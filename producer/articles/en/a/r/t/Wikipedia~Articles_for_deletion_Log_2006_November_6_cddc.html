<li><s><b>DELETE</b></s> <b>(see below... waaaaay below)</b> Yikes and goodness gracious!! My google search comes up with several sites identifying this man as being linked to terrorist groups and a "list of unindicted co-conspirators" of the 1993 WTC bombing. And here we have a Wikipedia article making him look so shiny and clean and →respectable?? Yikes! and again I strongly say... YIKES! There's no good faith effort to write a balanced, truthful article here. <b>Wikipedia is not a propagnada machine for terrorist organizations.</b> We must delete this until someone can verify all the hubub about his terrorist leanings or at least where all that talk is coming from. We cant ignore it. I won't buy an excuse that "it's just a smear campaign from prejudiced people who are his enemies." Where there's smoke... It would be good for people to see that these are where the man's sympathies and associations lie in a well researched article on Wikipedia, but this by no means is the beginnings of such an article. There is no excuse for this article. Wipe it completely clean until someone can write a responsible article. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 18:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Suspicions of accuracy problems <i>are</i> an appropriate thing to bring up in AfD. Some users seem to think that the only thing to discuss in AfD is "notability." Instead of just going along with what the nom and others concluded from the text of the article, I added information that I found. I think this man may well prove to have a degree of notability if indeed he is associated with the 1993 WTC bombing conspiracy in reliable news sources but there are other considerations. My objections fall under the catergory of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If these problems cannot be cleared up in a responsible way before the end of the discussion period for this AfD then the article is due to be deleted. But as to notability in the article as written there was not a sufficient assertion made. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 22:24, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>User:141.158.234.96 wrote the following in the articles talk page.: Dear Wikipedia: It would be ridiculous to delete this article. Bilal Philips is a major figure of English-language Salafi Islam, which has a worldwide reach. While his name may not be known outside of the Muslim community, he is quite well-known within that community. The existing article neither mentions his several influential publications, nor his political views and role in Salafi Islam. He is controversial especially among Salafis because he belongs to one of the splintered Salafi groupings so that others attack him as a "deviant." In fact, it appears that sometime between 1991 and 1994, he was either expelled from Saudi Arabia or had his visa not renewed, so that he had to migrate to the UAE. When I am able, I will try to fix his article here, but I want to write this right now so no one deletes him. I also want to add that in general Wikipedia is poor on Islamic topics and personages. Hardly any of the famous shaykhs of the past are noticed, and many modern personages are overlooked. This is quite apart from the poor quality of many articles that omit salient facts in the subjects lives or are too one sided. Thus, to go around looking for Muslim personages to delete is not the way to go if one wants to claim universal coverage for Wikipedia.</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> Being a good person is not a qualification for getting an article on Wikipedia; the fact that he is associated with the 1993 bombing so strongly seems to indicate notability. The article needs an NPOV rewrite, removal of all unsourced and POV statements. But the fact that he is a noted terrorist is NOT a reason for deletion. If he were a non-notable terrorist that would be one thing; to claim in the same breath that he is notable and then deletable is contradictory. This is a <i>content dispute</i> and should be carried on on the articles talk page. Be bold, fix the article to be NPOV. It doesn't need to be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:08, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Query</b><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a>, has anyone gotten hold of a single good reference source about this man? I am not sure we are in a position to say that its been established as a fact that he was connected with the 1993 WTC bombing. I absolutely agree with you that if we have that as a fact then notability has been established. But if all we get is some kind of fansite content then the article would be due to be deleted. I am very much in favor of expanding the information available on Wikipedia concerning Muslim personages and topics related to Islam, as long as the articles are done responsibly. Since there's a real possibility that Bilal Philips has been involved in such serious matters I think his topic should be handled with special care. I also don't want the article to say he is a terrorist without at least one reliable news source to back it up, since we are dealing with a very damning statement about a living person. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 18:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Independently of any judgement of a person's goodness or badness, there must be documented notability to have an article. No independent verifiable mainstream press coverage is presented in the article, and I could find no mention of "Bilal Philips"" in a 4000 publication database.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Is this a joke? Bilal Philips is a widely recognised and leading Islamic and comparative religion author in the English language and has appeared on regularly on at least one TV channel that I know of in the UK. He has fourteen books available on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/103-0436465-7102249?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank&amp;field-author-exact=Philips%2C%20Abu%20Ameenah%20Bilal" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/103-0436465-7102249?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank&amp;field-author-exact=Philips%2C%20Abu%20Ameenah%20Bilal" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and thirty-six overall according to one website <a href="http://abdurrahman.org/scholars/BilalPhilips.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://abdurrahman.org/scholars/BilalPhilips.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and not forgetting the multiple articles available on his website and others. His book <i>The Fundamentals of <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawheed.html" title="Tawheed">Tawheed</a></i> is one of the best on the subject and features in the University of South California Compendium of Muslim Texts <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/tawheed/abutaw/abutaw_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/tawheed/abutaw/abutaw_1.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipidian_2724.html" title="User:Wikipidian">Wikipidian</a>, maybe you can solve this whole discussion for us with your knowledge of sources and where to find them. Do you think that you could locate some articles about this man from good reliable sources? I am inclined to believe that they are out there, but I wouldn't know where to look. Surely he has been reported about in the news somewhere. Maybe there's something in an Arab newspaper from the time he was allegedly turned away from Saudi Arabia and emigrated to UAE in the early nineties, as was suggested on the article's talk page. Maybe there's an article about his alleged connection to the people who did the 1993 WTC attack. Maybe there's an article profiling his regular television appearances and public reaction to his statements in the BBC. If he's "widely recognised", then all we need is to present the evidence that he is indeed being recognised. I'll need to see something a bit stronger and more lasting than famousmuslims.com, but <i><b>truly, I can be persuaded</b></i>. I've changed my position on AfD's several times when an editor has come up with some good evidence. I'm open minded.

<li>Ok, I think you have set the bar a bit too high for notability - at least according to wiki guidelines (please refer here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). His 36-odd books (14 on amazon), multiple articles, website content and his notable book <b>The Fundamentals of Tawheed</b> in my opinion easily pass him on <i>"The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field"</i> criteria.

<dd>But in answer to your specific questions:</dd>
<dd>(1) I know of NO CONNECTION with Bilal Philips and terrorism and would be literally astonished of any proven link. The co-conspirators WTC thing, would be slander against a living person as more than likely the claim wouldn't be verfiable.</dd>
<dd>(2)He appears regularly on Peace TV (available in 125 countries) <a href="http://www.geocities.com/asimiqbal2nd/peace-tv.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/asimiqbal2nd/peace-tv.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, regularly on Itihad TV UK (no source but you gonna have to trust me that I've seen him on here) and only occasionally on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_channel.html" title="Islam channel">Islam channel</a> (which again has global availability) but is due to appear in the Global Peace and Unity Event organised by the channel and broadcast worldwide <a href="http://www.theglobalunity.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theglobalunity.com/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.clickwalla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=990&amp;Itemid=75" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clickwalla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=990&amp;Itemid=75" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Also apparently has been on Sharjah TV <a href="http://www.meganova.org/details/343756.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meganova.org/details/343756.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>
<dd>(3)I don't know if he's been seen on BBC/CNN etc but here's something from a Qatar-based paper <a href="http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=Local_News&amp;subsection=Qatar+News&amp;month=October2006&amp;file=Local_News2006100934111.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=Local_News&amp;subsection=Qatar+News&amp;month=October2006&amp;file=Local_News2006100934111.xml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and interview with IslamOnline (the web's most popular Islamic website) <a href="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=782" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=782" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> in addition to the Saudi Gazette interview from famousmuslims.</dd>
<dd>Basically, he's widely known for his contribution to english language Islamic literature and his television appearances and the most likely reason why he hasn't appeared in the secular media so often is because <b>he's not the hook-for-a-hand controversial imam the media like to splash on our screens.</b> <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipidian_2724.html" title="User:Wikipidian">Wikipidian</a> 00:47, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Okay, you got my vote with the Qatar paper and the IslamOnline profile. He's definitely a scholar, and he's notable enough with good evidence. I'm terribly curious where the other talk (WTC conspiracy) is coming from, and if can be tracked down, hoax or no, it would be a good thing to explain in the article what that's all about. After all, Cat Stevens has trouble getting into some countries for running his mouth and not controlling his anger, but he's not likely to bomb anything (is he?).

<li><b>Comment:</b> Conspiracy people claiming "certificates" from a PO Box is not a criteria for inclusion. There is not enough independent, RS sources for an article on this unaccredited school. WP:CORP is the criteria, and you have included trival sources that mention this in passing (read WP:CORP #1 to see why this fails). You have trivial mentions and no article that actually discusses this school. The NY Times (I linked above, but you omitted in your reference) says in one sentence its a PO Box and that's it. Also as you have been told before, just because I added it to a list does not mean wikipedia must keep it. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 03:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wp:Corp is a guideline. I consider it a stretch when applied to a school. For example, few schools are "<i>listed on ranking indices</i>" or have share prices "<i>used to calculate stock market indices</i>". Few schools have share prices full stop. However, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> guideline does state that: <i>Ideally each entry on the list should have a Wikipedia article but this is not required if it is reasonable to expect an article could be forthcoming in the future</i>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_(stand-alone_lists)#Selection_criteria" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_(stand-alone_lists)#Selection_criteria" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. I find it rather disturbing that so many established editors think the number of google hits should be the primary reason we include an article, but whatever. Based on the numbers there is no consensus to delete, thankfully arguments other than the google hits were presented, and per JJay's argument and evidence there does seem to be reliable information written about this topic. I suggest actually citing it in the article, which is about 0.02% as long as this AfD. <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:49, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An article does not need to meet every notability requirement it may fall under, only one(unless I am wrong). My stance is that while it may be a CORP, it is still a SCHOOL, and if it meets one of them, as opposed to all of them, it is fine. Yes, it is a CORP, but it is still a SCHOOL. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 03:51, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I don't think so, because that consensus was not neccesarily made with schools in mind. To be frank, it seems like a bit of a stretch to apply CORP to a school simply because it is not accredited. After all, acredited schools can be private corperations aswell, I don't see the connection. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 03:55, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> for all those "per Silensor" keeps: most of the Google hits returned are <i>not</i> about the Newport University on Newport Beach at all, but about the Cristopher Newport University. When you search for "NEwport University" California -"Christopher Newport", you already drop to 13,500 Ghits<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22newport+university%22+california+-%22christopher+newport%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22newport+university%22+california+-%22christopher+newport%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. Many of those are still false positives, but you get the idea. As for the number of students: they seem to have had a grand total of 8 graduates in 1993<a href="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/collegeguide/InstitutionProfile.asp?Inst=E0039A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/collegeguide/InstitutionProfile.asp?Inst=E0039A" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, and are not listed in the COOL database<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool/SearchResults.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool/SearchResults.aspx" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First, the school is registered with California for the bar exam <a href="http://calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=10184&amp;id=5128" class="external autonumber" title="http://calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=10184&amp;id=5128" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. It is also my understanding that Newport students can take the California licensing exam in clinical psychology and family counseling. Second, there are reliable sources available for the school, for example the Salt Lake Tribune did an extremely long expose in 1996 when it registered in Utah (pay site) <a href="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?q=%22newport+university%22+%22newport+beach%22&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?q=%22newport+university%22+%22newport+beach%22&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Third, whatever you may think of these types of schools, people are getting degrees from Newport and sometimes working in positions of authority. That can cause controversy. Stanley Blondek, an expert witness and California prison youth counselor who claimed a masters and PhD from Newport (but repeatedly failed the California licensing exam) is an example (pay site) <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&amp;p_theme=sb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0476D3400CDA9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" class="external autonumber" title="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&amp;p_theme=sb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0476D3400CDA9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.

Our <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning">List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning</a> is a very limited start but provides no real information and is unsourced (but does include Newport).

<dd>What??? California sets standards for allowing students from various institutions to sit for the bar exam and in the case of unaccredited schools, bar exam rule XIX is applicable (as indicated in my previous post). It is not up to me to "provide WP:RS for each criteria". The school is listed on the California bar exam website, meaning they have passed inspection and adhere to the clauses of rule XIX. Pretty simple really. If you believe that is not the case please enlighten us. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:53, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one claimed the school is accredited. That is not at issue. Your statement that "people can walk in and take the test" is false. The school has to be inspected and must adhere to a series of requirements. That is why few schools are on the list. Your comment that the school has been called a "diploma mill" is completely unproven. Provide proof of that statement. The California Bar's non-opinion of unaccredited schools is not the issue here either. Finally, WP/Corp is a guideline that should not apply to schools for obvious reasons. The interest of these types of articles is to have background information on institutions of higher learning that are awarding degrees to people that sometimes achieve positions of authority (in this case potential lawyers, social workers, psychologists). That is inherently notable and supercedes WP/Corp and its fixation on stock prices. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:51, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

This was in relation to Newport's "classes" which "are not in the form of instruction, we just ask the students to raise their questions and discuss them with experts." This again is a trival mention in the paper, but leads use to question Newport's seriousness as a "school"</dd>

<dd>You cearly haven't read the first source, which never calls the school a diploma mill. Nor does the second source, apparently. The only person making that claim is you, but without proof.

<dd>2) Your insisting we keep an article for a ten year old Salt Lake newspaper that calls this place a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a> is more of a reason to delete. That is, no one has provided any criticism in the article about its ppor quality of instruction. Thus, your link makes us more skeptical about the article meeting WP:V. The article says nothing about criticism, which is very misleading per your one article. Readers, right now, get the false impression that is place's academics aren't questionable per the one source you mentioned.</dd>

<dd>1) While the school is not accredited, the fact that several state bodies do provide some level of recognition to the school is not only evidence of verifiability, it also goes a long way to establishing notability in the context of a university. 2) The source is independent, reliable and verifiable. There is simply no criteria that the source must be recent OR that it must be positive. "Non-trivial coverage" is timeless. As the source is provided, readers can make their own impression of the article's characterization. 3) A reminder that a school's presence on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning">List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning</a> doesn't mean it should be deleted. 4) The time has come to address the evidence of notability and get past the fact that it is unaccredited. There is simply no standard whatsoever that makes an accredited school notable OR makes an unaccredited school a non-notable target for deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 04:37, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry but that is false. There is <i>no</i> information regarding student numbers on the school's website. The link provided by User:Fram shows eight law school graduates in 1993 and is from a California education site. The school also has numerous other programs. Finally, WP:Corp is a guideline. It is entirely debateable whether it should apply to a school. And numerous valid reasons have been given for keeping the article. Regarding WP:V, as indicated above, sources exist that confirm the school, its programs and that students are eligible to sit for the bar.

The only sources sited are either Web sites belonging to the subject or his critics. What we need is a few neutral, unbiased sources to establish notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> How does the ministry meet WP:Web? What are all the non-trivial sources? How is it an independent web site? If someone can improve the article, and make it obvious why this is notable, I have no problem with it staying. If not, delete it and the ministry entry.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm deeply uneasy about this one. There seem to be a lot of these obscure institutions claiming large numbers of Nobel laureates as members, and all claiming to be terribly important and prestigious, but curiously they run out of PO boxes in places like Eichstaett or Huddersfield.

<p>Yes thats true but they do boast a membership of over 300,000 registered members in just about 2 years. I believe that is a large enough pool of people to permit us to make a wiki about it.

<p>Secondary sources to back up the content? Warez boards are usually not officially listed as warez but i can prove that it is one of the 20 largest phpbb boards.</p>
<p>omg! all this discussion... ok, but to come to the point.. can we have the article or not?</p>
<p>here is a source, on of the 20 largest warez board, in fact projectw would be number 9 <a href="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?filter=phpBB,all&amp;sort=members" class="external free" title="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?filter=phpBB,all&amp;sort=members" rel="nofollow">http://rankings.big-boards.com/?filter=phpBB,all&amp;sort=members</a> they refuse to lost Warez boards and other adult content but in fact if you sort by members ou will find projectw fits into 9th place</p>

<li>Is projectw notable for that reason alone? 9th isn't all that impressive.</li>

<p>i still do not understand what you mean by secondary sources. IS big-baords not a secondary source?</p>
<p>And no projectw is also notable for the fact that It is the largest warez forum on the internet. When people download warez they have two choices, a bittorrent client or a forum and the number one forum is Us.</p>
<p>Also ProjectW beats the other warez competition in the fact that we have almost double the members of our two competitors and we are affiliated wiht other large warez sites such as katz.ws</p>
<ul>
<li>Now wait. Are you the largest warez site, or 9th largest? You've claimed both. Also, Bigboard's rankings are based on self-reporting by the sites, which is unreliable at best. Has the site been mentioned in the media at all? Size *alone* isn't a reason to have a Wikipedia article. --<b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">®</a> 04:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - This is one of those cases where lots of g-hits does not imply notability. Any site devoted to the Warez scene has the potential to be drastically over rated by the google test as a result of top100 lists, leech sites, mirrors, and content hosting sites. In very rare cases (such as the Pirate Bay) outside media attention makes a pirating site notable. In this case, the article reads like a teaser for the forum, and I honestly don't see how a well formatted NPOV article could say anything beyond "ProjectW is a warez community with a good number of members". <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:gold;font-variant:small-caps">-bobby</em></a> 14:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is not the obligation of those in an AfD debate to prove something is not notable. It is the obligation of those seeking to keep an article to show multiple independent mainstream coverage of it. Claims of how many members there are from the website itself are not verifiable or independent. I found no mention of "Projectw" in a database of 4,000 publications, but I did find numerous articles about the persons operating such sites getting convictions for software privacy.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a member of the band, and this article has only just come to my attention (it has not been written by us). It is largely incorrect and I will fix it ASAP. First, a few of the comments below need correction. The news article about Alex Milner-Smith's survival of a plane crash DOES mention the band, please read it properly. The main results from Google are not Wikipedia and MySpace, but the band's official page, <a href="http://www.fivemilesfromwoodstock.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fivemilesfromwoodstock.com" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. We are also featured on current West End Les Mis actor Gina Beck's website: <a href="http://www.ginabeck.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ginabeck.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. The sales figures are made up, I will edit them. We currently are under contract with EggNog Records and TuneCore Distributors: our album "Trash Talk" will be on sale from all digital music stores (including iTunes) from December 2006. We have toured France and Italy, I will post up articles ASAP. Thankyou for the comments.--ED</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I did read the plane crash article, and I stand by my original statement in the nomination. What the article states, is a quote from Alex Milner-Smith</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>He would also like to return to playing in his rock band: "I'm a guitar player but luckily I play the drums as well. I might have to play those for a while until my fingers heal."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This provides nothing in the way of verifiability. In any case, the article is a poor choice for reference as the article is not about the band, but about the victim of a plane crash. For the refernces that you are adding, please review <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as there are the criteria being applied. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 17:25, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

If you have recieved reviews by music critics in newspapers, trade journals, magazines, etc., PLEASE PROVIDE THEM. Make sure the reviews are a) extensive and b) from reliable sources (click the link above for reliable sources) and the article becomes inherently keepable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though reading like an advert currently, an article on this band should be on wikipedia. One band member is famous in New Zealand after their plane crash, and many articles can be found on himin the NZ press. Also the motion from the JCR of Brasenose College, Oxford to make them the college's official band makes them a legitimate article. (Though should be made to read objectively). TGHB</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Your comment has merit, but the notibility of this particular browser game is not contained simply in its Alexa rank. The tens of thousands of games you mention are largely uninspried clones of Gangwars. What caught my eye about Vox is its graphics -- it is one of the few games that is attempting to do something other than text. Look at the screenshot attached to the article. Much of Vox's notibility comes from its use of new web technologies. If this was just a Kings of Chaos script, I never would have made the page. Isotoad 07:16, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>According to PR Newswire's own site, "PR Newswire is the world's leading corporate news distribution, targeting and monitoring / measurement measurement service." The article in question was written independently of GamerNode's influence in an earnest attempt to raise the profile of the website. The fact that it was written and circulated by a PR <i>distribution</i> service does not dilute its independence.

The only participation GamerNode had in the creation or dissemination of the profile story by Brian Anderson was accepting the interview request from PR Newswire. PR Newswire simply does not write press releases on the behalf of its clients (which, according to the company directory accessed on 6 November at 11:30 PST, does not include GamerNode.com, GamerNode, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actuary.html" title="Actuary">actuarial</a> community as a whole is not well-known. Most actuaries, students, underwriters, and other insurance personnel will not have Alexa installed on their computers, due to corporate security measures, and violating them is grounds for termination of employment. As such, per <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html#Bias_in_the_Alexa_test" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Wikipedia:Search engine test#Bias in the Alexa test</a>, the Alexa ranking is not really applicable here, because the vast majority of users are not Alexa users. Secondly, per <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html#Google_bias" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Wikipedia:Search engine test#Google bias</a>, articles that have near nothing to do with pop culture are at a distinct diasadvantage when it comes to the google test. Outside of the small actuarial/insurance community, I am sure most people have not heard of this site. However, in its field, it is eminently notable. Almost every college or university with an actuarial program (at least in the US and Canada) links to this site. The major actuarial societies in the US and Canada link to this site. When exams are released, many more students flock to this site over the <a href="../../../c/a/s/CAS_9017.html" title="CAS">CAS</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOA_be5a.html" title="SOA">SOA</a> homepages because of the greater robustness of the servers. There are special forums for actuaries and students from all over the world. The authors of the most widely used actuarial study manuals frequent the exam sections of the site, answer student questions, and often base their new errata on comments from students at the site. It has one of the largest listings of actuarial jobs, and job searching advice. Even candidates for office of the <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOA_be5a.html" title="SOA">SOA</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/CAS_9017.html" title="CAS">CAS</a> will make statements, engage in debate and dialogue, and campaign on this board, sometimes more than they do on the societies own home pages. It has been discussed in the publications of the societies, such as <a href="http://futureactuary.soa.org/soaf/issues/2006-06-05/index.html" class="external text" title="http://futureactuary.soa.org/soaf/issues/2006-06-05/index.html" rel="nofollow">The Future Actuary</a> -- the publication of the <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOA_be5a.html" title="SOA">SOA</a> geared to actuarial students and <a href="http://casact.org/admissions/futfell/mar06/profile.htm" class="external text" title="http://casact.org/admissions/futfell/mar06/profile.htm" rel="nofollow">Future Fellows</a> -- the publication of the <a href="../../../c/a/s/CAS_9017.html" title="CAS">CAS</a> geared to students.

<li>But are there any reliable sources than <i>focus</i> on the website instead of briefly mentioning it?

<li>This is exactly what people find so chilling and laugable about Wikipedia and why I avoid participating more than a few minutes here and there. Some dude whose contributions include write-ups about every video game imaginable, which I personally don't find notable or contribute to society at all (so let's remove those!), and who has no knowledge of actuarial science, comes along and says "delete". And those are the kinds of people in charge. Hmmm, so actuaries and other interested people have to constantly defend this article against attack from people outside the profession. That's just odd. They don't have time for that foolishness. This'd be like if I went over to some random engineering field and started nominating stuff for deletion. I wouldn't know what I was talking about so I'd stay out of it completely. Sources have already been quoted from two of the main actuarial societies in the world. The UK's society discussed the Outpost in an article as well and it's somewhere on their the-actuary.org.uk website. And assuming that Google is the be-all end-all source of discussions and articles about the Outpost is silly. There have been print publications mentions of the Outpost that never made it to the web, too. Surely this is at least as notable as "Super Play Action Football". How many third-party mentions is notable enough? Also, one would think that such forward-minded people such as those editing Wikipedia entries would accept that bloggers discussing the Outpost *is* notable. This is a tiny profession.

I believe there are archived discussions on Avi's page that document prior dubious arguments for deletion. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheActuary_5432.html" title="User:TheActuary">TheActuary</a> 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>TA, TBC is correct, it was not a straight keep. As for me personally, I believe that <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> was acting in good faith when this was nominated, I just think that this is an example of a pivotal, if not seminal, forum in a small field that is notable enough for wikipedia. For example, it was formed to be an anonymous registry forum in backlash to the <a href="../../../c/a/s/CAS_9017.html" title="CAS">CAS</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOA_be5a.html" title="SOA">SOA</a> crack-downs (see the article). In a field where there may be a few thousand people worldwide at the time (casualty actuaries of the <a href="../../../c/a/s/CAS_9017.html" title="CAS">CAS</a>/<a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>), almost everybody knew each other, and people were afraid to speak about what they really felt about certain political issues fr fear of reprisal on the job. This forum almost single-handedly combatted that, from what I understand.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Hi! Tom here, the webmaster / moderator of the Actuarial Outpost. I've noticed several votes for deletion and I've managed to find a common similarity. They are all more than likely, not members of the outpost, not actuaries, and have never taken an actuarial exam.
<ul>
<li>Since the transfer of the administration, the site has grown to over 10,000 member and 1.8 million posts. Those numbers represent a large actuarial community that has been helping students pass exams for over 7 years now. The Outpost may seem insignificant compared to Wikipedia, but they share a common goal; spreading knowledge and helping students succeed.</li>
<li>Since the creation of the Actuarial Outpost, we have helped numerous students pass exams. I saw the mention of "Only 14 unique Google hits" as some sort of criteria for recognition on wikipedia, but if you do a search on our site for "I passed" or "woo hoo, I finally passed" or perhaps "I passed! Thanks everybody for the big help. I couldn’t have done it with out you guys!" you might notice that you get a few more than just 14 hits.</li>
<li>So what. . .Why should it be on Wikipedia, you ask? I travel to all of the SOA and CAS meetings and even go to the smaller club meetings around the US such as the IABA and just last week I went to the Chinese Actuarial Clubs annual Karaoke Party (I sang some Tony Bennett). There are two thing that I notice at all of these meetings: 1) People who come up to me and thank me for all of the hard work we do to help actuaries pass exams and keep them informed on the latest current events and 2) people that say "Actuarial Outpost . . . what's that?"</li>
<li>What I'm getting at here is even though we have a large group of actuaries that use the Actuarial Outpost, there is an even larger number that have never even heard of it. Wikipedia is well known amongst students for finding information and wikipedia has the opportunity to give them the inside scoop on a tool for learning, that's made just for actuaries. If wikipedia is not in the business of spreading information and helping people learn, then by all means, push the big red button, but as far as I can see, this article should stay, according to the philosophy that I have perceived Wikipedia is run by.</li>
<li>P.S. As a moderator, I realize how time consuming it is dealing with all of these little issues on a daily basis, but I assure you that this issue I take dear to heart. My main goal when I took over responsibility of the Outpost was to help students continue to learn and pass exams, and that is the only reason Glenn &amp; Traci were willing to give me control of the site. I like to think they have been happy with what I have done.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Outpost Tom (<a href="../../../o/u/t/User_talk%7EOutpost_Tom_81da.html" title="User talk:Outpost Tom">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Outpost_Tom_fa8f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Outpost Tom">contribs</a>) 00:11, November 7, 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> I understand that this may come across as an advertisement to some, but I think that may too broad of an accusation, since it's not like we're selling tee-shirts or something to that effect. To the contrary, we spend a lot of time and money making sure this resource is available to the actuarial community as a service. This is a non-profit venture to facilitate learning, just like Wikipedia. The wikipedia page was not created by me, nor ever edited by me, but rather by a member who felt that it was information worth sharing. As for my assumption of the <i>common similarity</i>, my assumptions only tend to be 97.5% correct with an error of +/- 2.5%, which I feel is actuarially sound <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" class="image" title="image:smile.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/2/26/Smile.png" alt="image:smile.png" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" /></a>.</li>
<li>The Actuarial Outpost Foundation is a non-profit organization with the goal of providing free knowledge to every person in the world.

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> It is a core policy of Wikipedia that you do not delete things for simply not being notable. Wikipedia has pages for individual Star Trek episodes.

This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page." This is official policy, as opposed to simply a guideline. If you are going to start enforce notability, then you should begin by proposing the deletion of all pages for Star Trek episodes that are not individually notable (which would be all, except for maybe the one with the first interracial kiss, but even then that would be better in the main Star Trek article). <a href="../../../2A/j/b/User%7E_jb_3e3c.html" title="User:*jb">*jb</a> 01:22, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, the existence of the subject of the article is eminently verifiable per WP:V; the only worthwhile deletion criterion in the nomination is that it fails WP:WEB. I argue that WP:WEB is the wrong guideline to decide the notability of this community. Yes, it is a community with a strong web presence, but as the website itself is not innovative <i>as a website</i> (it appears to be just a community blog and a vBulletin), the governing guideline should be <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> (or <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMPANY_21af.html" title="WP:COMPANY">WP:COMPANY</a>, if you prefer). Now WP:ORG is not ratified, but I think the text of the proposed guideline has reasonably wide support. It is clear that the Actuary Outpost is "national or international in scope". The next clause, "information can be verified by a third party source" is more problematic, as most of the article text is from primary sources. Per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, a subject can be used as a primary source of information about itself, but such information should ideally be supplemented by secondary and tertiary sources. In my opinion, the text of the Actuary Outpost article should be better sourced and details that are not verifiable from third parties even in principle should be removed, but this criticism is better suited for a <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">peer review</a> than AfD. (And I heavily encourage the principal authors of this article to put it through a peer review, where I might provide a more thorough criticism.) <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 01:54, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> (also for now). The article is not to explain the term "science" and the term "technology." It is for the term "science and technology" which takes on a meaning other than the sum of its two parts. I am the first to admit that the article in its current state is weak. However, I am not the right person to write the final article and it was my intent to put a clean-up tag on the article but I did not move fast enough and the speedy delete tag was up before I found my tag. It may turn out that nobody is able to bring this up to the desired standard, but at least give the article a couple of months to show where it can go. Cheers -- MCG 14:11, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> the article does not establish any insight of merit that is not found in the primary and secondary articles on science and technology already. This is not to say that it couldn't do that, but that it does not right now. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 14:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If there is merit, why delete it as opposed to fix it? It has been pointed out that there are several articles incorporating this term (which is more than its two parts). Additionally there are categories that do this as well; in a quick search I can find <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_and_technology_by_country_7707.html" title="Category:Science and technology by country">Category:Science and technology by country</a> (and this is full of many other sub categories of science and technology) and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_and_technology_studies_d874.html" title="Category:Science and technology studies">Category:Science and technology studies</a>. If you delete the article Science and technology, it will eventually be re-created. Why not deal with the content of the article now instead of later? -- MCG 14:32, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The question of alternative approaches and the benefit of <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incrementalism.html" title="Incrementalism">incrementalism</a> and "breakthrough" aka "spontaneous innovation", is quite an important subject in engineering and science. It is a bit like having an article on the trinity for religion in some ways they are considered the same thing, but in other ways they are very different.

<li><b>Keep</b> But please add a scholarly source for the claim that there is more to the Gestalt "Science and Technology" than to the conjunction of "Science" and "Technology."

<p>Group of hackers or something that doesn't seem to meet WP:BIO or WP:V. Looks like mostly vanity and original research. Pretty much all of the "references" make no reference to the subject of the article. Only the ABCnews article even mentions the subject, and even then, only a couple times in some passing sentences. <b>Delete</b> as failing any reliable independent coverage. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:22, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Independent Sources</b></p>
<p>The definition of reference:</p>
<p>(ref er ence –noun ) 1. an act or instance of referring.; 2. a mention; allusion.; 3. something for which a name or designation stands; denotation.; 4. a direction in a book or writing to some other book, passage, etc.; 5. a book, passage, etc., to which one is directed.; 6. reference mark (def. 2).; 7. material contained in a footnote or bibliography, or referred to by a reference mark.; 8. use or recourse for purposes of information: a library for public reference.; 9. a person to whom one refers for testimony as to one's character, abilities, etc.; 10. a statement, usually written, as to a person's character, abilities, etc.; 11. relation, regard, or respect: all persons, without reference to age. –verb (used with object); 12. to furnish (a book, dissertation, etc.) with references: Each new volume is thoroughly referenced.; 13. to arrange (notes, data, etc.) for easy reference: Statistical data is referenced in the glossary.; 14. to refer to: to reference a file.</p>
<p>Being that EACH article in the references, specifically references the moniker(s) of the HNC Network and also some of those formerly involved with it, said reference is therefore verifiable and legitimate as it is relevant to the entity in which it refers, no matter how major or minor said reference is.</p>
<p>Now, not withstanding this article has a ways to come, but even a quick search across any major search engine offers several substantial clues to why, where and when this group existed. Let alone the group seemingly has a current effort underway at www.thereformed.org, of which the group could obviously be contacted for a first-hand account or pointers towards other verifiable content. Perhaps this is a case of someone not wishing to help in finishing the homework?</p>
<p>The disturbing thing is this, your lack of willingness to assist in clearing up this article's potential misgivings and your history of requests in attempting to axe many well-laid articles simply due to your impatience with those lacking MASS quantities of referencial materials. Your contribs speak for themselves, play God on another Wiki, leave this one to those that can be objective and helpful in creating a incredible Internet resource of new content while paying tribute to the heritage and of those that walked before it, such as this group. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.203.174.248 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.203.174.248.html" title="User talk:72.203.174.248">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.203.174.248_eced.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.203.174.248">contribs</a>).</small>04:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia is not a moot court, and although rules can make things easier, they are not the purpose of the community and instruction creep should generally be avoided. A perceived procedural error made in posting anything, such as an idea or nomination, is not grounds for invalidating that post. Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines. Disagreements should be resolved through consensual discussion, rather than through tightly sticking to rules and procedures.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The anon editor's horibly illogical, and unsatisfactory arguements notwithstanding, the subject does not seem to merit ANY mention in Third Party references. If specific citations can be found in several third-party references, I will change my vote. The ONLY third party citations are reprints of the SAME article from CNN and Computer World that mention a different group of white-hat hackers. The litmus test for worthiness on wikipedia is references in THIRD PARTY sources. We have none yet. Thus, I vote delete until this situation changes. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This article should not be deleted. I'm a former member of HNC and this is actually the only source of information about HNC we have now. Sure, some references are questionable, but instead if deleting this article we should rather edit it. People are references too.

<dd>I'll bypass the blatant ignorance by my counterpart of above and move along to the bits. Taking it upon myself to contact one of the former members, since it seems noone else did, there apparently is historical, third-party articles that were indeed written(including a published book mention of the group, several interviews with NOW media, an interview with ZDNet UK, an interview with ABCNews apart from ViXeN900 and some other odd and ends), but unfortunately the archived links that were relayed via correspondence no longer hold data although their architecture is within scope of others in the same independent sites (apparently sometime between 2000-2002 many online new agencies expunged these records?). Secondly, it appears that this member had no knowledge there was an article posted on Wikipedia about the group, but upon reading it, had suggested to posssibly remove for edit and then resubmit at a later date for an article tailored to their history - he did however confirm that the timeline was incredibly accurate. He also questioned whether a full upload of all the tools to an independent external source and of course the HNC Video made in Las Vegas would help in validating any future entry? I was unsure of what to say, but I didn't think it would hurt since it was a published, commercial product produced in partnership with an independent post-production house.

<p>Article is about a neologism, "teddy tired", which has not gained common currency. A google search for "teddy tired" came up with very few relevant hits, all of which seemed to be from blogs. No reliable secondary sources were cited in the article. I could not verify that the Hoodoo Gurus wrote a song lyric about "teddy tired" with a variety of google searches. The article itself says this neologism is specific to a particular industry and goes on to point out that it is more of a one-man campaign than a common expression in Australia or elsewhere.

<p>150.135.180.195 added this info into the main <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_Airlines_fa44.html" title="Hawaiian Airlines">Hawaiian Airlines</a> article today. Honestly, I think Hawaiian is small enough that it's not a big hindrance to have this list maintained in the main Hawaiian article as opposed to having a separate article to list their destinations. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawaiian717_5c0b.html" title="User:Hawaiian717">Hawaiian717</a> 03:41, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

American and United serve many destinations worldwide and having the list on the main article page could easily overwhelm the article.

<li>I feel that articles should follow a standard format; the "...destinations" seems to be the standard, and should be kept throughout all airlines articles.

When this was created I looked into this and found only one article from a magazine (its the one source cited).

I see no evidence of that. What city is it in? What country is it in? There is not enough material for an article, and as it stands it is an article about what it isn't.

But there was a genuine, semi-serious effort a few decades ago to form a state of Superior led by the prominent local politician <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Jacobetti_c781.html" title="Dominic Jacobetti">Dominic Jacobetti</a>. Better references are certainly needed. The effort is briefly mentioned <a href="http://www.nmu.edu/archives/collections/political/jacobetti.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nmu.edu/archives/collections/political/jacobetti.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> in the biographical notes for the collection of his papers at NMU. AFAICT, most present-day calls for secession are intended as either humor or an expression of dissatisfaction with downstate government. I don't think anyone takes it seriously anymore, but there does seem to be some kernel of truth to the secession proposal. In 1978, Jacobetti introduced a bill in the state legislature for separation, but it never came to a vote. <a href="http://www.marquettefiction.com/page9.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.marquettefiction.com/page9.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> And <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mi/singit13/upind.html" class="external text" title="http://www.angelfire.com/mi/singit13/upind.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a pretty good account of the proposal to separate, although perhaps too much of a personal essay to be a reliable source -- though it does provide a general outline of events that could probably be verified from other sources. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 15:02, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Ultra Strong Keep</b> Living in Northern Michigan, I heard this idea widely and can attest to it not being complete BJAODN.

<dd>Yes, but one 31 year old newscast transcription is not sufficient evidence to prove this a serious movement. If there were truly active plans in Congress and the Michigan legislature to slpit the state of Michigan then an article will be justified.

<dd>The original AFD was started by somone's thought that this was BJAODN. It's clearly not a hoax. The numerous sources that have been since unearthed show that this was significant if futile movement in the 1970s and earlier. IMNSHO, Wikipedia ought to document the extent to which there is or isn't (was or wasn't) a movement to form the State of Superior. I still think it can and should stand alone given the level of documentation that we have unearthed.

<dd><b>I don't think I have ever lived in a part of the United States where secession and autonomy were not major issues in local politics. In northern Wisconsin, where I spent my childhood, there has been agitation for the creation of a separate state of Superior, encompassing the northern parts of Michigan and Wisconsin. The justification was both cultural and economic: "Yoopers" have more in common with people on the Wisconsin shore of Lake Superior than either group has with the rest of its state, both regions suffer from unemployment and underdevelopment, and both speak a dialect unintelligible to outsiders. .</b></dd>

<dd>The question BrendelSignature seems to be taking to heart is whether this is a "real" (moving) movement or is a "fake" one. My answer is that it is neither. It is a real cultural meme/rumor/phenomenon that has been floating around Northern Michigan and the UP for years. This is kinda like Christopher Walken for President... but it really happened. We shouldn't argue that just because it happened 20 years ago it is not relevant. It is relevant and notable... and now it is documented. IMHO we could change the name of it so people know that it is not a really active movement. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 22:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From a review of the timeline of the books and newspaper articles published on the subject, this seems to be a meme that's floating out there, popping up with some seriousness every twenty years or so, generating interest in the U.P., treated as quaint but undoable pie-in-the-sky by downstaters, and has never generated enough steam to be considered for real. When it is back in the public's conscience it does get play in the media, as exhibited by the Google News sources, and then it fades away in a state of dormancy, only top up two or three decades later. I think its status as an almost viable movement for periods of time over more than a century demonstrates that it should be a standalone article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From a 1900 Book: STORIES OF THE BADGER STATE by Reuben Gold Thwaites Copyright, 1900</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>The people of the northwest wished to be released from Wisconsin, in order that they might either cast their fortunes with their near neighbors in the new Territory of Minnesota, or join a movement just then projected for the creation of an entirely new State, to be called "Superior." This .proposed state was to embrace all the country north of Mont Trempealeau and east of the Mississippi, including the entire northern peninsula, if the latter could be obtained; thus commanding the southern land western shores of Lake Superior, with the mouth of Green Bay and the foot of Lake Michigan to the southeast.</dd>
<dd>.</dd>
<dd>The St. Croix representative in the legislature was especially wedded to the Superior project. He pleaded earnestly and eloquently for his people, whose progress, he said, would be "greatly hampered by being connected politically with a country from which they are separated by nature, cut off from communication by immense spaces of wilderness between." A memorial from the settlers themselves stated the case with even more vigor, asserting that they were "widely separated from the settled parts of Wisconsin, not only by hundreds of miles of mostly waste and barren lands, which must remain uncultivated for ages, but equally so by a diversity of interests and character in the population." All of this reads curiously enough in these days, when the intervening wilderness resounds with the hum of industry and " blossoms as the rose." But that was long before the days of railroads; the dense forests of central and western Wisconsin then constituted a formidable wilderness, peopled only by savages and wild beasts.</dd>
<dd>.</dd>
<dd>Unable to influence the Wisconsin legislature, which stubbornly contended for the possession of the original tact, the St. Croix people next urged their claims upon Congress. The proposed State of Superior found little favor at Washington, but there was a general feeling that Wisconsin would be much too large unless trimmed. The result was that when she was finally admitted as a State, the St. Croix River was, in large part, made her northwest boundary; Minnesota in this Manner acquired a vast stretch of country, including the thriving city of St. Paul.</dd>
<dd>.</dd>
<dd>Wisconsin was thus shorn of valuable territory on the south, to please Illinois; on the northeast, to favor Michigan; and on the northwest, that some of her settlers might join their fortunes with Minnesota. The State, however, is still quite as large as most of her sisters in the Old Northwest, and possesses an unusual variety of soils, and a great wealth of forests, mines, and fisheries. There is a strong probability that, bad Congress, in 1848, given to Wisconsin her "ancient limits," as defined by the Ordinance of 1787, the movement to create the proposed state of "Superior" would have gathered strength in the passing years, and possibly would have achieved success, thus depriving us of our great northern forests and mines, and our outlet upon the northern lake.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel the "contains at least one member" clause is a somewhat unfortunate one. If <a href="../../../j/u/k/Jukka_Jylli_84f0.html" title="Jukka Jylli">Jukka Jylli</a> one day plays his guitar to his cat a few minutes and calls it <i>The Feline Experience</i> it immediately passes the notability guidelines. And the cat can then transmit the notability to others. I don't think there is a "fame is virally transmitted to anything that a barely notable person touches" clause anywhere else on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 16:01, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Your cat case would of course require extra attention (although, I find the idea of a cat musician notable in its own right). In the more general case (such as for Zook) we are talking about a widely recognized band (ie. not a few guys sitting by themselves messing around with a guitar) composed of three individuals who used to play in notable bands. Thus, I feel the criterion I cite is well applied in this instance. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:gold;font-variant:small-caps">-bobby</em></a> 16:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Meow!</i> You are now notable&#160;:-) Re "not a few guys messing with a guitar": if the new band itself is notable due to what it does then it should be notable. Not by association with someone who was once in a band that had a member whose earlier band made two records on a "major" (heh) record label (the way "infectious notability" now works) (and I don't mean Zook/Kingston Wall is like that; I mean in general). If Zook itself makes records, makes headlines, tours widely, then it would be notable. But if it plays a few gigs in a pub and then disbands, I don't think it would be notable regardless of who is in it. But "infectious notability" <i>does</i> make such a band notable, as well as any of its otherwise non-notable members. There are bands and musicians like that in Wikipedia. Which I think is not good for quality. &lt;/rambling_in_the_wrong_place&gt;. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 18:05, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There are 2 articles dealing with the actual setting off of bombs by four men. A list of rumors with no citations to show they exist beyond the mind of the editor who inserted them in the article, is not encyclopedic. If there were a specific rumor which was reported, say, in the New York Times and the Times of London and covered on the BBC that provided a coherent alternative explanation for the bombs going off, that rumor, even if not proven true, might be worthy of an article.

<li>You are presenting a choice of trusting either the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>, with a known reputation and authorship, which could have dropped this entry for several reasons, or trusting the personal opinion, that this name is suspect, of a pseudonymous Wikipedia editor, based upon xyr own analysis and unsupported by any sources at all. And even the logic of that personal opinion is shaky. There's no requirement that a name that someone contrives in order to achieve a world record make grammatical sense in German, or that German people have solely German given names. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> says that we should side with the <i>GBWR</i> until other sources are written, fact checked, and published. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:12, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The guiness book of records drops records and introduces new ones each year (or else why would people have an incentive to buy new copies?). With a few exceptions, records such as this will repeat for a few years and then leave for a new one. Given that they've never retracted the statement, I don't see why that shouldn't be considered a reliable source.</li>
<li>Only if the Guinness Book removed Mr. Wolfe+585 for someone with a <i>shorter or equal-length</i> name would that removal concern me as to his verifiability. If they dropped him in favor of someone with a longer name, that would just mean his record was broken. And if they dropped the category entirely, that could just mean that they thought the category was no longer useful because someone could adopt a contrived name merely for the purpose of trying to get listed in the book, as opposed for wanting to use the name in his actual life -- which may, in fact, have been the case for Mr. Wolfe+585. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 22:16, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Ok, it’s the user’s first edit to wikipedia and most first users don’t read the guidelines and policies, I know I didn’t at first. He’s assumed that wikipedia allows any articles and I think we should assumed good faith. We all make mistakes; I know that I did something similar when I first joined wikipedia so I urge the user not to be disheartened by his article being deleted. I also urge users not to make sarcastic comments as I’ve seen before on such issues and to be understanding. Anyhow, it’s a none notable 6-a-side team, thus it has to be deleted. It may be a good idea to speedy delete as it obviously fills the criteria and it will make it less pain free for all involve. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 23:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This list should be sourced and <i>what is relevant</i> should be merged into <a href="../../../g/m/a/Gmail.html#Talk_integration" title="Gmail">Gmail#Talk_integration</a>. Doing a simple google search for "gmail emoticons" brought up several lists very similar to this one. Apparently, Google itself released a list of the emoticons. Gmail's moving emoticons don't merit an article of their own - they're just one relatively small feature in the notable webmail server. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 12:58, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The fact that Google Talk supports emoticons might be worth mentioning (it's probably mentioned already, though). The specific list, though, doesn't add anything to the reader's understanding of Google Talk - particularly as most of these are <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emoticon.html#Common_examples" title="Emoticon">pretty standard</a>, and I expect the list is available from within the client.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> This is a warmup that does wonders for your singing and we often use it. However, I do agree that the writer of this article has limited musical knowledge. You can't argue with that, it is a true zingamama (refering to zingamama being used as an exclamation following a great insult, shutdown, comeback or similar).

<li><b>Undecided</b> - leaning towards <i>weak delete</i>. Certainly the event got plenty of attention when it happened, and as such there are a plethora of news clippings written about it. On the flip side, sad as the sinking was, 3 victims is not that many and the vessel was not large enough to have significant enviornmental impact. I'm going to see what happens with this article over the next few days before making up my mind. In the meantime, I've added the boat to the list of Irish shipwrecks with the hope that more people will see the article and it's proposed deletion. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertbcole_d850.html" title="User talk:Robertbcole">→</a><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:gold;font-variant:small-caps">bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robertbcole_0dd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robertbcole">←</a> 17:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I disagree with the major points of the nomination. The same arguments can be made for every entry under the Lists of Rivers category. Just as there is no list of S, E, or W rivers there are no lists of rivers in Italy or a list of places without rivers. Honestly, in my opinion, it is more interesting to see a list of north-bound rivers than it is to see a list of rivers in Guam.

<li><b>reply</b> north flowing northern hemisphere rivers are not that rare. Many major rivers in Europe and Asia flow mostly north (Rhine, Elbe, Oder, Volga, Ob, etc. etc.). Rivers flow downhill, not in any one cardinal direction.
<ul>
<li>But the <i>misconception</i> that they <i>are</i> rare is common. I strongly suspect that the motivation behind this article is the very same question that you can find asked in the sources that I cited above: "Please name 3 rivers that flow north.". So one issue to address is: How can Wikipedia best help encyclopaedia readers to combat this particular misconception about the direction of flow of rivers? Obviously one idea that editors had was to construct a raw list of rivers that flow north so that they could say to those people (North Americans and otherwise) who assert that it's rare for a river to flow north: "Look at <i>this</i> lengthy list of rivers that flow north. That clearly demonstrates that your assertion is wrong." Incorporating the point that rivers flow downhill (which one can source from what I cited above) into an overall discussion that doesn't just present a raw list of rivers but that includes analysis and explanation as well, as per <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>, is good idea. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:18, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. North flowing rivers are not that rare. The length of the article testifies to that. The list however could be even longer and is in fact unlikely ever to be complete. For example, it has hardly started with Australia and yet more water flows into Australia's northern waters than anywhere else to the south. How do you define a "river" as opposed to a stream, a creek, etc. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 01:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as a non-notable list of rivers. The primary cardinal direction of a river's flow is neither notable by itself, nor as part of a listing. I am certain that if we extended this down to a full study of all rivers in the world, we would find that 25% (or an insiginificant statistical difference from 25%) of all rivers flow any one of the 4 cardinal directions. A restatement of a predictable stastistic is hardly something worth building lists on. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:48, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep if Verifiable</b> - Wikipedia is home to many drink related articles (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cocktails.html" title="List of cocktails">here</a>). Most of these contain some amount of instruction as to how the drink is meant to be mixed. In my mind, the biggest issue with this current article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>. If we can get some references that cite instances of this drink being prepared (my bartender's guide doesn't have a beverage by this name, although it does contain several other flaming drinks) I see no reason to delete the article. I would also remind the community that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>. Thus, the fact that a subject is dangerous does not negate it's candidacy. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun.html" title="Gun">Gun</a> would qualify for deletion, as would <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:gold;font-variant:small-caps">-bobby</em></a> 17:01, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to the bartending book, if they want it. Otherwise <b>delete</b>. I don't see anything about the social context of the drink that makes it appropriate for this project, only a recipe and Humblefool's reference to an alternate recipe. There has to be more than just a recipe or two. Is this a famous person's favorite drink? Has this been featured in a significant work of fiction? Has this drink been explicitly banned or been found uniquely responsible for a series of fatalities? Have there been legal fights about trade secrets or copyright regarding the preparation of this drink? These are the kinds of things that make what are otherwise just recipes appropriate topics here. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 22:11, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is a rather new entry, and as such is in it's infancy. As for being verifiable, a quick google search will show that myspace contains multiple movies of this. As the author of most of this entry, I just have not had time to upload pictures and/or movies of this drink being made and consumed. While the drink has not been banned (that I know of) it is quite popular here in Geneva Switzerland, and has been added to at least two menus that I know of. Given time, this will be documented and added to the wiki page. <b>Keep.</b> Saukeye 10:57, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>delete</b> I was ready to vote "keep" on this one, but the more I looked at it, the more I realized there were problems(NOTE: THE OTHER SURNAME ARTICLES HAVE THESE SAME PROBLEMS):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Original Research: Where are the references to back up that these are French surnames? What makes a French surname? Surnames of people in France? How long does a surname have to be in France to be considered French? What about French surnames that appear in other nations? What about Franchified names that originated in other tongues? What about French surnames that have been translated to other tongues? Former territories of France that are now parts of other nations? Names that sound french but have no connection to France? You see the problem here? We have no way of defining the list to any satisfaction.</li>
<li>The articles it links to make no mention of the list itself. For example, the first name <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphonse.html" title="Alphonse">Alphonse</a> redirects to a list of kings named Alphonso (first name, not surname!). If the subject of the list isn't notable within the articles it lists, why is it here?</li>
<li>Unweildy and huge. There are probably THOUSANDS of french surnames, maybe TENS OF THOUSANDS or HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. It is impossible that this list can justify including some over others, and it cannot have all of them.</li>
<li>triviality: Notable lists should be of notable things. This is no more notable than a telephone directory. Telephone directories are VERY useful. I use one almost every day. No need to put one into a wikipedia article, however.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any other additions to this? I think that presents a pretty comprehensive deletion case. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 06:07, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, unsourced list, no clear criteria, full of useless links like the one to <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferry.html" title="Ferry">Ferry</a>. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 11:32, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think a list like this is indeed a good idea and handy, but I agree that it should be sourced and I would think that a quick web search on French surnames would turn up responses that could be cited. Good bye and Happy Thanksgiving! --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 13:59, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for indiscriminate lists or original research. Who says the names are French and where did they say it&#160;? List of surnames which may have been borne by people who might be French describes content and problem. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 19:54, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Lacks meaningful criteria, resulting in original research, and has the potential to be wildly under-inclusive, making it less useful. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 22:38, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. Open-ended list, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and source</b> - lack of sourcing (as opposed to being unsourceable) is not inherently a reason to delete. If it is not sourced, bring it back here and it should be a slamdunk. Could be a useful article if cleaned up. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 01:33, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This list simply is not encyclopedic. Moreover, creating a complete version of the list could be impossible. George J. Bendo 00:10, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Appeared in one movie and died, apparently with no real role in the movie otherwise. I don't think this qualifies as notability. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 18:13, 6 November 2006 (UTC) "keep" I think this article should be cleaned up, but I see no reason to delete it- keep Stumblemonkey</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b>IF YOU DELETE THIS, I will personally feel the need to file a complaint with the owners of Wikipedia because GENE WEXLER is an amazing person and he is the only person that I can think of that deserves to have his own "section" to say the least on Wikipedia. So if you delete this or want it deleted, THINK AGAIN. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.204.157.62 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.204.157.62_2472.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.204.157.62">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>I completely disagree with the previous statement. Gene Wexler should be kept on wikipedia for his obvious importance and contribution to society. Nicholas' Gift was a key part of the movement to help support organ donation. Gene Wexler played the young boy, Nicholas, who is possibly the most crucial character in the show. While only having a small part in terms of time, his importance to the movie could not have been more crucial. The only action that should be taken against this wikipedia page is expansion. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.201.html" title="User:205.188.116.201">205.188.116.201</a> 20:53, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b>-This article can admittedly use cleanup (and I am willing to do it). But the fact is Wexler is an actor with an important role in the movie. And as per the above editor, the movie and more specificly Wexler has made an impact on society. 68.193.95.73 20:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>-The argument for deletion is false. This article is very notable as Wexler has made a large impact on society. His role in the movie, although short, flashes back various times. His role is vital in the movie and the plot would be lost without him. Also, he is an established musician, taking part in a variation of Stomp and has been in many musicals and dramas. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.193.95.73 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.193.95.73_96ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.193.95.73">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Gene is not only been talented enough to be cast as a lead role in a film, his work besides Jamie Lee Curtis has put him in the same "club", if you will as Dan Akroyd, Tim Allen, Bette Midler, Lindsay Lohan, Chad Micheal Murray, and many others. Wexler's performance inspired children and adults alike to be organ donors, and one may argue that a TV movie may be more widely viewed than a movie in theatres, being that it is offered for free on TV. The point of the previous statement is, if Ben Afflect and erroneous actors and actresses get their names mentioned on Wikipedia, why does someone who has affected a subject so important, such as Gene, deserve to have their entry deleted.

<p><b>KEEP THIS ARTICLE</b> Though the movie was only a TV movie, it still raised much awareness about organ donation. I know a few people who were impacted by this movie and became organ donors themselves. It was interesting to read about the actor who played Nicholas and what he is doing now. Maybe we will see more of him in the future. He did a pretty good job, so i suggest you keep this article!</p>

<dd>WIkipeadia isn't about awareness of organ donation, cancer, or upcomming actors. Or advertising or making people feel good. It's an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. It's about knowledge and information. Gene's main claim to fame is a minor role in a TV movie from 8 years ago. Should Gene get his big break or become a notorious murderer or something actually of notoriety I'm sure we'd be happy to have an article on him. Right now I think I get more hits on Google, and I think I've had more screen time from back when I lived in Chicago - and I'm not an actor.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Its been known for a while that Episode 3 is the finale of the HL2 Trilogy so there's no need for a Episode 4 article when there is a 0.00001% chance of a game ever being made.

<li><b>Comment:</b> OK, if that turns out to be the consensus here, I won't make a fuss. The article did not explicitly say he is a member of the parliament, and the question of verifiability / POV in a potential autobio remains - but if he's notable enough for en.wiki, there are other ways to take care of this. --<a href="../../../l/c/a/User%7ELcamtuf_1a6c.html" title="User:Lcamtuf">lcamtuf</a> 17:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I edited the article to make it somewhat clearer that he was in fact a Moldovan MP, and found an English language site confirming that. Some Romanian language sites also seemed to confirm it, but I don't really read Romanian. Other English language sites called him a "deputy", which is an ambiguous title in American English. It does seem that he is both an MP and the leader of his party's faction in parliament, which makes him a significant enough figure to pass IMO. -<a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Born in 1969, Oleg Serebrian is one of Moldova's youngest and most promising political leaders. He has a solid background in international affairs, with a degree in international relations from the European Institute of High International Studies in Nice, France, and post-graduate work done at Harvard, Edinburgh and Paris. In the late 1990's, he worked for his country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is also the author of several books on international affairs and foreign policy, the latest being "Dicţionar de geopolitică" (Geopolical Dictionary), a 340 page tome on international politics which has just been published simultaneously in Romania and Moldova." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.97.56.58 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.97.56.58_d54e.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.97.56.58">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>This article contains content that is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a collection of indiscriminate information. The article on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Abramoff_37c3.html" title="Jack Abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> is already very long, and contains many, many subpages. Some of this information could be integrated to one of the other articles, but most of it is just indiscriminate information relating to the Abramoff scandal. Each Abramoff list also contains little if any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">references</a>, which makes me think that it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - This list has misguided intentions, exposed in the very first sentence: "Here is a list of songs that happen to be the name of a movie". This sets a bad precedent for unencyclopedic lists: Things that have the same name as other, unrelated things of no particular category. --<a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossanova_19f2.html" title="User:Vossanova">Vossanova</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/o/s/User_talk%7EVossanova_e002.html" title="User talk:Vossanova">o&lt;</a></sup> 18:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> While it's an interesting trend/built-in marketing gimmick, this opens the door to messes involving one-word song/movie titles or exceedingly common names like "Hold On".

<li><b>Comment</b> I could possibly see a List of films containing songs of the same title, or List of songs from films of the same title, but the flaw of this list is that entries don't necessarily have to tie the two together. If someone were to rename the article and restrict the list more, that could be discussed. --<a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossanova_19f2.html" title="User:Vossanova">Vossanova</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/o/s/User_talk%7EVossanova_e002.html" title="User talk:Vossanova">o&lt;</a></sup> 19:41, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Just because some rock band names a song "Deliverance" 30 years after a film of the same name ... that isn't notable; if said song is in some way a tribute to the film, then that should be noted in the film's article. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:56, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "List of Songs named after a Film" might be notable as it establishes causation and by extension notability. This list,however, in its very nature is based on coincidence and not causation. Random coincidence are by definition not notable. Thus, delete it as having no potential to ever become notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 06:18, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment</b> I actually came looking for a page of this specific description, for help with a small project I'm working on, so in theory, it has a valid use. Agreed that endless, coincidental matches are not useful, but certainly it's worth noting the cultural trend of titles such as "Singin' In the Rain," "Pretty In Pink," "Knock On Any Door," transferring from film to music, or vice versa. If there were a way to better define what the list was for, it could be a useful reference. --Hypersquared 20:15, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand what everyone is writing about there being little context and little pages being linked the the page but i have to have time to link pages to it and such like and also add context. Also i've read millions of articles on Wikipedia and some of them appear to eb more useless than this one ^^. Also A Tale Untold has been worked on now for over a year since around last winter and although only about half of Series 1 has actually been filmed we have had alot of script writing, designing, advertising and CGI work to do so in some sense i suppose that's why it's not fully notable. Please just give me some time and if you want explain want you want improved, if you need a longer description and an improved article i will happily ablige (dunno how to spell it sorry). Also i realise that there are no "Fan based websites" about A Tale Untold but 50% of the atricles on wikipedia i bet there aren't aswell. For example i looked at a few MMORPG's and searched for them and the only hits they had was on there offcial website, not fan based websites so they are still notable even without any other hits so why can't A Tale Untold have the same treatment? - <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonoridge_d2d6.html" title="User:Jonoridge">Jonoridge</a> 17:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep and cleanup</b> The subject is the basis of an important "thought experiment" that has received mention in many sources. The Straight Dope devoted several columns to the issue. As a subject, it is quite notable.

<li><b>I agree with Jayron32</b> - but I was the original author, so i might be biased. However the topic seems thoroughly debated all over the internet in Blogs, News Columns, and Message Boards. It was nominated at Mythbusters (NGC) forums for a possible future episode. -- SAO123</li>

<dl>
<dd>So who thought it up? If it was a notable individual or group in the field of Physics then yes, I can see how it would be notable.

<dd>Agreed. The posters to Mythbusters are (apparently) non-notable. But I propose that if it can be verified that that series starts producing a segment about this topic (say, getting past the writing stage to the actual production and taping, but not necessarily to having a finished, broadcast segment), that we keep and rewrite. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBaccyak4H_9457.html" title="User:Baccyak4H">Baccyak4H</a> 18:25, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I dont see how the the origin (whether it be insignificant or unknown/anonymous) can detract from the prevalence of the question today. I believe that the mere fact of its continued existance is justification enough by itself. Something so insignificant would surely eventually die out in a matter of time, however this has continued for 2+ years. I also site <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999..." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999..." rel="nofollow">0.999...</a> as a similar phenomenon with unknown origin, which still stands as being deemed significant today, and also sites The Straight Dope as a valid source.</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b> This is basically a riddle, and not a particularly famous one. It is like a question on an exam.

<li><b>Delete</b> I puzzled over this one long day on Straight Dope before I figured out that the conveyer belt was the length of the runway (I thought of it as a treadmill - I figured the plane would either remain stationary or just fall off!) It was a fascinating Straight Dope article. But I'm of the opinion that it's not an encyclopedia article. It is <b>fascinating</b>, but not <b>famous</b>, <b>knotty</b>, but not <b>notable</b>. I've seen it reproduced in different places, but that's common for riddles and puzzles. What I would want to see to make this notable is an article <b>about</b> the riddle in a national publication (i.e. an article about how many people have tried to solve it, the debates it's caused, that it's taking the world by storm...something like that). So I'm in the deletion camp. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 01:29, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Again with the thinking this problem must be famous in order to be enclopedia worthy. I thought an encyclopedia is supposed to be a reference of things unknown, a place to find something when you encounter something previously unknown to you. If all we ever list is common knowledge, why even have an encyclopedia? If people already know the facts, they are not going to come to you for the answers. An encyclopedia is supposed to be a reference source of uncommon knowledge, meaning, they come to you for the unknown, not the common knowledge or the famous knowledge. As far as being in a national publication, did you checkout the afore mentioned Pilots Lounge Issues #94? - SAO123 10:18am November 09
<dl>
<dd>Well, an encyclopedia is a repository for <i>established</i> knowledge. You may not know about it, but it should be something that IS well known by somebody; to the point that it appears in other <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Encyclopedias are not the place for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, there are other kinds venues for this. An encyclopedia may be the place where one FIRST goes to learn about something, but as a first resource, it is always an overview; a superficial study of the subject at hand. The encyclopedia should lead you to the in-depth studies and resources, and be well referenced to do so. That having all been said, I am still of the opinion that this particular logic problem is well enough known in external sources that it transcends the simply trivial; its solution is debated. The Straight Dope article cited above is more than a solution, it is part of an ongoing analysis of the problem. Which is why I vote keep. The subject is referencable in reliable, third party sources. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 15:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, having just read the pages on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29" rel="nofollow">Wiki: Notability of Science (proposed)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28numbers%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28numbers%29" rel="nofollow">Notability of Math</a> it would seem that under these general guidelines, the article could be considered notable. Consider it under items 2,8,9,10 or 11, under the science page, and Items 1 &amp; 3 (item 2 does not apply) on the math page.

Furthermore from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Uncle_G/On_notability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Uncle_G/On_notability" rel="nofollow">Wiki: On Notability</a> <i><b>The primary notability criterion</b> The rationale that underpins the primary notability criterion is that the fact that something has been noted demonstrates that it is notable. Notability is something that is judged by the world at large, not by Wikipedia editors making personal judgements. <b>If multiple people in the world at large that are independent of the subject have gone to the effort of creating and publishing non-trivial works of their own about the subject, then they clearly consider it to be notable.</b> Wikipedia simply reflects this judgement. There are other portions of this argument to long to print here, but also read subsections <b>Notability is not fame nor importance</b>, <b>Notability is not verifiability</b> and <b>Notability is not subjective</b> for further relevent guidance.</i> - SAO123

<dd>Those science and math guidelines are, unfortunately, all off-point. This is not a scientific or mathematic principle, it's an <i>example</i> of basic physics (i.e. two objects moving in opposite directions and not applying force on each other don't act on each other.) It's not a significant new development, a new theory, a new explanation, etc. - it's a physics example in the form of a logic puzzle. The question I have is whether significant publications have taken notice of it and written about it (rather than just re-stating the riddle and the answer.) I haven't seen enough of that, hence my vote. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 16:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>By the way, one small thing - you can more easily sign your post by adding the four tildes. Beyond that - I don't know what to tell you. I've looked at those publications, and draw the distinction I've drawn before. I in no way dispute that the publications and authors you're talking about could, in some cases, be a part of notability. But here I don't think there's enough <i>about</i> (rather than restating) the riddle. For reference, you can see that Jayron applied (I believe) the same analysis and came out the other way - he sees enough <i>about</i> the riddle. I don't. You disagree with my analysis on that, and that is absolutely fine - I think we just disagree and I think that's ok. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Admittedly, I was the person who nominated this article for deletion. The problem is not particularly noteworthy from a physics perspective, but seems to have gained a limited popularity on the web. Admittedly, the fact that I do not agree with the conclusions reached (despite them being echoed by the Straight Dope) may seem to give a limited credibility to its claim to be a paradox. However, there are many such problems that could be posed. Somewhere here somebody cited the problem being nominated for mythbusters - however on the same page somebody nominated a "Helicopter in an elevator" for Mythbuster's treatment - and I doubt too many people would be troubled about the question of whether an elevator when going up crashes into a model helicopter or if the helicopter hovers serenely in its original position with respect to the elevator. - JHill 17:43 GMT</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - The article is a physics problem, not an encyclopedia article. While it may have been discussed elsewhere on the web, it does not appear to have achieved enough notability to warrant inclusion at this time. George J. Bendo 22:09, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The problem is ill-posed. If the conveyor belt "tracks the plane speed" and "tunes the speed of the conveyor to be exactly the same (but in the opposite direction)," then the conveyor will end up going faster and faster (because the plane gains speed using its engines) until friction in the plane's wheels brings it to rest again. It's a language problem, not a physics problem, just like the "irresistible force meets immovable object." <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHEL_f701.html" title="User:HEL">HEL</a> 19:28, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Since it's even more "popular" than "Gar" it should indeed pass as an"community-only slang term ready to get it's own article alongside with "Gar".

<p>An AfD tag was applied here weeks ago by a single-purpose account and the nomination was not carried through. Now, the article is a CSD-A1, lacking any sort of encyclopedic context. But the editor creating it has spent lierally weeks crafting it. I don't wish to see it deleted per se, but I can't, at this moment, see what our customers (the people who <i>read</i> Wikipedia rather than edit it and who thus vastly outnumber the people who make changes) would make of it. So I ask for others to discuss it in a reasonable way and offer <b>no opinion</b> of my own.<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:36, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. The "customers" for this article are the same as the customers for the hundreds of tennis articles that are scattered throughout Wikipedia. Many of those articles are about past tennis champions.

The practice in those articles is to include "Grand Slam performance timelines" (or something similar), which recounts in a tabular form their career performances in the most important tennis tournaments. This article, which by the way was tagged for AfD by single-pupose "Tennis editor" 5 minutes after that account was created, is a compilation of those tables so that the performances can be readily compared without having to constantly toggle between innumerable browser windows or tabs. The article is by no means complete. But for the hundreds (or thousands) of people who read and edit the Wikipedia tennis articles, its purpose is already readily apparent.

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you offering to provide con<b>text</b> for the article? It currently lacks it, which is why this got to AfD. If you, or any other editor, could provide an introduction, a clear explaination of what the colours and the columns mean, and make the page accessible to non-tennis fans (the <i>vast</i> majority of our readers, I'm afraid) then it might be a clear keep. Oh, and for those tempted to add <b>speedy</b> to their opinions: <b>Don't</b>... unless you can point to policy for why it's a speedy (in either direction). Otherwise it's meaningless and isn't helping anyone.

<li>Of course I'm going to provide context for the article and a complete explanation of the tables, including the symbols and colors. (Part of that is already done below each table. More will be added there and at the beginning of the article.) That was the intention all along. I've edited, created, and contributed to hundreds of articles and certainly know how important context is. By the way, I'm glad you were able to tell me what the intention of "Tennis editor" was when he or she nominated the article for deletion because that user has provided no reasoning directly to me or publicly, as far as I can determine. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 22:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do understand what this article is trying to do. However, I'm not sure that it makes sense to combine all of the Grand Slam finalists of all time into a table of this sort. By contrast, the information when displayed in each individual player's article is useful (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Evert_aaed.html#Grand_Slam_singles_tournament_timeline" title="Chris Evert">Chris Evert#Grand Slam singles tournament timeline</a> for a good example). --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 08:59, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Tables of this sort are a tool that makes it easier for a tennis fan, a sports historian, or just a casual reader to gain a historical perspective about the relative performances of tennis players at Grand Slam events. The tables provide the forest whereas the individual articles are the trees. A person perusing a Wikipedia article about Margaret Osborne duPont probably would have no idea whether she was among the top players of her time because the reader wouldn't know about the results of her contemporaries, namely Pauline Betz Addie, Lousie Brough Clapp, Shirley Fry Irvin, or Doris Hart. But the tables in this article would quickly give the reader results-based information about duPont's contemporaries, enabling the reader to delve further into their careers and the history of tennis by clicking on the links provided. Rankings, head-to-head competition, and relative results are the essence of the sport of tennis. Therefore, these tables are important to people trying to understand the history of tennis and past champions of the sport. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 15:48, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep &amp; rename?</b> Not being at all interested in Tennis, I had to think about this article. My reason for voting to keep is that it is a good starting article from which to find one or other tennis player whom one has forgotten (but there may be better articles which I've not checked). I don't like the name - at first I thought it was some scientific comparison of serve speed! My other concern is that there is too much detail and I'm not sure whether the notation used is at all standard. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The notation is the same that is currently being used in over 100 individual tennis player articles in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is, whilst I know of Ms King and her works, I know nothing of tennis rankings/results/systems or whatever the article is trying to tell tennis fans. If the article has something important to say, then why, even with the changes, do I not understand it? I'm not thick, I'm not playing stupid, I simply know nothing about whatever these complex coded multicoloured tables are trying to tell me. A need to simplify exists. Without it, CSD applies: no context. If I can comprehend an article like the ones we have on quantum physics (a subject I know even less about than tennis, of which I know almost nothing) thanks to having the <i>issue</i> discussed first, the meta-meaning of the item second and the weird science third, then asking an article about tennis to do the same (what are the championships? How important are they comparitively? How has tennis changed over the period concerned? Who is deciding this? What will I <i>understand</i> if I read the article?) seems plenty reasonable. As I said in my introduction, the time spent crafting this table is noted and appreciated. But now someone needs to make the table meaningful. It isn't there yet. It's still a CSD as it lacks context. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then it <b>must</b> have context supplied. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:47, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response to Comment</b> What tennis is about, how to play the game, how people are ranked, etc., etc. is already provided in innumerable <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a> articles. Are you wanting me to repeat those articles here? Have a look at the tennis articles that provide data without the context you are saying is necessary. For example, look at <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Open_champions_%28Women%27s_Doubles%29_9440.html" title="French Open champions (Women's Doubles)">French Open women's doubles champions</a>. That is not my article, by the way. But it illustrates the data-oriented tennis articles that abound throughout Wikipedia. Should all of those articles be deleted (trust me, there are lots of them)? As for whether I have "something important to say," it would be a violation of Wikipedia's POV doctrine for me to say that so-and-so was a greater player or had a better career than so-and-so. I am presenting a lot of the relevant data so that a reader could draw his or her own conclusions. The tables are very simple. I've changed the article to discuss the color coding. The concept of this article is much simpler than the quantum physics article, which I'd bet, by the way, any reader would have to spend a considerable amount of time trying to understand - much more time than understanding the tables I'm presenting. But if you want to delete the article, so be it. I think you would be holding the article to an unprecedented standard when compared to virtually all the tennis articles that are out there. If the article is deleted, I'll still have it available for my own purposes and will continue working on it. But others will never see it. It's up to you, I assume. I'm done debating the issue and I'm not going to beg for the article to be treated fairly and consistently. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 21:46, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As stated above, I'm against having this article. However, I don't think it should be considered difficult to understand. The idea is that for every female tennis player who ever won, or came in second, in any of the four major tennis tournaments, her lifetime record in all of those tournaments is shown, from the first time she entered any of them to the last time. And for each such tournament in her career, there is an indication of whether she was the <b>W</b>inner, a <b>F</b>inalist, a <b>S</b>emi <b>F</b>inalist, a <b>Q</b>uarter <b>F</b>inalist, or lost in one of the earlier rounds, or didn't compete in that tournament. So if you see some player shown with a lot of <b>W</b>s, that means she won a lot of major tournaments. I don't find it easy to read or particularly useful, but it's certainly not a candidate for speedy deletion. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>A problem for Wikipedia</b> - There really ought to be a method to discuss and article before an author is encouraged to spend so much time and then see their work thrown away by potentially having it deleted. <b>This is something seriously amiss with wikipedia</b>. In theory, it should be possible to create a stub article and then just put it up for AfD, but too many people don't judge the article, only the contents and so an AfD discussion doesn't work as it should! There needs to be another way to prejudge an article to give a potential author an idea of whether the article as invisaged would be acceptable. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Redvers - positive comments - unfortunately there may be many talking, but is anyone listening? I've pesonally posted on this subject, (I even created a new AfDU) and your's is the first comment I've had! This is a problem of power disparity. Those without power need things to change, but those with the power and influence to make things happen have no need to see any change. I only grumble because it makes me feel better, not because I expect anything to change! --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 21:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>My honest opinion</b> As a non-expert in tennis, I must say I find a table such as this one rather useful. For better or worse, I find information assembled in a tabular format rather helpful and easier to assimilate. Admittedly, some of the features (colors, symbols) could be simplified but, all in all, I believe this article serves a useful, albeit infrequent, purpose. Carpe diem 11:11, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There's plenty of evidence that this term has frequently been used, but little evidence that it exists as a concept in political science. I'm not sure that we need an article about a vague political usage or derogatory term, and it seems unlikely - especially on the basis of the life of this article so far - that such an article would ever get to the point of being particularly informative, let alone reality-based, comprehensive, well-sourced and well-written or, in short, encyclopaedic.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree that there are sources and that we can believe the product exists and it seems that there are sources to back the claims, although some the references could perhaps be better embedded within the article. However it's still advertising for a specific branded (probably trademarked) product isn't it? The article is not about a class of supplements, for example. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich257_a349.html" title="User:Rich257">Rich257</a> 10:44, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Okay, where do I begin? First of all, although patent documents prove that the said product (which I have never heard of) DOES exist, that does not mean it is notable to a wide audience. I would consider most medical journals to be unreliable sources, as some have come under fire for being paid by a manufacturer to write a positive article. Give us a citation from the New England Medical Journal or from a source that the general public <i>knows</i> is legimate, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a> (or such). A lot of the statements in the article are attributed to "According to Immunotec...". This is a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research">primary source</a>, and thus a no-no. Use <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">inline citations</a> for statements, providing a reliable secondary source. While I believe this product does exist, it's nothing personal, but I believe Wikipedia must maintain a strigent article acceptance policy, because otherwise it would soon become a walking billboard. If the article is kept, it needs major cleanup to make it look less like a spam article (all of the external links in the article text need to be converted to inline cites) and more understandable to people outside the medical community. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen451_48b7.html" title="User:Green451">Green451</a> 16:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Green451: You suggested either the "New England Journal of Medicine" or the "New York Times" as credible sources. That's like saying I want the high standard of a either a Ferrari or a VW bug. Highly divergent. The NEJM typically requires the highest standards for inclusion of clinical trials (unlikely that a nutritional supplement trial will meet this criteria unless it is subsidized by the <a href="../../../n/i/h/NIH_0352.html" title="NIH">NIH</a>). The New York Times is least credible source in scientific terms. Heresay and author opinion. Most journalists are not scientists. Your statement that "most medical journals [are] unreliable sources, as some have come under fire for being paid by a manufacturer to write a positive article" is something that is not accepted in the scientific community. Most are "peer review" journals and almost all today require authors of articles to state "conflicts of interest" which would certainly include being paid for writing a positive article. I am a scientist and if I participated in that, I would lose all professional credibility. It happens, but it is the rare exception and not the rule. Lets re-write as necessary, but not exclude minor journals as references because they could be "tainted".<a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApparent_Logic_937b.html" title="User:Apparent Logic">Apparent Logic</a> 05:04, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Okay, I will assume a leap of faith and believe that the nine journals you cited are legitimate.

Why would people want to know about this product? I just thought of those examples off the top of my head, but they are notable drugs.

<dd>Rich257: Not necessarily. Only that the reader hadn't seen it before. SkierRMH stated: "parts come almost verbatim from thier publicity/publications" but I also reviewed the supplied manufacturer's link and didn't find verbatim lifts. I reviewed the WIKI article and most statements are documented by external links to credible sources. If the contention concerns "the manufacturer states", perhaps an editor could do a little research to find references beyond the manufacturer (i.e. compensated by Medicare/medicaid, etc). I believe this may need a re-write, but dont think the baby should be thrown out with the bathwater... <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApparent_Logic_937b.html" title="User:Apparent Logic">Apparent Logic</a> 14:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Rich257: You are correct. The class of supplements is "undenatured bioactive whey protein supplements". There are only 2 or 3 that I am aware of, however the Immunocal is the original supplement in the class, and most folks search for it by brand name. I checked the Yahoo network and found no searches for "undenatured bioactive whey protein supplements" but numerous for the branded product "immunocal". Users of Wikipedia would therefor be more likely to search for the branded product. (This is similar to the brand "<a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleenex.html" title="Kleenex">kleenex</a>" which is more likely to be searched for than "facial tissue", and is included in Wikipedia as the branded reference for that reason. <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApparent_Logic_937b.html" title="User:Apparent Logic">Apparent Logic</a> 14:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The notability of this person is not clearly established; he was a local politician / ministry spokesperson, and a local scientist who, judging from the article, had published about five articles in various magazines and/or larger compilations, but has no own published books; this is perhaps more clear when you look at the references <a href="../../../../pl/o/l/e/Oleg_Serebrian_2a7b.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Oleg_Serebrian">on pl.wiki</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> OK, if that turns out to be the consensus here, I won't make a fuss.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I edited the article to make it somewhat clearer that he was in fact a Moldovan MP, and found an English language site confirming that. Some Romanian language sites also seemed to confirm it, but I don't really read Romanian. Other English language sites called him a "deputy", which is an ambiguous title in American English. It does seem that he is both an MP and the leader of his party's faction in parliament, which makes him a significant enough figure to pass IMO. -<a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

He has a solid background in international affairs, with a degree in international relations from the European Institute of High International Studies in Nice, France, and post-graduate work done at Harvard, Edinburgh and Paris. In the late 1990's, he worked for his country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>I agree with Pjacobi. I've been watching this article to make sure someone didn't start adding back dubious additions, such as calling Volfson a physicist. I've flagged Phonon Maser for deletion for much the same reasons as this article (not to mention that a real <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonon.html" title="Phonon">phonon</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Maser.html" title="Maser">maser</a> would be something very much different). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 21:44, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and merge into this article the Phonon Maser article. The editors of Wikipedia absolutely are not the arbiters of scientific validity. Claims by an editor that in his expert opinion it won't work is the very definition of Original Research. We only have the right to determine whether or not some person, patent, etc. is notable, based on the presence or absence of citations in mainstream publications. The AfD nomination claims "non-notable" and "no reliable third party sources," but there in fact are reliable thrid party sources to show notability now cited in the article. The article includes references showing this individual was issued a U.S patent, which is certainly verifiable, then the patent was written about, in some detail in the following major publications or the online versions thereof: National Geographic News,the British newspaper Telegraph, and the major science journal Nature (print edition). These three articles makes a strong case for keeping the article about Volfson. In addition there are about 3,000 Google hits, and it was discussed at many websites. It may be pseudoscience, but that is not the criterion for including or deleting an article. We have and will keep articles on many discredited or plain wrong theories such as <a href="../../../p/h/l/Phlogiston.html" title="Phlogiston">Phlogiston</a>. Rather than deleting the article with a claim that it lacks "scientific validity," <b>edit boldly</b> and include in the article the criticisms of the invention in the references, so the article serves the important function of debunking any doubtful claims.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am not impartial, so I remove my vote. However, the statement that I am the inventor of a single non-notable and inoperateble device is incomplete. The last time I checked with the USPTO site, it listed the following patents:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. 6,962,737 Simulated stained glass modular electroluminescent articles 2. 6,960,975 Space vehicle propelled by the pressure of inflationary vacuum state 3. 5,965,897 High resolution storage phosphor x-ray imaging device 4. 5,656,814 Versatile method and device for thermoluminescence comparative analysis 6. 4,826,044 Dispenser for viscous fluids 7. 4,411,044 Cord weight pulley 8. 4,399,855 Roll type closure assembly for a window</p>
<p>All these patents (along with some foreign patents) are to my name only except for ##3 &amp; 4 on the list where I am listed as a co-inventor. Most of the patents are physics-related. All the patented devices other than the item #2 were built and worked as intended.</p>
<p>The device of item #2, the "antigravity" Spaceship, worked too. But it cannot be demonstrated as it broke through the ceiling, the roof and flu away toward <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a>. The "antigravity" Test Chamber is used by the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> in the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_Bay_detainment_camp_d6fa.html" title="Guantanamo Bay detainment camp">Guantanamo Bay detainment camp</a> for questioning of the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatants.html" title="Enemy combatants">enemy combatants</a>. The "antigravity" Phonon Maser is hidden in the secret undeground lab.</p>
<p>The device of item #6 was sold for many years as Colgate Toothpaste pump. The pump was very popular and sold in the millions in many different countries (the product currently sold under this name in the UK is slightly different from the originally-produced pump). Volfson,boris</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm afraid the above entry only confirms my opinions. Further discussion does not seem to be required.

<p><br />
<b>Keep</b>. Edison's remarks are thoughtful and salient. This is the sort of thing one would want in a civil forum. In response to pjacobi: If you read the text of Volfson's anti-gravity patents, there is extensive reference to, and use of, both of the Podkletnov and Tajamr articles. Podkltnov's work was the inspiration for Volfson's. The following are directly from the "theory" page linked to his site (borisvolfson.com). Emphases added by me:</p>
<p>"A series of experiments, performed in the early 1990’s by Evgeny Podkletnov, reportedly resulted in a reduction of the weight of objects placed above a levitating, rotating superconductive disk subjected to high frequency magnetic fields. (“Weak Gravitational Shielding Properties of Composite Bulk YBa2Cu33O(7-x) Superconductor Below 70K Under E.M. Field”, E. Podkletnov, LANL database number cond-mat/9701074, v. 3, 10 pages, 16 Sep 1997). The drawback of the technology described in Podkletnov’s above-mentioned paper is the weakness of the resulting effect. Even though Podkletnov has reported .3%-to-2.1% weight reduction with the device described in the above-mentioned 1997 paper, many scientists point to a likelihood of error in Podkletnov’s measurements."</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"Also in Nov. 2005, scientists led by Clovis de Matos and Martin Tajmar and funded by the European Space Agency, published a paper on their research of gravitomagnetism. They measured the gravitational equivalent of a magnetic field in a laboratory by rotating a superconductor ring at 6,500 revolutions per minute. The scientists found that, under certain conditions, the gravitomagnetic effect is much greater than expected from general relativity. However, at just 100 millionths of the acceleration due to the Earth's gravitational field, the effect, which the scientists identified as the Gravitomagnetic London Moment, is very weak. Unlike Podkletnov who used the Type II superconductor, de Matos and Tajmar used a Type I superconductor (“Gravitomagnetic London Moment and the Graviton Mass Inside a Superconductor”, C.J. de Matos and M.Tajmar, Physica C Volume 432, Issues 3-4, 15 November 2005, Pages 167-172). The relative weakness of the artificially-generated gravitational effect makes it necessary to consider amplification before this effect could be used in many practical applications."</p>
<p>Moreover, Volfson provides a well-documented path though his reasoning. See his step by step inferences from work of his predecessors: <a href="http://borisvolfson.com/GravityTheoryPaper.html" class="external free" title="http://borisvolfson.com/GravityTheoryPaper.html" rel="nofollow">http://borisvolfson.com/GravityTheoryPaper.html</a>.</p>
<p>I am not a physicist. However, I know that without imagination, physics would stagnate (and often has). It's still incomplete and confounding. We still don't have a unified field theory. Even the "standard model" has been found wanting.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting dumping currently accepted theories regarding gravity. Darwinian theory is also gappy, but this doesn't warrant disregarding constructive, well-supported parts -- in fact, we rely on them. We should embrace attempts like Volfson's to creativly extend existing theory, provided there is sufficient justification. (An examination of the path he provides, referenced above, would be warranted.)</p>
<p>Mathematics and logic have lead, in the past, to new empirically interesting ground. Group theory, for example, provided particle physicists a fruitful heuristic for empiricle research ... in spite of group theory not being an "empiricle" science. Volfson's work follows an analogous route.</p>
<p>Hostile arguments like some provided by other commentors contribute nothing to a search for truth and understanding, but contribute to the growing climate of incivility and to rigidity of thought. Consider the values behind the attitudes displayed. Consider allowing others to judge for themselves from the evidence he provides. If you find actual errors in the science or logic, please document them. It's more useful to offer constructive suggestions, and to avoid criticism base on mere failure to match current accepted theory. That does not provide anything fruitful.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - just because they don't yet doesn't mean that they won't ever. I'm currently working on pages for ESC entries going by country (in the middle of Luxembourg at the moment) and I can tell you that the following Contests have their second-place songs written up: 1956 (inasmuch as there was a second place, we probably have it), 1957, 1967, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002 (the subject of this AfD), 2003 and 2006. The majority of the missing years are due to the fact that the United Kingdom has placed second something like 15 times and I just haven't got as far as U yet. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:41, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for a number of reasons. Most importantly, the song placed second at a major (arguably <i>the</i> major) international competition. Eurovision performances are broadcast throughout Europe, as well as at least as far as Canada and Australia, which means that it attracted a sizable audience. Additionally, to get as far as the Eurovision stage, it had to win a national competition (the Maltese pre-selection) first. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:41, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Per that guideline, too, it's notable. The big four it misses out on, true, but turning our attention to the other 11 criteria we can see that it <i>Is the signature song of a performer</i>, certainly in the sense that Losco has a signature song for non-Maltese listeners. It was also <i>the subject of a major publicity campaign</i>, in that Maltese television wanted it to win the ESC that year and promoted it accordingly. I'd argue that it is also <i>a particularly well-known song from a piece of musical theater, radio, film or television</i>, being performed live at an internationally-televised event. I'd also suggest, subject to research which I'm mid-way through at the moment, that it could well have <i>appeared in the Top 20 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country</i> or <i>Charted in the Top 100 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country, for at least six months</i>, although I may be proven wrong there. Add into that the fact that it was nominated for a national award and I think we've got a notable song on our hands. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You said it yourself: Maltese chart. <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> is far from a large or medium sized country, hence, it misses out on that criteria. You also stated that it's her "signature song", but that's merely your opinion. You also stated that it's a "well-known piece from a piece of musical theater, radio, film or television", citing the fact that it was performed live on tv, but you are fully aware that the guideline refers to a theme song or other song associated with a specific production.

<dd>I am in fact blissfully unaware of that interpretation of that clause, for the simple reason that it's not clarified anywhere on that page or its associated Talk. In terms of one's "signature song", the description of any song as such is often going to be a matter of debate. What I <i>will</i> say, though, is that it's the song for which she is best known outside of Malta, which would go quite some way towards it being her signature song. In terms of the size of the country, there's also <a href="http://www.maltasong.com/page.asp?n=newsdetails&amp;i=7612" class="external text" title="http://www.maltasong.com/page.asp?n=newsdetails&amp;i=7612" rel="nofollow">some evidence</a> that it charted in Germany. I was reluctant to add this at first, since the page doesn't actually say what number it charted at, but in an effort to counter systemic bias then it seems important. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Regarding being in the German charts, there is absolutely no evidence that it was listed <i>for at least six months</i> and I'm most certain that it was never in a major Top 20 chart. Regarding your other point, I certainly do not classify winning the "Malta Song for Europe" as a major award, and I doubt anyone would. Technically, it's not even an award, as the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta_Song_for_Europe_7512.html" title="Malta Song for Europe">wikipedia page</a> itself states: <i>it's the song festival which decides who will be Malta's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest</i>. If the "Song for Europe" competitions were a "major award", then every song that has ever participated in the ESC would merit its own page! I'll stop here...<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus1234_8c08.html" title="User:Marcus1234">Marcus1234</a> 12:10, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> So far, the precedent has been that every ESC entry <i>does</i> merit its own page. The two AfDs I've linked to before have upheld that idea, even as far as to say that a song that came second-last is notable. Indeed, <a href="../../../l/o/p/Lop%C5%A1in%C4%97_Mylimai_35d1.html" title="Lopšinė Mylimai">a song which came stone motherless last</a> was sufficiently notable to appear on DYK. We talk a lot about "ESC winners" meaning the artists who perform the song, but in a very real way it's actually the song which wins or places - hence the notability of a song which places second, especially when this is the equal-best (then-best) result that a country has had. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 20:44, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hopelessly POV, and there are thousands, no, millions of texts that could be potentionally put here. What is the definition of <i>influential</i>? Also, influential to <i>whom</i>? The Western World? Muslims? Feminists? Scientists? Militants? Consumerists societies? Socialists? Daoists? Stoics? These are a drop in the bucket of the idealogies and demographics by which billions of peoples' daily lives are affected. And each group could credibly point to hundreds, if not thousands, of influential texts that espouse these lifestyles - everything from poetry by Robert Frost, to the Kama Sutra, to the Iraqi constitution. There are many notable and influential texts for sure, but the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Category%7ELiterature_206d.html" title="Category:Literature">Category:Literature</a> would probably be someone's best bet to sort through such an incomprehensible list, and even that cat has a tag on top saying "This category requires continual maintenance to avoid becoming too large." But at least that cat has a fighting chance. This list will always be POV, random, inadequate and unfathomably large to the point of inutility.--<big><a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d"><font face="Sylfaen">Esprit15d</font></a></big> (<a href="../../../e/s/p/User_talk%7EEsprit15d_0875.html" title="User talk:Esprit15d">talk</a> ¤ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Esprit15d_a6e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Esprit15d">contribs</a>) 21:45, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

This serves as an epilogue of sorts to the series. Snicket formats this chapter like a whole new book...title page, copyright, etceteras. Because of this, it has been granted a whole article. As it is only <i>one chapter</i>, I do not believe it deserves an <i>entire article</i>.

<dd>Let me get this straight. You for whatever reason are very against this chapter/short story (whatever <i>you</i> would like to call it). So you nominate it for deletion, even though you don't really think it should be deleted, it should just be merged/redirected (per your comments on the End talk page). You cause a big argument/discussion/debate (once again stick in whatever word <i>you</i> want here). People have differing views and sometimes we have problems accepting that. So after legthly arguing/discussing/debating (see above parentheses), I merge and redirect the page as you originally wanted quite a while ago (once again referecing comments on The End talk page). And now you're upset? I don't get it. You got what you wanted and you're still upset? If you truly are this upset, maybe you need a cup of hot chocolate, a kiss on the forehead, and a nap. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClamster5_9625.html" title="User:Clamster5">Clamster5</a> 04:16, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, at this point I no longer care. Stomp your feet, pout your lips, and whine like a five year old. Nominate every book for deletion and say they should be merged into the main asoue page. Tell everyone you see "There was this truly horrible, truly dastardly editor on Wikipedia. She thought she could actually have a differing opinion. (Laugh)." I don't care.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would just like to stress that this is the <b>most important chapter</b> in a book series with 13 books (more if you count non main series books such as the Unathorized Autobiography).

<li><b>Comment</b> So in other words you assuming you know what Snicket's opinion is, even though he has never said it it outright and you are just speculating? And is it really the most important chapter? That's debatable, and frankly, POV. For example, I could consider Chapter Thirteen the most important; Olaf and Kit Snicket die, Baby Beatrice is born, and we find out the fates (albeit indirectly) of Fernald, Fiona and the Quagmires. Does <i>that</i> chapter deserve its own article because I think its the most important?--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 00:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Hey, let's keep it civil here... (which I say in a purely preventive and totally-non-accusatory way!) Anyway, point taken that "importance" is a relative term (though it's clearly <i>one of the most</i> important), but nobody is proposing giving any other random chapters their own pages, so the example is a bit of a straw-man. Clamster's knowledge of the author's "opinion" is obviously based on the simple fact that Chapter 14 is treated completely by "Snicket" as a book-hidden-within-a-book. It's hardly an unfair logical leap... Further, the fact that it is the ONLY Chapter 14 in a series of consistently-13-chapter-long books clearly sets it apart as special in the author's mind as well as just about anyone else's. I honestly don't understand the urgency to get rid of it. --Arvedui 08:13, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, its important. Yes, its the only Chapter Fourteen. But its only one chapter and <i>can easily be explained and referenced in the main End article</i>. You're right, no one is proposing any other chapter-articles because doing so would be foolish...just as giving what is little more than a glorified epilogue its own article is. It <i>does</i> deserve special mention in the End article, but it <i>does not</i> deserve its own article.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 22:29, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, you've once again ignored the key point of the author's fairly obvious intention that the "chapter" be treated as a separate small book hidden inside a larger book. That alone clearly distinguishes it from "foolish" proposals to dedicate separate articles to any other random chapter. It may indeed be a "glorified epilogue", but it's clearly being glorified for a number of reasons which are important to the story as a whole, and I think we would be doing a disservice to the series and Wikipedia's coverage of it to lump it in with the "previous" book in any way other than appending the entire Chapter 14 page (including book info-box) to the end of Book 13's--which would then inevitably lead to the question of why it doesn't just get its own page, as it happens to right now. --Arvedui 01:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Who says it deserves its own infobox either? That'd be pretty redundant given that 90% of the information applies to the End as well, right? Its not a seperate piece of work, which is what I don't think you understand. Its a continuation of an already existing novel. If it was say a new short story that could stand on its own (like Snicket's Lump of Coal story which was published in the Boston Globe) it <i>might</i> deserve its own article. But right now it could very easily be condensed into one paragraph at the end of the End article rather than a bloated redundant article. Its not two different stories in one book. Its the same one, which just so happens to be split up near the end.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 01:49, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(sigh) One more time, all together now: "Authorial intent" ... "glorified for a number of important reasons" ... "disservice by lumping it in" ... "what's the harm?" I also think describing the Ch.14 article as bloated and redundant is a bit much considering the only duplication at the moment is the section on the Charles Beaudelaire poem (which could just as easily be removed from "The End"). --Arvedui 02:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And to think you were talking about being civil before? But maybe the rules only apply to you when you want them to. And I noticed how you ignored everything I said and just regurgitated your old comments without responding to what I said. Its <i>not</i> a seperate work. The End is seperate form Penultimate Peril. The Bad Beginning is seperate from the Reptile Room. Chapter Fourteen is <i>not</i> a seperate work from the End. Its a disservice by writing about a ten-page chapter in the book that it appeared in?

<li>I'm very sorry you feel I was being uncivil towards you--my comment certainly wasn't intended that way and to be honest, I don't see any incivility in it myself. If you mean the (sigh), that was simply an expression of exasperation at the fact that <i>your</i> response didn't address a single one of the key points <i>I</i> raised, which is also why I felt I had to repeat them. Also, "Authorial intent" plus "glorified for a reason" (plus some comments elsewhere on this page) were my earlier answers to your assertion that the Book and the Chapter are totally inseparable, which, again, you haven't yet addressed (beyond pointing out that they are published in one volume, which is still beside the point).</li>

<dd>I don't really believe that Snicket intends for Chapter Fourteen to be considered a seperate work. Wouldn't the title alone make it Chapter Fourteen of an already existing work, not an entirely seperate one? If it was a seperate work, why didn't Snicket give it a more distinguished name, like the Eerie Epilogue or something? Also, its not like its even its own seperate story in terms of plot...its just another chapter carrying on from the previous chapters. Had Snicket done another plot that was unrelated from the general story (like one chapter detailing the lives of Lemony and Beatrice) I might be more willing to consider it a different story. But formatting gimmicks aside, whose true intentions are unknown, is there anything about it that makes it a different story for deserving its own article?--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 18:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I recall, the 6-book division was arbitrarily imposed on Tolkien by the publisher, who believed that people wouldn't buy or want to read such big thick books, but it was in fact written originally as a trilogy.

<li><b>Merge</b> don't delete; the content has value and should be blended in the the existing! Authorial intention is to be counted - but does not overrule basic practices. If a chapter is called a chapter it is a chapter. If a "chapter" is called a short story is guess what, a "short story". If a chapter is included as part of a publication of single narrative stream it is part of that publication, either a collection of stories or one story, i.e. a novel. The publisher obviously considered the "chapter" as part of the final novel and bound and published it that way. Initial publishing vehicle should be considered the "prime" and historically significant method of delivery. The same arguements (allbeit reversed) apply to Lord of the Rings and it's three novels.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 08:59, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would agree with this line of reasoning, except that I don't for several reasons. In the LOTR example, the "books" were separated simply by a single page which said "Book Two" or "Book Four". It was clear that they were little more than section-markers, and indeed many authors use divisions like "Book One," "Book Two" etc without ever intending that they be published separately. In this case, Chapter Fourteen is preceded by all the usual trappings of a regular book, including blank pages, copyright info, title-page, other-works-by, etc. It also isn't intended to be published separately, true, but there is also an internally-consistent (to the story) logic behind having it published the way it was. And don't get too hung up on the name--meta-fiction is tricky that way! --Arvedui 10:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But even you seem to think the chapter needs a mention, a paragraph, something that signifies its existence. So why didn't you have a discussion on both talk pages, stick the template that says "it has been proposed that these page be merged", wait patiently for at least a week or so, and then merge giving Chapter Fourteen the coverage you feel it deserves in The End article?

<li><b>Another Comment</b> I think this comes down to a matter of semantics. Are we defining a book as being a physical entity, or are we defining a book as a logical entity? There are 13 physical books, 14 logical books. I do think the author intended there to be 14 "books" but the publisher has done 13 books. If the publisher were to publish a separate book 14, then I could justify listing it in an encyclopedia as a separate entity. As it is now, it is merely a section of book 13 and therefore should fall under the page about book 13. Therefore, I think we should merge the pages. --<a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCoug_fb99.html" title="User:JCoug">JCoug</a> 02:15, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>CMG was created by a single individual working out of his home, and within less than 2 years grew to become one of the top 2000 most visited sites on the Internet.</li>
<li>The website currently receives over 300,000 unique visitors per day.</li>
<li>CMG pioneered the <a href="http://www.crazymonkeygames.com/sponsor.php" class="external text" title="http://www.crazymonkeygames.com/sponsor.php" rel="nofollow">game sponsorship</a> model now used by 100's of Flash gaming sites across the Internet. This model allows game developers to earn money from their games while still being credited as the author and retaining the copyright on the game - Something that was almost unheard of before the sponsorship model was introduced.</li>
<li>CMG has sponsored the creation of many extremely popular Flash games, including:
<ul>
<li>The Thing-Thing series. Evidence of notability: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=thing-thing&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=thing-thing&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">1,370,000 results in Google</a>.</li>
<li>The Stickman Sam series. Evidence of notability: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22stickman+sam%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22stickman+sam%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">675,000 results in Google</a>.</li>
<li>Adrenaline Challenge. Evidence of notability: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22adrenaline+challenge%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22adrenaline+challenge%22" rel="nofollow">741,000 results in Google</a>.</li>
<li>RaidenX. Evidence of notability: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22raiden+x%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22raiden+x%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">537,000 results in Google</a>.</li>
<li>Many others, as can be seen in CMG's <a href="http://www.crazymonkeygames.com/download.php" class="external text" title="http://www.crazymonkeygames.com/download.php" rel="nofollow">listing of sponsored games</a>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Ok, but what we are looking for is reliable third party coverage.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Could be noteworthy, but the sources aren't there to confirm that. Lots of search hits, but the first 10 pages or so of search results are to the site itself, to programmers, or to forum posts. I did find <a href="http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/learning/8129.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/learning/8129.html" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>, in which a library offers it among other teen-oriented sites, so that's an argument toward passing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<dd>Come on now, how did this list help you find some old friends? I find this notion a bit of a stretch. Even if you did find your old friends through a listing such as this article, the content is almost exactly duplicated in the external links given above. And what other uses could this list have other than to show a list of squadrons, of which only a minority our notable? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyluke_155b.html" title="User:Luckyluke">Luke!</a> 01:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The sum of the four pages you reference is less than the one page that you're proposing to delete. This page tells me that there's a squadron (825) in Yellowknife, NWT, which is not listed on any of those four pages. Plus there's the entire central region (Ontario), which doesn't seem to have a convenient page like the four you list. I'd also opine that there are things you can do with a single list like this that you can't do nearly as easily with a list split across five or six pages - like identify gaps in the numbering, identify the highest and lowest numbered squadron, count the total number of squadrons, look at the distribution of squadrons across the country, etc While I agree that the general topic is the RCAC, I feel that this page does provide value, and that it wouldn't be easy to merge it in with the RCAC page. Looking at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sea_Cadet_Corps_in_Canada_f5eb.html" title="List of Sea Cadet Corps in Canada">List of Sea Cadet Corps in Canada</a>, that page was created in July by splitting the info out of the RCSC page.</li>

Lots of kids get scholarships, self-publish books, etc. <b>Delete</b> as nn. I've self published books that get piles of ghits, and have been on the web for 10 years, yet I don't get a Wikipedia article. So a 16 year old kid whose parents help him publish a fancy book shouldn't get a WP article, and friends of the author of the book shouldn't guilt editors into keeping an article on a non-notable author. EVERYONE wants to honor WW2 fighter pilot veterans, but IMHO this object would be better served by work on individual articles on the important fighter pilots rather than keeping an article on a totally swell but non-notable (as an encyclopedia subject) high school kid. I think Andrew Layton himself would agree that the point of encyclopedia articles on the subject of fighter pilots should be to honor notable fighter pilots, not Andrew Layton.

<li>I say <b>Keep</b> it. This kid is impressive. I found plenty of hits about him on dogpile, and a couple more articles that were pretty good. Sure there are lots of high schoolers out there who get scholorships, and maybe a few who publish books, but have you ever heard of a 16-year old getting a special award from the U.S. Congress? I haven't. Andrew is evidently a pioneer in youth volunteerism within the VA, let alone his accomplishments in writing and in filmmaking. He is obviously a rising star who has a great career ahead of him. It's refreshing to see our youth rising up to do positive things like this. If VA and congress have given him so much credit, why shouldn't wikipedia? The kid is an inspiration.walkintheline 10:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: walkintheline (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Walkintheline_ebad.html" title="Special:Contributions/Walkintheline">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li>Last night a friend informed me that she had submitted my name for a biography page on Wikipedia. When I took a look at her nomination, I was flattered by the amount of references and facts that a number of people had taken the time to track down about me. To be honest, I was surprised that a couple of editors had even suggested keeping it. However, I would agree with user Tubezone that I really do not belong in this database. I am grateful to those who left their comments and revisions for the page, but I give it a <b>delete</b> vote unless someone else adamantly thinks it belongs here ofr some reason. Tubezone, you were right when you said that the people who should be getting wikipedia articles are the veterans who have fought and sacrificed for our freedoms here in America and not people like me who got lucky with a couple of scholarships. Sorry for the inconvenience and any confusion that this may have provoked and thanks to everyone for their time. I’m honored even by the consideration. – Andrew Layton. <i>“History is more than just places and dates.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>: I am working on what you asked for. This link takes you to a review of a Boyfriend Robotique show <a href="http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=outabout&amp;article=86" class="external free" title="http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=outabout&amp;article=86" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=outabout&amp;article=86</a> Also, this magazine features a set of images from another show www.psiloveyou-magazine.com So that's two reliable media sources. As for the other problems I have edited the page to include a line as to why they are notable (as per guidelines) and also have referenced the newspaper where I read about their deportation from Canada. I am new to wikipedia so please do forgive my lack of tech-savy. My point is simply that if this is to be an encyclopedia (and not just a high brow version of US Weekly) it really needs input on artists other than those who rotate heavily on MTV. I intend to get better at the technical side of wikipedia and contribute to the community information on the well known and less well known.Roderick P. Bruce 22:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Its a start. I am not changing my vote yet, but more of sources like this might get me to. Being "well known" or "pop culture" has nothing to do with a Wikipedia article. A subject must be notable. Read <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">guidelines on notability</a>. It expressly states that: " a minimum standard for any given topic is that it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, where the source is independent of the topic itself." In several places , you will see that notability is expressly NOT fame. If you want this article kept, continue to provide <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> its notability. YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. Its not much, but you stand a better chance of keeping the article by providing these kinds of reliable sources than by appealing to people's sense of pity or justice, or by implying that wikipedia's only criteria is popularity. It isn't. Its notability. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:56, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>More sources</b> I found a catalogue of images here www.images.ullirichter.com from a German photographer's site (he's a professional not an amateur or fan). Also at <a href="http://www.gayliverpool.com/homotopia.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gayliverpool.com/homotopia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gayliverpool.com/homotopia.htm</a> there is an article about an upcoming show and in the 'Liverpool Echo' (25/10/06) there is a discussion of this show again. There is also a brief article in 'Boyz' (16/03/06) detailing their appearance at a gallery opening in London. I really don't catalogue the amount of press they get but it seems ever with a little research that they're quite prolific.</li>
<li>Change vote to <b>keep</b> I have seen enough. It's getting better. Now that the references have been found, the original article needs to be edited, and the links provided either as inline references, or under the external link section. Reasearch is what this is all about, and it is obvious that research has been done, and evidence of notability has been found. These are honest-to-goodness reviews, and I see that as enough to satisfy <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>.. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 01:29, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
