<p>Originally Speedy deleted <a href="../../../c/s/d/CSD_2af8.html#G11" title="CSD">CSD#G11</a>, this is close enough to the original that it could probably be a <a href="../../../c/s/d/CSD_2af8.html#G4" title="CSD">CSD#G4</a>, but I thought I'd open it up to community review. Ignoring for the moment the fairly clear <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> problems {which could be addressed with editing), I don't see anything that meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The subject has been on a few talkshows, but the "reference" section is vague to say the least; it is unclear if these are trivial mentions about the subject in the referenced publications, or more substantial coverage. Without more specific information (issue numbers, etc) it is hard to even verify this coverage actually exists. I'm not a big fan of the "Search Engine Test", but I found very little in the way of content that suggests this person meets any of our notability guidelines. In the end, there simply is not enough evidence of notability here. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:39, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The fact that an article has been edited by its subject is not, by itself, grounds for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although the article may need work I have know the author for many years and can personally attest to much of what is written herein. It must be noted that much of what is attested to is documented and can be referenced with a bit more work.-Guy <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Big Zeets (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Big_Zeets_51ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Big Zeets">contribs</a>) 02:17, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</small> <small>— Big Zeets (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Big_Zeets_2906.html" title="Special:Contributions/Big Zeets">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I can also personally verify these events and think there is value in this material and should therefor be kept. The work to put this documentation in proper form must be done, but it shouldn't be confused with the fact that it is documentable and worthy of inclusion. I see citations to books, down to the page and many references, some which need to be cleaned up. At this point I fail to understnd why this is still beiing consudered for deletion. She obviously has been covered by newspapers and appeared as a reference in quite a few books. She has been on multiple television shows and was responsible for a movie that is used at many universities.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else than possible objection to the subject matter (which in itself should not be the criteria for deletion) is there for deletion? I think this passes under <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> <i>"Published works" is broad, and encompasses published works in all forms, and various media.3</i> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <i>A person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent,6 and independent of the subject.</i> These are both covered by the reference on the page - <i><b>Claudia Varren's book; "Rituals and Pracitces" insparation &amp; research provided to Ms Varren by by Goddess Rosemary, (p. 223 - 242)</b></i> and <i><b>Daily News New York Live, Aug. 23 1992 Fangs for the Memories By Sheila Anne Fenney</b></i> - Darkeraven 13:19, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The trouble is that almost all of those "sources" are no good, and almost all of them refer to Wikipedia articles. Just as an example, a short film in which she appeared has three links, one of them passworded, one to the Wikipedia article of the score's composer, and one to <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_festivals.html" title="Film festivals">Film festivals</a>, presumably on the strength that the film supposedly was featured in several; the subject isn't herself mentioned in any, even trivially. A bit more digging turns up something startling; for someone presumably so prominent in the visual arts, a Google image search turns up just 15 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/images?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;output=images&amp;svnum=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Goddess+Rosemary&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;imgsz=&amp;as_filetype=&amp;imgc=&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=off" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/images?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;output=images&amp;svnum=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Goddess+Rosemary&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;imgsz=&amp;as_filetype=&amp;imgc=&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=off" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, five of which are from a Myspace site and seven from Z-grade porn vid covers, an aspect to the subject's career not mentioned in the article. One wonders also why the subject's real name (Rosemary Delain) doesn't appear in the article. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:18, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I dont know what a "z" grade video is but you have materials pointing out women in xxx rated films when as an artist I have never done any hard core porn in my life I find this rather rude to say. now I wanted to help in this project not just on this page that I thought was a simple addition, but I have a lot of information I thought would be of use to the greater project as a whole however this is not really at all the way I thought it would be. I could have signed in as "joe" and filled this out however I did not as I wanted to work on other pages here but now Im not even sure that I want this page here at all. Why would this be listed as Goddess Rosemary, well for 20 years that is what everyone called me and that is what they would look for in a search that is the fan base and I would think thus being so that is how it should be listed as that is what was used for so many years. This is a history as none of it goes on today however I thought that the many people who followed the art would be interested, however mostly I wanted to participate in your project as a whole, truely Im not sure I even want this on here at all at this point. There are also many here listed under stage names and such. Given time, re references no good, as I was not to fill it in myself a point I had not noted as this is the first time using this site, the dates of the film festivals would have been filled in, as well as the other works participated in, however there was some problem with me giving you this requested information. If you read the pocket book version of piercing the darkness by Katherine Ramsland the whole additonal last chapter is about her meeting with me. I am an artist with lots of time on my hands now and really thought that I could add some great information to this site in a wide number of areas. I hope that can still be so as I think this is a terrific project. I only created fetish and erotica I did not make porn films I do not think my art is porn I think that it is a sort of middle ground. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Beatty" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Beatty" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Beatty</a> here is a reference to my film on another page with my partner who I created this film with. Rosemary delain film festivals try that in a google search to see film fest. info your looking for to add if someone would like to do that. GR</p>

<p>That is fine then delete it. If someone else would like to write about me that is fine when I put this up I did not know that being honest and putting my name would be a conflict obviously others have read more then I did and created a dummy name to put their articles up here and I wanted to as I stated partcipate in the broader scale of this site so I was honest in the name I put for my name how many others are here under another name and have put them up here and we would never know it I think that the merit of my material and work should be looked at and if someone else would like to write about my 20 years of artistic body of work then I would be glad to answer and provide any information to them.</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Goddess Rosemary is a key member of the Strigoi Vii philosophy followed by thousands WORLD wide. --Levarius 18:48, 25 March 2007 (EST)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
In addition to all of the following verifiable references, it should be noted that Goddess Rosemary's true call to notariety is achieved through her influence &amp; nurturing of the Strigoi Vii philosophy &amp; lifestyle. She is the founder of House Sahjaza (www.Sahjaza.com) one of the original households of the Strigoi Vii. Father Sebastiaan, whom publishes a majority of the literature in relation to Strigoi Vii philosophy, was himself a student greatly inspired by Rosemary. She was involved in the Theatre of the Vampyres &amp; Mother in New York City, as well as several other Strigoi Vii events around the world. She has been a part of the movement for 2 decades and is now a mythic figure in their stories. Many people hear amazing tales of the Goddess Rosemary, never fully realising she is in fact factual. It was much the same with myself until I decided to research the legendary woman who means SO MUCH to the Strigoi Vii. What follows is my own collection of resources in regards to this amazing woman, Rosemary, the Strigoi Vii Goddess.</p>
<p>The movie, "The Elegant Spanking" can be found listed in the IMDB Movie Database at the following link. It has even been seen &amp; discussed/rated by othershere. Quote -"The Elegant Spanking has a near classic silent-era feel, with Rosemary Delain and Beatty portraying Mistress and Maid Kitty respectively in a 'post-modern romantic subversion' that feels like a scene from a lost Anais Nin story. Buoyed by John Zorn's exquisitely fractured score, Delain and Beatty glide through their role-play smoothly and [yes] elegantly, most notably during their take on water sport, so tender and intimate that it reveals the true nature of the women's dynamic. What Delain and Beatty exchange is stronger than Power…it's something that will linger long after the lovers have parted" <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305522/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305522/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305522/</a> It can also be purchased by Playboy's catalogue "Playboy Catalog Holiday Season 1996 page 57 The Elegant Spanking Directed by Goddess Rosemary 1995" How many of you here are qualified to judge what film is worthy of notariety? Not many I assume.</p>
<p>She was also in the following film by MM Serra, which can be found at <a href="http://www.mmserra.com/frameset2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mmserra.com/frameset2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mmserra.com/frameset2.html</a> Soi Meme (1995), Sound composition by Zeena Parkins. Erotic dance performance by Goddess Rosemary.</p>

<p>For what it's worth I have been a follower of Goddess Rosemary for some time and I advocate keeping her entry in Wikipedia. Her creation of The Elegant Spanking alone is enough to warrant her inclusion in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Goddess Rosemary is a New York City based fetish model, actress and filmmaker. An erotic dancer and avant-garde performance artist, she attained cult figure status within the NYC underground of the eighties and mid-nineties. Legendary throughout the fetish club scene her appearances at NYC's Vampyre Theater were especially renown. A female supremacist and a strong proponent of women wielding their erotic power she emerged in the 80's as the archetype of the lifestyle dominatrix. Clearly an original, she was perhaps the first to proclaim herself a Goddess and her erotic exploits and career provided the prototype for the wave of female dominants to emerge in the early 21st century.</p>
<p><br />
She is the founder of the Z/n Society, a group of female artists, witches, and sirens who met or meet monthly to conduct what she called the Full Moon Goddess Worship Ritual.</p>
<p>She also established New York's first Sahjava,a Vampyric Witch coven devoted to the exploration and practice of ancient pagan rites and culture. Her disciples are encouraged to experience spirituality in dramatically new ways. Her teachings, not unlike those of Joseph Campbell, draw heavily upon the power and wisdom found in ancient myth.</p>
<p>Although she has appeared in more than 20 films she is best known for starring in her erotic masterpiece "The Elegant Spanking" (1995), which she also choreographed and directed.</p>
<p>Considered a cult classic within the S&amp;M community, the film is an exquisitely stark depiction of the sadomasochistic interplay between an imperious Mistress (Rosemary) and her worshipful supplicant maid. A cinematic testament to the power of sexual fetish and ritual, the film is the subject of study at film schools and universities around the world.</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> It looks to me like like there are more than enough sources and sufficient notability to construct an article here. Let's give our editors a chance to work on it a while.</s><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC) I have done some research online. The easiest to verify connection is with <i>The Elegant Spanking</i>, which does indeed seem to have some minor notability as a piece of art erotica. However, appearing in two pieces of art erotica does not make a film career, imho. (The article says she was the director; she was in fact the co-director, and her collaborator is in fact much more of a filmmaker than Ms. Dulain.) Her connection with Strigoi Vii, while probably genuine, seems problematic to verify due to the lack of third party sources, at least online. Other claims seem similarly difficult to document. Given this, at least until some better online sources turn up, or a reliable third party editor with access to some of the print sources, I am down to a <b>Weak Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:37, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right. Here's a portion of the first paragraph: <i>Many people hear amazing tales of the Goddess Rosemary, never fully realising she is in fact factual. It was much the same with myself until I decided to research the legendary woman who means SO MUCH to the Strigoi Vii. What follows is my own collection of resources in regards to this amazing woman, Rosemary, the Goddess.</i> Strigoi Vii being a "Vampire House" that's being plugged here by the same folks that made this article and are involved with this group. This is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/_/WP%7EAD_5bbf.html" title="WP:AD">advertising</a> and a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> in the worst way.

<li>Quite. The long laundry list of (unproven) photo credits recently appended to the article doesn't prove a whole heck of a lot. No doubt any local lingerie model could cite herself a hundred times over in the local newspapers and TV ads, but that doesn't equate to non-trivial mentions in reliable, published sources. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, And Strigoi Vii is a religious philosophy of thousands of people in the earth. If she was christian, and it spoke of her being a revered member of the catholic arch diocese would that still be advertisement? You smell advertisement, I smell censorship. This is quite ridiculous as there is a large number of people whom would be interested in reading more about the Strigoi Vii, and notable figures within the philosophy. The group and it's follower's do not make money off of it's teachings, so what exactly that would be advertising is beyond me. Levarius 15:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's rich. There is no proof provided of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of this "Vampire House". It claims to be a religious philosophy with "thousands of members". Hunting clubs can claim "thosands of members" but that doesn't make them notable esp when no proof is offered. Don't try and compare this New Age chic noir club to Chrsitanity, it makes you look foolish esp when right after you accuse us of deleting this garbage because just we "don't like it" and want to "censore" you. Take your proselytizing and advertisment elsewhere. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 18:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You should visit the Strigoi Vii's online temple, it is a free service to all Strigoi Vii world wide where they can share their lessons &amp; experiences. Yes, FREE so this is not an advertisement plug. But visiting the site you can verify the activity and discussions taking place amongst its members. Calling anyone's religious beliefs a "New Age chic noir club" is pathetic. No offense. Who are you to judge precisely? Levarius 20:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
