<li><b>Delete</b> Weatherman90, you beat me to AfDing this by a second or so. No reliable sources for this. The only source given is the website for this event. I'm still concerned of possible copyright violations of <a href="http://climbavolcano.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://climbavolcano.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for this...but there's no copyright information on the website. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 03:58, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I was suspicious of this before, and now even more suspicious considering a different username just showed up making another copy of the article: Climb A Volcano. Seems like a scam/hoax to me. And also since I just now checked and found the creator of THIS one tried removing the afd tag twice. -<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarthogDemon_a18b.html" title="User:WarthogDemon">WarthogDemon</a> 16:58, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>UnDelete</b> While the wisdom of having a junior high child edit escapes me, the changes have been made by a several supporters who care about this organization. It is a factual page and unlike someone obsessed with Barry Manilow it actually makes the world a better place. If you two have nothing better to do than harass six-year old children - how sad for you. Otherwise you should contact the attorney whose name appeard on the web site in several places.</li>

<li><b>UnDelete</b> I just read the policy for deletion and this article clearly does not qualify. There is no copyright issue, nor is this a vanity article. Unless you have some evidence that this is illegal, this page will remain. For newer users of wiki there are a number of rues and procedures we are still learning - in turn there are a number of overzealous edits being made in the name of juking stats to claim more edits not good edits. The educational outreach of this program is slated to reach a large number of students and adults - more than 1 million so before you guess a post is suspicious do some basic research.

<li><b>Comment</b> how about one of the top 3 content policies of Wikipedia, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>? Is this verifiable? No, it doesn't appear so.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is contact info at the web site for an attorney and I will provide you with contact info at the Global Fund if you email me with a private email address, but the contact info at TGF should not be part of a public record or they would be inundated with junk. Common sense will tell you if a California bar approved attorney is listed with his business contact data that this is for real. Attorney's don't risk their bar status on scams. <s>Musicbiz 10:00, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</s><small>This comment was posted by user 24.54.227.131</small>

<li><b>UnDelete</b>I am a marketing executive working with sponsored charities including Children's Miracle Network (cmn.org) and I am familiar with this forthcoming event tied in with The Global Fund. It is legitimate and I suggest any concerns be raised with the chief counsel for this charitable venture, Arnold Goldstein. If you would like to boardmail me your personal phone number I would be happy to contact you directly and address any of your concerns about this international charity event. Regards,Todd Erickson toer13</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Three votes opposed to deletion, all using the somewhat odd term "UnDelete" in lieu of the more conventional "Keep", and two of which only have edits to this page and the subject article, all of which were made within the last 24 hours. Interesting. <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> 22:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah, I sent an email out to a couple of people like Todd and told them to use that term, because I didn't know to write "Keep." <s>Musicbiz 10:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</s> <small>This comment was posted by user 24.54.227.131</small>

<li>So, you wrote to two people who - judging from their contribution histories - then came here for the sole purpose of voting against deletion of this article. So you are admitting that they were single-purpose accounts? <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> 18:58, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable, non-verifiable.

<li><b>Delete</b> A clear hoax; contains factual inaccuracies, perhaps only apparent if you have climbed Kilimanjaro. Particularly, if you develop hypoxic pulmonary edema (oedema in the UK) oxygen will not help. You MUST descend.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 22:17, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> THis is my bad, the writing is unclear here. What shoudl have been written is that in children, HAPE is difficult to diagnose properly and it often shares symptoms with less serious ailments. Oxygen will often alliviate the symptoms allowing a correct diagnosis, and a continuation of the climb if it is simple an altitude headache. With HAPE you must descend, again my bad, but hardly a "clear hoax," at worst a lazy mistake. <s>Musicbiz 10:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</s><small>This comment was posted by user 24.54.227.131</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and the above.

<li><b>Comment</b> THis is a new event, prior to going online with any information, The Fund had to "sign off" on the event. So you are not quite correct on their reach. <s>Musicbiz 10:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</s> <small>This comment was posted by user 24.54.227.131</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, not to toot my own horn, but I have spent the last couple of years working with the Fund in various ways and so have a fairly good idea of its scope, scale, and methodology. What is the associated 501(c)3 non-profit that is performing oversight on this project? The logistics of getting a U.S.-based tot (and may we presume that the doe-eyed child photoshopped onto the elephants on the site is in fact the putative climber?) up Kilimanjaro must significant, and that overhead could easily eat up the funds raised via PayPal... <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 20:22, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>delete</b> - I don't know whether this is a hoax or not, but then that's why articles need to be able to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which this article fails to do. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 18:05, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> THis is a legitimate observation. Once The Fund links to "Climb" from their web site, which should occure in the next few weeks, I will have someone repost. Once that occurs, I do hope that those of you that are so convinced that this is hoax will do a little "make good." After all it is easy to tear down and any mistakes that have been made as it goes are mine, and the supporters I reached out to, and not those of The Fund or the boy. This thing is new and sometimes you learn as you go. So delete away. <s>Musicbiz 10:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</s> <small>This comment was posted by user 24.54.227.131</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, per nonverifiability, and per the fact that the article has next to no content about its subject; it's all about routes up <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Kilimanjaro_7d9e.html" title="Mount Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosquito.html" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a>, and the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Fund_7a6b.html" title="Global Fund">Global Fund</a>, all of which have perfectly suitable articles of their own. The proper place for this information is a sentence in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_climbers.html" title="List of climbers">List of climbers</a>, but only <i>after</i> the child in question has actually finished the climb (or died in the process). --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 18:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> When I sent out an email to a few people, I had no way of knowing if they had wiki accounts or not, if that violates some rule, my apologies. It's clear that no amount of facts or explinations will satisfy many of you. I understand it is the poster's hurdle to verify and obviously I should have waited a few weeks, and undoubtedly I should have written more about the educational outreach - live and learn. <s>Musicbiz 17:15, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</s> <small>This comment was posted by user 24.54.227.131</small></li>
