<p>This article is unreferenced, and has been so since references were requested seven months ago. I have not been able to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable references</a> (following an admittedly cursory look, as I wasn't enjoying going through the material), and seems to be comprised almost exclusively of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The topic may also be a neologism. Please do not make accusations of cultural bias. Futanari is a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> neologism based upon the Japanese words for 'double' and 'form'. If we had an article entitled an English cultural phenomenon 'doubleform' about pictures of nude women with penises, were utterly unable to provide any references for any of the claims, and the article's sole link was to www.doubleform.com, this would have been deleted within a week of creation.

<dd>So because it's a fairly unusual pastime, we don't have to have reliable sources?

If the word has an established meaning, great - write a wiktionary article on it. Find reliable sources about the topic.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is fairly common in anime, common enough to warrant an article. I'd say this is a lack of sourcing and not a lack of available sourcing.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have about 30 gigs of futanari related doujins. This is a very real phenomenon even if people don't speak of it much. I guess it's just not as controversial as lolicon. But Shonen-ai and shotacon are also unreferenced and no one's suggesting those be deleted.

Sample quote: "It is in this context that futanari were included in Yamai no Soshi [Book of the disease],36 and futanarihira, androgynous stunners, were considered beautiful wakashu. Differently put, in this paradigm futanari falls into the category of disease, along with anal fistulas, pyorrhea, lice, and so forth, whereas futanarihira amounts to a certain aesthetic." 69.174.66.47 04:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Strange Fates. Sex, Gender, and Sexuality in Torikaebaya Monogatari, Gregory M. Pflugfelder, Monumenta Nipponica Vol. 47, No. 3 (Autumn, 1992), pp. 347-368.</i> On page 359: "Ambiguous bodies surface in the native literature at least as early as the twelfth certury. Yamai no Soshi, an illustrated catalogue of rare afflictions dating from that ero, provides an interesting example. 'Recently there was a man [otoko] who walked the streets of the capital with a drum hung round his neck. He had the face of a male [otoko], but there were things about his form that resembled a female [onna] as well. A certain person was confused [obotsukanagarite] by this. One night when the drummer was asleep, he secretly lifted his robes to have a look. Underneath, he saw both male and female genitals [literally, roots]. This was a hermaphrodite [futanari].'" Futanari seems to have meant "hermaphrodite" then as early as the 12th century. I found more examples for androgyny in Japanese culture as someone pointed out above but I couldn't nail down the word "futanari" to these references. 69.174.66.47 20:15, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

The fact that I don't speak so much as a word of Japanese is conspiring with the reality that there really are topics I've enjoyed sourcing more than this one to make it a challenge for me, too. I'll fully admit that the places I found this discussed aren't ... erm, reliable, so I've got <i>no way</i> to navigate that all-Japanese site to get information (if its the right one...). Back into the fray I go, I suppose. Still no idea where on their site to find detailed material (if that's the production studio and not the distributor, even!), but the series is evidently marketed in English as "Futanari Lesbians" ... 1, 2, and 3 (because porn studios have creative naming conventions).

Here's the link <a href="http://www.jlist.com/SEARCHES/futanari/" class="external free" title="http://www.jlist.com/SEARCHES/futanari/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jlist.com/SEARCHES/futanari/</a> If this is not appropriate or useful, please feel free to delete. 89.242.93.69 21:42, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although this sort of hentai art isn't my fetish, this concept is prevelant in h-art. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 00:19, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Because some people either don't like material or fail at google does not mean it doesn't exist. The fastest way would be to go to live journal or go to one of the 'chan's alternative page(4chan, ko-chan, etc). If you have average IQ there are tons of Japanese sites you can browse(just need to press enter and find the relevant sub-page, not hard). For the sake of it all I'll list some of the artists: Behind Moon, Rebis, Agent Orange R, Dusty Heaven, Tiberius - the list goes on. Destorss</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> How can one even think about deleting this page, everything said is valid and true. Any number of comic websites such as Jlist and DLsite has direct links to it. Google has over 210,000 hits on the subject. It's true so why delet it??</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article is of extremely poor quality, but doesn't meet criteria for deletion. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 12:01, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article is in definite need of cleanup, and maybe even a rewrite, but by no means should it be deleted. If numerous artists and/or author can make a living off of it, animated adult video can be made of it, and multiple imageboards can exist of it, that's definitely worth keeping. I would like to see the article fixed up after this discussion is over, however. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 11:58, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can see that it's not well cited, but that's just a cry for people to help advance it, really. It's hard to site anything in this genre, though, as the content is very adult and in a sense animalistic, meaning that it's not normally something to have any structured sentences or thoughts or rationale behind it. I personally believe that the commercialism surrounding the word provided in this discussion is definitely enough to substantiate the fact that it's a legitamate term, as for the content of the article itself, the most plausable way to back them up is with imagery. That being said, you can really see that every word is true just by looking through the pictures yourself. If you have an inability to do that (ex. being grossed out) you do not have the right to call deletion on this article, as you do not have the means to judge it. Wa 12:09, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Some artists include Agent Orange, Purple Bonus, DTiberius. Agent Orange, and Purple Bonus can be found using the "Return results only in japanese" after searching on google. DTiberius can be found at WWOEC. www.affairanime.com has an entire gallery devoted to Futanari. I'm not sure if these count as sources, but they are *definite* proof that this article just needs to be rewritten and not deleted. Maybe these websites can be used in a rewrite?

<li><b>Keep</b> Found a specialised book on amazon about homosexuality in japan which refers to futanari <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Male-Colors-Construction-Homosexuality-Tokugawa/dp/0520209001/sr=8-3/qid=1168803771/ref=sr_1_3/104-8645081-9512703?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Male-Colors-Construction-Homosexuality-Tokugawa/dp/0520209001/sr=8-3/qid=1168803771/ref=sr_1_3/104-8645081-9512703?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, You can use the "Search Inside" function. --Simon ---80.143.231.60 19:48, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is lots of evidence of this paraphilia and is very common. I see no reason for it to be deleted just because there is no referncing to it. Instead of being lazy, why didn't you just refernce it yourself instead?

<li><b>Keep</b> I find it remarkable that the OP recommending deletion cites a lack of research, then proceeds to call the term both a "<a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a>" and "<a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>." I'm not about to attack the OP for not checking Japanese sources, or for a lack of knowledge of Japanese grammar or etymology, but I believe this article shouldn't even have been recommended for deletion for the OP's complaints without first checking with a person who actually has passing literacy in Japanese.</li>
