<p>Invalid speedy. But this is a minor web site. Article seems to be made to promote it. Fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in current form. So, while opposing speedy, I support deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:21, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Response:</p>
<p>Although the article found by searching 'worwis' is in reference to a blog, it's deletion will not in any way benefit the primary aim of WikipediA.</p>
<p>As mentioned is the article, the sole aim of the blog is to benefit humanity, "whatever culture, race or religion".</p>
<p>I don't think it's a valid point if it's a "minor" website or not. It has a unique purpose and it's contents is different to that of any other article on Wikipedia. The level of uniqueness is such that it should be taken note of and assured it's small space on Wikipedia, as oppose to bieng deleted.</p>

<p>Kukini, what do you mean by "per nom", and also by this "unless updated to respond to WP:WEB issue"?</p>
<p>Thankyou</p>
<p>StriveR</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi StriveR. "per nom" just means he agrees with the nominator's reasoning for deletion (e.g. me). <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a guideline for inclusion, which you need to read. Basically, what you need is to identify a number of reliable sources, who have written in depth, about the web site. You need to show that more people, then you, and the users, are interested in it. We need information about the site, that doesn't come from the site. Most web sites, don't meeet this requirement, and can't be listed on Wikipedia. It's probably best to use other places, besides Wikipedia, to list your web site. We don't include web sites based on how good they are. We write about web sites that are widely deemed "notable", which few are. Probably a tiny fraction of a percent of all web sites, could every be listed on Wikipedia. So, while you could try improving the article, there's no guarentee you're work wouldn't be lost. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:28, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Thanks for help Thivierr and Kukini. I doubt many people have written their interest in depth or the like, but for me 26 google hits is quite high&#160;:-P. Anyway, please visit the site yourselves so that you may benefit atleast.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
<p>StriveR</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> StriveR, 26 hits is pretty far from high. The site doesn't appear to have much traffic and the article doesn't outline any level of notability. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 21:34, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>Hello IrishGuy</p>
<p>I say 26 hits is high because I expected one if any. The people here may delete the article, but hopefully you can benefit from the website. All I wanted to do was to spread it and benefit people, but anyway hopefully different chances to come if this website isn't going to be much help.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable enough. Deletion doesm't mean it isn't a good idea, just that it hasn't achieved enough attention to merit a place in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkestone_e60a.html" title="User:Hawkestone">Hawkestone</a> 01:13, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Where on Wikiepdia does it say you should use Wikiepdia to advertise your company, striver?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>How can it be "the sum of human knowledge" if you don't let people contribute such things? The blog itself was made for the sole aim to benefit as many as possible, so whats wrong with providing information about it's roots and the like?</p>
<p>Earlier today I ate a bowl of cereal. It was corn Chex. Up until me writing this...I was the only person in existence with this knowledge. Should that have an article as well? You know, for the "sum of human knowledge"? Not everything can, or should, be included in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 16:49, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>No, what you did shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. Thats because it has no aim to benefit people and is of no benefit anyway. The worwis blog however has hand-picked sayings of the widely known early leaders of Islam - but religious material has been filtered by myself so only the sayings which all can benefit from have a place on the blog. Take this for example: Imam Ali [AS] said: "Silence is the best reply to a fool." and "Be like the flower that gives its fragrance even to the hand that crushes it". Now I think thats worth a space on Wikiepdia.</p>
<p>Whoever deletes the article will put theirselves and others at loss from these beautiful sayings. Why don't you visit it now, because the point is that people like you benefit? br</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I hate to break it to you, but a website filled with quotes that has very little traffic just plain isn't notable. Your aims with your site are completely beside the point. There are very notable sites that have no desire to educate or enrich people...but they are still notable. Your site isn't. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 16:59, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>By the sites rules it isn't notable but I think it should because of it's contents [but that's not the point here anyway]. I would of thought a different type of article would be nice to widen the and enrich the variety availible. But it is good, even if it is not set out and designed well, because it is purely words of wisdom. Anyone here can just go to it, be it only two or three people of whatever amount so you can be at an advantage, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Just take about three minutes browsing and reading abit Irishguy; I recommend you scroll down and read abit on the sixth blog down on the homepage [spaces.msn.com/worwis]. I'd just like to know what you think and your opinions if you don't mind.</p>
