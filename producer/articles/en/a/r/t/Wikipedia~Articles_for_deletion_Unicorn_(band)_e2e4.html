<li>In the very comment that you are replying to xe pointed to an AllMusic entry that said outright that this band was a put-on, created by Hilary Clay Hicks. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:09, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is interesting that you should mention the album being for sale on Amazon. There's a review of the album <i>Cosmic Storyteller</i> on its Amazon page by one very dissatisfied customer who was apparently looking for an album by a <i>real</i> band named Unicorn, from the 1970s. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, I've had a listen to it and it doesn't sound like it was made in the 60s though that's by no means water-tight. If this is a hoax then maybe it should be judged as to whether it's a notable hoax. Given that it's available to buy, I would suggest that it is. This is certainly a fascinating subject and I am going to try and find out more. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 19:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm trying to figure this out and I'm still confused. The album appears to not be by the band Unicorn but by a woman named Hilary Clay Hicks and is sort of a hoax in the vein of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platinum_Weird_e7c0.html" title="Platinum Weird">Platinum Weird</a>. The album exists, and can be bought -- it just isn't a "lost" recording. But did the band really exist at some point and she just took their story? Or is the whole thing a hoax? <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 19:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There was <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:idjw7i2jg75r~T1" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:idjw7i2jg75r~T1" rel="nofollow">an unrelated band with the same name</a> in the seventies, as Uncel G already mentioned above. I'd guess this one is completely made up. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">Fritz Saalfeld</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFritz_Saalfeld_515f.html" title="User talk:Fritz Saalfeld">Talk</a>) 19:30, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There was a real band in the 70's called Unicorn who had <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Gilmour_e9c5.html" title="Dave Gilmour">Dave Gilmour</a> produce one of their albums see <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:2nklu3e5an5k~T1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:2nklu3e5an5k~T1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It also lists this band with Cosmic Storyteller listed as their sole album see <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hz6gtrarkl2x~T2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hz6gtrarkl2x~T2" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It doesn't have any text for the band but the album review states "Lost artifact of the psychedelic era? Pseudo-Spinal Tap put on? Modernist pop/psychedelia? The Cosmic Storyteller is all of these things. The brainchild of singer/producer/singer Hilary Clay Hicks, these tracks attributed to Unicorn make up a "lost" 1960s album that embraces several different musical genres, and does so with a classy sense of spirit and style." Please note that this All Music Guide tells a different story to the article. We don't have an article on Ms Hicks and nor does All Music Guide. In conclusion, I would support keeping an article on the 70s group as they clearly meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. An article on this group is marginal although we would have to make sure it was verifiable and it would need significant changes. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 20:11, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's problematic, isn't it? On the one hand we have AllMusic saying that this band is a complete invention from whole cloth, and Amazon reviewers (and Wikipedia editors) saying that this album certainly doesn't <i>sound</i> as if it were a product of the 1960s. On the other hand, we have <a href="http://www.cosmicstoryteller.com" class="external text" title="http://www.cosmicstoryteller.com" rel="nofollow">the web site for the album</a>, and the album's own blurb, neither of which are independent of the album's creator(s), giving this giant history of a band whose music was supposedly "lost" for 34 years. Then, in order to muddy the issue even further, we have <a href="http://www.popdirt.com/article50326.html" class="external text" title="http://www.popdirt.com/article50326.html" rel="nofollow">people accusing Platinum Weird of stealing the story of Unicorn</a>, and a completely separate <i>real</i> band named Unicorn. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:31, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
