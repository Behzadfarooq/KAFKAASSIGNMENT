<li><b>Comment</b> the real reason notability is used as a criteria, is to stop advertising bloat. It's hard to maintain NPOV when 10000 different articles are created by someone with a personal stake in it, and not very many people are familiar enough with the subject to maintain an NPOV structure to it. In the end, it would undermine wikipedia by going for the throat(credibility) <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 17:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Remote Access As a whole was the BBS package to run in the 90's as well if you look at the links on the BBS page it is listed there. It was the main runner in the 90's and I think this page will grow with time. Although I have been the one of the ones changing it I would like it to stay. I still run a bbs so I am biased, but in time this page will be like everything else on Wikipedia. IMHO this is the first Draft and will grow with time when old sysops look up there software. You know they are still out there. And this page is accurate. Vagabond

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm not sure why delete this entry would even be in question. RemoteAccess was one the most important pieces of software to hit the streets. It, with other BBS software, with their compliment of applications, forged the path to the commercial internet as we know it now. Omitting it from the Wikipedia would be like removing the civil war from US history books. If you aren't familiar with the subject matter, it doesn't necessarily make it insignificant nor not noteworthy.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not like it how people with more time on their hands than others can participate in ugly acts on wikipedia. Whether it be the structured anarchy of 'deletionists' who feel that anything they do no know about does not exist, and should not belong on wikipedia, or people that do outright vandalism. Remote Access is an award winning software. Hide behind as many policies as you want [even unimplemented ones], it doesn't change a fact that BBS softwares played an important part in the history of computing, and the internet. <a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMroblivious1bmf_6e38.html" title="User:Mroblivious1bmf">Mroblivious1bmf</a> 04:49, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This whole thing strikes of "Well, we don't know about it, so it needs to be deleted because you can't prove it exists". As was said by others, it was good solid BBS software for a long time. It's hard to find stuff on it, because most of the records aren't likely easily available. I never used the stuff personally, it just strikes me as a totally unncessary deletion, and yea, I agree with the remark about "hiding behind policy".

<li><b>Question</b> What about this article have we not verified. It merely states the software exists. What more do you want? Open the archive and read the WHATSNEW.TXT for more then that. Were you some WWIV BBS fan or something? Seems this is a personal battle for you. It's just an entry in the Wikipedia, that will probably only be viewed by those that know what a BBS is anyway.

<p>What do you want? All we've heard is 'cite' this, and several links to wikipedia policies. We've cited. we've given websites, and documentaries that you can view for free. Honestly, what more do you want?<br />
I would really like to come to a consensus with this. The people involved with bbsing were notified, and they have spoken. I don't want this to develop into some wikipedia ego war. It's obvious that having this article considered for deletion was a mistake.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the person who submitted the RemoteAccess artical to Wikipedia, and I admit I am am a noob to submitting articals here. The initial issue I had was Wikipedia said that the artical needed to be "Wiki'fied", so I asked for some assistance in a #BBS IRC channel, and Dopefish was kind enough to jump in and help out. Then we ran into the issue that someone had requested for it to be deleted, and it was discussed by several people on IRC, but it was certainly not my intent to turn this into a war. As I understand it, the real issue is that the software is considered "Notible" unless media (newspaper, magizine) sources are cited. This is difficult since RemoteAccess was popular before the world wide web explosion. Andrew (and most RA sysops) lost intrest in it by 1996. There was only one popular media-publication for BBS software that I know of, which was a magizine called Boardwatch. While Boardwatch did contain frequent articals on RemoteAccess, these articals would be difficult to locate because Boardwatch no longer exists. Incidently Andrew Milner was on the cover page of the January 1995 issue, standing next to his Jaguar. You can see a thumb sized image of it here: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991116131747/boardwatch.internet.com/mag/online95.html" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19991116131747/boardwatch.internet.com/mag/online95.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/19991116131747/boardwatch.internet.com/mag/online95.html</a> Unfortunatly Boardwatch did not post the older issues from 1990-1994 on their web site, and even the later issues from 1995-2000 are not well archived by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archive_a5d5.html" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a> so most articals are lost. I think the best proof that RA existed, and its popularity can be cited by the large number of third-party utilities that were written for it. I have started adding links to RA specific files, and other links to prove not only that RA existed, but it was indeed very popular in its day. I will continue to search for more proof, but my concern is that someone will delete it before enough sources have been cited. Incidently, I have no commercial intrest in RemoteAccess. I was a RA beta tester since the early years, and I was also a North American RA Support Site. <a href="../../../p/c/m/User%7EPcmicro_f547.html" title="User:Pcmicro">User:pcmicro</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Guys, I understand your thoughts on this subject and how you can view it as popular, but the fact remains that Wiki does have policies and guidelines in place. If you could find old magazines, books or some form of hard copy at least that can back up your claims then this would be accepted by the wiki policies. The simpsons characters have pages because they meet all the standards. The claims are verifiable, not original research and presented in a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClintJCL_f2a6.html" title="User:ClintJCL">User:ClintJCL</a> I will remind you to remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and stop making <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">Personal Attacks</a>. You are making general statements about people whom you do not know. <a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">User:Myleslong</a>, I remember the BBS days and was using them on a 286 (with 640k of RAM and a 2400baud modem) long before the internet was around. I remember this software, and using it before being introduced to Gopher, Telnet, and finally the Internet. However, unless wiki's policies can be meet, the article can not be kept. This AFD is not about how many people raise their hands and say 'I remember the software, so let's keep the article' as the Admin who will make the call on keep or delete does not take those comments into concideration. Mainly what they look at is the arguments made and if the article passes all of wiki's standards. Also, it's not anyone's job to have to race all over wiki making AFD's. Instead of making personal attacks, contribute. Nominate those articles yourself if it bothers you so. Don't expect that it's someone else's job. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 02:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b><a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMroblivious1bmf_6e38.html" title="User:Mroblivious1bmf">Mroblivious1bmf</a>, I'm not taking this personally, nor am I engaging in personal banter. Someone is accusing people who this this article is worth deleting as being too young to know about the subject. I provided information disproving that. Also, note that the Articles for Deletion process is designed to get community input. Your views are not being heedlessly dismissed. Also remember that voting here is done by consensus, meaning that a majority is not enough to delete. If the article has merit as it stands, it will remain. Mr Obvious, how are we supposed to write a useful encyclopedia if we don't have a set of standards that govern what we will allow ourselves to publish? How are we supposed to verify that your, my, or anyone's submissions are accurate, for example, if this software has never been covered in the press? I hope you'll read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and understand why we have these debates. I assure you that nobody here has anything against you or this software personally - it's just that many, many people try to use Wikipedia to publish announcements, opinionated statements, or unverifiable information. It's nothing personal - these articles just do not meet Wikipedia's standards. A word of caution: in the true Wikipedia spirit, voters/commenters should try to judge the merits of the article itself in the light of the rules (see <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>)--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 20:32, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I understand the need for references, citations, etc, and why this is a big deal for Wikipedia. But couldn't we simply remove this article from AfD and instead put in a tag saying that citations are needed? I think that by now, even without "proper" citations, there should be little doubt that the software was actually notable. --<a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECotoco_32b8.html" title="User:Cotoco">Cotoco</a> 02:49, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> while a nice thought, the problem is the AfD process is almost over at this point. The 'citations' tag really is used to give the authors a chance to cite their sources before the Prod and then AfD is assigned. If it is notable, then there should be newspaper, magazine or books mentioning it. If so, then people should cite them. If people feel so strongly about a keep, then obey the process and wiki standards/guidelines, and do research and cite sources. The burden of proof is on the article writers to provide evidence that the article shouldn't be deleted...not visa versa. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<font color="blue"><font color="red">:: The RemoteAccess(ra) Scene

Where did the RemoteAccess scene go? this famous and in many eye's
infamous BBS-software. In early 1994 when the first Betas of RA was
realeased many sysops looked there eye's up and saw this BBS-software,
this software who was too easy to configurare that people never used
more than a few weeks to mod it and it was ready. A lot of PCB sysops
look'd at this pathetic software and wondered, was is this shit? and
took a look at it. They saw the most easiest to use menu system ever
being made to setup a board that even my kidbrother who is 7 years old
could start a BBS and make it popular.

Alot of newbie sysop's started to build there BBS:s in RemoteAccess and
soon almost 50% of the europian Bulletin Board Systems where RemoteAccess
certified And with alot of board running RA the modding people started to
build there groups to release "doors" to RA and to there own boards.

Around 1996 there where about hundrets of Modding-Groups active like:
RA-force, MAD, TRAP, RUDE, CROW, IDS, COT, COFFEE, NAILBOMB, NOVA STORM,
S!P, DX, XPress and alot more or less unknown groups. German was a big
holdout for alot of these groups.

You didn't have to do anything as a sysop, everything could be found at
most of these modding groups. As a lame newbie sysop you could find about
100 of LastCaller Doors, about 50 Note 2 Next User door, a total of 200
Doors with unknown features (like lamer-killers, random quotes and
userdupers) About 20 different rumour doors, somelike 300 page-the-sysop
doors, userlisters, bbslisters, userconfig doors, and even clocks you can
tell the user what the local time is (whaow!, i'm impressed!). And the
best - they all where free. Doors with shareware shit never got used
becouse RA-sysop's could always find a look-a-like door that was freeware.
With all these plugins/doors it wasen't hard for a newbie sysop to choose
system. Not to say all the utils that was available, status-doors, top
download/upload and so on...

As usual in the scene, all PCB-sysops got pissed off all these newbie
sysop's didn't know how to run a REAL board, so all the modding groups
As usual in the scene, all PCB-sysops got pissed off all these newbie
sysop's didn't know how to run a REAL board, so all the modding groups
started to say "now with pcb lightbars" / "now got pcb-ansi" / "pcb style"
so all RA-sysop's thought that was kewl, they will soon run a 100% pcb
clone. Alot of ideas to doors to RemoteAccess (RA) where directly taken
from the PCB modding groups, even the ansi where ripped, that's the main
reason the PCB-sysops got angry.

Well, as every good start it have to end, alot of modding groups died most
becouse of the "ideas" was empty, and the BBS-scene in general was fading
out, and worst of all - The Developers behind RA have stopped developing
it. Ofcouse was RA 2.50 not buggy but alot of sysop's wanted to see Even
more features but there it stopped.

RemoteAccess source code was later sold (expensive) to a man with name
"bruce morse" who still (today) is working on a new version but he seems
to work very very very slow so alot of RA-fans started to build there own
RA-clone's, as the structure of RA was free.

In 1998 the RA-scene is 100% dead, there is only 1 real active group left
producing RA doors - Coffee from UK - Respect!
One of the more famous RA-clones is "eleBBS" which is still in beta-status
and the GUI/windows version that is named "tcRemoteAccess/32" they are both
being developed and they are both in Beta-Stage, but they are not giving up
so respect to them too! They are both YK2.</font></font>
