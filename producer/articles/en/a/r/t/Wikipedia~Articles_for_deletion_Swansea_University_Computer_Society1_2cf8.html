<li><b>Keep</b>. I believe SUCS is well worth a footnote in history due to their involvement in the development of Linux, a fact that <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_S._Raymond_ac9d.html" title="Eric S.

<li><b>Keep</b> The society can be considered to be one of particular importance as it has close tyings in with some of the notable names of Linux and is a close knit and friendly one. The individual who started this AFD request does not provide a valid excuse as such, the age old Cardiff Vs Swansea debate should not be brought into context for this page.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. 180 members is pretty big for a student society -- I would guess it is one of the biggest student compsocs in the country. How big does it have to be to be notable? Nom appears to be from Cardiff Uni making them somewhat biased&#160;:) (On which note it might be worth pointing out that I'm a life member of this society.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHairy_Dude_fc1c.html" title="User:Hairy Dude">Hairy Dude</a> 20:49, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, that's two biases cancelled each other out then. May the discussion commence. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangherous_d22f.html" title="User:Dangherous">Dangherous</a> 20:55, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Deleting an article because you don't like the location is not reasonable. It'd also argue that the society is notable because it has long been linked with Linux (SUCS was name-checked up until the 2.4.19 kernel for the work <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Cox_e02c.html" title="Alan Cox">Alan Cox</a> did on the network drivers while he was at the university). I also note that the nominator's discussion page has a number of complaints from people about his other edits. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFury_cebb.html" title="User:FireFury">FireFury</a> <small>User has 26 edits, mostly to the article in question. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the longest running socs (without break) in Swansea Uni and I like it (but I'm biased because I'm a life member too!&#160;:) 82.21.163.125 21:14, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think anyone who uses "I don't like the place" as an argument can be taken seriously. --<a href="../../../a/k/y/User%7EAkyan_9f80.html" title="User:Akyan">Akyan</a> 21:19, 21 February 2006 (UTC)<small>User's first edit --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If this was a serious AFD, the nominator would have gone through all of the similar articles in the same categories as the SUCS one, found out how many members each society had and then given them the same treatment, depending upon whether he found their physical locations to his taste, of course. As it is, the nominator did not take this action. The location of the society is no justification for the deletion of the article. As FireFury mentioned, the society plays a part in the history of the Linux operating system and for this reason it is just as, if not more, noteable than other university society articles on wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/e/l/User%7EWelshbyte_e6fa.html" title="User:Welshbyte">welshbyte</a> 21:20, 21 February 2006 (UTC)<small>User has 24 edits, mostly to the article in question.　--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not a question of how many members the society currently has - it's its historical significance that makes it notable and worthy of a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDeniswalker_3d59.html" title="User:Deniswalker">Deniswalker</a> 21:26, 21 February 2006 (UTC)<small>User's first edit --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge into main Swansea University article. If kept it could do with a comprehensive prune as much of the information in it is not encyclopedia relevant and is linked to on the society page anyway. It's still far more relevant than <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhole_cover_theft.html" title="Manhole cover theft">half of wikipedia</a>. Also I'd note that the proposers comments about Swansea are inappropriate (even if meant to just be funny) and we don't need a Swansea v Cardiff minor article deletion war. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanCox_6b81.html" title="User:AlanCox">AlanCox</a> 11:52, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Suspicious timing considering "Varsity", a large amount of sporting events between Swansea and Cardiff Universities, is imminent. [Elsmorian - SUCS member] 15:11, 22 Febuary 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability is firmly established through its association with the early Linux work, and the resultant namecheck. Its also oen of the most prominent (if not the most prominent) society at Swansea uni, providing webspace, email and mailing lists for other societies for example. Full disclosure: Like at least half the others voting here I am a member. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 15:15, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> nn club. If we keep this then everyone who has written something whether it be a fanzine, the student newspaper, or some computer code is then notable. Ugh! If as Talyn256 suggests it deserves a footnote in history, a footnote should be dropped in either the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> article or the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea_University_90d0.html" title="Swansea University">Swansea University</a> one, not every noun deserves a link and article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:46, 23 February 2006 (UTC) I note that the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> article makes no mention of the supposed contributions of the society and the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea_University_90d0.html" title="Swansea University">Swansea University</a> article has an "external link" to the society's web page but I could not find any text why such a link would be relevant or notable. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:48, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> article makes no mention of many other contributions too. I don't believe the article should (or indeed could) mention or link to all people and organisations that have made significant contributions - that would make it a very long article. In any case - the contributions are not "supposed" - they are well documented elsewhere, including in the kernels themselves (yes, the article needs some more references - this is something that's being worked on). <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFury_cebb.html" title="User:FireFury">FireFury</a> 10:08, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would also like to note that SUCS members have been adding their views to this page out of choice and not because we (the main contributors to the article) have been telling/asking them to or broadcasting to them about it.
