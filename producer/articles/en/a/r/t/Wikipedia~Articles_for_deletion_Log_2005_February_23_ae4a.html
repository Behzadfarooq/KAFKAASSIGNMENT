<li><b>Delete</b> Completely non-notable even as web forums go. According to the article they only got their own domain a month ago(!!)

</ul>
<p>Rangeley Note: For those who think 50,000 members is the benchmark, You will be hard pressed to find a forum over that. I can think of one, Gaia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che-Lives" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che-Lives" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Here is one with 8000 members, is that too low too? Why arent you going after all the forums with less then 50,000 members, or is this merely a double standard. And to those who say there is only one active user, that is because this is an American Board, and it was in the middle of the night when you said that... And while the main reason appears to be notability, I dont think this should be enough. The article goes pretty in depth. If this were an article with one paragraph, I would definately see your point, a non notable forum with a silly article. But this does have a lot of information in it, it wasnt thrown together in a few minutes, its taken quite a few days to get where it is.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Note: the above by Rangely, the author of the article being VfDed.) Nonsense, there are numerous online communities over the 50,000 mark. Slashdot, DeviantART, Kuro5hin, ChristianForums, Hardware.fr, Anandtech, and many many more. As for why we aren't "going after" other non-notable forum artcles, we are. It just takes time. The vast majority of online message-board articles that come up for VfD get deleted for this very same reason. In fact, I can't remember the last time that one was nominated and ended up being kept. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:40, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My benchmark comes from <a href="http://www.ocforums.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ocforums.com" rel="nofollow">OCForums</a>, a fairly active overclocking community, where the forum is only loosely attached to any non-forum websites. When I posted my last comment, it had 277 active users in the last however many minutes it counts, at 4AM Eastern (US) time. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 00:19, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rangeley note: Che-lives has been up since August 31st, quite a lot of time and its still there. While the Brink of Reality isnt as active as some other forums, Is that reason to take a relatively in depth article down? I would think that the top way of judging these types of things is whether the article has a point or not. I could very well be wrong. The Che-Lives article is quite informative and I learned a lot about whats going on there from reading it, and I am not even a member there. I would want to judge that article by its content, not the 'active users' count. I would not mind if this was attempted to be deleted for its content, that I can fix and improve upon, but as is there is literally nothing I can do really. I dont really see this as fair, it should be the articles content not the active users. If there is an article about a small organisation with 100 people in it, is that reason to delete it even if the article is informative and you learn a lot from it? Basically what I am getting at is, if an article has content and informs, that should mean something, and in this case I feel that is being ignored, as noone has yet presented a reason for deletion as being the content. But if the content needs improving, by all means say so and I will get on it!
<ul>
<li>Ok, you bring up some very good points, and I'll try to address them. Point 1: For the most part, very small organisations do not generally deserve articles. There's no official WP-approved number of members an org must have for an article, but usually an article about a 100-member group would really only be of interest to people already within that group. There are exceptions, as always, but that's how it usually goes. Point 2: I wish I could say that the content of this article is blameless in its VfDing. It really focuses far too much on the internal politics of the forum, something that, again, only members of the board would care about. For comparison's sake, let's look at the article for an indisputably notable organisation: the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a>. It's a very good article. Notice that it covers basic history, mission, statistics, and activities of the org. It doesn't get into the internal politics ("X was fired by Y", "X was elected over Y,Z, and N") that those not involved with the org wouldn't care about. Some good questions to ask yourself when deciding what to include are: "Will anyone not inside this group have reason to know or care about this?" "Will anyone need this information in 50 or 100 years?" "How does this information relate to other information? Does it help explain anything?" In my opinion, the first two paragraphs are fine, but the rest is only of interest to those involved in it (who, as a result, probably know it all already). That part should be scrapped or condensed into a sentence or two. If you need more help or advice, just let me know. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 01:43, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>(Rangeley)Alright, that type of advice is something I can follow up on. Edit: I have removed the questioned paragraph, and replaced with a few sentences in the Government and President sections. I have also added a statistics section.
<ul>
<li>That is indeed a vast improvement over the way the article was. By the way, I registered for a Brink of Reality account today as Starblind. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:27, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I appreciate the fact that you continue to improve the article. However, for comparison, the game design forum I follow has 2470 members and 103662 posts. What I'm getting at is that, while your article is of decent quality, its subject is not encyclopedic. As an extreme example, I could write a lengthy informative article about my cat, but that doesn't make it worthy of encyclopedia inclusion. Poor articles on good subjects are tagged for improving, and kept. Consequently, good articles on poor subjects can be tagged for deletion. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:35, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Rangeley) Alright, lets look at the rules and guidelines for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">deletion policy</a>I dont see anything about a cut off point for forums, I do see things against Advertisements and Vanity articles. A vanity article would be like something on you, your cat, dog, family, your freind, that type of thing. An Advertisement would be 'Go to this site (link)' As we have clarified this article is not this, and I beleive the consensus is its a pretty good article instead, where is the base for deletion? I see many rules that say deletion is alright if the content is poor, but none in this case.
<ul>
<li>You're right, you'll never see a cut off point for groups in official WP policy. This is because WP generally prefers to take things on a case-by-case basis, like you see here on this VfD. Under this system, each member votes using their own criteria (or perhaps no criteria at all). It works much better than simply "All groups bigger than X need articles" or "all groups bigger than Y need articles". Some WP members believe that anything that can be verified can be included, while others prefer relatively high imclusion criteria. The ability to vote based on our own beliefs rather than a set-in-stone this-is-how-it-is set of rules, as well as the open incouragement of dialogue and discussion, keep the system generally balances and reasonable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:27, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Rangeley) Im not sure it keeps it balanced and reasonable. The majority isnt always right, and sometimes some people judge unfairly. While you say discussion is encouraged, such as what is going on now, I am beginning to see that it has one flaw. Even as I have shown this wasnt a deadend site, wasnt a vanity article, and even made it information useful to others, rather then internal goings-on, it still comes down to what others think. And in this case the criteria is something unfixable. While we have discussed this for a day, the issue has been whittled down, and we have reached a point where regardless of the rules saying this article is good, personal oppinions will take it down. Even though the point of view for deletion has no rules to support it, it will win. As you said earlier, you cant remember the last time one of these was nominated for deletion and got off. I doubt this case will end any differently. I do think Wikipedia should add more guidelines for deletion, because when I made this I did look into them, and stayed in the rules. I wouldnt have bothered to make it if I knew that even if I followed the guidelines, it would get deleted because the deletion policy isnt actually written, but just ends up being any given persons own idea.
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but you are mistaken about the process. The guidelines for inclusion (or exclusion) are intentionally vague, because it would be patently impossible to provide for all occasions. There are a few non-debatable issues (e.g. copyvio), but the others will have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. We do not want the 'lawbook for wikipedia' to govern us (apart from the fact that creating it would take too much time). Therefore, a consensual majority will decide the case.</li>
<li>As is the case here. You have made your point. We have listened to you. And we disagree. Taking the case to extremes, we obviously want an article on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a>, and we obviously don't want an article on my goldfish. We must draw a line somewhere, and that is called notability. There is too little that distinguishes your forum as being special amongst the thousands of other internet forums. Therefore, the vote to delete stands. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 22:13, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Zero hits for <i>Minneapolis "Snow Exclusion Zone"</i> on google, google news, and google groups. Orphan.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'll say that I find the barrage of opposition here a bit surprising, and some entries are simply machist, really. Some have attacked the merit of the analysis it implies. I find the quote from <i>The First Sex</i> by Elizabeth Gould Davis to be interesting to ponder about and possibly in part quite right. ...but even if you feel this is <i>revenge bull****</i>, as a poster politely implied, we can't delete an encyclopedia fot the merit we subjectively give it. I feel the article could be kept. Also, mentions of this outlook could be added to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">Sexism</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_envy.html" title="Penis envy">Penis envy</a>. I think the idea of historical sexism being in part attribuable to envy and fear is only an application of many theories about discrimination. So, at the least, this would warrant a rename or inclusion and expansion in the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">sexism</a> article. And if the article were to be moved to <i>sexism</i>, redirects would be essential. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 05:29, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've compressed the page to a redirect. <b>Deletion is no longer necessary</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To explain in more detail: This is not the first time that pages of this sort have come up for discussion on vfd. In past discussions, a general consensus emerged around "minor candidate" pages: (i) there is room on Wikipedia to store some information about such figures, (ii) individual bio pages might not be the best way to approach such figures.</p>
<p>In one previous discussion, I suggested that I (or someone else) could create a more centralized database for minor candidates of the same party, storing the basic information for several such figures on a single page. Most seemed to agree that this was a reasonable compromise, in the event that it was necessary. (The threshold for "relevance" is somewhat lower for a general page of this sort than for a bio page; also, some readers opined that having the information in one location would be more convenient.)</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Chernushenko_729a.html" title="David Chernushenko">David Chernushenko</a>" is now a redirect to a page on 2004 Green Party candidates. For the time being, his is the only entry -- there are a few more "dubious" bio pages that I plan on adding (and compressing to redirects) in the near future, however.</p>
<p>If anyone disagrees with this decision, please contact me on my talk page. For the time being, however, I suspect the matter may be closed. (Note that I made a similar decision on vfd once before, without any complaints.)</p>
<p>(Btw -- the page in its previous form *was* vanity.) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:50, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm alright with this compromise; certainly better than a whole article on him. Also currently on VfD is <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Biocchi_a31a.html" title="Dan Biocchi">Dan Biocchi</a>, who, amazingly, is surviving VfD, even though his page said less than this one did. Part of the reason might be that he was once apparently an Olympic athlete (a fact that the article does not mention, nor does it even mention what he ran for and when). If he ran the same year I think he could be put on the same minor candidate page. I imagine there are many pages of candidates who ran for some office and lost who could recieve similar treatment. I know of a few anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:11, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I hereby amend my earlier list (on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Biocchi_a31a.html" title="Dan Biocchi">Dan Biocchi</a>) of what I consider the main criteria for inclusion of minor party candidates, to add <i>(e) most candidates are included on a single list</i>. I think this is a really good idea, and strikes a good balance between notability concerns and the fact that the information <i>is</i> useful for some purposes. Keep list. (Oh, and I still think Dan Biocchi's Olympic history makes him an <i>individual</i> keep, as long as the article is expanded to include it.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:21, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

He just does not meet my understanding of the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Merger into a list doesn't really solve the underlying problems of articles about such persons. He is so little known that no one will realistically be able to verify the information in the article. A vandal could add, delete or modify the content of the article (whether stand-alone or in a list) and there won't be enough knowledgable reader/editors to catch it. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:52, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't believe this is likely, or that it makes a strong case for deletion -- these may not be well-known figures on a national level, but they're still public figures; information added to such pages may be scrutinized, as such. (And questionable edits can always be reverted in the absence of concrete information.) Chernushenko, in particular, is a relatively well-known figure within the City of Ottawa. He may not deserve a separate bio page, but there's surely room on Wikipedia for information on his political history. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 06:03, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Including the redirect. Candidates for election, even to national legislatures, are usually not notable, and this is the only basis for notability that is mentioned. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a>'s "compromise" was to create a list article <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Canada_candidates%2C_2004_federal_election_513e.html" title="Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election">Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election</a> aiming to have a short bio on each of the Green Party's 308 candidates (almost all of whom list). This list actually only has one bio, for Chernushenko. I think if you create a list that has a potential for 308 entries, you should create it with a significant number of those entries from the outset, rather than relying on eventualism to complete it. Nobody is going to expand this list to any reasonable degree and it is just going to be crud that is eventually going to have to go through VfD itself. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:40, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I realize that the discussion time on this article is over, but I should probably explain my motivations on the odd chance that anyone actually looks over this discussion in the future: the page only has one entry because it was presented as a model for future entries, and was meant to solicit discussion. There are numerous other pages that I could compress to redirects as well; in fact, I may do so shortly. (Btw -- for those overseeing the vfd/old page, I do not believe there is any consensus to delete the "David Chernushenko" page *in its current form*.) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:02, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Jason Frost was a Sunshine Bandmember withMajor label, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, as well as an important part of rock n roll history in Olympia-Seattle area, who continues to create music for his devoted fans like myself. You can check here, as well as the many, many, links thoughout this page on his newspaper articles, press, artist pages, and movie film database on major film, etc. He is notable. Android79 has done nothing but angered me and played games and muddied up this page.</p>

<p>(The star next to his name means he is notable to MTV!!!)</p>
<p>Wikipaedia requires for a band or artist personality to be listed he must have been a member of a notable band, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, had hits like "get down tonight" and others. His being a member of this band makes him notable, even though I find this the least notable of his accomplishments. I vote to KEEP his other related band entries! - Timk</p>

<li>I saw someone driving 85 mph on Route 128 the other day. Is that an argument that Route 128 should have its speed limit raised to 85 mph? Wikipedia is intrinsically inconsistent.

<li>Concur with Dpbsmith. Actually the entire 'Pokemon test' is an argument out of spite, and thus invalid.

<p>Uppyspeak has been around for about a year, maybe a little longer. I was thinking about incorporating it into the article about <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">internet slang</a>, but I noticed that it said the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">internet slang</a> article took up too much webspace as it is. So, I created added it as its own article. If you don't think it's up to the wikipedia standard as its own article, and you do choose to delete it, I would think it should at least be worthy as a footnote in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">internet slang</a> article.

<li>"He became the first homosexual to gain channel operator status". Channel operators are server- and channel-specific and not organised or controlled by any specific authority. IRC technology makes channel operatorship an entirely peer-controlled process: the first person to join a new channel, or a channel that is empty at the time, automatically becomes an operator, and any operator can appoint anyone else as an operator. Some channels employ "bots" to moderate this. Therefore, if no specific server or channel can be mentioned in the sentence from the article, it is meaningless. 193.167.132.66 11:08, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Also, by 1997 IRC was a decade old, so the assertion that someone in 1997 was the first gay channel operator is <i>highly</i> suspect. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:33, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability established. How about giving the benefit of the doubt more often to give Wikipedia a chance to grow? it seems that most people are more likely to add to an existing article than to start a new one, so it is counterproductive to delete stubs or otherwise unfinished articles. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 23:46, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's not necessarily true. The category 'substub' was added because the category 'stub' was overcrowded, and now 'substub' is also getting far too long. People are likely to add to articles they find (e.g. a Spaniard checking spain-stub) but stubs about things or people nobody much knows about tend to stay stubby forever. That said, this article should be kept now that it's established as a media presence. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:06, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This kind of management-speak nauseates me and I'd never heard this particular term before, but Googling convinces me that this a reasonable article and a reasonable title. It doesn't seem to be a copyvio, either. The cutesy-poo terminology seems to be in very wide use. It is <i>not</i> a book summary; the reference (which I've just added to the article) seems to be: Tuckman, Bruce. (1965). Developmental sequence in small groups. <i>Psychological bulletin,</i> 63, 384-399. This really seems to be the way people refer to the model. See also the not-great article <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team.html" title="Team">Team</a>; this article seems to have been written completely independently, and uses the same terminology. Perhaps Forming, Storming, Norming, and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performing.html" title="Performing">Performing</a> should be redirects or disambiguations to this article? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:59, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and keep at this name (although I'm not so sure about the punctuation). This model for describing team dynamics has expanded past the original analysis and is in very wide use. It is not the only model of team dynamics, however, so it can't neatly be shoe-horned back into that article. By the way, to everyone getting all snotty about the "management-speak". please remember that what appears to be unnecessary jargon from outside the field may be necessary precision of language when inside the field. This term has the same degree of precision to a person studying Organizational Dynamics as, say, Mazlow's Hierarchy of needs has to a person studying psychology or quantum chromodynamics has to a person studying physics. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:51, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>69.107.96.61 because I am the author of the original note, and for these reasons: (1) I am a financial contributor to Wikipedia--it's the Golden Rule--they who have the gold, rule; (2) the source for Frederick S. Mates (which admittedly probably should be titled as the Mates Investment Fund) is the classic book "The Go-Go Years&#160;: The Drama and Crashing Finale of Wall Street's Bullish 60s" by John Brooks (not to be confused with Brooke Burke, who is impossibly hot); (3) what's the harm? storage is scalable; (4) I notice some of the editors on wikipedia are or could be librarians...but for the rest of us, Wikipedia makes a great vanity publishing site...it's probably not a viable concept however, since statistics tell us that for every population N&gt;=30 people, you will inevitable get somebody who is an 'outlier' oddball who will disagree with everybody else--a weak link in the chain.

<li>69.107.96.61 I am alarmed that so-called registered users can delete stuff contributed by financial contributors. Who'se your sugar daddy? Me. Daddy Warbucks. I'm paying for your tuition while you go off and ponder Kant. Yes, it's the same thing. The Chicago school of economics says your worth is directly related to your money. Oprah Winfred is worth more than 50 IBM fellows, cause she gets paid more. That's what society wants. Give it to 'em good and hard, like Mencken says for democracy. Sad but true? Then start your own society; move to Canada. Another pet peeve: I spent a half hour gathering statistics for diamond production by value (rough cut to final gem) and some bozo deletes it from the DeBeers site cause he thought it was extraneous. That's wrong folks. This whole concept of wikipedia is doomed, and the Lexus/Nexus people are laughing all the way to the bank, which confirms BTW the Chicago School analysis. I vote that financial contributors get as many votes as the dollars they contribute, and nothing they post can be deleted unless outvoted, or if it's clearly abuse.

<li>I'm sorry, you seem to have confused wikipedia with a capitalist enterprise. Look at the top of your screen and you'll see this is wikipedia.org, not .com. You remind me of those people who give money to the Red Cross and then want to tell them exactly what to spend it on. You're not the first person to want to turn wikipedia into the yellow pages, and you won't be the last, but it still isn't going to happen. I appreciate that you donated $75,000 (I assume you did, you said that you are our sugar dady, not that you are one of many), but that doesn't allow you to vote yourself thousands of votes. Write to your congressman and ask him to introduce a bill that will grant every citizen 1 vote per tax dollar they pay, and use the Chicago School to back up your argument. See where it gets you. And to really endear yourself make sure you mention that 1 Columbian drug lord is better than 1000 Jesuses, 2000 Gandhis, 3000 Buddahs, and a Mother Teresa. That should seal the deal. Let me know when that succeeds and I may reconsider. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:41, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>69.107.96.61 Yellow pages? Nuts. The article is about Frederick Mates, a notable financial person. One vote = one dollar is actually the law in some juridictions vis-a-vis property taxes (a minority trend but Scalia and others are pushing for it on the Supremes). Mother Teresa was a capitalist powerhouse--don't be put off by her modesty--her foundation got paid. Drug Lords are indeed gods in Latin America--see Cidade de Deus/City of God (Brazil 2002). And, BTW, I have contributed US$30 so far, and will continue to do so as long as my stuff does not get deleted too often. Like I said, my DeBeers post got trimmed but I'll consider that a rookie mistake by some stylist. Take Care.
<ul>
<li>While this particular article isn't "Yellow Pages" material, your proposal to allow financial contributors to write whatever they want and block deletion would amount to as much. Walmart could donate a mere $20,000 (pennies to them, and a tax write off) and write articles for every store they have, product on sale this week, etc. As for $1 = 1 vote, I'm not convicned this is the case anywhere, nor do I see how Scalia would have any say about extending such a practice, as it would clearly be a case for the legislative branch, all he could do is rule it constitutional or not if it ever got that far, which I doubt it would. Mother Teresa's foundation may have had alot of money, but that doesn't mean she did; anyone who reads about financial topics should know the difference. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:32, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>About Bruce Hicks: If this wasn't written by a family member I'll eat my hat. I see lots of quite minor accomplishments, while the presentation is just oozing with praise. He's been on some committees, worked behind the scenes in politics, got a few awards (none of which have articles; man, there are alot of awards in the world), and then we have his family background. I'm calling this vanity, or at least family-vanity. And <i>"Bruce Hicks" Canada</i>, got me about 500 google hits, which isn't tons, and not all of them are him. eading the article, you'd think this guy basically saved the world from all that is evil, but I'm pretty confident he didn't. The Sidney Hicks article is much worse. <b>Delete</b>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:25, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is why I hate it when two (or more) related articles are VfDed together. <b>Keep and Cleanup</b> Bruce Hicks. It looks like a lot of his accomplishments are pretty much resume-stuffer material that doesn't really mean a whole lot to most people (Look, ma, I made the Order of St. Stanislas!). But I think that a lot of medium-sized accomplishments can pile up and amount to the same thing as a big accomplishment. The guy does have a charitable org and award named after him, and that fact alone might lead some people to look him up. However, the article does need a fair bit of cleanup, NPOVing and trivia-removal. As for Sidney, I sadly must vote <b>delete</b> as 99% of the article seems to be about her family, not her. In this case, removing the irrelevant info would leave us with a 3 or 4-word stub, and it's better just to wipe the whole slate clean. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:16, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced even Bruce's bigger accomplishments are really worth much, even when added together. The article says his greatest accomplishment is being responsible for proposing that the motto of the Order of Canada is placed on the Canadian Coat of Arms, and a small note on the article on the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_Arms_of_Canada_ca4e.html" title="Coat of Arms of Canada">Coat of Arms of Canada</a> is more than enough for that. He started his own foundation and named it after himself, which tons of well-to-do people do; the number of "Ernest W. Flagglebert Foundations" or whatever is pretty large, and we're not talking the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._And_Catherine_T._MacArthur_Foundation_127f.html" title="John D. And Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation">John D. And Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</a> here. Googling the "Bruce M. Hicks Public Service Award" got me a whopping 13 google hits (at least one from his own site) which hardly supports the assertion that it's awarded at most independent schools in Canada (assuming there are more than 12 of them). The article so inflates everything he does I'd really like to take the standard approach to vanity, deleting this, then if he is notable maybe someone who doesn't just want to pour accolades over the guy can write a new article. My guess is anyone not related to him isn't going to. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:07, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>For the sake of argument, considering that there are dozens of different Latin textbooks, and all of them cover pretty much the same stuff, it would be nigh impossible to come up with an interesting article for all of them.

<p>It seems that readers are mistaken the nature of the listing: i.e., list of Dominicans, with a listing that says, for instance, the list of Dominicans they know. Those who lived or played tennis in the Dominican Republic between 1981 to 1989 could easily attest to the fact that Acosta-Diaz monopolized the news media with his tennis victories. Those who would like to seek verification only need to contact the Listin Diario or any other major newspapers in the Dominican Republic. But again, the listing is not about a person who "made" in the U.S. or the world tour but rather a famous dominican- in the Dominican Republic. I can only assume that none of the voters here know Rafael Moreno, Genaro De Leon, Menlith Acosta, Joel Schwab or Madeline Sanchez. All those individuals were also great Dominican tennis players and will also EQUALLY qualify to be listed. Milton Nunez</p>

<li>In my view, if you want to be a politican in any notable sense, you have to be elected to something. A few quotes from this article seem to indicate a certain lack of notability. "Brown has been outspoken on numerous political issues, and has achieved small notice in the Fargo-Moorhead area." Even <i>big</i> notice in the Fargo-Moorhead area isn't much. And placing "fourth place out of five candidates with 40 votes" in a race for mayor of what is by no means a large metropolis undermines claims of notability. I'm thinking this is vanity, and I really don't like vanity on Wikipedia. <b>delete</b>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:03, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I hope this doesn't sound mean or anything, but 40 votes in an election, even a local one, is pretty pathetic. Most of us, if we were running for something, could do better than that just with support from family, friends, neighbours, co-workers, and the like.

<p>To expand my arguement, and maybe become a little over-impassioned about what my vision of wikipedia is all about (but I do believe this is that important), I'm a long term wiki contributor, at one time up there in the 'most contributions' list, now a bit of a recovering <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipediholic_2ec3.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipediholic">wikiholic</a>, and generally a level headed contributor with a strong belief in what wikipedia stands for, and it seems maybe ironic that I'm prepared to make a strong stand over what is 'just' a 'relatively unimportant' stub, but I don't create pages like this (Red Square) and those who celebrate lightly, certainly not for reasons of 'vanity', but because I believe that in certain contexts these groups had/have significance, both within the context of the history of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_improvisation.html" title="Free improvisation">free improvisation</a> and in the former case, a documentation of the music scene of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southend_on_Sea_dd41.html" title="Southend on Sea">Southend on Sea</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, where I have always lived.</p>
<p>The 'allmusic' arguement I have already addressed, the 'not many hits on Google' is PRECISELY why it is important that the history of groups like Red Square isn't lost forever. I have a wealth of detail, information and history of 'obscure' groups inside my head, based on experience, gigs attended, gig recordings, people I know/knew, etc etc, much that may well be of use/interest to future academics, historians, archivists, genreally interested people and the like, so do so many of us in all sorts of areas. If/when I die, that will be gone forever. So do we want a 'wikipedia' that just regurgitates what 'allmusic' posits as 'the truth' and 'notable' or do we want a richer tapestry with the gaps filled in?</p>
<p>To use an analogy, one of my principle fields of interest is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permaculture.html" title="Permaculture">permaculture</a> and urban land rights issues. Whilst reading Peter Harper's classic book <i>Radical Technology</i>, published in 1972 and totally reflective of it's time, I came accross a mention of a South London based radical urban land rights group called <i>The Urban Farmers</i>, who pulled off various stunts in the late sixties such as planting vegetables in the middle of roads, etc, and also published a 'beautiful and graphically inovative' silk screened magazine. I wanted to know more. Google searches however produced nothing, nor did various email requests on likely groups, although I did get a couple of responses from old hippies who 'vaguely remembered' the urban farmers and their magazine, but couldn't be any more specific. Seems the urban farmers are lost forever. They certanly will be in a further 30 years. However, we now have the tool (Wikipedia) to ensure that such ephemeral but relevant history is documented rather than lost to future generations and researchers, which is why I am so passionate that the memory of groups like Red Square shouldn't be lost just because somebody in Australia (for example), presumably with little interest in the history of free improvisation or music in Southend on Sea, on a whim thinks they 'arn't notable'. Whose to say what is and isn't notable and in what context? So delete away if that is to be the majority decision, but the quality of a so-called 'free encyclopedia' will be greatly diminished as a result as far as I'm concerned, cheers <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a> 01:12, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Philosophy of chemistry is clearly a topic of substantial discussion and inquiry. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?official_s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22philosophy+of+chemistry%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?official_s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22philosophy+of+chemistry%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for the phrase (with quotes to yield only pages containing the words in a phrase) yields 10,500 hits. Wikipedia has articles on topics that have 5% of that much internet presence. If the article is currently substandard, there is clearly enough material to improve it with. Giving that potential for the article, chemistry is an important enough discipline to give the philosophy of it it's own page, just as the other topics within philosophy of science have their own pages.</li>

<dd>I'm concerned that some of the votes for deletion have not taken into account a thorough review of the abundant philosophy of chemistry material available on the web. An interesting <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/14418;jsessionid=aaaeI64wZUcz2T" class="external text" title="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/14418;jsessionid=aaaeI64wZUcz2T" rel="nofollow">book review</a> of <i>Of Minds and Molecules: New Philosophical Perspectives on Chemistry</i> by Michael Weisberg, Philosophy, Stanford University concludes "issues in philosophy of chemistry may not raise the kind of deep conceptual perplexity that the quantum mechanical measurement problem raises, and they may not be as conceptually complex as debates about optimality arguments in evolutionary biology. They are, however, essential to understanding what makes science work and progress."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The review also wites: "The contributors to this book are philosophers, chemists and philosopher-chemist teams (including the editors). Collaboration between philosophers and chemists is one of its most exciting features; it focuses the discussion on the application of traditional topics in philosophy of science to chemistry and on previously unexplored topics native to chemistry."</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Someone above said chemistry is a science, not a philosophy. Well, science is not philosophy, either, so would that mean the philosophy of science, a major discipline, ought to be abandoned? Specific applications of science have peculiar philosophical implications with respect to methodology and underlying assumptions. Most philosophers of science are oriented towards physics, and, happily, a growing number are coming from chemistry and biology. It makes perfect sense to have such an article. <a href="../../../i/c/u/User%7EIcut4you_0ea4.html" title="User:Icut4you">icut4u</a>

<li>Now, yes. Take a look at the original version to see what I was talking about when I said that, though. And Christofurio, I apologize for taking so long to be convinced. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../e/g/o/User%7EEgomaniac_b61a.html" title="User:Egomaniac">Egomaniac</a> 22:35, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
