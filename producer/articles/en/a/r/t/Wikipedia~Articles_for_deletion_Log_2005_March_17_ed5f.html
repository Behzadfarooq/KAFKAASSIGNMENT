<dd>If you can find a reference for Clinton or the "numerous senators" mentioned, I'll change my vote. Otherwise this is merely a genealogical reference.

<p><b>Keep</b> With or without Clinton, this family has (based on the evidence) played a fairly large role in American history (with special regards to the Revolution) and is significant in their own right because of their connection to the Truelove Eyre legend. I have heard that Bill Clinton had a strong Revolutionary War ancestry, and this would seem to fit. However, if definitive proof cannot be found then the article should be modified so that Clinton's name is not included. Connection to an American president is too huge a claim to pass off without verification. Other than the Clinton thing, the rest of the article is fine. Great job finding resources!</p>
<p>Okay, I've got something about Bill Clinton: "Furthermore, he is related to every Scottish monarch to the current British royal family. Clinton's royal roots include several medieval monarchs and Simon de Montford, a statesman and soldier under King Henry III. Through de Montford, Clinton is related to EVERY ancient aristocratic family in Britain today." This comes from: <a href="http://asis.com/~stag/uspres.html" class="external free" title="http://asis.com/~stag/uspres.html" rel="nofollow">http://asis.com/~stag/uspres.html</a> It's not a lot, but it is a small thread that leads me to believe that the Clinton-Eyre connection is genuine. If Clinton is related to every aristocratic family (I capitalized EVERY in the quotations to emphasize that point) in Britain, then he has some connection with the Eyres. The quote also mentions, "medieval monarchs," which would ostensibly be the House of Wessex through which the Eyres claim descent. Obviously more specific information must be found, but this is a start.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If you think that the individuals are notable, write articles about them. The family as a unit however is not notable. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 18:30, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> I respectfully disagree with that view. I think that the family as a unit (that is, all together) is far more significant than any of its members (Truelove Eyre notwithstanding) alone. For example, we have established that Jehu Eyre helped build boats and give money to the Revolution, and that his brother Manuel was a member of the Committee of Correspondence. Obviosuly, their work was highly influential, but neither one is particularly famous. Separate articles would be immediately debunked as, "non notable," and it's ,much easier to just include every significant Eyre on one page. The Bill Clinton thing sounds like it would be right, but I haven't been able to find anything that confirms it, so it should be taken out. I hope that someone else can locate something about him. It appears that Jehu Eyre had a lot of children beside this one daughter, perhaps it's through another child. <b>Liz1848</b> Hi, same person again. I just went over to Truelove Eyre and was reading the Talk Page that debated whether or not the legend was genuine. I just wanted to add that the Truelove Eyre article was widely denounced by Wikipedians following the Eyre Empire garbage, but that evidence eventually proved the legend to be verifiable. It now appears as if the Truelove article is going to stay, namely because so many Wikipedians changed their votes. I hope that this article is given the same consideration. I have found that there are some people here who are a bit, "delete happy," i.e., they attack things just to attack. Come now. I thought that our goal here was to report the facts. This is history, and, HISTORY BACKED UP BY REFERENCED FACT. <b>Liz1848</b></p>

<p><b>Keep</b> Rick is right. If no one has any objections, I am going to edit the article so that the part about Bill Clinton is ommitted. I will postpone doing this to allow for any kind of debate on the issue, but I've got to say that the evidence just isn't there. Liz1848 has a point, too, though; the family as a whole is notable and historically confirmed, as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truelove_Eyre_0858.html" title="Truelove Eyre">Truelove Eyre</a> and the talk surrounding it show. As the politicalgraves website shows, the Eyres have significant political connections. This family should be included on wikipedia.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> In the face of the overwhelming evidence (the profusion of websites detailing the family), I can reach no other conclusion but that the Eyres were a family of great importance, both politically and socially. Unless anyone can find a website stating, "all of these other websites are completely false, and here is the evidence of that," I find no reason that this article should not be kept. <b>bit89medieval</b></p>

<p>It may be my first contribution, but that does not detract from the legitimacy of said contribution. To 208.22.177.10: you can set up a user account by going to the upper right hand corner of your computer and clicking, "Log In." It's pretty self-explanatory after that. By the way, there are ten websites referenced on this page alone about this supposedly insignificant family! If their influence was really that miniscule, why are so many people talking about them? There is no reason to create so many sites about a group of entirely unimportant people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not a single person here has accused this family of being insignificant. What we are saying is this article does not belong in an encyclopedia. It isn't of interest to general readers of an encyclopedia, except as a geneaolgical resource. Since Wikipedia is not a genealogy site, the article should go. As you've pointed out, there are much better genealogical resources than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 18:19, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> for obvious reasons. This could be helpful to anyone who's ever had to do a history report on the American Revolution, or on influential American families. Perhaps this should be placed under "Important Families of the Revolution," or, "Important American Families," or even incorporated into, "American Revolution," something like that. The article is certainly noteworthy, though. I think that wikipedia would lose an asset if this article was removed (it's certainly a very interesting part of American history without the stink of uncertainty that accompanies legend), though it seems that some rather narrowminded people are bent on doing just that. Therefore, I would like to pose a question: if we absolutely cannot accept this entirely legitimate article, where should it go? Does anyone have know of any websites where this could be posted, or any other area of wikipedia where it could find a home? I remain steadfast in my opnion that this article SHOULD BE KEPT.</p>

<p>I believe this page to be a hoax- this is a rather unusual name for a compound more normally known as orthosilicic acid. Most of the information in this 2003 stub is either wrong or overly simplistic. I have never seen this name in any chemical catalogue, and books such as the ref. below refer to it as orthosilicic acid. It would be impossible to "pass SiO2 over water vapour" as the boiling point of SiO2 is much higher than the 800 C mentioned. Also, the ref mentioned below implies that complex mixtures of silicic acids are formed, not just one. I have created a stub for <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicic_acid.html" title="Silicic acid">silicic acid</a> to compensate for the loss of this rather dubious page. I am also proposing deletion for related nonsense on <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicate_dihydroxide.html" title="Silicate dihydroxide">Silicate dihydroxide</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicate_monohydroxide.html" title="Silicate monohydroxide">Silicate monohydroxide</a>.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia has long had image gallery pages (eg, there are a couple linked from the <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompeii.html" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> article) when such images are informative and too numerous to include in the main article without clutter, though such have become less common since the start of the Wikimedia Commons. I know of no blanket policy against image galleries if they are encyclopedicly done (for print parallels, my old Americana has blocks of pages of photographs not integrated into the text), and I strongly disagree with the suggestion that any and all photo galleries should be deleted. IMO to keep or delete this article should be based on specifics. This one IMO does seem a bit of overkill, and I'm not sure the copyright status of all the images is adiquately researched and taggged. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 19:57, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough, but I think such gallery pages are the exception rather than the rule. Certainly for a minor biographical article like this such images are overkill, copyrighted or not.

<li><a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a>, the gallery you are referring to, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_Pompeii_and_Herculaneum_7981.html" title="Gallery of Pompeii and Herculaneum">Gallery of Pompeii and Herculaneum</a>, is an exception because it supports content from <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompeii.html" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>.

<li>Hi- I put up this page this morning in my capacity as an editor for Buyers lab... Please let me know how I could render the page less "spammy" so that the legitimate information can stay up... (benjamincurry@gmail.com)
<ul>
<li>Um hi. I think you missed the bit that says "Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a website, a product, or a business". If you want this to stay, I suggest you read <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_Point_of_View_9960.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View">Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View</a> and condense it to something your competitors, detractors and sceptical wikipedia voters would agree is true. Also you will need verifiable evidence that this is an important company, maybe media coverage. You may also need some luck (and get a user name). <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:46, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I am new to this community, I hadn't completely reviewed your policies; as of my latest edit, I have reviewed the two articles you cited. I would like to do what I can to ensure that a legitimate profile of our company remains on this site - I have no desire to advertise, I would simply like information about our existance to stand here on Wikipedia, which more and more is used for all levels of reference in the business world. I would also like to note that the article on Mr. Kallet referred to our company by link, a link that led nowhere before this entry was created - isn't that alone a reason for this article, in order to provide comprehensive information on a given subject, ie Mr. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Kallet_22ac.html" title="Arthur Kallet">Arthur Kallet</a>? Again, please let me know whether this re-edit satisfies you in regards to your editorial policies. Here are several articles that I hope may show that we are in fact a legitimate company:</li>

<li>So you're basically saying it isn't advertising because it didn't make you buy the product? I disagree, it's blatant advertising. There is no attempt to look at how the product fits into the history of computing, into a general category of products, to look at criticisms of the product -- the only perspective in which the product is looked at is "how can our product solve the problems of <i>you</i>, the prospective buyer?" and this is betrayed openly when the text comes right out and claims "Your application gets the best of both worlds". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:45, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A common mistake is to think that "if it is more than 1 line long, it isn't a dictionary entry". This article very clearly demonstrates the error in that thinking (to those who haven't been to Wiktionary lately and so haven't noticed that many of the entries are a lot more than 1 line long ☺). Wiktionary's <i>article about the word</i> had existed for 15 months at the point that this article was created. Also note that the identical text was added to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/browbeat" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:browbeat">Wiktionary:browbeat</a> 2 minutes after this article was created.
