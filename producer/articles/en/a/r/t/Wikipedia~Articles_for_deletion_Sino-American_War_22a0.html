<p>This war has never happened and is only hypothetical. Even the Israeli-Lebanon War was not classified as a war until nearly weeks into the 2006 conflcit. No attempt has been made to create a Iran War page even though that as recevied much mroe attention and is more likely. In addition the only edits to this page have been made by radical conservatives, and the enitre page seems to promoting a view point. --Stalin1942 00:18, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypothetical or not, the article cites several good sources that discuss the possibility of such a war, including <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0679454632</a>, which is a 245-page book on the subject. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:20, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please read <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">our policy</a> properly.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. About four fifths of article consists of books and sources relating to the subject, while the article itself says not much more than that there have been speculations over a US-China war after the Cold War. That is too thin a basis for an article, an article needs some description of the subject matter. Something <i>could</i> probably be written here given the sources, but this article is not it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What you have described is a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a> that has copious sources cited upon which further expansion of the article can be based. Per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> we don't delete stubs that have scope for expansion (especially ones where the scope for expansion is handed to editors on a platter with lots of citations). We expand them. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am changing my vote to <b>keep</b> because of the expansions to the article. I do stand by my opinion that the revisions initially nominated were deletable. I agree with you that we don't delete stubs for being stubs, but I felt that the revision I described above was not even a stub, but a mere collection of literature with no "body" of encyclopedic content. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:47, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup per Uncle G. This AfD debate is a spectacular demonstration of how our eyes too often allow us to see only what we want to see and nothing else: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CBALL" title="WP:NOT">"If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be <i>well documented</i>."</a> And this one <i>is</i> well-documented. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 15:08, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think World War III is a considerably more encyclopedic topic than this one.--<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 15:25, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And both are "future events" that are by no means certain to occur, no? <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 15:33, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And one has <b>three</b> quoted references, all taken in turn from <b>one</b> book. The other has many dozens. Therefore one is a delete, and the other is a keep. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 15:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because someone can't be bothered to actually get the refernces into the article, even though they are certainly out there on the Web, is not a valid reason to delete. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 15:42, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By all means feel free to provide some more encyclopedic references and <b>content</b>; this is the only thing that might change my mind. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 15:48, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, lack of content in a valid encyclopedic concept is a reason for <i>expansion</i>, not deletion. The cites are well-out there - <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> returns 48 hits for "Sino-American War" (in quotes) while <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> returns 23 for the same term. People <i>have</i> been writing about this anticipated conflict. There is already sufficient material for a well-sourced stub. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 16:03, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't quite agree, and as I said, I would need to see <b>evidence</b> rather than argument before I would change my mind. As it stands it is a delete I'm afraid. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 16:05, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Evidence was presented to you before your above comment and it has been expanded after. Sources have been commenting about its possibility as far back as 1965 and if your&#160;!vote is not elaborated upon by this AfD's end it sounds pretty invalid. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 13:32, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, it does seem to be sourceable. I am concerned that this is going to open the floodgates for hypothetical wars between X and Y, as long as a handful of people have commented on them. This would not just include wars of the future, but past hypothetical wars which never happened, including alternate versions of real wars, if they started earlier or later. Reliably sourced speculation probably extends to all manner of subjects, not just wars. I note that commercial products which have not been confirmed by their manufacturer, particularly video games, are almost never allowed to have articles, even if there is 'reliable' speculation about them; Gears of War 2, for example. The extent to which we want Wikipedia to have articles about hypothetical things is a question which goes beyond this AfD. I sympathise with Guinnog's view; it's easy to see this as being against the spirit of the policy, if not the letter. Finally, this article will probably end up as a grab-bag of pop culture refs, like the <a href="../../../w/w/3/WW3_0695.html" title="WW3">WW3</a> article. We should revisit this in a year; perhaps the policies will have been made more specific.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 17:59, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> If such a possible war has been noted in reliable sources, then it is notable enough for an article. Just as the U.S had plans 100 year ago for war with Canada Mexico Japan, and Britain, I am confident that official and think-tank planners are making analyses of another possible China-America War (see<a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Relief_Expedition_a14c.html" title="China Relief Expedition">China Relief Expedition</a> for the U.S. invasion of China in 1900). But this article is more of a memo about how an article could be written from the sources cited. It does not discuss more causes for such a war than Taiwan, ignoring conflict over oil, and ignoring competition for markets for goods. It does not discuss the relative military strengths and vulnerabilities of the two parties, or their alliances, Janes publications should be cited. The relative manpower and the relative military spending should be discussed. The U.S has what? 5% of the world's population and about 50% of the military spending? With China loaning us all the money? And manufacturing an increasing portion of the high tech components? And soon to demand more food and oil? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Because of a rise in hostility between the United States and Venezuela, should editors assume that the rationale articulated by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> for keeping <i>this</i> article would equally be applied to a Venezuelan-American War article? What about an Iranian-Israeli war article? It is very possible, and commonly speculated by authors and pundits that those two nations may come to nuclear action against each other in the future (should Iran acquire nuclear weapons). Perhaps an article over the possibility of a future military conflict between Ecuador and Peru, styled the Ecuadorian-Peruvian War? Ecuador and Peru have had loud squabbles over their shared border for years. I can understand both sides of the discussion here, but I'm not sure that keeping this article is the right way to approach it. Don't articles such as these create a precedent that implies that any event that could possibly occur in the future should warrant a Wikipedia article, provided that a few authors provided their opinions on paper? No disrespect whatsoever intended here, and I would enjoy any responses.

<li><b>comment</b> It might really help to change the name, to something like "Possible future Sino-American War." . There are zero books about the war. "Thinking about China and War", "The Coming Conflict with China" , "Hegemon: China's Plan to Domnate Asia and the World.", "China Threat" These are all books about speculations concerning a possible future war. To use the present title is an unjustified confusion of fact and fiction. I don't see the point of deciding on the basis of our own opinions about what will or will not happen, but on the usual basis of RS. None use the term in the title. Even the ones that seem to expect it don't use the term in the title. Even the posts on google don't use the term in the title except for a single discussion forum. With the present title,</li>

People at the <i><a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_Eastern_Economic_Review_4c22.html" title="Far Eastern Economic Review">Far Eastern Economic Review</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/s/a/Asahi_Shimbun_1acd.html" title="Asahi Shimbun">Asahi Shimbun</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Florida_Times-Union_1ccb.html" title="The Florida Times-Union">The Florida Times-Union</a></i>, among other sources, are doing the speculation for us. We <i>are</i> allowed to document other peoples' published reasoning. Tossing scare words like "original research" and "crystal balling" without justification will get you nowhere. Lastly, show us the published reliable sources for all these other hypothesised wars you mentioned. There will be none. Unlike them, this war - or rather the spectre of it occurring - is causing people to act and publish things. In reliable sources. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 11:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

By combining their theses into one article, Wikipedia is drawing its own conclusions, hence <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovelac7_4e12.html" title="User:Lovelac7"><span style="font-family:times new roman, times; color:#000064;">Lovelac</span></a><a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovelac7_4e12.html" title="User:Lovelac7"><span style="font-family:times new roman, times; color:#640000;">7</span></a> 18:05, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Original research by Wikipedia editors is <i>where the information has not been published anywhere else before</i>. Since even you are not denying that someone <i>elsewhere</i> has published their own notes about this hypothesized conflict, these notes are not original research. The article as it stands now is nothing more that a summary of what writers of certain published articles have articulated about this possible conflict. Anyone with access to the listed publications, or a database like JSTOR and Factiva, can verify that none of the editors of the article have inserted non-published thought into it. Combining "thesis" that have already been published elsewhere into one article is not original research; to say otherwise is a distortion of NOR. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 18:56, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please read your own provided links again! What SYN forbids is: "A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position C. However, this would be an example of a new synthesis of published material serving to advance a position, and as such it would constitute original research." Position C is only permitted if: "a reliable source... that specifically comments on [positions A and B] makes the same point about [position C]. In other words, that precise analysis must have been published by a reliable source in relation to the topic before it can be published in Wikipedia." And I have presented in the article only conclusions and opinions (based on other facts) which are already published in the referenced works. I hereby challenge you to <b>quote <i>exactly</i> from the article any <i>unpublished</i> "position C"s, or else your&#160;!vote is invalid</b>.
