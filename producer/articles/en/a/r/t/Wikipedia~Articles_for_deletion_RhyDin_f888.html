<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This is, if anything , even worse than the other similar article nommed today, because it's mostly a long list of "satire" which is neither funny, interesting, or understandable to those who don't already play the game (and, in all probability, not to those who <i>do</i> play the game, either). "<i>Every building has rafters .</i>" Stop, you're killing me!

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are several thousand roleplayers over the course of over a decade who would most certainly agree that this role-playing realm is notable. The article is in its infancy, and needs a great deal of elaboration, but it does NOT deserve to be deleted. If anything, the satire section, which is NOT the entire article (or even most of its substance) could stand to be removed. But the entire article? No way. Besides... this meets criterion point number 3 in the Web criteria for notability, being distributed by Dragonsmark.com AND Ringsofhonor.org, let alone its solid place as a part of AOL. Also, I have been tagged as a single purpose account, yet the fact is that I am new to the wiki community, and this is simply the first article I have edited. One of Wikipedia's principles is "Do not bite the newcomers", correct?Sacredepitaph 15:56, 23 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Sacredepitaph (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sacredepitaph_aef3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sacredepitaph">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As someone who's actually played within this universe, I might be able to offer something unique to the discussion. <b>RhyDin</b> is nearly synonymous with text-based role playing on AOL, and has been since the eariest versions of AOL. It dominated the Arts and Entertainment section of AOL chat rooms for nearly a decade, and remained the prominent role play setting within AOL until four or five years ago. An overwhelming percentage of current AOL role players started within the RhyDin universe, and you can <i>still</i> find rooms open that play RhyDin-style games.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>With that said, though, I'll be the first to admit that it's going to be a pain in the ass to reference. Because RhyDin began as an AOL-only universe and developed in a quasi-evolutionary way into its current form, you'll be hard pressed to find information on its history. This is mentioned on the talk page, although not much has come of it. No new editors seem to have arrived, and my own attempts at finding non-trivial references that would meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> -- <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is inappropriate, as the game merely uses AOL -- have met with futility.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I appreciate that a merge suggestion saves all the work I've done on the RhyDin entry from being a complete waste, I still have to assert that RhyDin deserves its own dedicated entry. It only began on AOL, and has since evolved far beyond it. Although the <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_chatroom_game_f3d2.html" title="AOL chatroom game">AOL chatroom game</a> entry is also something I've got a considerable amount of experience with, so that may become one of my next targets for editing. Yes, RhyDin is difficult to chronicle, but I am willing to do every bit of research necessary. As I stated before, this article is in its infancy, and it is only recently that I took up the reins and decided to flesh it out. The Satire section has since been deleted, and my focus with the article is in the process of shifting. What it comes down to is the fact that this world has a huge amount of relevance and was a huge contributor to the formative years of literally thousands of people out there. Most people have since laid their characters, and their RhyDin experience, to rest, but the fact remains that it literally meant the world to many, many people. I feel very strongly about this, and I can't just let it all be for naught.Sacredepitaph 14:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> my advice in that case is to copy the article to a subpage of your user page, and work on it there until you have some verifiable sources which establish RhyDin's notability. Once you do, recreate the article. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy Snoodle</a> 15:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Oh, but of course. This article is not going to go away for good, even if it is deleted now. As long as Wikipedia exists for the reasons it is supposed to exist, I will give RhyDin the documentation it has always deserved. This is not about a personal agenda. This is about the preservation and distribution of knowledge and information. Sacredepitaph 18:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
