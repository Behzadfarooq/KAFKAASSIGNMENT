<p>Prod, deprodded by me, because of my previous experience with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_titles_of_Harry_Potter_books_in_other_languages_7ff1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of titles of Harry Potter books in other languages">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of titles of Harry Potter books in other languages</a>. Prod reason was "Not notable. Arbitrary criteria. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." I agree, and let me add to that: Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a>, and this article is totally <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>, and the amount of individual separate verification it would need makes it arguably <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm going to state a preference that maybe isn't Wiki-policy. I think this page could be quite useful and is about Diseny, something certainly notable. Rather than delete, I'd favor putting a {citation-needed}} tag on it. It really isn't original research but is a collection (still not yet in proper Wiki-form, I admit) of info from secondary sources. Am I going to get jumped on for this? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep to Strong Keep</b> I don't follow any of the arguments of the nominator. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is about verifiability not verifiedness (is that a word?). I tried a few and had no problems verifying any of them. Also none of the entries are strictly <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?donald%20duck" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?donald%20duck" rel="nofollow">dicdefs</a>. I don't even see the need to tag it with a {citation-needed}} tag, since the info is not controversial and probably frequently patroled by international editors anyway. (See recurring <i>What nonsense</i> interjections which should probably be removed.) I think the list is too unwieldy and also believe that all lists should eventually be outsourced to Wikilistmania, but these are not AfD issues. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:00, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. With (until now) 237 editors contributing to the article, this is probably one of the most verified articles on Wikipedia. It is also quite useful for, say, a Finnish user, who wants to read up on her favourite character <b>Pikku Apulainen</b>. Just enter it in the search box and bingo. Without this list, the search would produce "No results found.

<li><b>Comment</b>: on the contrary; though there are a lot of editors on this page, I found very few that actually came BACK to the page after another editor had edited the page. For the most part, all those editors just edited the page once, or a few times, and then never returned. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I'm desperately unimpressed by the assertion that this turgid mass of cruft "might be useful;" that's the usual last defense of the editor who lacks a genuine reason to keep, and somehow the <i>ways</i> this might be useful seldom are cited. I likewise see no reason to cater to the Finnish user who cannot operate her own language's Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 08:49, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, per nom and per RGTraynor. The arguments made for keep are distinctly desperate. "Just enter it in the search box and bingo." (Lambian). A Finnish user would be better served on the Finnish Wikipedia... looking at, oh I don't know, the Finnish Disney article.

<dd>I think the argument that when information is deleted from Wikipedia you can get the information by doing research outside Wikipedia does not work at all in favour of deletion. The number of editors that the page has attracted shows this topic is notable enough. The criteria for inclusion are quite obviously not arbitrary, and the information collected here is not at all indiscriminate. So why should this not belong in an encyclopedia? I've said before that I can't see verifiability as an issue. Finally, I do maintain that the usefulness of the information <i>is</i> an argument. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:36, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where is the line in your opinion, then? If we have this, should we have, for every fictional universe, a "list of names in other languages" for that universe? What about places? Or real people? Or ordinary nouns, verbs... this starts to sound like a translation dictionary very quickly: do you think all of this is okay? If not, where do we draw the line? I think the place to draw the line is where we can write ABOUT the translation and actually say something; to me, that's the equivalent standard that differentiates a dictionary definition from an encyclopedia entry. Most of these, there's nothing to say. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although many interesting things <i>can</i> be said about the translations, that would mostly be OR. Among the "recognized" main purposes of lists (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>) are information and navigation, both of which are provided by the present list. It's nice if you can create an annotated list (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>), but this is only one of several recognized formats, and the fact is that the majority of present non-controversial lists, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Maine_rivers_4001.html" title="List of Maine rivers">List of Maine rivers</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Army_installations_in_Kuwait_4d5c.html" title="List of U.S. Army installations in Kuwait">List of U.S. Army installations in Kuwait</a>, is not annotated. Should there be a list of names in other languages for the fictional universe of, say, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pride_and_Prejudice_c5b8.html" title="Pride and Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a>? Well, the fact is that Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy also in translations in other languages. So, no. <i>This is the case for almost all notable fictional universes.</i> But there are a few exceptions. I'm also in favour of having a list of of Harry Potter characters in other languages, so that a reader can find who Severus Rogue is, or Petter Pittelpytt. Such lists are not going to overwhelm Wikipedia, and unlike for names of nouns etcetera it is not something you learn when learning English as a second language and not something you can look up in a dictionary. I'm also in favour of keeping <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_2346.html" title="Names of European cities in different languages">Names of European cities in different languages</a> and similar articles, and I've tried to explain on the deletion page that the argument that there are hundreds of cities and hundreds of languages is specious. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:09, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
