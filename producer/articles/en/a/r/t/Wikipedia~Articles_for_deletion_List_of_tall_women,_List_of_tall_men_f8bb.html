<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>no consensus to delete</b>, default to keep. After substantial consideration of the arguments presented, that's about all I can say, except that the principal question - at what height should the lists start? - appears to me to be less an encyclopedic fact in need of sourcing, but a matter requiring the community's <i>editorial judgment</i>, i.e., consensus and discussion. Policy is of little help here, as several people have noted. I suggest a half-year moratorium on any further deletion requests. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:18, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, it is. "Notable tallness" would be established by any passing mention by any short journalist. Such statements as "Barack Obama stands above the crowd" or "Bill O'Reilly towers over his guest", recorded in media, will be "notable tallness". Are those guys tall? Yes, but where does this end? Damn near everyone over 5'10" has been called tall by someone, somewhere, and 5'10" is going to result in a list ten times as large as the current one. This will actually be a very big problem for politicians, because it is actually part of the spin system to drop mentions about height, since it's a fact that tall politicians tend to be elected more readily. Mentions of notable height are quite spammy for many occupations. As for "tallest people", if you mean only the tallest person in the world at any given time, this will have a very glaring bias for Westerners (Wikipedia already has a terrible problem with such bias), and if you start trying to break it up by geography you inevitably run into all the POV problems that border disputes bring in. Who's the tallest person from China? What if they live in Taiwan? It's just another invitation to different messes, no less tendentious, and no more useful for this encyclopedia. All the information about height can and should be noted in the individual articles of each separate person, so no information need be lost. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heh, getting sick of repeating myself. The first voter didn't exactly list their reasons either, rather a vague reference to comment they made on other AfD's.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - the only argument provided for deletion was that the list's inclusion criteria are "subjective". However, this (in my opinion, misapplied) criticism would extend to <i>all</i> lists that are not naturally-bound to a relatively small number. A list of countries or capital cities, for example, is bound to a maximum of 190-250 entries. A list of the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_suspension_bridges.html" title="Largest suspension bridges">largest suspension bridges</a> and of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_Paris_region_b7ed.html" title="List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region">tallest buildings and structures</a> (both of which are <b>featured</b> lists), although still finite, are much larger (in the thousands in the former case and the hundreds of millions in the latter). <i>That does not mean they are not encyclopedic and/or impossible to work with!</i> It is a useless exercise to try to impose a level of rigidity on Wikipedia that is not present in the English language itself, and that indeed diminishes the quality of the encyclopedia itself. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:17, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but with a renaming or other stricter criteria. Listing people who are of exceptional, world record height makes sense, women who happen to be over six feet, not so much (I personally know at least half a dozen).

<li><b>Delete</b> - Listcruft. I know plenty of tall men and women, but I would not add them to this list even if I could source the claim. This is a list of people who are notable in their own right, who also happen to be tall (which is, in itself, an arbritary claim). I believe that for inclusion in such a list, a persons primary claim to notability should be their height - and if that is the criteria, then such a list would have no more than a few entries. -- <a href="../../../q/a/r/User%7EQarnos_4a9f.html" title="User:Qarnos">Qarnos</a> 20:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - World's records in human physical limits are indeed notable. Picture the sales of 125 million copies of Guiness World Records every year. Evidently those people find world record's notable. Perhaps we should super-combine this discussion with all World Records.

<li><b>Delete</b> as an unencyclopedic and unmaintainable list. The argument that Guinness World Records holds such information is not convincing. First, Guinness typically lists only the <i>tallest</i> person - that is, they maintain a single entry, not a list of all people who are alleged to be "tall".

<dd>Tall is a relational adjective, by which I mean one that describes an objects in relation to others. Relational adjectives are a normal part of everyday English. Wikipedia cannot be more specific/rigorous than the English language (or, in fact, any other language) allows. As for you personally, does a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> note you as being notably "tall"? If it does, then by all means add your name to the list.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I most certainly agree: many, many names should be dropped from the lists. As for sources, not necessarily just record books. For historical figures, history books might be used (most books about Russian history note that <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_the_Great_2494.html" title="Peter the Great">Peter the Great</a> towered over most of his compatriots). For contemporary figures, any number of sources exist, including record books, almanacs, news articles (such as <a href="http://www.stevequayle.com/Giants/Russia/020919.Ukraine.giant.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stevequayle.com/Giants/Russia/020919.Ukraine.giant.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), etc. (by news articles, I am of course not referring to such things as: "the murdered has been described by witnesses as tall, dark-haired, etc."). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, however, I think the scope of the article should be interpreted as either "List of notably tall men" or "List of tallest men" (which would be included by the former).

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b>. The lists, by virtue of their scope as proclaimed by their titles, are inherently POV. "Tall" is highly subjective, depending on where your POV lies. The "list of tall women" article, for example, has a lead entry that is U.S.-specific. Separating the "basketball section" makes the list even more subjective and POV. Why accord a special sub qualification for a specific sport? Because to use the article's own set "rules" would put too many names into the "basketball" section. Because of this, the article is internally inconsistent. Bringing the other list into consideration, one can see that they aren't consistent as sister-lists as well. As of now, the male list starts at 6'5", with a separate section once more for "basketball". NPOV is impossible with these lists, as with any list that uses a subjective descriptor. In order for the lists to be NPOV, they'd have to be named something along the lines of <i>List of men taller than 6'5"</i> or something similar, and by using a value-limiter in the title, the lists would then make no sense.

Upon actually looking at them, I find them exceptionally well done, and encyclopedic. The placement in the list is quantifiable--it isn't like a list of best known anything.

The virtue of the name change is that it emphasizes he objective nature of the determination along a scale.

<dd>Actually, there are POV problems, as I've pointed out the previous debates. One such problem is that any cutoff point favors 20th and 21st century Westerners, especially Scandinavians and to a slightly lesser extent, Americans. This has been noted by several other editors before I'm bringing it up here. The POV concern that I noticed and brought up in previous debates is that arriving at a particular cutoff point is arbitrary, and since there's no "good reason" to choose 6'5" <i>instead of</i> 6'3", someone who wants their favorite person included can always come along and change it, and no one else can have any legitimate argument why they're wrong. An example, below in this very debate, is <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudo2_2bfc.html" title="User:Dudo2">User:Dudo2</a> who wants the list changed back to 6'3" so that <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Ferrigno_0964.html" title="Lou Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> can be included. Is Dudo wrong? If so, why? If not, why? There's no rationale argument one way or the other, so POV pushers will forever move the criteria around, just like they've done in the past. Now, as to the fact that this debate continues to be contentious, that's not an indication that there's no consensus for deletion. We've had many contentious debates result in deletion; the GIAA comes to mind. The fact is that one side here has consistently been arguing on basis of policy, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, while the other side wants to circumvent these requirements. A contentious debate can still reach consensus if only one side is backed up in policy. I do not believe that editors' passion is a basis for keeping articles. I've seen hundreds of very passionate AFDs go by, and the mere fact that there is a dispute should never be mistaken for "no consensus". Policy comes first unless there's a good case for invoking <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, and I've seen no such case here. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think we're moving toward retooling this as tallest or among the tallest. However "tall stature" is not a single height, but is instead a range that begins several deviations above average height. That beginning will vary by nation, but there should remain a subset which is tall in all nations. For example <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endangered_species.html" title="Endangered species">Endangered species</a> might be defined differently in differing placing, but there is almost certainly a limit that no nation goes below in defining the matter. What is tall in the tallest average nation, I believe that was the Netherlands, should be tall stature with all nations. That might sound ethnocentrically biased, but there's no reason every nation must be equally represented in all lists. In addition to that the 99,8th percentile of Vietnam would add up to about as many people as the 99th percentile of the Netherlands anyway.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>I think the idea is among the tallest. The standard can be raised if this is switched to tallest. If that occurs women and men should still probably be treated separately due to their being treated separately in anthropometrics or height studies. The Dutch starts women at 201 cm (6 ft 7) I believe. This might be too restrictive, but perhaps not.

<li>So you're going to replace the arbitrarily chosen height with an arbitrarily chosen centile? Sorry, that doesn't fix the problem. It's still arbitrary. T.

<li>I shouldn't have mentioned the Dutch standard, it was just an example. Anyway no percentiles and standard deviations are not arbitrary. It's the method medical science uses when defining "tall stature" and "short stature." I can get you the information from the National Institute of Health or Cornell or one of those if you need it. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22tall+stature%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22tall+stature%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Here's Scholar Google</a> results for tall stature. I think it's 3 SDs above average height. I need to learn more about standard deviation to quantify that, but it's not something I invented.

<ul>
<li>Addendum. In normal distribution it seems 3 SD is the 99.73002039367% percentile. If I can find something on that, or 3 SD above average height, this would go along with the Pediatrics site. I'm concerned I won't find anything that specific, but the issue isn't impossible I'd think.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<ul>
<li>There are roughly 6 Billion people in the world. Assuming a reasonably normal distribution, three standard deviations would give us a list over 16 million long. Even 6 standard deviations would be a list over 12,000 long - and that's just for people alive today. That's not a maintainable standard. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 23:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>People seem to have trouble understanding lists of people and your statement is a good example of that. Lists are not intended to list every person in the world who fits the topic. Take for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a>, which is a featured list. According to the <a href="http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/answerplace/scope.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/answerplace/scope.cfm" rel="nofollow">Epilepsy foundation</a> 2.3 million, in the United States alone, had epilepsy in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a> is not intending to list the millions of people in the world that have epilepsy, but is instead about notable cases. All lists are bound by Wikipedia rules on notability and verifiability. Maybe 4 SD would be better as even more limiting, only 1 in 15,000 people would fit that if I read it right, but I couldn't medical validation for that.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>Actually, 6 sd would give us only 5.9196 people.

In any case, no one is proposing to include all 8 million people who are three standard deviations above the mean (the remaining 8 million are below it)--either only those who are notable of their own right and are on WP or (more likely) only those who are notable for their height. Oh, and those 6 people above 6 standard deviations should definitely be included. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for clarifying. I'm not sure that it fully solves the problem yet. What limits will be imposed to keep the classifications from proliferating inappropriately? "Tallest man in the world" - sure. "Tallest man in the 18th century" - okay (though I don't know how you'd ever prove it). But at some point you get to "tallest blue-eyed plumber in Akron with a mole on his left forearm". What criteria do you propose to define the limits of the parsing? Without some idea about possible controls, this appears to merely shift the subjectivity to a different area. Do you have a mock-up of how you think the proposed article might be laid out? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 23:55, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I love the example! Here's how I propose we keep out plumbers with heterogeneously-pigmented skin from the list. If the title remains <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tall_men.html" title="List of tall men">List of tall men</a>, then it should include only notable men above a certain cutoff point (specified by an internationally-recognized height institute). As this is somewhat difficult, it may be renamed List of the tallest men or List of men notable for their height (in which case <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_short_men.html" title="List of short men">List of short men</a> should be merged into it). In these two cases, subjectivity is removed by listing only those people who are notable for their height according to one or more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. As for my "by time period" comment, I didn't mean to list the tallest man in each century (although I realize that's what it reads like). Instead, I meant having a section for historical figures who are notably tall (e.g., <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_the_Great_2494.html" title="Peter the Great">Peter the Great</a>). I hope this clarifies my intention somewhat--I would be happy to have your comments. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oh dear god, make them go away</b> - in other words, delete and delete. How there is anypossible question that "tall" is 100% subjective is a complete bafflement to me. I had hoped with the recent deletion of the list of tall men that at least half this battle was over, but alas the conflict continues. Drive stakes through their hearts, bury them at crossroads, sprinkle holy water and chant voodoo spells but make these ridiculous lists disappear. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> List with clearly defined scope, topic and inclusion criteria. -- User:Docu
<ul>
<li>It is most certainly none of those things, which is why it's on the deletion block again, because the scope has never been decided by consensus and never will be. You must have mistaken these for some other lists. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Coelacan, please remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. The only reason these articles are "on the deletion block again" is because the prior discussion was inappropriately closed and the decision to delete the article was overturned at DRV. Please do not (deliberately or not) mislead people--you may say I am not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and perhaps I'm not. However, why should I assume good faith given strong evidence to the contrary--you were one of the most active participants in the DRV and are thus <i>undoubtedly</i> aware of it. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:39, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are mistaken. The DRV resulted in relisting <i>not</i> because the AFD had been incorrectly closed, but <i>only</i> because the two AFDs had come to separate conclusions and DGG and others asked for a bundled relisting only so the result would be <i>consistent</i>. Unless I'm badly miscounting, the DRV had 10 "endorse deletions" and only 5 "overturn/relists", at least two of which were only for the sake of bundling. In any other case, this 2:1 margin would be a clear endorsement of closure; the only reason this was relisted was for the consistency that would result from bundling the two. The "on the deletion block again" refers to this entire recent deletion, AFD4/DRV/AFD5 as a piece, and it is indeed here because the inclusion criteria are arbitrary, that's why AFD4 began. I'm not misleading anyone and I'd appreciate it if you continue to assume good faith instead of making insinuations about my intentions. Considering that multiple editors above have repeated the fact that the list is arbitrary, I see no reason for you to pick out <i>my</i> statement and say it's misleading, when I'm reiterating others' words. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 03:11, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My sincerest apologies, then--I should have at least asked you to clarify your statement. When you wrote that the articles are "on the deletion block again", I naturally assumed you were referring to this AfD specifically, in which case "arbitrariness" is not the reason (instead it is the decision at DRV). The DRV resulted in overturn/relist to bundle the two together for consistency <i>and</i> due to a lack of consensus on the closure. The actual count for the DRV is 12 "endorse deletions" and 12 "overturn/relists" (I think it comes to 10-5 if you count only those who typed <b>Endorse</b>, <b>Overturn</b>, or <b>Relist</b>). Again, I apologize. I should have assumed good faith. As it turns out, by pointing you to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> (for the comment "You must have mistaken these for some other lists."), I did not follow a parallel policy (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 05:13, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No worries. Thank you for reconsidering my intent.

<li>No (but it's an interesting page), more like: Back in the real world, people are interested in this, Wikipedia is inherently well placed to construct such an article and Wikipedia should play to its strengths. Knowing who is known for being tall and who happens to be tallest are both useful in limited circumstances (and Wikipedia is, if I may be allowed this heresy, <b>actually meant to be useful</b>, and all Wikipedia articles are only useful in <i>limited</i> circumstances), and no encyclopedia has ever been opened only for serious purposes. Wikipedia need not be quite as serious as Holy Writ or the instructions for defusing a bomb.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And what would be the rationale for choosing 6'3" instead of 6'1"? Why is one more encyclopedic than another?

<li><b>Delete</b>, again. The proposal that we can og by "List of tallest men" is actually the same article, all these people are among the tallest in the world. The three letters don't make any difference. The proposal that this should be "notably tall men" is also going to be indiscriminate. Who's notably tall? What does this mean? I've seen men in America who are 6'1" be told "hey you're tallll." That's not particularly tall, but if someone wrote it down somewhere, suddenly "their tallness has been considered notable." This would probably make the lists <i>worse</i> instead of better, since when it was 6'5", while this was arbitrary, it wasn't painfully long. "Noted for tallness" would extend down under 6'. No way. Anybody can be claimed to be notable for anything; it would only take one short journalist to add heaps of people to these lists. Such citations of "notable tallness" can surely be noted in the subjects' articles if someone would like to include them. No need for that information to be lost, but it doesn't constitute inclusion criteria. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:59, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, let's turn Wikipedia into the driest of academic exercises. Squeeze anything interesting out of it. Let no reader ever crack a smile, raise his eyelids any higher or have her heart beat any faster than a dull thud. We truly need to squelch these eruptions of normal human interest. I'm sure that when we do, we'll all feel more important, more dignified, more <i>serious.</i> Of course, we'll still have the porn-star, pokemon and video game articles, so it won't be a total loss. (These comments don't mean to imply any description of the sentiments of Usedup or any other particular editor here, just a strong suspicion that these sentiments seem to be behind some editors' comments.) <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your strong suspicions are probably off-target concerning most of us here. I haven't got a problem with amusing or merely interesting lists or articles, as long as they are objectively bounded. These lists may be interesting to look at, but they continually erupt in very heated arguments and a lot of bad blood arises as a result of them. The reason is that there are no, and can be no, objective criteria for when to <i>stop</i> the list, and so arbitrary measures are taken to choose a cutoff. Because they're arbitrary, everyone's reason is as "good" as anyone else's. For example, I want the list of men to stop at 6'5" or 6'6" to keep it short, Dudo2 wants it to be 6'3" so <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Ferrigno_0964.html" title="Lou Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> will be included, and we've had others arguing that it needs to be low enough for <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Christian_Anderson_4d6a.html" title="Hans Christian Anderson">Hans Christian Anderson</a>, I've seen requests for 5'10" and 2 meters, and no one is "right", and no one is "wrong". If it were something objective, someone would be "wrong" and they could get over their pride and acquiesce to that, but in this case everybody's "right" and things get heated because no-one <i>should</i> have to back down and give in. On Wikipedia we have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policies that everyone has to abide by, and these policies are fair and apply to everyone so they defuse most situations. But these lists exist outside of policy. There is no verifiable objective way to bound the lists, and policy doesn't come into play to cool things. I'm saying that since the policies can't be made to apply to these lists, the lists have to go. I don't want to scrub Wikipedia of intersting content, but I do want our battles here to be about objective things that can eventually reach a conclusion, instead of screaming at each other in the dark. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 05:43, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
