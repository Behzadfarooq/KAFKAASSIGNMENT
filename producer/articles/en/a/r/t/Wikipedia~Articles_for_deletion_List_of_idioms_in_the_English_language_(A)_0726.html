<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>, userfy to transwiki individual idioms on request. This essentially boils down to a quorum over whether "Not a dictionary" is applicable to this list, with a strong majority in favor of removing it from Wikipedia, either to delete or to transwiki (supposedly most of the content is already there, which I didn't check). There is also a preponderance by "keep" commenters to opine based on the usefulness, which is not a strong argument as the information will still be available. We don't have a monopoly on free content. Lastly, there is also the simple problem of sourcing, which has in all the debate not been addressed. There is of course no prejudice against creating articles for individual idioms, as long as they contain encyclopedic content. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page is only a list of dictionary definitions. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. These already exist as single definitions over at Wiktionary, see <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Idioms" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Idioms">wikt:Category:Idioms</a> and this page adds very little to them. Unreferenced and possibly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</p>
<p>There's another 25 of these to come (<b>which are not nominated</b>), so consider this as a test case. Contested prod. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 02:11, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>It is, however, to be found in Wiktionary, which has several categories of idioms, as the nominator linked to, as well as several appendices, including <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_idioms" class="extiw" title="wikt:Appendix:English_idioms">wikt:Appendix:English idioms</a>.

<ul>
<li>I have looked, an impressive as that page is, it links through to individual Wiktionary entries, which in themselves do not provide country/region of usage information. They also do not provide the extended information found for some of the entries. How would you suggest the country/region of usage be recorded, as that is one of the intents of this article so as to allow non-native users of idioms to determine their appropriate use? <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 19:33, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>'Where used' information is uncited and occasionally doubtful, but wiktionary certainly has the capacity to store it. It's not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apples_and_oranges.html" title="Apples and oranges">Apples and oranges</a> is a good example of an encyclopedic article about an idiom, but it is in the rare minority in that respect. <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectro_bf83.html" title="User:Vectro">Vectro</a> 07:21, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wiktionary's guide to entry layout explains how to mark usages that are specific to, say, U.S. English, and there are plenty of entries in Wiktionary that are marked as being Commonwealth English, Australian English, U.S. English, and so forth, that can be emulated. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:53, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (all)</b> per Czj. Also your nomination is a bit confusing... how can this information be included on Wiktionary AND be original research here?

<li><b>Keep</b> Sigh. This page (and the other 25) were created to split up an article which had become over-long, using the same technique as in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_e36e.html" title="List of Latin phrases">List of Latin phrases</a>. The original article was created as part of a popular and well-contributed to effort to document the differences between different varieties of English, and is of great use for those people trying to understand cross-cultural issues, as well as trying to understand unfamilar idioms. It is part of a group of articles, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_Kingdom_9354.html" title="List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom">List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English_e65a.html" title="List of words having different meanings in British and American English">List of words having different meanings in British and American English</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States_481c.html" title="List of British words not widely used in the United States">List of British words not widely used in the United States</a>, which as a whole have survived numerous AfDs. There is a move to relocate the content to Wiktionary, but the proposers of such a move have not demonstrated the practicality of this, especially as cross-Wiki authentication is still not implemented, and lack of IDs on Wiktionary would tend to put off contributors, as at least one has explicitly stated. Pending agreement on the mechanism for migration to Wiktionary, consensus could then probably be built for such a move. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 10:31, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh and by the way, it would have been better to put the AfD nomination on the main <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_idioms_in_the_English_language_ef3b.html" title="List of idioms in the English language">List of idioms in the English language</a> and List of idioms in the English language (full), rather than one of the transcluded sub-pages, where it is far less prominent. Could I suggest the AfD is moved to there so the proper audience (videance?) sees it? <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 10:37, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I put the AfD on this article to establish a precedent for dealing with the other 24 (and the front page). <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 11:36, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Putting it on the 'front page' would have been more visible, in my opinion. However, I've added notification on the two 'front pages' and notified recent editors of the AfD. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 14:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That editors are unwilling to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pull_one%27s_finger_out" class="extiw" title="wikt:pull_one's_finger_out">pull their fingers out</a> and edit Wiktionary, which is as easily editable as Wikipedia is, is not a reason for overriding our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy. As for "pending agreement on the mechanism for migration": We've had a transwikification process for several years, now. I suggest learning about it. It's also unnecessary in this case, as Wiktionary already has categories and appendices that are <i>better</i> than this misplaced dictionary of idioms in the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:47, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't believe it is a case of simply 'trying harder'. For better or worse, Wikipedia is far better known than Wiktionary, and contributors are apparently more motivated to contribute to the former rather than the latter. I have learned about transwikification, and I have 'tried harder', and have an account on Wiktionary. Do not presume my knowledge. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">User:Rossami</a> is even proposing it for some other articles, but has yet to demonstrate it. Just because <b>you</b> think something is easy or obvious does not make it so for others. It might also have been better to propose a Copy to Wiktionary rather than outright deletion - note that Wiktionary does not give country/region of usage for the idioms that it records - which is actually useful information, and of cource citations need to be improved from the current non-existent state of most, if not all entries. All in all, I think the Deletion process is an overly blunt weapon for improving this article. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 14:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This stuff is already at Wiktionary, hence {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopy_to_Wiktionary_891b.html" title="Template:Copy to Wiktionary">Copy to Wiktionary</a>}} is unrequired. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 04:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Really? Have you checked every entry? And what about the 'where used' information, which, as far as I can see, is not in Wiktionary? Deleting information contibuted in good faith by many people will tend to put people off from contributing, which is not what I thought Wikipedia was about. My personal view is that information like this probably does belong in Wiktionary, but I have not voted Delete, or even Transwiki on the basis that I an not convinced that the current state of Wiktionary is fit for purpose. Uncle G would no doubt disagree, but I am sure that there is room in a debate for different opinions. Simply pointing people at individual Wiktionary entries, or a category does <b>not</b> provide a proper replacement for the function this article (and others like it) provide. To use the deletionist/inclusionist tags, I would probably be of an inclusionist bent, and I see little if any harm that this article is doing - especially as Wikipedia is not paper, and it could well do positive good. If the article is less comprehensive than Wiktionary, I can see good grounds for adding an introductory paragraph that points out that it is not comprehensive and that more comprehensive and/or accurate information can be found at Wiktionary - thereby encouraging people to look at and use Wiktionary. Simply deleting the article removes that signpost, will demotivate good faith contributors, and removes what would be a useful link between the -ipedia and the -tionary. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 08:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"<i>It might also have been better to propose a Copy to Wiktionary rather than outright deletion</i>" — No. I repeat: It is unnecessary in this case, as Wiktionary already has categories and appendices that are <i>better</i> than this misplaced dictionary of idioms in the encyclopaedia. Notice the fact, demonstrated below, that Wikipedia has got several entries <i>wrong</i>, for example. Wikipedia is simply <i>bad</i> at being a dictionary. There are many examples of mis-placed mini-dictionaries that Wikipedia has grown here and there, that Wiktionary has done far better at, often from a standing start. This mis-placed dictionary of idioms is one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:53, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We obviously differ in our opinions of the relative merits of the Wikipedia articles and Wiktionary. I do not believe that Wiktionary presents information collected together in Wikipedia articles like this one in anywhere near as good/useful/accessible format - so <i>in my opinion</i>, until Wiktionary improves to equal or excel the Wikipedia articles, I will not support a 'Delete' or 'Transwiki'. As it happens, I agree with the underlying tenet - that such information <i>should</i> be in Wiktionary, but I do not think the Wiktionary presentation style is ready for it yet. In addition, I do not believe that Wiktionary and Wikipedia are sufficiently integrated for editors as yet. Automatic cross-Wiki logins should at least be implemented. Where that particular project has got to, I don't know. In your opinion, I'm probably blinded by the merits of Wikipedia; and in my opinion, I think you are blinded by the merits of Wiktionary. While neither of us is likely to convince the other of the correctness of our views, there is probably a reasonable middle way. I think that middle way would not include a summary 'Delete' of this article, but is more likely to be a 'Transwiki' <b>pending</b> improvement of Wiktionary's presentation style for such information - so it is not a vote for a Transwiki now. I really don't think it is <i>essential</i> to delete this article now. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 22:16, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there is a great deal of debate on a related policy item about the inclusion of Glossaries in Wikipedia - see here: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Glossaries" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia_talk:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Glossaries</a>. Rather than rehash that debate here, it is probably worth reading the quite voluminous debate there as well, as I think the arguments apply here. As I understand it (and I am open to being corrected here), no consensus was reached as to their inclusion or exclusion, so a glossary's inclusion needs to be argued according to its individual merits. A 'List of idioms' seems pretty close in structure to being a glossary, so I would conclude that it is <b>not</b> a matter of policy that they be excluded. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 00:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So are the yellow pages. That doesn't make it Wikipedia material. This could easily be put in Wikitionary so we could stay an encyclopedia and not a dictionary.

<li>Wiktionary is already right there, and already <i>more</i> useful, since it has all of this and <i>far more</i>. If non-native speakers of English want a dictionary of idioms, they should <i>use the dictionary that is right there</i>. Wiktionary, after all, aims to document all idioms <i>from</i> all languages <i>in</i> all languages.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> While I like this concept, it has several problems. 1) It is better suited for a dictionary, and Wiktionary's coverage is already more complete. 2) There is no real standard for the information at this point in time. The areas in which these are used are pretty questionable as far as accuracy, and I think a lot of them are just editors making judgment calls. This alone isn't a reason for deletion, but combined with the dictionary thing, I feel it's better to improve the already more complete location of this information at Wiktionary and let this one go. DISCLOSURE: I got an unbiased notification of this AfD on my talk page. GassyGuy 19:50, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>. This list is useful as an encyclopedic article due to the depth with which it covers many of the particular idioms. I might choose to weaken my 'keep' proposal by advocating that the list be shortened to a select, group of idioms per letter about which multitudes can be written and they can be explained in great detail. E.g., "at sixes and sevens" is a very old idiom about which the history and cultural influence and relevance can be given, as well as information about its use in print. In contrast, supposed idioms like "at one's beck and call" are barely more than unique diction, not deserving of the title, 'idiom'. <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminatiscott_e45c.html" title="User:Illuminatiscott">Illuminatiscott</a> 22:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; Czj's remark has been sufficiently rebutted by Uncle G.

<li>My intention was to politely request recent editors of the article to take a look at this debate, which had (in my opinion) been initiated but putting the AfD notice in a less-than-prominent position, given the article's structure. The messages were placed by hand (no bot) on people's talk pages in as neutral a manner as I could, choosing all the recent editors in the last two pages of history that did not edit via anonymous IP IDs. If this was wrong, I apologise. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 19:37, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is generally frowned upon and seldom results in any advantage for the person doing so. However, it is not as bad as votestacking and since you are being open about it your apology should be sufficient. The AfD will still be settled based on arguments by experienced non-anon editors and not votes. Often what you see is a whole stack of votes going in one direction and with very little text to explain why they voted that way. That is votestacking and will almost certainly result in the closing admin disregarding the votestacking sides arguments. In other words, it isn't worth the effort. Because the system is open to abuse it is something we are very aware of and sometimes that results in well-meaning people getting frowned upon. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 20:57, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note: The following idioms (14 out of 35) are not currently present on wiktionary, thus a transwiki process should be preferred to mere deletion.
<ol>
<li>Airs and Graces (but Wiktionary does have 'putting on airs')</li>
<li>Albatross around one's neck (but Wiktionary does cover albatross as burden, and I'm sceptical about the definition given here.)</li>
<li>All bark and no bite</li>
<li>All piss and wind</li>
<li>All talk and no trousers</li>
<li>All over the place</li>
<li>All roads lead to rome (I'm quite sceptical about this definition)</li>

<li>have ants in one's pants</li>
<li>Any port in a storm</li>
<li>Argue the toss</li>
<li>As far as I can throw you (is this really an idiom? More of a cliche metaphor.)</li>
<li>Asleep at the wheel.</li>
<li>A stitch in time saves nine</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Wiktionary has had <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/all_over_the_place" class="extiw" title="wikt:all_over_the_place">all over the place</a> since 2005. "A stitch in time saves nine" isn't an idiom. It's a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proverb.html" title="Proverb">proverb</a>. You can find a whole list of such proverbs in Wikiquote at <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/English_proverbs" class="extiw" title="q:English_proverbs">q:English proverbs</a>. You'll find "All roads lead to rome." which is also a proverb and not an idiom, there, too. This is yet more proof, as if any were needed after years of cumulative evidence, that Wiktionary and Wikiquote are better at being dictionaries of idioms and collections of quotations than Wikipedia is.

<dd>My experience of Wiktionary's handling of glossaries leads me to the opposite opinion to Uncle G - that is to say, I currently believe that Wiktionary is simply <i>bad</i> at handling glossaries. I am hopeful it may improve, however. Categorising wiktionary entries as idioms, then relying on the category for the presentation of the list of idioms simply doesn't work, prividing a list with no context to the entries. Individual articles give no indication of where particular idioms are used. Wiktionary is not yet ready to take over the functions of this and related articles. When it is, I would support a transwiki. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 08:49, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> Falls between Wikipedia and Wiktionary, but insofar as the items require <i>definitions</i> ( = A phrase that cannot be fully understood from the separate meanings of the individual words which form it, but instead must be learned as a whole unit of meaning), that would make Wiktionary the better place. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 02:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Additionally, it isn't even the same argument. That cautions against arguing in favor of (for example) a page about a band because you particularly like that band. People are not arguing to keep this page of idioms because they especially like particular idioms, but because the page itself is inherently informative and useful in a way it might not be elsewhere.
