<li>Note - this is the second nomination, the previous debate is at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sexuality_of_Abraham_Lincoln_c8b7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln</a>.</li>

<p>I put this page to AfD for second nomination because of its biased intonation, also its controversial features. This article totally bases on a single view from a book "The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln" by the late researcher C.A.Tripp. The book itself is among controversy and a lot of other biographists and researchers on AL's life have made counter-arguments against this theory. Up til now no one can bear out the tangibility of the thesis. As I've said above, this article bases on almost every proofs that Mr Tripp used to convince his idea, which leads to the complexion of the article looks like a script of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. In other word, the article can be seen as a brief material of the book. Moreover, if this article exists, we <b>must</b> create another article called "Counter-arguments for <i>SoAL</i> thesis". Wikipedia is not a source which only reflects one-sided viewpoints. <font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><sub>Abelin</sub></font><font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><b><a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECausesobad_a54e.html" title="User:Causesobad"><span style="color:#0022b6">C</span></a><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln"><span style="color:#5170f7">A</span></a><a href="../../../c/a/u/User_talk%7ECausesobad_b57d.html" title="User talk:Causesobad"><span style="color:#69a5ff">usesobad</span></a></b></font> 14:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the great values of Wikipedia is the comprehensive coverage that it gives to topics either excluded or neglected by other encyclopedias. This subject belongs in Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia is the comprehensive coverage, which doesn't mean that it <i>must</i> contain all the research on a particular personage or an event.etc. Every given information should have steady reasonings, which have been justified by factual evidence.

<dd><b>Response</b>Tripp is the most prominent exponent of the theory. But he is not the only one. Personally I think it is garbage. But it is out there and should be covered at the length necessary to cover it in WP, which is probably longer than can be accomodated in the Lincoln article.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 17:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response to response</b>: Of course I know Tripp is not the only one who agree to this theory, but you should remember that the number of researchers who disagree to it is much considerable, most notable is Havard Professor <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Herbert_Donald_653d.html" title="David Herbert Donald">David Herbert Donald</a> who has been studying Lincoln and the Civil War his whole life and has published his own book "We Are Lincoln Men" in 2003 and says there is no definitive proof of Lincoln having affairs with any men. This theory is <i>still controversial</i> and can't find any reconcilement among the reasearchers. This article is a brief version of Tripp's book, so should we add another one which is a brief version of Donald's book? NO. Wiki is NOT a place to contain every research around a person. Theories around Lincoln are many, including "Was Lincoln a racist?" Should we need another article on this, too? NO.

<dd>You're commenting on virtually every keep. AfD may be a discussion, but questioning the motives of everyone opposite your side just seems excessive. You keep trying to play off comments as worthless, which I simply find annoying and a childish tactic. You don't get to discount votes, and I find the attempt sad. AfD does not exist for you to prove a point, nor does it exist as simple motivation. I will not go any further in explaining myself, as it has been done for me by those I have cited. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 06:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b>: "You keep trying to play off comments as worthless, which I simply find annoying and a childish tactic." First, yous should differentiate between the assessment about "a comment" and the thing that you call "a childish tactic". I use no tactic here, also I don't need to use it because my judgement is staunch enough to provoke your idea. I feel in vice-versa that it's you who play off the "<i>childish tactic</i>", in which you constantly mention my favor on Lincoln to scatter the prejudice on other commentors that I propose the idea just because I like him, instead of giving out "clear explanation, reliable citation and tight-fisted ratiocination" (as I mention above) to the dicussion. <font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><sub>Abelin</sub></font><font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><b><a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECausesobad_a54e.html" title="User:Causesobad"><span style="color:#0022b6">C</span></a><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln"><span style="color:#5170f7">A</span></a><a href="../../../c/a/u/User_talk%7ECausesobad_b57d.html" title="User talk:Causesobad"><span style="color:#69a5ff">usesobad</span></a></b></font> 06:37, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Pare down by about 90% and then merge</b> to <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. There is simply not enough material for it to be anything more than speculative, and such speculation, while may be appropriate on a biographical article, doesn't warrant an article of its own. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 18:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename or Keep</b> Rename, according to the argument proposed by Argyriou and Keep if his assumption, that the article is based almost solely on the book, is false. The article is badly written, the writer of an important source seems biased (he's a gay activist) and I think that Lincoln' sexuality is not important enough for us to have an article on it -- I don't care if he liked men, women, both or even goats as long as he did not act unethically&#160;; yet I vote for a keep because it seems to be a topic that is being discussed. --<a href="../../../a/_/s/User%7EA_Sunshade_Lust_fec1.html" title="User:A Sunshade Lust">A Sunshade Lust</a> 21:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but the article does need attention. The argument predates the 2003 book so it isn't really possible to rename it to be a summary of the book. It should be made clear that many of the instances discussed as evidence are "as argued by Tripp", rather than stuffing him into an afterword. Nobile's counterarguments should be more thoroughly aired. But this is a content dispute. The topic is unquestionably notable, and I don't think the existence of the article <i>per se</i> is POV as the nominator argues, and we absolutely should not have a separate article from the opposite POV as that represents a fork. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As I suggested above, if <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Herbert_Donald_653d.html" title="David Herbert Donald">David Herbert Donald</a> has disagreed with hypotheses on Lincoln's sexuality, then somebody should source from his writings on the subject as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Articles like this need to be improved, not deleted. "<i>I put this page to AfD for second nomination because of its biased intonation, also its controversial features</i>" is an example of precisley what AfD should not be used for. Why not withdraw the nomination and edit the article instead? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 11:15, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't know how much the article has been edited since this discussion started, but the article itself seems mostly neutral, and I don't see that the topic can be considered un-neutral if it has been in discussion for almost a century. --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaibe_6dd3.html" title="User:Jaibe">Jaibe</a> 22:06, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A notable topic about an important Historical figure. There is much discussion about the topic out there. The article is too large to merge but needs work.<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParammon_7bc5.html" title="User:Parammon">Parammon</a> 23:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
