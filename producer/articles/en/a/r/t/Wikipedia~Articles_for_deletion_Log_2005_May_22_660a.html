<p>Good for you, At least someone has shown an interest and hopefully this will finally prove that the Principality of Galore is REAL!!!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> even if the city council has in fact recognized this entity, an independant state must have international recognition, and no evidence of this is claimed.

<li>Dear all, The Principality of Galore HAS been acknowledged by the Port Phillip Council, There for becoming a new city council, under Australian law a city council (an area/territory) has the right to secede as long as the citizens within that area vote unanimously. That has been done.

<li>Asserting it doesn't make it true.

<p>OK i shall prove that Galore has seceded here it is</p>
<p>GALORE IS INDEPENDENT</p>

<li>Can user pages be moved? If not, you could probably speedy your user page (edited only by you, except for vandalism and vandalism reversion). You should be able to move your user talk page to a subpage of your new user talk.

<li>Stancel, since this is one of your own pages, you can ask for speedy deletion <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletion_1a12.html#Deletion_of_personal_pages" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletion">here</a>. Much simpler than a vfd vote. If you want to you can simply move and redirect it. Moving the page in the same way as an article to the new name - that will make the old "Stancel" pages redirects. If you want to, you can then put the "Stancel" redirects up for speedy - which would effectively remove that account. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 02:48, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>

I admit that the European English PROJECT is pretty new, and has only little support for now compared to esperanto, but this is not an original research, this is a project to improve this existing European English.

There <i>may</i> be an American English--the language that is taught in classrooms in the United States--but it would be wrong to assume that such standardization applies meaningfully in other countries.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a translator, I know perfectly well that there is such a thing as European English, although the article as it is now doesn't do it complete justice. What one has to understand is that English is used as lingua franca across a continent which shares a vast amount of legal, educational, technological etc. concepts, which differ from those in real English speaking countries. That's why there are a lot of English expressions used in Europe which aren't used in the UK or US (e.g. "external arrangement" for, roughly, "landscaping"). <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 11:25, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>neutral</b> it is much better now, but I dont know if it deserves an article. The EU style guide can be something that can be useful. But I dont think we should confuse the English used in Ireland and the UK (these people's native language and their main vehicle of expression), with the English used in mainland Europe (just a learning language). Maybe <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_English_d130.html" title="European English">European English</a> article would be just for UK/Ireland and English language in Europe for the use of English in the EU. But please include only factual information (use of data from the EU is a good source). probably, a conversation between a French with an Italian or a Spanish with a Portuguese, etc. will not be in English, but in a sort of a mixed romance language. Eastern Europeans speak Russian, it is their lingua franca. English seems very popular in Germanic and Scandinavian countries, there could be a section about that. It is not that popular in Latin countries, elder people dont like English, while younger people like it. In fact, the use of English/French/German in the EU is a declared weapon in Portugal for the supporters of the "no" in the EU constitution referendum, which the government and the president are keen to make, even after the French earthquake.-<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 11:47, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>But three interwikis is also three places where it has been regarded as notable enough to survive a VfD.

<li><b>Delete</b>. (damn edit conflicts) No references that did not originate with Wikipedia. The article doesn't even give the name of an inventor(s).

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is looking like a close vote, so I'd like to make a point for future voters: Even if this article survives the current VfD, it will ultimately be sent back repeatedly, because it doesn't answer even the most basic questions of notability and is in no way verifiable:
<ul>
<li>Who created it? (I'm guessing it was the Spanish Wikipedian who created the article)</li>
<li>Approx. how many speak it? (I'm guessing 1, the Spanish Wikipedian who created the article)</li>
<li>Where is the source of the information contained in the article? (<b>not</b> including Wikipedia or our mirrors, "recursive sourcing" is not allowed)</li>
<li>So before voting "keep", perhaps you should see if you can answer any of the above questions first. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 19:32, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Comment:</i> If more information (most notably, the creator) cannot be found, instead of outright deletion, perhaps summing up the article in a sentence or two and listing it under "Esperanto reforms" in <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperantido.html" title="Esperantido">Esperantido</a> could be an acceptable compromise. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 18:03, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment:</i> I agree with this last proposition. I discussed with the editor of this article (I don't remember in which language) and it has seemed to me comunleng is known by an only guy and it is not possible to know more about. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoLagrange_38c1.html" title="User:ArnoLagrange"><font color="green">Arno</font> <font color="blue">Lagrange</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../../eo/a/r/n/Vikipediista_diskuto%7EArnoLagrange_5adf.html" class="extiw" title="eo:Vikipediista_diskuto:ArnoLagrange">✉</a> 22:12, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did that; it's ready to be redirected. (The <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperantido.html" title="Esperantido">Esperantido</a> page is a little rough, but it's growing, and help from the esperanto Wikipedia community is being enlisted, so.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. OK, I'm just baffled here. This is like some kind of <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury_nullification.html" title="Jury nullification">jury nullification</a> going on. ArnoLagrange has just stated that this comunleng is "known by an only guy", ie: it is an original creation of the Wikipedian who first wrote it, ie: it is original research, and we don't do original research. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 15:25, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, unless <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">func</a>'s questions of 2 June above can be answered in the article to show verifiability and some kind of importance.

<li><b>Comment</b> The idea that ancient Ayurvedic texts specifically mention antioxidants, protein synthesis, Vitamin C etc is screaming at me, not that they would claim these effects similar to this, but that they would use the language like that. For example in claim that <i>It also works as an antioxidant, thus slowing down the ageing process.</i> I'd suggest that the Ayurvedic texts would claim they were anti aging, but the idea that they would claim this stuff is an antioxidant, a very western idea, seems wrong. The Benefits section looks like a modern interpretation of older claims.

<li>Well, I can tell you atleast 15 inventions which were invented in the East years ago, but were believed to be western ideas. There are several yoga <i>aasans</i> which anti-oxidise the human body and it is clinically proven. Do you think Vitamin C and anti-oxidants is a modern concept? Just tell me, will a common westerner understand a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word for anti-oxidants or Vitamin C? So hence using mordern terms to describe the effects of these ancient medicines does make sense.

I suggest that you read a book on <i>Acharya Shrishti</i>(i'm not very sure about the name), one of the founders of Ayurveda. U'll realise that how advanced their medical science was.

Languages are public domain, right? Unless some dacoit is copying verbatim, it isn't preposterous that the contributer is a native speaker or student, right? Anyway, I do see the point for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is not really that useful for tourists (anyone fancy a trip to Anglo-Saxon times?) but is of considerable interest from the linguistic point of view, in showing how a few common phrases are treated differently in different languages, and thus complements the various other articles of a linguistic nature. I would say this is eminently encyclopedic. If it gets too big it could be split up, perhaps by language family: constructed languages already have a separate article although Esperanto somehow appears in both! <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 17:34, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <b>strongly disagree</b>, being a linguist myself. The most important reason is that phrases and snatches like this are by far the least interesting from a cross-linguistic point of view. Look at the article: most listings are language-specific phrases lacking any grammatical embedding. Greetings for example are often fossilized scripts that are not comparable cross-linguistically — incidentally, this 'article' does not even succeed in spelling out any of those scripts (it only contains the English 'hello' and 'goodbye' and and their loose equivalents on other languages). Demonstrative phrases like 'that one' and 'this' are either not interesting to compare because they're not really phrases, or they are impossible to compare because of missing (sentential) context. Additionally, the very few full sentences that there are are not glossed and thus are still useless for a linguistic comparison on a morpheme-by-morpheme basis. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 19:51, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Absolutely not. It is unsalvageable, starting with the title.

<li>Mark, this page provides samples (however representative or unrepresentative they may be) of languages, often with IPA representation. That alone is of enough linguistic value to me, especially since many of the phrases are repeated again in different languages and so can be used for comparison. And if it were intended as a phrasebook, I doubt it would use IPA as most tourists won't know it and most American tourists won't be willing to learn it. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 21:11, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Most of the "delete" voters clearly expressed an opinion that a new entity can not generally be encyclopedia-worthy the day of its launch (or worse, the day prior) and that more time should be allowed before the decision is made to include it. The "keep" voters were less consistent in their reasoning. By strict vote-count, I count 20 "deletes", 20 "keep as is" (though ten of them had to be discounted as either anonymous or so new that they were indistinguishable from sockpuppets) and 6 "merge". Since the "merge" votes count as a variant of "keep", the decision to delete fails to meet the necessary concensus even though there is a clear majority (20 to 16) in favor of deletion. There is, however, an overwhelming concensus (26 to 10) that this should not remain as an independent article. Accordingly, I am going to call this one as a "merge and redirect". Relevant content has been merged with <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rose_5701.html" title="Kevin Rose">Kevin Rose</a> per the recommendations below. (If anyone thinks I missed an important detail, you can view it in the page history and can merge it yourself.)</p>
<p>This decision should be considered binding until there is clear and convincing evidence that <i>Systm</i> is independently encyclopedia-worthy. That is usually taken to mean that the entity has been around long enough and has had enough general impact on society that a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> article of greater than <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a> length can be written and that the topic is widely enough known that we can expect the necessary critical mass of knowledgable reader/editors to keep the article <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP IT</b>. In all seriousness, this isn't nonsense! Mishing is an actual pastime and an actual slang term used by Europeans. The article is accurate throughout and at the same time it's funny. The figures cited have a small margin of error and facts presented are indeed true.

<li>I seriously recommend that this webpage be kept. It provides an insight into a very weird (maybe wonderful?) world of a group of youths in the Liverpool Region of England. Having travelled to Ukraine on a visit to Kiev, (sorry, but i went to see the Eurovision Song Contest), I was informed of the phenomonon of "mishing". Apparently, the original three "Mishketeers", spread the phenomonon through a mutual appreciation of Liverpool Football Club with another small group of Ukrainian youths. However, in the Ukraine, mishing has more of an edge apparently. Mainly because you stand a risk of getting shot. Yours Sincerely, Bally

<li>No, I mean if we create articles on every single mosque on the planet, the sheer number involved would mean it was quite likely that the vast majority will not be regularly looked at, and could be vandalised without being noticed.

<li>No, you're wrong. If anyone were to make a pun on the word "church" (can't think of one right now) no one would raise an eyebrow.

<dd>It’s either people are very supportive of insulting Muslim's in the west that some try to come up with new definition to words to justify the racism behind it, or they are just uneducated – as far as the English language is concerned and this is the language used in the topic discussed here, not Spanish or Indian, English, the word used to identify a Mosque is very degrading and insulting to Muslims. <b>MOSQUITO: two-winged insect whose female has a long proboscis to pierce the skin and suck the blood of humans and animals.</b> - <b>Mosquitos: are the members of the family Culicidae; these insects have a pair of scaled wings, a pair of halteres, a slender body, and long legs. The females of most mosquito species suck blood from other animals. Size varies but is rarely greater than 15 mm (0.6 inches).</b> - There’s no justification for supporting racism as some people got out of there way to justify such indecent remark against a place of worship to Muslims. <b>I must have completely failed to see that an INSECT is the WEST is the way to identify with Islamic places or worship – its even more saddening to see others justify such remarks.</b> - I want no association with Wikipedia from this day forward since RACISM and OFFENSIVE remarks are justified and accepted by so called educated-people, rather then being corrected - Good luck to the non racist people. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECARPEDIEM_3826.html" title="User:CARPEDIEM">NEWUSER|CARPEDIEM</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECARPEDIEM_e232.html" title="User talk:CARPEDIEM"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:27, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> As far as I know (and I've been playing KOTRII alot lately), there is no actual information on Kae. She's mentioned as one of the Jedi Masters that taught Revan and thats one of the few times she's mentioned in the game. Its believed that Kae is Krea/Darth Traya, but I'm not sure.--<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> 10:22, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete</b> - This is far too speculative, and cites no sources. None of this is backed up by the game, and can at best be considered only a weak implication.</p>
<p><b>Comment Again</b> You loser, just get a life. Stop critisizing other people when you don't even know if it is false misinformation. This site would be better without people like you, <i>Kross</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>I have common sense</b> - Hey, Kross, just to tell you, I agree with you fully. Well, almost fully. You have made a good point about how newbies should not write fake stuff and put it up. Well, this is actually quite a good article, and if you cant even use you brain for once, it is backed up by the book: 'A guide to Kotor', which is both approved of and congratulated by Lucas Arts as a 'G-Canon'. Anyway, don't call this newbie stuff, the expanded universe is newbie, that load of absolute crap and garbage, so go insult yorself and stop being a low life.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Interesting. The KotOR II strategy guide says little to nothing about Kae's background - which includes lack of information on her supposed stay on Coruscant, as well as her alleged trip to Yavin 4. And, although I do not own the original KotOR strategy guide, I highly doubt it reveals information on a character that wouldn't even make an appearance until the next year. Oh, and a guide to a Star Wars videogame being G-Canon? Maybe that's a typo, because G-Canon refers to the movies, their scripts, the novelizations of the movies, and the radio plays based on the movies. Not videogame guides. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 04:28, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Certainly a topic worthy of an encyclopedic article. However, after removing the dictionary.com copyvio, the article consists of a number of claims that seem largely unverifiable trivia.

<dd>It is probable that these pages are mostly original research. 'Guilt by association' for this page is not a valid argument.

<li><b>Comment</b>: For the record, here were my explicit reasons: The article states a Lagrangian <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/b/4/4b4d4c8ca68d3b64782789fa92cd81ee.png" alt="L={s^2\over 2}+s\dot s^2" />. The second term would be called the "kinetic term" but its bizarre, a normal kinetic term would be quadratic in s-dot, with no additional factor of s. Thus, right off the bat, we have a formula that needs deep justification, and none is given. Next, we have something that appears to be a variational minimization of this lagrangian: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/e/4/1e4232940fd9e6831cd1691ea5311993.png" alt="0=\int_{0}^{\infty}[\dot s^2\delta s+2s\dot s\delta \dot s]\,dx." /> But this expression seems to have missed the s^2 term in the Lagrangian. Why was it dropped? There is no explanation for this. Why is this called a "coherence condition"? It looks like some ordinary variational principle, except a term is inexplicably missing. We also have gems like: "If <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i><sup>2</sup><i>s</i> = 0</span> then <span class="texhtml"><i>s</i> = <i>b</i> + <i>a</i><i>x</i>.</span>". I can guess that D is some kind of derivation, but that is not stated in the article. If this is a field equation, its certainly not derived from that Lagrangian. It seems to be saying that <i>s</i> is harmonic, but there are few harmonic functions that take the form <span class="texhtml"><i>s</i> = <i>b</i> + <i>a</i><i>x</i>.</span> Now, maybe if a,b and/or x were grassman variables, then this last formula might make sense; in supersymmetry, harmonic functions are always first order, since the square of a grassman variable is always zero. But this article fails to use the words "antisymmetric" or "grassman"; it doesn't even mention "Clifford algebra", which the other articles in this series did. Next, we have "the field equation <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i><i>s</i> = 0</span>". What happened, why is this not D^2? Subsquent formulas might make sense if the variables were grasmannian, but even so, one would have to assume that they were filled with typos and ommissions. Or something. This might also maybe sort-of make sense if one assumed this was a high-school calculus assignment filled with errors. Should I assume this is a treatment of some kind of supersymmetric classical differential equation? But to extrapolate to that would take a lot of work; and besides, what does "coherence" have to do with it? There's no quantum mechancis in here, much less a "vacuum state". This article seemed beyond repair to me. I VfD'ed it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 21:52, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page appears to marginal and possibly a crank physics page; the text appears to be filled with errors and inaccuracies.

<dd>Not really; I'd rather see <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pion.html" title="Pion">pion</a> enhanced to mention that 1) pions mediate the strong (nuclear) force, 2) that the Yukawa potential is a non-relativistic description for them, 3)the reletivistic equation for pions is the Klien gordon equation. 3) that they are pseudoscalars under parity inversion, 4) they couple to an axial-symmetric current 5) Skyrme's topological soliton aka 'cloud of pions' aka 'chiral model' is a decent model of the nucleon (proton/neutron). etc. No on actually "quantizes" pions very much, its a little more subtle than that since they're made out of quarks.

Some argued that it would take as long as 6 months for a renomination could/would be assumed to be in good faith. The majority opinion was probably closer to 3 months. Inside that limit, the burden of proof is very strongly on the nominator to show why this renomination is appropriate and why the community should consider the question again so soon."</dd>

<dd>While as closer I share your disquiet about this prompt renomination I am inclined to let it stand.

The statement that is was closed wrong is a result of <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">User:R. fiend</a>'s belief that a 2:1 ratio of votes to delete should result in an article's deletion.

<li><b>Some</b> admins count as low as 66% to be a rough consensus. I don't think admins ever override one another's judgement on closing a Vfd; it isn't in our interests to do so. My closing of the second VfD was well within the consensus on policy; don't assume that there is any significant opposition to administrator discretion on consensus--I think you would find that there isn't any. As a matter of conduct, I never engage in opposition to administrators who think I made an error and take steps to correct it. However such an act in the case of a VfD would be unprecedented and--in the current case--would be seen by most editors as utterly unwarranted. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:33, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

Seeing that neither the person who started the stupid article and the person whom the article is written about both don't want the article gone it is rather stupid for you to insist that it should be kept! Now the article, it seems, can't even be altered or added to unless it meets your approval because you promised to look after the article makes it pointless for it even being around anymore. If you find something offensive such as a photo you proceed to erase it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. According to the IMDb link, she's been in two direct-to-video B-movies by the same director.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Well, it's direct to DVD these days, and you can buy it from Amazon (along with virtually anything else). Not that many people have bothered to, it doesn't make the top 50,000. How many sales is that, and how long would it take to run them off on a PC DVD writer, I wonder? Do the people voting keep with no explanation want articles on all actors and actresses in those 50,000 films with more sales, or are they voting keep on technicality? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:21, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>First, Amazon isn't the only place that people buy DVDs (I've never bought from them, and I buy far too many CDs and DVDs for my poor wallet). Secondly, that isn't how the Amazon ratings work; something can be high one day and low the next (I've watched the sales of my own books go up and down like jet-propelled yo-yos). Thirdly, yes, I'd love to replace all the articles on Pokemon and comic-book characters (and hardware), and radio masts, etc., with articles on real people doing real things, and thus entertaining hundreds of thousands of other people. How many people do you think ever look up <a href="../../../k/v/l/KVLY-TV_mast_c99e.html" title="KVLY-TV mast">KVLY-TV mast</a>, or WKDR Radio Tower, or <a href="../../../n/u/z/Nuzleaf.html" title="Nuzleaf">Nuzleaf</a>? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:42, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> asks: <i>Do the people voting keep with no explanation want articles on all actors and actresses in those 50,000 films with more sales</i> Well that's not what they're voting on. This is about a particular person, not a class of people. It may be that this actress's face looks particularly sympathetic, or that the plots of her films tend to tickle the sense of humor of those reading the article and its associated links. It may be that some of those voting to keep are simply reacting to this article being listed for deletion for a third time in just five months or so, and barely a month after the last listing. All of these may affect the outcome of a VfD listing. I currently don't have a vote to make on this yet, but it's simply wrong to imply that those who vote to keep this article must thereby justify their failure to enter 50,000 articles on other little-known actors and actresses. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:02, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I can’t say I agree with everything the Michael Moore wantabe said on this articles talk page. And previously I had voted to keep this page, however in light of the info that she actually contacted Wikipedia. Ms. Nogueira actually writing concerning her page and suggesting that she wouldn’t mind it being deleted sounds like a polite way of saying that she is not ready for this type of publicity yet. Perhaps it would be wise to remove it if she is not comfortable with it. Perhaps also, she does not like some of the raucous arguing that goes on that sometimes even makes fun of the people that have been listed in an article. And if there is some sort of attacking of the page that has been cited maybe it would be better to remove it. I have yet to decide at this point. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlank_08b6.html" title="User:Plank">Plank</a> 23:30, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I have no intention of sticking my hand into a nest that's already abuzz, but the notability standard does and should differ depending upon context. X Google hits for a scientific site is greater significance than 2X the hits for a porn site, given that porn sites multiply links intentionally. Similarly, X hits for an environmentalist is greater than 2X those hits for an actress, because the actress is guaranteed hits via the movie production company, the distribution company, archival sites, and, inevitably, fans. If an avant-garde composer got 1,000 hits, we'd be looking at a world leader (see how many hits Paul Drescher gets, e.g.). The problem with straight to video actors and actresses is that the numbers are staggering, and we ought to be looking at whether or not a career (not a person) has been such that its subject will be sought by researchers <i>and can be discussed</i> rather than just catalogued. If all you can say is "Was in A, B, and C," then that's not encyclopedic. That's just a record, and IMDB is going to kick our butts in every case. An article is not just a fact, nor just a list of facts. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:48, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I give heavy weighting to the fact that the subject of the article contacted us saying she does not belong in Wikipedia and asking how she can delete the article. She said "How can I alter or delete an entry on myself that I did not create?" She then said "Also, if the editors of this site would like to delete this article that would be okay with me.

<li>To the two preceding comments: I replied to her message, reassuring her, and she replied to me (on my Talk page), thanking me, and apparently successfully reassured. Her message is therefore no reason to delete this article (in fact, personal requests by subjects don't in any case consitute grounds for deletion). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:41, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, but I started the page and if I had known that it was to have caused this person any undue stress, I would not have done so. It is obvious from her statements that she doesn't want to be included in this encyclopedia and I think it is terrible that you would suggest that her personal request doesn't mean we should delete it. I think that is rather insensative and I regret that I ever started the article.

<li>You can delete it if you like. I only added an entry for it because someone added a link to it on the <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a> page (not me), and they seemed to misunderstand that it was a <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitjantjatjara.html" title="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a> word exclusively, hence I put in the little explanation. Perhaps you can instead change the <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a> page to have a link to the Wikidictionary entry, so that this can be clarified a bit better. It seemed to me like there was a great deal of misunderstanding as to what the word meant, so I was trying to help things a bit. Alternatively, it could be expanded in to something that would be encyclopaedia-worthy, as it is rather a broad word. I am sure that someone knowledgeable of aboriginal languages and customs could do that. It's up to you.203.26.206.129 07:31, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, if I can be so bold, what I think is a good suggestion is to do both. Firstly, make a link from the <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a> page (which references Anangu as a word) straight to Wikidictionary (I am sorry, I am a newbie, and don't know how to do that). Secondly, expand on my article here (which is a stub) to make it encyclopaedia worthy. A word like "Anangu" does not simply mean "people". It means a whole way of life. That is what makes it enyclopaedia worthy. Furthermore, it can be used interchangeably to mean all aboriginal people, or all aboriginal people of an area, and has so many different meanings. I am sure that it could be turned in to something encyclopaedia-worthy with the right writer. Please can you change this to a stub, and deal with it in that manner. 203.26.206.129 07:37, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, just another bit. This particular word is also used with lots of Aboriginal businesses. So it could also be a disambiguous entry to link to the various businesses that use the word "Anangu" as part of their name. I can think of a dozen off the top of my head. 203.26.206.129 07:41, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - the Anangu are one of the more well known Australian Aboriginal tribes or peoples being included with the people associated with Uluru / Ayers Rock. The word does not just mean people it refers to particular people. I am appalled that anyone would nominate an article about a people for deletion. The article certainly needs expansion but nominating it for deletion should not be the way to achieve that.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 10:40, 23 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that that highlights the importance of having an argument, because Anangu is like saying "I am aboriginal" or "I am a member of a specific tribe". Anangu is not the name of a tribe (nor do aborigines use the name tribe - they refer to themselves as being from a particular country, such as being from Arrente country or from the Pitlands, or sometimes from a certain community). Furthermore, Anangu isn't just used in Uluru/Ayer's Rock. It's used in a large number of other places. I don't know the full extent of it though. But in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands, it is very important, probably more than in Uluru/Ayer's Rock. And the Ngaanyatjarra people have no claim over Uluru. 203.26.206.129 07:55, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This conversation demonstrates the importance of articles like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anangu.html" title="Anangu">Anangu</a>! I chose <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernabella%2C_South_Australia_0df8.html" title="Ernabella, South Australia">Ernabella, South Australia</a> as the most important town, as I'm from South Australia, and associate "Anangu" most strongly with Anangu <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitjantjatjara.html" title="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a>, who own (freehold!) a large tract of north western SA. You picked <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warburton%2C_Western_Australia_477f.html" title="Warburton, Western Australia">Warburton, Western Australia</a> in <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngaanyatjarra.html" title="Ngaanyatjarra">Ngaanyatjarra</a> country, and others have identified it with <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a>. Incidentally, I think I've heard Aborigines use the words "tribe" or "clan". It's a smaller grouping than "nation". I suspect Anangu is the "nation" composed of several of these other groups, like <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngarrindjeri.html" title="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a> nation consists of a number of groups along the Murray River. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 12:47, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have only ever heard aborigines refer to themselves as being from a "country" or "land", never "nation", "tribe" or "clan". But maybe I am talking to the wrong ones. The word "country" they use to mean their language group, such as <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrente.html" title="Arrente">Arrente</a>, <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngaanyatjarra.html" title="Ngaanyatjarra">Ngaanyatjarra</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitjantjatjara.html" title="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a> etc, while the word "land" can either mean that, or else simply their community/town or a smaller area like an outstation. We have maps at work which divide Australia up in to aboriginal countries, and only list the traditional aboriginal lands. Quite interesting. You can get one from Institute for Aboriginal Development if you want one. I think they are in the range of $60-$100 each. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInternodeuser_a2c6.html" title="User:Internodeuser">Internodeuser</a> 08:48, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hopelessly POV article containing no scientific facts, and a lot of nonsense (using <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_Dating_2221.html" title="Carbon Dating">Carbon Dating</a> to date something millions of years old, for example), written by a creationist whose only contributions to Wikipedia have been for POV pushing and for pasting links to his website. The article is about a subject that is probably not notable enough to split from the main <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article and which would be pretty impossible to cleanup and use.

<li>I have discussed this on various talk pages and I have seen others discuss this with you on other websites.

<li>Though it does present some information as fact (whether or not it <i>is</i> fact is debateable), most of the article is just a directory of weblinks more than anything else.

<li>The only content of the article is the Carbon Dating claim. That Carbon Dating found those ages may be a fact, but for reasons already explained to you many many times already it is not scientific because Carbon Dating is not used for dating things over 50,000 years old--if it is misused in this way it invariably finds an age of about 50,000, as indeed it did in this case. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinsky_9c79.html" title="User:Steinsky">Joe D</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteinsky_e9a2.html" title="User talk:Steinsky">(t)</a> 23:50, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this, which was never finished. But <b>Keep</b> Biggest-selling female musician, which was started by the same person but now presents arguments for all three possible answers. The value of that article is that it isolates this perpetual debate in one place, rather than having it mess up the main articles for the three artists. Why people care so much about this "title" is beyond me, but it's resulted in endless edit battles in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> article and elsewhere. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 10:35, 25 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with that title is that Wikipedia in many of its articles differentiates between a singer - someone who just sings, and a musician - someone who plays a musical instrument. Since Mariah Carey, Céline Dion, Madonna aren't know for their musicianship and more for their singing, the title is not strictly conforming with other Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 07:14, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The best title would be the one that's (modulo hyphen) used inside the article, "World's Biggest-Selling Female Recording Artist", since it's records that's being measured, not concert attendance, TV audiences, etc. If Nadja Solerno-Sonnenberg sold 200 million classical violin recordings, she would go on the list too. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 18:45, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pursue at VfU, if you believe it was improperly deleted. Content of the original stub was:</li>

<dd>"An egg cup, sometimes called egg server, is a container used for serving eggs within their shell. Eggs could be either raw or hard or soft boiled. Egg cups have an upwardly concave portion to hold the egg and often include a base to raise the egg retaining portion and give stability."</dd>
</dl>

<p>Personally, I feel this content is criterion #1 in nutshell (or egg cup). On the other hand, I think there is a US College football game that is known as the Egg Cup. I'm not sure, though.
