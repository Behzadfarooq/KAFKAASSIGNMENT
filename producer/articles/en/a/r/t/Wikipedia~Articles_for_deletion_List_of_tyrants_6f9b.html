<dd>An article that is listed for deletion as "irredeemibly" or "inherently" POV doesn't have mere bias or POV problems—the allegation is that its very subject matter and defined scope is founded upon POV (not an NPOV reporting of notable POVs, mind you) and can't be extricated from it. An article that is incapable of being made NPOV is clearly unencyclopedic and therefore deletable. I believe it would also qualify as original research, because the content then entirely depends upon how an editor has subjectively chosen to theorize or interpret information. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_that_have_been_cited_as_being_among_the_worst_ever_made.html" title="List of movies that have been cited as being among the worst ever made">List of movies that have been cited as being among the worst ever made</a> for a way out of this—that list functions as a report of rankings by notable judgments/standards. The delete votes here obviously do not believe this list is capable of being rescued in such a manner. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 17:22, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>I have created this list to move the modern POV out of the definitions of <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrant.html" title="Tyrant">Tyrant</a> and <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrannicide.html" title="Tyrannicide">Tyrannicide</a> and to create a list of ancient Tyrants.

<dd>If the list is too subjective then it better that it is in a separate list than in the two other articles "Tyrant" and "Tyrannicide". If you vote to delete this list you simply vote to reinstate the POV into the definition page which IMHO is worse. The list which appears in this article was in the Tyrant page and I removed them from there. There was also a list with even more POV in <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrannicide.html" title="Tyrannicide">Tyrannicide</a> which I edited down but has been reverted. Go have a look and then decide if having one POV list broken out of the two definition articles is better than having them embedded directly in the definition articles. A similar tactic has been used in many articles for example <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_occupation.html" title="Military occupation">military occupation</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_occupations.html" title="List of military occupations">List of military occupations</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">Torture</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Uses_of_torture_in_recent_times.html" title="Uses of torture in recent times">Uses of torture in recent times</a> --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:53, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is to remove the POV from the other two articles "Tyrant" and "Tyrannicide" which can then remain clean definitions with the POV restricted to List of Tyrants. For example at the moment the list of people on whom Tyrannicide was committed includes King <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVI_of_France_ad74.html" title="Louis XVI of France">Louis XVI of France</a> and Tsar <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_61a9.html" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a>. Two autocrats who are not normally defined as tyrants. If one can argue on the Tyrannicide page that unless the victim appears in the list of Tyrants then they can not be a victim of Tyrannicide it will help keep POV out of that article. If the definition of tyrant is changed on the Tyrant page to mean only true Tyrants as defined in classical literature, then all the better because the list would cease to have any POV. But leaving aside the NPOV issue of the of list of modern tyrants for a moment, a list of classical tyrants would in itself be interesting and useful, as I am sure that like me most people do not know who they all were. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 19:48, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>There are some (a minority for sure, but they probably exist) who would consider Hitler a great leader and a savior rather than a tyrant. There's a difference between an article that currently has POV problems and one that will always have POV problems. The policies you site are not the end-all-be-all of the way things work around here. Deletions occur by consensus, not necessarily what is written down. Past consensus has typically been to delete articles that are inherently or blatantly POV. I think that is an accurate description for this article. My vote remains unchanged: <b>delete</b>.

<li>Explain how a title such as List of Tyrants will always have POV problems. It depends on how the introduction defines Tyrant.

<li>An article on&#160;?tyranny? can discuss various definitions and concepts of tyranny - the concepts will be POV but an NPOV reporting of them is possible (just like definitions of Socialism, Christianity etc). A&#160;?List of tyrants?, however, must per se apply one of those POV definitions - the selection is thus 'inherently POV'. You suggest the introduction can define tyrant - but that introduction will be POV itself - it will result in a dispute and there will be no 'neutral' ground to decide it.</li>

<dd>At the moment I would say that it increasingly falls under <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A SOAPBOX</a></b>, Philip Baird Shearer. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is in parentheses and it most certainly dosen't say that 'suitability' is <i>limited</i> to its provisions. Again, consensus <i>will</i> determine whether this article is "suitable for wikipedia."

<dd>In what way is "List of Tyrants" anything to do with a soapbox? If you are refering to what I have written here, I have asked a reasonable question and your answer is that there are no policy guidelines to follow other than whatever is placed on "Votes for deletion" and votes which take place. In which case why have a Policy statment on the template? If the policy guidelines are not being followed why have them at all? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:39, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the <b>bolding</b> and CAPS seemed a bit of an overstatement, is what I mean. And, no, what I am saying that consensus can play a loose role in the realm of suitability, beyond perhaps all the provisions of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, fitting 'precisely' for every subject. In this case, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_general_knowledge_base" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base</a> seems to be fairly applicable, but my point is that so do other policies mentioned in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, such as: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, etc. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 09:57, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said above the title "<i>is neutral in a way that "The Tyrant Churchill" is not</i>". A list of tyrants is no more "Origial Research" than many other lists (please see my comments on list under <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_2c3e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research">Wikipedia talk:No original research</a>). So I disagree with you. The title is not related to any of the subsections in "Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base" nor was that the reason that <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> gave as his reason for posting this request. He wrote "This is inherently POV" which is covered in the Policy "Procedure for deletion" under "Problems that don't require deletion"-&gt;"Article is biased or has lots of POV" with a solution of "List on <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_attention_a7b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing attention">Wikipedia:Pages needing attention</a>." The policy does not advocate deletion. So This request should be withdrawn as it does not following policy. What is the forum for putting requests to delete "votes for deletion" pages? No action should be taken on this request to delete until it is agreed that it is within policy --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:49, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>further remarks</b> I have serious doubts about the very possibility of a NPOV in many cases. See my remarks on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToo_Old_9c4f.html" title="User:Too Old">Too Old</a> 17:18, 2005 Jun 10 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nearly all lists are shit. They are all too often POV -- for the reason stated by Doc glasgow (they apply one definition out of many possible). One person's tyrant is also another's benevolent prince. The big problem with pages like this is that they are sinkholes for shitstirring and editwarring. If I added George W. Bush, someone would take him off. If someone else added Fidel, I'd take him off. But I daresay we could each find someone somewhere who calls both a "tyrant". However, the problem is with the modern guys. Greek tyrants, I think, are not something we're liable to squabble over. There's a case for moving to List of classical Greek tyrants or something similar and editing out the modern stuff. Banning a page title just to avoid the POV pushing doesn't strike me as a great solution. But if it's that or this page, <b>delete</b> it has to be. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 08:28, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I wrote on the talk page and mentioned higher up this page "<i>I have created this list to move the modern POV out of the definitions of <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrant.html" title="Tyrant">Tyrant</a> and <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrannicide.html" title="Tyrannicide">Tyrannicide</a> and to create a list of ancient Tyrants. To be listed here they ought to meet the definition of Tyrant as defined on the Tyrant page.</i>". All the modern tyrants appeared as a list in Tyrant. The list in <i>Tyrannicide</i> has been restored since I chopped it and includes <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVI_of_France_ad74.html" title="Louis XVI of France">Louis XVI of France</a>. It is better to have the POV in one "sinkhole" than in the defining articls. Also the list now contains many people who were classical tyrants, so only one small section at the end will have POV if the editors of the page define tyrant to include modern ones. I think this is better than the solution proposed by those who whish to delete this page. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 08:49, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as the list of "tyrants" have citations then there is no way a list like this is "inherently POV". This type of issue has come several times before and I wish people would stop making the same mistake over and over and over. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 12:40, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> - I don't think I understand your remark Pete, what type of citation would neutrally verify that some one was a tyrant? If I can find a few cites calling Bush or Blair tyrants, can I add those names? If this was a list of 'leaders who have been described as tyrants', then fair enough (although most leaders have been at some point). But the lable tyrant is just far too subjective. What criteria would we agree on? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 13:31, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>How about using the definition(s) given on the Tyrant page and altering that if it throws up too many matches with which you disagree? The other way to do it is to find definitions from respectable organisations/publications like people have done for the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitions_of_terrorism.html" title="Definitions of terrorism">Definitions of terrorism</a> article <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:02, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
