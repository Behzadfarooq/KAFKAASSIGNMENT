<p>Hi Nareklm. <a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">User:Dacy69</a> has made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AMA_Requests_for_Assistance/Requests/December_2006/dacy69" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AMA_Requests_for_Assistance/Requests/December_2006/dacy69" rel="nofollow">request for assistance</a> in the editing of the Urartu article.

You are not named in the dispute; however, I note that you have been involved in recent editing of the article, so I would be interested in getting your views.</p>
<p>Dacy69's request is for "neutral wording of section "Ethnic Composition" of page Urartu". From my reading of the situation, it appears that Dacy69 would like information about the Hurrit tribe to be included in the article. It also appears that he has provided evidence that some scholars believe the Hurrit tribe did live in Urartu. Is the evidence he provides correct? If the evidence is correct, and some scholars are saying that the Hurrit tribe did live in Urartu, then what is your opinion on that information appearing in the article? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 11:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for adding references to the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigranes_II_540e.html" title="Tigranes II">Tigranes II</a> article.

<p>I have read some of the new articles you created. I have to tell you, they have made me somewhat frustrated as often the English is not good and there many problems with how the facts are organized. However, the subjects you have chosen to give attention to are good ones and I understand why you would want to see them included on Wikiepdia. I will try to clean up your articles as best I can but it will take time. You can see what I have done with <a href="../../../h/a/g/Haghpat_Monestary_8d1d.html" title="Haghpat Monestary">Haghpat Monestary</a>. If you look at <a href="../../../t/r/d/Trdat_the_Architect_ab4f.html" title="Trdat the Architect">Trdat the Architect</a> you will see much material was removed -- that is because you didn't tell us how it related to the architect. My first priority will always to make an article grammatically correct and able to be understood. Inclusion of more facts comes second. So, for example, I want to expand Trdat the Architect but many of your new articles about <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian.html" title="Armenian">Armenian</a> topics require more immediate attention. I will help as much as I can. I hope this message makes good sense to you and I wish you a happy 2007. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 09:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Narek, this article was actually made three months ago. There hasn't been enough substantial expansion to qualify it for DYK again, though. Maybe if the article creator expanded significantly, it could get on DYK. Also, watch for the wording there. "Annhilated" is a definite sensitive word, and would probably not sit well with Iraqi editors. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 01:44, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Please do not delete sourced information from articles, as you did with <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmiri_people.html" title="Kashmiri people">Kashmiri people</a>. This is considered vandalism.

<dd>Have you tried reading the Ahmadiyya source? The reference specifically mentions Kashmiri people as from Lost Tribes of Israel. I have no clue why you remove the Ahmaddiya opinion. I can even provide a reference to actual Qu'ranic commentary by <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maulana_Mohammad_Ali_a5ef.html" title="Maulana Mohammad Ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a>, though it is not necessary because of the source I provided.

<dd>To The Behnam: It seems awfully POV. Not all references are trusted, and even if you find POV statements that are sourced, they shouldn't be included into the article. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 01:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I just came upon the article once, and it blatantly stated the Rabbi's view as fact. I NPOV-ed it, and added the Ahmadiyya remark because they hold a similar view. I don't know anything about Kashmiri people aside from these fringe theories, but that reference was from the Ahmadiyya website. While I want someone to add real facts about modern Kashmiri people, no one has done that. I am not sure why Nareklm only removes the Islamic reference; it isn't too different from the Rabbi reference. In any case, it is sourced information, and the view of a significant Islamic movement, so it shouldn't be removed. If you felt the presentation was POV, just make it not POV, but don't remove the information. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 01:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know what POV you are accusing me of, but no POV is behind my edits. You also do not explain the supposed inaccuracy of my edit. I mentioned that Atropates is a Persian nobleman, and sourced this description. Your revert removed this sourced information, and thus you deserved a warning. If your objection was to my description of the article about the newspaper as an "analysis", this could simply be changed to an "article" about the political newspaper. Also, your revert removed various improvements I made to links, etc. Please refrain from such vandalism, thank you. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 00:40, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Azerbaijani reverted an entire series of edits because of one mistake, which I amended in my revert of his revert. You then simply reverted, no reason given. I will bring them up on the talk page. Apparently you aren't planning to explain what was so inaccurate about the last version I made, but you still removed sourced information. Now you are defending vandalism!

<p>He has been reverting back and forth, but I will only warn him for 3RR now. It seems like a content dispute, which means you could potentially be blocked for 3RR violations as well.

<dd>No, I mean if you revert his edit again (for a 3rd time). If this happens, then I will have to block both of you for 3RR, and I don't think you would want this.

<dd>Technically, no. I warned you not to do 3RR, so if you do it, then I will have to block you. Try getting others involved in the discussion on the article talk page. People may revert in support of your claim, and then you won't need to violate 3RR. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 23:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm saying you can't revert 3 times because I have already warned you not to.

<dd>Usually, someone will see a person with 3 reverts, and then warn them. The 4th revert would be a 24-hour 3RR block.

<p>Hi! If I am not mistaken, Yazdegerd stopped the persecutions when he lost the battle, but the following Shahs continued to persecute Christians. That is why Vahan instigated sporadic rebellions to force the Sassanids to sign the Nvarsak Treaty. This seems to be much more decisive, but there are a few decades that separate it from the battle itself so what happened in between deserves a mention. Regarding Mitanni and those theories... Our history is a long one and it is normal that people would have different interpretations especially for the more ancient years. We do know, however, that Mitanni flourished in Southern Armenia. Right? -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavo88_09f3.html" title="User:Davo88">Davo88</a> 22:12, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've read about this earthquake before in MS Encarta which uses the "United States Geological Survey (USGS), National Earthquake Information Center" as source. The Armenian king back then was Hetoum I. However, in my Armenian history book, there is no information about this earthquake or how it influenced the country. My same source (Encarta) also talks of a few other earthquakes in or near Historic Armenia: an earthquake in August 9, 1138 in Aleppo (230,000 dead), another one in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamakhi.html" title="Shamakhi">Shamakhi</a> in November 1667 (80,000 lives), and lastly in November 18, 1727, Tabrīz (77,000 dead). It is sad that the Armenian Highland is such a seismically active region... -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavo88_09f3.html" title="User:Davo88">Davo88</a> 23:08, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another thing that you might find interesting... During the reign of Hetoum II, the Mamelukes had taken Hromgla and had kidnapped the Catholicos and a relic of St. Gregory the Illuminator (his right hand). However, cholera and famine started in Egypt and the sultan considered this a punishment imposed to his nation by God for stealing the religious riches. Thus, he let the Catholicos, the relics, and and other riches go back home. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavo88_09f3.html" title="User:Davo88">Davo88</a> 23:17, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you ask <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> to remove the "Baku massacres" article? It'd be too much work to further investigate this (Dacy69's right, Azerbaijan was occupied in April 1920 and these incidents did not occur until May, so I'm not exactly sure what we should do). It'll cause too many issues in the long-run, just remove it. It'll be easier on all of us. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 14:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User space harassment <b>Placing</b> numerous <b>false or questionable 'warnings'</b> on a user's talk page, restoring such comments after a user has removed them, placing 'suspected sockpuppet' and similar tags on the user page of active contributors, <b>and otherwise trying to display material the user may find annoying or embarrassing in their user space is a common form of harassment.</b> A user page is for the person to provide some general information about themself and a user talk page is to facilitate communication.

<p>This is kind of old now, but, er, how to put this. What were you trying to do by moving the Amazon page to Amazon (people)? I mean, if you didn't realize that the Amazons article existed and didn't notice the link on top of the page (blind spots happen), then you could have created the Amazon (people) article, then edited in a link to it on the disambig page at Amazon. Even after you did move it, when you recreated a new disambiguation page, you left off all the summaries and a lot of the entries from the old page. Now the history of the disambig page is off in the "wrong" article and difficult to see. Hardly a major deal, but still.</p>
<p>This isn't to flame you as I see you've made a fair amount of good contributions, but I do want to bring this to your attention. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 21:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but 1,750,000 is more than 1,680,000, right? Besides, you should always use quotes when searching for things like that. Your method makes it search for the words "Greek" and "coffee" separately. The quotes make it search <b>only</b> for the term "Greek coffee". <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 05:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Second, you and your friend roob323 or chaldean keep using armeniapedia version about the Battle of Sardarapat. But not the whole version, without the last sentence. Moreover, there is nothing about proclaiming independence of Armenia twice or ottoman crackdown on Armenia in early may when armenia was independent. Whose fruit of fantacy is this? Yours Chaldean's or Roob 323. All 3 of you are kind of paranoic.</p>

<p>You accuse me of synthesising published material. Where do I combine the findings of different authors or sources to a new stance? Please be careful to what you state and before you revert again without Talk. Scythians have been abundantly asserted to be of mixed composition. So what information a generalized statement like "Scythians spoke an Iranian language" really gives us? Almost nothing. Anybody opposing <b>nuances</b> should produce sourced evidence on cultural AND archeological AND linguistical arguments. Tertiary sources are not sufficient to uphold a generalised view, that could easily misguide readers into thinking Scythians represented Aryan - or even PIE - purity of race, culture and language. Essentially Scythians introduced a new way of living into the steppes that can't be extrapolated to Indo-European proportions. My contribution therefore is not POV but meant to counterbalance a misleading lack of information. Please make yourself clear, in the meanwhile I will restore the better sourced version. <a href="../../../r/o/k/User%7ERokus01_014f.html" title="User:Rokus01">Rokus01</a> 08:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lets look the the basic common ground. There is no question regarding if these armed conflicts exist. You are having problem with a person who says s/he is an Armenian with an extensive knowledge on them.&#160;:-) There is no question that they existed, so do not try to bring validity questions by claiming I created the article. Where does your disagreements originate from? It is not from the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> side, for sure. Your arguments are Armenian issues which can render some of the heroes as a reckless belligerent person. Could that be the reason this period is silenced as you are saying "there's no information"? The <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk_38d2.html" title="Treaty of Brest-Litovsk">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> clearly defines where the boarders are in March 3, 1918. I look at the ongoing discussions and changes made at the page. I want to point out something. You know, establishment of a state is before the people of the state declare it "internationally". The military power of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Republic_of_Armenia_cf42.html" title="Democratic Republic of Armenia">Democratic Republic of Armenia</a> did not established in a single day, as some want to claim, The miracle day is 28 May, 1918. If you think the details of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a> is a big issue? The details of this war is bigger, as all these conflicts are part of "the Armenians: Past and Present in the Making of National Identity". Remember, these patriots wanted to keep the land and their main goal was to declare the republic. They declared the republic but... In 1918 there was famine and sickness in these lands, and these are heroic victories (not on the Ottoman side) are very controversial. You have to recognize that the people who declared the Armenia is the same people that build the Armenian resistance between 1915-1918. I guess, we can eliminate the argument that they are aliens coming from alpha-century, and they have no responsibility of shaping the grand picture. That is the reason details are really important for this group, so that they can have a perfect nationhood. Today, I can not add a basic fact to Armenian Genocide as anything beyond the simplistic view is rejected by Armenians, what makes you think that I can be part of basically an Armenian NATIONAL issue. It is time for Armenians looking from a bigger window. The Armenians that died during this period deserve a better analysis. I hope you will continue digging the events, which will be very educational to all parties. <b>I would like to see some citations, but all sides brought their arguments without citations.</b> PS: from Ottoman Empire perspective, the location of military forces are defined by <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice_of_Mudros_9e6a.html" title="Armistice of Mudros">Armistice of Mudros</a>.

<dd>Your going a little far there, heh, well i don't know if you had any education on this, i wasn't accusing you of anything i was just wondering, by the way by "famine and sickness" you were referring to the Armenian Genocide right? but don't you think all the deportations caused this? thats my analysis. Even if the ottomans made Armenians walk and leave there homes out of "war zones" they still were responsibly, im not a person who shoves the genocide through someones throat and accuses them, this was obviously a small case that turned big. Maybe it wasn't the Turks intention for the Armenians to die, look at the pictures, if the Turks were barbaric why would they make the Armenians walk? why didn't they kill them already? and cut there heads off or something, eh what do i care let the historians debate this and initialize it. <font color="#0099FF">Nareklm</font> 13:33, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not know, what to say to you. I'm not genocide denier. The problems you are facing (if you follow the lead) is a little bit complex. <b>Not everything in Armenian history can be explained by Ottomans, or genocide.</b> As I said, it is hard to move within Armenian national issues, so many deep wells. Also, there is always that ottoman factor that pops up, like pop-ups of MTV. I guess Ottoman Empire was like USA of today; remember the claims of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_tsunami.html" title="Indian tsunami">Indian tsunami</a> caused by a military submarine. &#160;:-) AND Armenians need to remember that people walked from both sides. People walked in the war zones, even today (see:<a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_Fallujah_fd37.html" title="First Battle of Fallujah">First Battle of Fallujah</a>). I was not thinking about walking Armenians. I believe the issues that Yerevan had faced was more than just walking Armenians. What I'm saying is simple. Turks needs to do some digging, but Armenians do not? Just look at the battles that happened during the Europe side of WWI. Some of those battles includes less military force and smaller civilian effects. There is much more to this period beyond the arguments of (the battle) existence or who won the battle. AND only Armenians can walk that path as anything that may come from ottoman side would be a "denial of genocide". It sounds like a cover-up plot for preventing deeper analysis.

<p>I've blocked you and Dacy69 for 24 hours because you need to cool down and rethink your attitude. This block is not a punishment, it's an attempt to get your attention. Allow me to offer some unsolicited advice. This is not a template pasted to your talk page, so I'd appreciate if you thought about what I have to say. Your petty bickering with Dacy69 is not productive, and your are making way to many reverts. This is a problem because hostile attitudes and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">battleground mentalities</a> hinder proper collaborative editing and progress. In particular, when you get into a dispute with another editor, even one you think is pushing a POV abhorrent to you, take your time in writing comments, and don't let yourself get worked up. Sometimes you will even have to deal with unreasonable people; we all have. We need to do this tactfully. Consider that perhaps the other editor perceives you in the same way. Rather than doing things like reporting them to administrators for blocks, or trying to prove their misconduct; imagine how you would feel if someone "reported" you for alleged misbehavior: you wouldn't like it. It would escalate the conflict. Instead, remain cordial and don't engage in petty behavior outside of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> (discussion/mediation). If simple discussion isn't working, or you notice that it's getting heated quickly, disengage from the conflict and seek outside opinions and mediation, and be willing to make a serious attempt at compromise. I'm concerned that your recent behavior - excessive reverts and sniping - are in the opposite of this collaborative, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> community spirit. Hopefully you'll make use of this short time off to familiarize yourself with the various <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> precesses, and hopefully to draw up a <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDCAB_20f1.html" title="WP:MEDCAB">mediation request</a> to resolve the conflict amicably.

<p>Hi, thanks for helping with patroling image copyrights. However, I think you needn't tag those images from www.euro-caspian.com, the website has plausibly confirmed that its owner is identical with the image uploader, so those should be okay. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 14:03, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, I see your point, but most of the images really don't look implausible - they are not particularly professional or anything like that, so I find it entirely believable that some guy who owns that website just took them himself. Or have you found any of them on other third-party websites that make a stronger, more plausible claim to be the creators? Have you asked the uploader to comment? As long as we have no actual evidence that something is fishy, I guess we can afford to take their word for it - if it turns out to be a copyvio after all, it's their problem, not ours. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 14:11, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, seems you have a point. That etravels.cz page isn't making an explicit claim to authorship either, but those are embedded into series of photographs clearly taken by the same person, with more images than on the euro-caspian site, and the same person also having traveled through other countris; that would make them the more likely owners.

<p>The request for Arbitration is meant to present the cases to be heard, one Arbitrator(the administrator who submitted the case and who resigned) left and I don't think he was replaced, so the case will be heard. No need to add more evidence. I also highly advice you to read how the arbitration works and other past cases anf familiarise with how evidences are presented. There is no point to document on every Azeri users, neither retaliating against those who submit evidences against you. You should only provide evidences against those who you think Administrators shal take action against.

<dd>Arbitration does not take vengence and its decisions are not punishing but protect the system(Wikipedia). Take this as an experience, and if you are "sentenced" for anything you should not be pissed, no one beside Adil have done anything to get very heavy "sentences" beside maybe me, for my personal attacks against some members. Your use of sock was not a good thing, you should have never done that, this was basically why I ignored your last email, I didn't like what you did. The mistake was done, we can't change the past, but we can have an impact on the future. Right now work on your evidences, accumulate as much as you can, work it on a subsection of your userpage.

It is true that you have been warned, don't worry you haven't done anything major, the only person who did is Adil and his meatpuppets. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:46, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is just more than simple IP uses, check Urartu article history, Tabib was involved in the past, the probability that either Dacy or Atabek is him is very high. BTW, don't get involved on image copyright stuff, just contribute in Armenian related articles, don't "invade" Azeri one, this will be viewed as retaliation to Adil invasion of Armenian articles. If you know Russian, you can be of great help to find out under which account Tabib has contributed on Russian wikipedia, when he stoped contributing, when Dacy appeared in the picture there, and if there was an Atabek etc. The IP's you find, check if they have contributed there and also the IP's from ru to here. While their possible misbehavior on Russian Wikipedia can not be used as evidence, this might help for the cronology of the event and better understanding for me to prepare my evidence and find where else to check. There is definitive organization and I intend to find it out. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm writing again as a Clerk for the Arbitration Committee. You have placed responses or rebuttal in another user's section on the evidence page. As the instructions indicate, each user should place evidence in his or her section only, and subject to a length limit of approximately 1000 words. Since as far as I know this is your first experience with arbitration, rather than simply going ahead and removing the threaded discussion I am giving you 24 hours to remove what you have put in other people's sections and incorporate it, if you see fit, in your own section within the overall limit. Thank you for your anticipated cooperation. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC) <span id="63298079294"></span></p>

<p>Check out some of the new admins. Basically, they participate in many facets of Wikipedia, like article editing, AIV, RFPP, XfD, etc. My only concern about you going up for adminship is the whole frequent edit war situation. The same thing happened to Khoikhoi when he went up for adminship, and he had almost 40,000 edits when he finally got it. Knowing your work, I know it's hard to get into disputes, and that's perfectly fine. I don't know about your civility, but be civil to users you are in a discussion with, and I think that would really help your cause. I was considering nominating you, but I'd prefer to wait until everything is checked out. And adminship is harder than it seems. You're frequently asked to deal with issues, and help mediate disputes between multiple users. It's sticky business. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 23:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know why you're asking me this question. Yes, Askeran clashes and first two Azeris shot was the beginning of the contemporary NK conflict, which pursued with 26 Armenians killed in Sumgayit, 200,000 Azeris deported from Armenia, 250,000 Armenians deported from Azerbaijan, some 500 Azeris brutally massacred with mutilations in Khojaly, and 600-700,000 Azeris deported from Karabakh and other surrounding regions of Azerbaijan, final count about 30,000 total killed on both sides. The facts are there, many, including myself, witnessed some of those. I don't see why that should raise any questions. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 01:30, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
