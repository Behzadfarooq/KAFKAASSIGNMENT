<dd><b>(The following are my reasons, they were also addressed in the talk page for this so the style reflects this as I pasted them here as well.)</b>
<ul>
<li>First, the sources listed for '<a href="../../../p/r/o/Producerism.html" title="Producerism">producerism</a>' are <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">questionable</a> including a <a href="http://producerism.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://producerism.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">personal advocacy</a> page set up by someone.</li>
<li>Second, (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">GUILT BY ASSOCIATION</a>) Most of the people or groups listed as 'producerites' or whatever you call them are people, groups, party's who associate themselves with the traditional economic views of: <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_McKinley_c296.html" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>; or their party's: <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_Party_%28United_States%29_e117.html" title="Federalist Party (United States)">Federalist</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_Party_%28United_States%29_806f.html" title="Whig Party (United States)">Whig</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> (whose philosophy from 1861-1930's is mostly like Buchanan's today with a few exceptions) or the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a>; called the <b>American System</b> by Senator <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a> of Kentucky.</li>
<li>Third, the 'producerism' article is an attack on that above mentioned system of economics and its proponents, grouping them as one and the same on all issues which is dubious to the extreme. For example, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Buchanan_d9ff.html" title="Patrick Buchanan">Buchanan</a> is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">Conservative</a> on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_policy.html" title="Social policy">social policy</a>, but believes in a mild form of the old <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> of <b>Hamilton</b> and <b>Lincoln</b>, whereas, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Perot</a>'s ideas and those in the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America_7861.html" title="Reform Party of the United States of America">Reform Party</a> are in line with the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> of economics mostly but he and the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America_7861.html" title="Reform Party of the United States of America">Reform Party</a> are neutral or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressive</a> (in some circumstances) on social policy. These men and party's and their <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> overall are not interchangeable and conflict on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_policy.html" title="Social policy">social policy</a> and therefore do not hold to a unified system such as 'producerism' at all.</li>
<li>Fourth, the personal attacks made on <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Larouche_d52f.html" title="Lyndon Larouche">Lyndon Larouche</a> (alluded to on his page here at Wikipedia) and others like <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">H. Ross Perot</a> (also in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracism.html" title="Conspiracism">conspiracism</a> (another dubious term) page and your <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">personal page</a>) are obvious to your intentions and beliefs. <i><b>You have a right to oppose the traditional economic system of men like <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Lincoln</a> but not to <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defamation.html" title="Defamation">defame</a> someones character in the process!</b></i> You can also label anything as an 'ism...like anti-American Systemism, if you will, as these pages are doing. These personal attacks are <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defamation.html" title="Defamation">defamation</a> of character and obvious <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">bias</a> attacks. <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Larouche_d52f.html" title="Lyndon Larouche">LaRouche</a> is an <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economist.html" title="Economist">economist</a> who embraces the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>.

Neither does <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Buchanan_d9ff.html" title="Patrick Buchanan">Buchanan</a> who is no different from other <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republicans</a> except he does not toe the line on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_policy.html" title="Foreign policy">foreign policy</a> (he holds to the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional.html" title="Traditional">traditional</a> policy of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_country.html" title="Neutral country">neutrality</a> expressed by Washington in his <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%27s_Farewell_Address_7f0a.html" title="Washington's Farewell Address">Farewell Address</a> mostly) or economics (he holds to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> (Philadelphia School) of Economics of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Ben Franklin</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_C._Carey_d8a1.html" title="Henry C.

<li>Fifth, I am an educated man holding a degree in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_Science_9900.html" title="Political Science">Political Science</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">History</a> with particular concentration on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_History_3d4e.html" title="American History">American History</a>. I have never heard of the word 'producerism' either in my field or in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a> before, except here and on a <a href="http://producerism.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://producerism.org/about.html" rel="nofollow"><b>website</b></a> linked from here that is quite odd and does not contain a <b>DEFINITION of PRODUCERISM</b> that fits the men and the philosophies already mentioned <i>making this article even more suspicious</i>! The 'producerism' page wishes to give a negative impression to anyone who believes not in <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laissez_faire.html" title="Laissez faire">laissez faire</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> economics (Austrian School) or Planned Economy <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> economics (Marxist School) but in Traditional Capitalism or <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_1f67.html" title="American System">American System</a> (Philadelphia School) of economics as practiced by our nation prior to the 1970's, by associating it with such things as <i>Nazis, Fascists, Communists</i> and other negative groups whose sin was <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranny.html" title="Tyranny">Tyranny</a> (see below).</li>
<li>Sixth, and this is a problem on the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> links as well...Fascism's main point is rule by an elite or single man combined with private ownership of corporations (sometimes less so as in Fascist Italy that was more <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialistic.html" title="Socialistic">Socialistic</a> in nature). Like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, it is a <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranny.html" title="Tyranny">TYRANNY</a>, not because it attempts to regulate the economy in this way or that (as many philosophies share the same traits depending on belief see <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">Association fallacy</a> on Wikipedia) but because of its restriction on individual <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">LIBERTY</a> (the freedom to do all you wish to do so long as no physical harm is done to others) or invasions into ones <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privacy.html" title="Privacy">private life</a>. Not understanding this causes confusion and allows attackers of any belief system to try to lump different political philosophies through a <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">GUILT BY ASSOCIATION</a> technique trying to discredit them.</li>
<li>Seventh, an article in <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia</a> should be as neutral as possible, simply description with true example etc. It should not be made up stuff, (any 'ISM could be proposed then!) in order to attack people like Mr. <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Larouche_d52f.html" title="Lyndon Larouche">Larouche</a> (your <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">personal page</a> states your <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusade</a> against another 'ism Larouchism? <b>Everything isn't an 'ism</b>!) or <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Perot</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Buchanan_d9ff.html" title="Patrick Buchanan">Buchanan</a> or by association some of America's Founder's like <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">1st U.S. Treasury Secretary Hamilton</a> or America's Father's like <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">President Lincoln</a> who believed the same way as the before mentioned men on economic matters.

<dd>Comments: <b>Producerism.</b> I did not create the page on producerism, contrary to the false claim by Northmeister. The term is used in political science, history, and sociology, not as a guilt by association canard, contrary to the false and hyperbolic claims by Northmeister. Academic cites are listed on the page. <b>Conspiracism.</b> A term used in academia, and popularized by Mintz, an academic. This is another attempt by a fan of convicted criminal and crackpot Lyndon LaRouche to delete material that is critical of the type of conspiracy theories and dubious right-wing populist economic theories promoted by the LaRouchites; such as their idiosyncratic analysis of the "American System" political tradition. Academic cites are listed on the page.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 04:16, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Both pages have cites to known marxist oriented (see their links for proof) and left wing political sites. I am NOT an advocate for Lyndone LaRouche except as to prevent character assassination from Cbert and synarchists like him, where does that come from? and personal attacks like that with no proof is not right for a forum like this? If you see the so-called "academic" links on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Producerism.html" title="Producerism">producerism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracism.html" title="Conspiracism">conspiracism</a> page they are from the same site "<b>The Public Eye</b>" an advocacy site, not an academic site or credible source, and other authors listed write for that site. Some articles listed have nothing to do with the topic but talk of 'Populism', yet are listed as if they speak of Producerism in word. I do not make links to political sites or advocacy and neither should those links be listed as credible, they have an axe to grind just look at his diatribes against people he calls 'Right Wing'. Calling me right wing is like calling Marx a Capitalist, give me a break. Guilt By Association folks is not Facts and he does it again towards me, trying to link me to LaRouche. Check the site of his out you will see its marxist sentiment. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 14:16, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please make sure that you have fully read and fully understood Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. While the articles in question may be biased towards a particular point of view, it is not correct to attempt to remove information quoted from verifiable sources, no matter how much you believe that those sources are in error and unfair. Wikipedia's neutrality does <i>not</i> mean that controversial topics cannot be addressed, or that controversial opinions and point of views cannot be presented (if they are notable); it means that such views must be attributed to those who hold them, and presented fairly, without asserting that any particular view is right. - If you hold an opinion that conflicts with the text, and you can come up with your own sources that back up this different opinion, by all means, go ahead and add this dissenting viewpoint to the article. If you believe that the article is biased and favors a particular viewpoint, go ahead and remove the bias; please read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_tutorial_6edc.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV tutorial">NPOV tutorial</a> on how to do that. However, you should not try to prevent significant viewpoints from being presented, no matter how strongly you disagree with them. 62.245.80.251 20:42, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the creator of the Producerism article, not Chip Berlet. Politically yes I admit I am left-wing but I consider myself sympathetic to Producerism. I don't think the article is biased against it. For some reason it has been targeted by the LaRouche people... I have no idea why. Who has any idea why they do anything? Probably they have some feud with Berlet. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 03:48, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> No reason to delete either article, I fond them both well written, sourced and informative on a particular aspect that is not widely known today but nonetheless important in socio-politics. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 12:50, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
