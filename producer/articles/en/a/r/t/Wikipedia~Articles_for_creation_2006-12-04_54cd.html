<p>When Sana'a university was first established, it included only two faculties; The Faculty of Sharia and Law, and the Faculty of Education, which also included the specialities of Colleges of Arts, Sciences and Education. in 1974, those specialties were developped and formed three new faculties; the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Science and the faculty of Education. Also, the Faculty of Sharia and Law celebtrated the launch of the Business Departement, which became an independent faculty a year later. By that time, the university included five faculties and continued expansion until it included the rest of the other specialties. In 2000, the univeristy included 17 faculties, ten of which were in Sana'a including all type of Academic specialties and the rest were spread in different provinces around teh country.</p>

<p>Accepted. You can find the article at Contraharmonic Mean --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 20:01, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Contraharmonic Mean of a set of positive numbers is defined as the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">Arithmetic mean</a> of the squares of the numbers divided by the Arithmetic mean of the numbers: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/2/6/c267183a5c87ddca57c262e3c015f638.png" alt="C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) ={ { (x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2) \over n} \over {(x_1+x_2+...+x_n) \over n}} \quad where \quad \forall i \quad x_i &gt; 0 \" /><br />
This is the same as : <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/c/c/8ccb75a8280c65706442505b9496e046.png" alt="C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) ={ { x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2} \over {x_1+x_2+...+x_n }}" />.<br />
It is easy to show that this satisfies the properties of a <a href="../../../m/e/a/Mean.html" title="Mean">Mean</a> :<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/9/8/19887fa7848bee0682792249045b8c0d.png" alt="1)\  MIN(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \le C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \le MAX(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)&#160;; \" /><br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/1/5/81597edba770c11f7985eea87fc2cca4.png" alt="2) \  C(t*x_1, t*x_2, ..., t*x_n) = t*C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\ for \ t &gt; 0" /><br />
Note that Property 1) implies that for all k &gt;0 C(k, k, ..., k) = k (fixed point property).<br />
For just two variables, a and b, taken as <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/d/c/3dc4ea4fa5bd921f8096299071a317f1.png" alt="0 &lt; a \le b" /> it is easier to see why this mean if complementary to the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_mean.html" title="Harmonic mean">Harmonic mean</a>. In the case of just two variables the Contraharmonic mean C(a,b) is also that mean that is as high above the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">Arithmetic mean</a> as the Arithmetic mean is above the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_mean.html" title="Harmonic mean">Harmonic mean</a>:</p>
<p><b>C(a,b) - A(a,b) = A(a,b) - H(a,b) or C(a,b) = 2*A(a,b) - H(a,b)</b></p>

<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/3/f/53f323614578cea002271d2bbd7b6e04.png" alt="A(a,b) = {{(a+b)} \over 2}" /> and<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/d/4/0d48a9e270034fb8c9eed152cd95969f.png" alt="H(a,b) = {1 \over {{1 \over 2}*{({1 \over a} + {1 \over b})}}}" /> = <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/c/a/eca2174b3d4b7afaa64659f1f4a55f85.png" alt="{2ab} \over {a+b}" /><br />

<br />
Notice that for two variables the Average of the Harmonic and Contraharmonic means is exactly equal to the Arithmetic mean:<br />
<b>A( H(a,b), C(a,b) ) = A(a,b)</b><br />
Also note that as <i>a</i> gets closer to 0 then H(a,b) also gets closer to 0. The Harmonic mean is very sensitive to low values. On the other hand, the Contraharmonic mean is sensitive to larger values, so as <i>a</i> approaches 0 then C(a,b) approaches <i>b</i> (so their average remains A(a,b) ).<br />
The Contraharmonic mean has the property that it is higher in value than the Average and also higher than the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_mean_square.html" title="Root mean square">Root mean square</a> : <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/0/0/4007b74b034085d034f71db23554f64b.png" alt="min(a,b) &lt; H(a,b) &lt; G(a,b) &lt; L(a,b) &lt; A(a,b) &lt; R(a,b) &lt; C(a,b) &lt; Max(a,b) \ for \ 0&lt;a&lt;b" /> Where <b>H</b> is the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_mean.html" title="Harmonic mean">Harmonic mean</a>, <b>G</b> is <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometric_mean.html" title="Geometric mean">Geometric mean</a>, <b>L</b> is the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithmic_mean.html" title="Logarithmic mean">Logarithmic mean</a>, <b>A</b> is the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">Arithmetic mean</a>, <b>R</b> is the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_mean_square.html" title="Root mean square">Root mean square</a> and <b>C</b> is the Contraharmonic mean. If <i>a</i> could be equal to <i>b</i> then the above <span class="texhtml">&lt;</span> signs can be replaced by <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/9/d/49dc1443f33cf63082d6e193dd2af78f.png" alt="\le" />. When a=b the above chain of comparisons collapses to the same value, a.<br />
There are two other notable relationships between 2-variable means. First, the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometric_mean.html" title="Geometric mean">Geometric mean</a> of the arithmetic and harmonic means is equal to the Geometric mean of the two values :<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/1/2/212c6ff6e36ecb48f710bb4fd468b071.png" alt="G( A(a,b), H(a,b) )=G({{a+b}\over 2}, {{2ab}\over {a+b}}) =  \sqrt {{{a+b}\over 2}*{{2ab}\over {a+b}}} = \sqrt{ab} = G(a,b)" /><br />
The second relationship is that the Geometric mean of the arithmetic and contraharmonic means is the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_mean_square.html" title="Root mean square">Root mean square</a>:<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/a/2/5a20048150812fede923576307dc12f5.png" alt="G( A(a,b), C(a,b) )=G({{a+b}\over 2}, {{a^2+b^2}\over {a+b}}) =" /> <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/b/3/db31f596063ff37557ad5f4bddbcb53c.png" alt="\sqrt{{{a+b}\over 2}*{{a^2+b^2}\over {a+b}}} = \sqrt{{{a^2+b^2}\over 2}} = R(a,b)" /><br />
The Contraharmonic mean of two variables can be constructed geometrically using a trapezoid (see <a href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.2000/Umberger/EMAT6690smu/Essay3smu/Conharm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.2000/Umberger/EMAT6690smu/Essay3smu/Conharm.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> ).<br />
You can also construct it using a circle similar to the way the <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_means.html" title="Pythagorean means">Pythagorean means</a> of two variables are constructed.<br />
Basically, the Contraharmonic mean is the rest of the diagonal on which the Harmonic mean lies. Their sum is always the length of the diagonal (a+b) of the circle that shows the Pythagorean means (see Pythagorean means on MathWorld at <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanMeans.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanMeans.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> ).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-04_54cd.html" title="Edit section: Franck Amsallem jazz pianist/composer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Franck Amsallem jazz pianist/composer</span></h2>
<p>Franck Amsallem was born in 1961 in Oran (Algeria), and then grew up in Nice, France. His parents, having repatriated the family piano, started him on classical piano at seven, which he gave up a few years later. The large family, the cramped apartment weren’t at all propitious surroundings for the old teacher’s stale lessons. Still, however, the family owned a large collection of 45 records where Ray Charles mixed with Glenn Miller and the Four Tops. In all logic then, he was seduced in adolescence, by the sound of the blues and swing and started taking music lessons at the Nice Conservatory where, considered too old for the piano (!), he signed up for classical saxophone and soon earned a first prize.</p>
<p><br />
But the piano remained his first love. Soon the news spread on the Cote d’Azur, and he worked in Monte Carlo, learning hundreds or maybe thousands of jazz standards, "I have always, above all, loved all American music," and at 17 years of age, John Lewis chose him to be his student for a french documentary "La leçon de musique". Having jammed offstage at the Nice jazz festival with Jerry Bergonzi, Mike Brecker and Richie Cole, he was then encouraged to move to the USA to hone his skills and learn. He made the move without a blink and entered Berklee College in 1981. "At 19, I did not see myself backing up pop singers in Paris and playing jazz on the side, which was what everyone was doing then. Like the song says, it was All or Nothing at All."</p>
<p><br />
Franck stayed three years in Boston and earned numerous awards, performing in Herb Pomeroy’s big band and attending his composition and arranging classes. Still the longing for more excitement was always there and at the beginning of 1986, he moved to New York City.</p>
<p><br />
"There are many good pianists out there, but good pianists who are equally good composers — that is what makes the difference". He then took, with Bob Brookmeyer at the Manhattan School of Music, lessons in composition for jazz orchestra, and lessons in classical piano with Phil Kawin. Their influence stayed with him for a long time. And the experience added up, the true New York Jazz Experience, as an accompanist, and then as a leader. To learn the art form of jazz like the greatest have done it before you. To confront your skills with the best musicians of their time. 2nd prize at Jacksonville’s Great American Jazz competition. 3rd prize goes to Brad Mehldau.</p>
<p><br />
&lt;&gt;”All that was great, but a career as a leader was just too tempting.” In 1990, at 28 years of age with the help of the Fondation de la Vocation and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, Franck records “Out A Day” a trio with Gary Peacock and Bill Stewart. Critics are laudatory; “There is every reason to expect excellence from this young pianist, still in his twenties, who prepared with such discipline for his first recording opportunity. The promise of good things to come is based on the considerable appeal of this recommended CD (Cadence)". “We are in danger of gushing and embarrassing ourselves. Sample this wonderful recording at all costs (Penguin guide to jazz , 4 stars -top-rating-)”. Next, Franck participates in the all-stars gathering "New York Stories" with Joshua Redman, Bobby Watson, Roy Hargrove and Danny Gatton. Then came a long collaboration with saxophonist Tim Ries. “Regards” earned four stars in Down beat, and JazzTimes found the CD “compelling”. “Is That So”, a duo reinforced by the equal participation of Leon Parker, is noted in the French press by the Inrockuptibles, and so does “Years Gone By”, with Daniel Humair and Riccardo Del Fra. “On Second Thought” is heralded as a CD of rare intensity, a live recording from a working band where everything comes together successfully without a hitch.</p>
<p><br />
Franck has performed in many of the big festivals, from Juan les Pins to Pori, Nice to Molde. He has brought his trio to faraway countries such as Uruguay, Mexico, Sweden, the Czech Republic (2004), Croatia, the Ukraine, Norway, Palestine, Switzerland, Belgium, Armenia, Lebanon, South Africa, Bulgaria, etc..., has also backed Gerry Mulligan, Charles Lloyd and Harry Belafonte, recorded with Bobby Watson, Roy Hargrove or Joshua Redman, and performed in the bands of Maria Schneider, Rick Margitza, Jerry Bergonzi and Joe Chambers, has composed numerous pieces for big band, for strings and for chamber orchestra. His suite "Nuits" for jazz quartet and string orchestra has been performed in Romania, Bulgaria, France and in Los Angeles. "I love the variety of situations, learning as you go along, challenging every solution, nothing ever preset."</p>
<p><br />
In the fall of 2003, Franck returns to the trio with "Summer Times" (Nocturne/Sunnyside) featuring Johannes Weidenmuller on bass and Joe Chambers on drums. Jazzman ("This recording aims for a perfect balance in every sense of the word"), Telerama, JazzTimes ("...laid-back yet brash, simple yet complex, unassuming yet confident and above all original') all praise the new effort.</p>
<p><br />
2005-6 saw Franck perform in the US (Washington D.C., NY), a nine-city tour of South Africa and neighboring countries, Israel, Holland, Croatia, Portugal, Spain, Armenia, Lebanon... In the fall, Nocturne released "A week in Paris", a Billy Strayhorn tribute featuring Elisabeth Kontomanou and Stephane Belmondo ("disque d'emoi" jazz magazine, 4 stars Jazzman).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-04_54cd.html" title="Edit section: Driver drug impairment and testing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Driver drug impairment and testing</span></h2>
<p>Drug intoxication is a significant contributing factor to road tolls in Western countries, and studies have shown a worsening trend of a decades duration. Los Angeles Police have been leaders in addressing the problem. They developed an effective system to detect when drivers were under the influence of drugs and pursue prosecutions first.</p>
<p>It is known as the drug recognition expert program. Police complete significant educational blocks which qualify them to detect drug drivers and testify to their impairment as expert witnesses in court. Drug impaired driving suspects are examined for 45 minutes by investigating drug recognition Officers. The physical evidence that suspects exhibit and which drugs are likely to cause such effects are recorded.</p>
<p>The expert after ruling out any ailments as cause, makes a determination based on the clinical picture as to which drugs are likely producing any symptoms of altered functioning. Independent evaluators at John Hopkins University have found almost 100% accuracy. Blood tests are then taken and analysed for the suspected drugs.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom recently consulted the U.S. Police about implementing a new system of their own. The UK decided to simplify the process and make it less time consuming. They bought out of retirement the old "standardised field sobriety test" originally used to identify drunk drivers.</p>
<p>Only this time modified via incorporation of some of the components of the drug recognition testing protocol, rombergs test being but one example. A crude tool it has proven far less accurate than full drug recognition testing, as many people who have taken impairing drugs (per a recent study) were able to bluster through the test and pass.</p>
<p>Some recreational drug user websites even offer advice on how the test works and upon practising for the test so you can get through it no problem if need be. Another problem is that the test provides no specific information about which drugs may be in play. So expensive blood testing may be made moreso by having to cover the full range of possibilities. Drug users surveyed say they are not much deterred from drug driving as testing seems to occur very judiciously.</p>
<p>Germany, France, Australia and Canada are all at various stages of implementing new legislation which enable Police to use modern enforcement means to reduce drug affected driving. Approaches are varied and it is early days to be analysing results as yet. Although it would appear the Australian approach first trialed in Victoria is lacklustre.</p>
<p>The toll for Victorian truck drivers, heavily targeted for saliva testing has risen. And no evidence has been produced by the Government even after 2 years that a reduced number of deceased drivers has recently used impairing drugs. Further to this only a small drop in the toll has occurred which is more than accounted for by the introduction of several thousand alcohol interlocks.</p>
<p>Roadside testing methods being explored in Ireland, Malaysia and several other countries as perhaps useful to enhance road safety include the following; optical tests, sedi tests, sweat tests, urine tests and saliva tests. Mostly such tests like breathalysers are not foolproof and could be challenged in court if impairment is Prosecutors try to infer any drug impairment from results. Their usefulness is for establishing suspicion of impairment and in some cases the probable drug involved.</p>
<p>Further testing via physical exam and blood testing is normally required to rule out that impairment symptoms are not due to other causes. Sleep for instance can cause pupils to react abnormally rather than the cause being a suspected type of drug.</p>
<p>Penalties for drug impaired driving are also many and varied. Traditionally they have been aligned with drink driving ones, but with new legislation to address a new problem some jurisdictions are trying other options such as decriminalisation and a fines system.</p>

<p>Salvia divinorum is a plant from the mint family and a species of sage that is used for its psychoactive effects. Salvia is endemic only to the Mazatec region of the Sierra Madre mountains in Oaxaca, Mexico, also known as the Sierra Mazateca. Given the right dose, individual, set and setting, it produces a unique state of "divine inebriation" which has been traditionally used by Mazatec healers and prophets. This inebriation is quite different from that of alcohol. Salvia is both similar to, yet different from, other drugs that affect the brain and behavior. In many ways, Salvia divinorum is a uniquely "magical" herb. Salvia, along with it's active princliple salvinorin-A, is very difficult to categorize pharmacologically as it does not fit well into any existing pharmacological class. Salvia is NOT a recreational drug in the way that other drugs like alcohol and marijuana are used. It is definitely NOT a party drug. But can be the best inner party. Salvia is best used by those wishing to explore deep meditative states, spiritual realms, mysticism, the nature of consciousness and reality, or even the possibilities of shamanistic healing.</p>

Alanso as the vocalist and Zai as the drummer later, tried to find other bandmates from their school.And then, alanso suggested Azreen@iem,who was a genius in playing bass as their bassist. Finally, both of them chose two of their closed friends, fyruzo and eboy@zul to be in their band as the guitarists, after being suggested by zy@roy. They were all studying in the same school, St. Joseph High School, Kuching.</p>
<p>The band was officially formed in April 2006, after an April fool joke by fyruzo. For the time being, they're playing cover songs and all of them are related closely with indie genre or in other words covering the songs from indie band. the first song they covered was someday by the strokes. It was pretty darn good for the first timer like them. They don't have any songs for now but their working on it. The material that they're worked on currently, will be wicked. Just imagine the mixture of indie pop and rock with some genius bass and also injected with psychedelic and art pop and rock sound. With the ideas and genius thinking from what people who lived in hollywood village(Kuching) called 'Alanso The battery Thinkers', Alanso whom also being resembled as Alex Turner and Damon Albarn, 'MIX' with big ideas and melodic thinking of zy@roy the drummer as well as the crazy hipnotic style and the thinking of 'everyday is a holiday' of the two killer guitarist eboy@zul and fyruzo. the supernatural kind of music which is super-artistic or "art and dark indie that they're created were completed by the genius bassist, azreen@iem with his father's legendary style of old skool bass with the legendary old skool bass guitar.</p>
<p>They declared Arctic Monkeys and The Strokes as their biggest influences. they're also being influenced by other superb band such as the kooks, blur, suede, oasis, dirty pretty things, mew, placebo, the smiths and other band which the bosh (band) classified or judge it as artistic or indie. they're very judgemental and this band should be classified as the next biggest thing and also the art-indie band with attitude. And they called it 'music for people who is not blind and deaf' or simply called it real music.</p>
<p>Bosh(band)will concentrate on their music 99% after they have finished their studies or graduated. For people who thinks that they are not blind and deaf should be waiting and ready for Bosh and not just pollute the mother-earth with posers. Cheers~</p>

<p>Trinity School is a comprehensive, mixed school of about 1200 pupils in Newbury, Berkshire. The school is relatively new and has been open since 2001 when three schools combined (hence the name Trinity). The Elizabethan Grade 1 listed Shaw House mansion is located on the grounds of the school. Trinity School allows pupils of all abilities between the ages of 11-18 to enrol with the school, with the motto 'Personal Excellence and Collective Responsibility'.</p>
<p>The school is a specialist Performing Arts College which benefits their pupils and the community alike. The school is currently producing the show 'RENT' for the end of December production. They are also fortunate in their relationship with their neighbour Vodafone. Their world headquarters is just across the road and both the company itself and their staff help out within the school.</p>
<p>Trinity is situated in the grounds of Shaw House , a stunning C16th mansion that was the site of the second battle of Newbury during the Civil War. It is a superb Grade 1 listed red brick house completed in 1581. One moment, students might think that they are studying in an ancient college. The next, they will turn a corner and see the superb facilities that are the new school. Currently undergoing renovation, Shaw House itself will eventually be open to the public, school and adult groups on certain days of the year with special events and exhibitions. It will be the venue for civic and community functions including concerts and meetings. One room in the house will be designated as the civic wedding venue for West Berkshire. The house will also be home to the West Berkshire Education Centre. This is a resource and training venue for teachers in West Berkshire.</p>

<p>Douychebag is a commonly used noun that is often misused in popular culture. The most frequently used definition among the masses is often in a derogatory sense, most times meaning lacking tact or social skills (often misspelled as 'douchebag'). However, the true meaning is derived from the physical sciences, and was coined by polish physicist Grbic Czertys to describe the hypercharge phenomenon.</p>

<p>Iceland's heavily modified <a href="../../../4/x/4/4x4.html" title="4x4">4x4</a> Super Jeeps / Super Trucks are one of a kind. The tires are large, 38-44 inches in diameter, giving the Super Jeep a very high clearance from the ground. The way these specially equipped jeeps are used in Iceland is unique in the world and one of the few countries that actually allow these car's on regular roads. Therefor it is quite popular amongst the regular jeep owner to have at least 38 inch tires. It is also connects with the travel market. Many companies offer tours in these heavily modified vehicles to glacers, beaches and all sorts of off road driving. The vehicles are usually divided into two categories: I and II. Category I (Jeeps) consists of smaller jeeps with seats for 4-7 persons, for example, the Nissan Patrol. Category II (Trucks) consists of larger trucks with seats for 8-14 persons, for example, the Ford Econoliner. Within each category you can find trucks with various levels and types of modification. Communications on board each vehicle are also sophisticated, and generally you can find at least five different communications tools on the dashboard: CB radio, VHF radio, GSM phone, NMT phone, and the latest technology Tetra, which works both as a radio and a telephone. What mainly sets the super jeeps/trucks apart from "normal" sport utility vehicles is their capacity for driving in snow and on glaciers. By letting the air pressure in the tires down to 2-4 psi from the normal pressure of ca. 25-28 psi, the super jeeps/trucks become able to actually drive on top of the snow instead of "through" the snow.
