<p>The result of the debate was delete, with a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">The Legend of Zelda series</a> thrown in totally of my own accord. This discussion conflates two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name "Zelda Universe" has official provenance. The pratice with items like this per Wikipedia:Notability (websites) is a redirect to the parent when they don't have stand-alone notability. No one has suggested that the official site does.</li>
<li>The name "Zelda Universe" is also a fan site. Nothing has been presented to suggest that <i>it</i> satisfies the notability guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, given that neither one nor the other can stand on its own, delete and redirect is the appropiate outcome. In the event that greater notability arises (for whichever incarnation) it's trivial to replace the deleted content.<br />

<p><b>*EDIT - Withdraw request for deletion, request page re-write</b> - Zelda Universe is the official name of Nintendo's Zelda.com web page, as well as all international iterations. A fan site does not hold presidence over an official site, and this article is nothing more than an expanded summary of the "about" page on the fan site. <a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETSA_3997.html" title="User:TSA">TSA</a> 07:17, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - Zelda Universe is *now* the official title of Zelda.com, but this name was not actually chosen or implemented by Nintendo until March of 2001 (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.zelda.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.zelda.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), while Zeldauniverse.net was launched at least a month earlier. A fan site does *not* hold presidence over an official site, but people who visit Zelda.com probably do not regularly refer to it as "Zelda Universe" (since typing Zelda Universe into google will yield the fansite before the official one, and typing zelda.com will yield a site that is labeled "The Legend of Zelda"). And even if a person does refer to Zelda.com as "Zelda Universe", this sort of occasion is exactly what disambiguation pages were invented for. Deletion is way too harsh, and honestly I think you're only proposing such a thing because you are the owner and operator of a rival Zelda fansite. Andi- 11:53, 27 February 2006 (EST)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'll have to second that, <b>don't delete</b>. There is really no good reason for deletion here. The fact of the matter is that this site has been the largest fan-site in the Zelda community over several years, and one of the bigger game-specific fansites on the entire web. To me that alone makes it worthy of it's article. Not to mention your reasoning behind the proposed deletion is pretty weak. There have been few to none mixups throughout the years between ZeldaUniverse.net and the official Zelda site, Zelda.com, which has only used the name "Zelda Universe" irregularly for the past few years. And as the user above me pointed out, that's what the disambiguation pages are for in any case. The article needs to be cleaned up and rewritten however. Lars-Christian</li>
<li><b>Comment - no vote</b>. Name conflicts with an official site is not a criteria for listing. Let the lawyers sort that out. However, with an Alexa rank of 72,971 I don't know if it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. â€”<a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrathchild-K_cab0.html" title="User:Wrathchild-K">Wrathchild</a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../w/r/a/User_talk%7EWrathchild-K_6125.html" title="User talk:Wrathchild-K">talk</a>)</small></sup> 17:22, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment - no vote</b>. The criterias are a little vague, but I would believe it meets them, seeing as it has been featured in several magazines, as well as on TV in France. Not my call to make however, so I'll leave that up to those in charge. Lars-Christian</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Additional input</b>: This isn't a vandetta or anything, it's about being accurate. Perhaps I was too brash, but something has to be done. Zelda Universe should, first and foremost, point to an article about the <a href="http://www.zelda.com" class="external text" title="http://www.zelda.com" rel="nofollow">| Official Zelda Web Site</a>. There, on the same article, can be information about this site, or a tag at the top which directs people looking for the fan site to go to another page. I thought I read that infringing on IP or misleading information was grounds for deletion - but please understand I do not want this content removed because of any other reason than it is taking the place of the official Zelda.com website. It is confusing to a fan who does not know any better, and yes there have been fans who confuse content on Zelda Univerise.net for OFFICIAL information endorsed by Zelda.com (Zelda Universe). That's my rationale. And Zelda Universe was used since 1995 on the AOL portal page of Nintendo. Camp Hyrule linked to it in the chat room used then. The website Zelda.com did not use the name Zelda Universe until it was launched as its own hub site - beforehand Zelda games got their own micro sites. Also, Zelda.com was originally a domain for pornography, and Nintendo went to court to retain the domain. Or else earlier Zelda.com would have been around sooner. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETSA_3997.html" title="User:TSA">TSA</a> 00:53, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's true. It is just pretty much a carbon copy of the site's about page. I know this because I'm the one that did it. I figured some other people would've straightened it out by now, but evidently not. I couldn't care less what happens at this point. --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Cornflake_5bc4.html" title="User:Captain Cornflake">Captain Cornflake</a> 19:51, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Additional input</b>: Wouldn't information on the official Zelda website go under the <b>Zelda</b> page? Why would an official website for a video game (which contains nothing but official information) need its own wikipedia article? Does Coca-Cola.com need its own page, while we're at it? Just for the record, I will admit that I didn't know that this wikipedia article existed until I decided to do a random wiki search (ironically, it happened to be just a few hours after TSA suggested the article for deletion. But now that I do, the page will be updated quite a bit.Andi-</p>
<p><b>Edit</b>: The page has been changed a bit, and the fact that "Zelda Universe" is also a name for the official website has been pointed out (And a link has been provided). Andi-. 21:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
