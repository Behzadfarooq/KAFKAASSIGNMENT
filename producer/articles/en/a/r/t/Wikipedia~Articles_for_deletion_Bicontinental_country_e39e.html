<li><b>keep</b>, NOT delete, will someone state his objections, please? This article compiles the information about these border-cases gathered from the main wikipedia articles about the continents and states involved. I think that instead of continius fighting about what country to include where - this article clears the things out and everyone should be happy with the compromise - also this article acts as some sort of a mover of the unresolvable debate about continent borders from the main pages to a separate 'borderline cases'-page. Also this article reflects the geographical reality. Anyway, even if some information is wrong, why not correct it instead of delete the whole article??? <i>Unsigned by User:62.204.151.1</i>
<ul>
<li>As you say, it duplicates information.

<ul>
<li>Is it not currently like a list? There are some explanations given, but it could not be plain list... it should be noted WHAT is listed... that's why there are explanations. I think that the information about that subject is much better synthesied here - in one common place, where eveyone can look into (or change if needed) when some debate about states on the continent borders arises...

<li>Europe/Asia border is drawn along the Caucaus watershed-Caspian Sea-Ural river-Ural montain-Arctic Ocean. This is the most recognized path. The other - KumaManychRivers-Caspian Sea-Emba river-Ural mountain variant is much rarely used, but we can add it too for completecy.<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlinor_19c1.html" title="User:Alinor">Alinor</a> 07:59, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Americas and Asia/Africa border is drawn along the Isthmus/Canal of Suez/Panama - as stated in many Wikipedia articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>; looks interesting and could be expanded in lots of ways. For example, Turkey's bid to join the EU is based on its partial European geography, whereas objections from other European countries are based on its predominantly Asian culture.

<li><b>Keep</b>; the Europe/Asia border is as I've always seen it drawn, along the Urals and the Caucasus. The North/South America border is harder to argue, since I've never seen it drawn there, so I'd rather see sources for that. But it's interesting nonetheless. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfvaen_e012.html" title="User:Alfvaen">Alfvaen</a> 04:26, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: No context, no discussion, no explanation, no ramifications, no significance. It's a list article disguised as a discursive article. What are the effects of going over a continental border? Is there anything historical about this? Do the locals know they're crossing borders? What is there to <b>say</b> about this? If it's a list article, then, well, the battle against lists has been lost, but it's clearly not an explanatory article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:52, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>That are only geographical borders, not political state borders, so locals don't have to know when crossing them. This is like knowing/not knowing the apple falls becouse of gravity. 62.204.151.1 07:51, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>again this originality...this is just a compilation from another sources (I have mentioned them multiple times on multiple places around here), I don't see original, creative parts, what do you consider 'original research'?62.204.151.1 18:34, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I believe the problem is this: if the listed countries have nothing in particular in common other than the fact that they are considered to be on two continents, then the list is as arbitrary as List of countries with an R in their name - ergo, not encyclopedic. If the listed countries <i>are</i> alleged to have something else in common, then the article would be original research. Either way, <b>delete</b>. As a side point, inclusion on this list is arbitrary depending on from what POV you define 'continent' - see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a> for details. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 18:59, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The common thing is that they are bicontinental and this is quite enough reason to make such a list - look at the edit wars, witch errup everytime one such country is put on 'the other' continent. This article is a good place to present the subject from a neutral point of view (if you object something in this article - let's discuss and change, not delete) and to release the other articles of these edit wars. (<a href="../../../b/i/c/Talk%7EBicontinental_country_6148.html" title="Talk:Bicontinental country">rant</a>).</dd>
<dd>Look at the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Template%7EEurope_df8b.html" title="Template:Europe">Template:Europe</a> discussions to see the 'popularity' of these edit wars. They are practiced by MANY PEOPLE. So it looks that there IS NEED for the information on bicontinental countries to be compiled (and improved) at one single place (not individualy on each country - one time for Russia, next time for Cyprus, again for Turkey, etc.) - I suggest this place to be here.62.204.151.1 19:55, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since there are edit wars about this subject, creating a new article that explains your POV is not a very good way with dealing with them. It seems to me that the people participating in those edit wars would not agree with the contents of the Bicont page. Hence, it gives them an extra arena to fight edit wars in. Instead, you should go to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and resolve the issue. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 22:10, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If someone thinks that something in the article is POV - just say and it will be corrected.

While the information is interesting it is trivial at best, it can also be viewed as inaccurate at worst.

<li><b>Delete</b> - irrelevant and impossible to get interesting or relevant. Borders between continents are too arbitrarily drawn — in Eurasia, the Americas and in the sea — to make it possible for this to become anything else than an weak shaddow of pseudo-science.

<dd>The relevance of this sort of seemingly trivial information may require several steps of inference. For example, I could see relevance to this sort of information when dealing with the politics of conservation. Indonesia's conservation strategy should take <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace%27s_Line_772f.html" title="Wallace's Line">Wallace's Line</a> into account and potentially treat things very differently on either side. Turkey may have a similar concern across the strait of Bosporus. Panama and Egypt are both in an unual situation with the existence of the Panama and Suez canals. These have isolated once contiguous biological ranges and have led to geographic reproductive isolation among populations on either side. I suspect there's plenty of relevance to this sort of discussion outside of biology as well. Admittedly, borders of continents are somewhat arbitrary, but I think this information is still potentially of some value. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 01:51, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
