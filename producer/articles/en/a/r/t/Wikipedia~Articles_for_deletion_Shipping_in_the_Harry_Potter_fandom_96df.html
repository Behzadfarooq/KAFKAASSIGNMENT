<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 22 clear "delete" votes to 22 "keep" votes (with about 5 of those explicitly "keep as merge/redirect"). A number of anonymous or very new users were discounted (with votes on both sides of the debate). Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the decision defaults to keep for now.</p>
<p>Reviewing the comments in detail, I find the main objection to be the level of detail. Many of the "keep" votes, all of the "merge" votes and quite a few of the "delete" votes expressed support for a merger of this article back into the parent. Since merge/redirect is a reversible decision, I am going to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and exercise my discretion as an ordinary editor to redirect this article to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a> which already has what appears to be a very good overview of this topic. Any further discussion on the appropriateness of that redirect should be made on the respective article Talk pages. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 06:30, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I'm not going to trouble with whether or not <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a> should have an article, that one topic of that should be drawn out to such a gargantuan essay, with no apparent sources other than message board postings (and what other sources could there be?), is something that just begs for deletion. <b>Delete</b> as nonencyclopedic, essay, personal research, and for good measure, wikipedia is not a travel guide. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 08:23, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC) (ok, that last one didn't apply)</p>

<li>Dude, I'm the <i>main contributor to that article</i> and now that you put it like that, I see that somehow an inconspicuous informative description of an odd phenomenon on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a> has turned into a bloated monster of information, and perhaps indeed not all of it is necessary. I vote <b>keep</b>, solely due to the fact that I'm well aware that any vote that is not "keep" helps little in the effort to prevent it being deleted altogether. I hope it ends up condensed and simply <b>merged</b> back where it belongs. Also, no need for condescending boggling and that horrid word "fancruft".

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is a rather lively discussion at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article_a63c.html#Size" title="Wikipedia talk:What is a featured article">Wikipedia talk:What is a featured article#Size</a> about splitting out articles into subarticles when the main article becomes too long.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Ah, the famous Wikipedia obsession with pop culture. This is all, of course, completely bloody irrelevent. The plot is what Rowling says it is, and all the wild speculation in the world is just that. As for splitting it off because the original article was too long - just because someone can wildly expound at great length on a topic does not mean that that topic is of any worth as an encyclopedia article - often it just means they should get to the point. The section in the Harry Potter fandom article is sufficient and to the point, and is all that is needed on this subject. Otherwise - well, you have your own websites for this subject, don't you. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 17:10, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Harry Potter fandom has certainly become notable, and if some of the more devoted Potter fans think this is a valid subject, I'd leave it be. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 18:01, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think you deserve to know the precise reason for the move. It wasn't just space; almost all contributions were focused on this section, which is how it got to be so long and out of proportion with the other section. Therefore, I thought it might be good to split it off and I suggested the idea on the talk page a long time ago, but I got no worthwhile response.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Can anyone confirm that this "shipping" thing is a phenomenon outside of a small set of forumgoers? Unless a large portion of the Harry Potter fanbase is familiar with this kind of stuff (I, for one, am not), I don't see why it should be kept. Also, consider a title change; referring to romantic relationship speculation in popular fiction as <i>shipping</i> is just bizarre.
<ul>
<li><b>response to comment</b>. Well, J.K. Rowling is familiar with it, has commented on it and has referred to it as "shipping". Clearly she didn't have to find a small, obscure set of forumgoers to run across the phenomenon. It's unquestionably the most prominent trend in HP fandom- if it's deleted on the grounds on non-notability, then <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a> should get the axe as well. It seems that HP shipping gets the flack here simply because of its inherent "WTF" factor. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 21:21, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, I vote to liberally condense and <b>Merge</b> back into <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a>. That article isn't <i>really</i> that long; it's the long list of external links that contributes most to its unneeded length.

<li><b>Response to Comment</b>. If it had just been a small set of forumgoers, then this thing wouldn't have gotten to be so long, now would it? — <i>Unsigned comment by 67.171.180.209.</i>
<ul>
<li>That doesn't make any sense. A small set of people could have <i>easily</i> written an article of this length. <s>In fact, there's only one IP address listed as a contributor to the article, aside from the VfD tag and a minor edit.</s> D'oh, obviously, if this was moved, other contribution history is not recorded there... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 22:09, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response to Comment</b>: Is "shipping" a large part of fan culture? Sure you jest. It's huge. It's <i>freakin' huge</i>. The answer is <b>YES</b>. That being said, just being huge and labyrinthine doesn't mean its complexities are encyclopedic, so this should not be taken as a 'keep' vote. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:35, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>A minor distinction, to be sure, but I wasn't speaking about fandom in general, but Harry Potter fandom in specific. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 21:39, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> If it's gotten this long and detailed, surely a decent number of people think it a worthwhile subject? Sure, maybe only a few people have contributed to it <i>since it's been moved</i>, but it started out as a subsection of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a> article and this particular section has undergone many changes, even in just the last few days I've been watching it. Furthermore, J. K. Rowling herself has said that shipping will become more of a theme in future books. I think there are sufficient reasons to <b>keep</b> this page <b>as its own page</b> and not merge back into the Harry Potter fandom article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">Hermione1980</a> 22:04, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. For both the size of the information and the fact that shipping IS most of the fanculture (but by no means all of it, hence a separate article). It's written rather well as well, better than some more serious topics, I'm a bit dismayed to see. <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">®</a> 22:42, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Voters should also be made aware that <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipping_%28fandom%29.html" title="Shipping (fandom)">Shipping (fandom)</a> exists, which deals generally with the phenomenon of which this article is just one permutation—all popular books, movies, and television series have these kind of fan arguments. No reason to treat all of these discussions in and of themselves as noteworthy or to treat the Harry Potter one as uniquely notable. The phenomenon is notable. Its individual manifestations fail to be. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:39, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <b>I may well be wrong here, but doesn't this stuff seem a bit suited to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>?</b> From what I gather, this is the kind of stuff many Wikibooks feature: a long analysis of specific literary titles. Anyone interested in doing a Harry Potter study guide, with this content as a starting point? It will no doubt be useful to the hundreds of high school students who will be studying and writing essays on Harry Potter or the Harry Potter films.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Tough one, since fandom is inherently less encyclopedic than the original books.

<li><b>Keep for now</b> It is one of the more notable and widespread shipping phenomenons, so this article will make sense to more people than articles on ships of other fandom worlds will. It may even serve as an example of the shipping culture. For these reasons, I find it useful. However, once the final book is published, will we really want to keep an archive of debate over questions which will have been resolved? I think the article should be reconsidered for deletion after the last book has been published. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinistro_1894.html" title="User:Sinistro">Sinistro</a> 08:52, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tough one. If it were just about fanfic, I would have wanted it deleted post haste. But this is genuine analysis of a famous series. I don't think looking for deeper meanings to character development in a book is necessarily original research either, nor does 'not a crystal ball' apply since this doesn't speculate much about future books, but rather tries to find meaning in the existing ones. So I can't really find a solid argument for deleting it. And I found it interesting. So <b>keep</b>. Oh, but it should certainly be renamed since 'shipping' means 'naval transport' to most people unfamiliar with fanfic. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:38, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, trimming any original research if applicable. To the extent that it's a widespread phenomenon, it's noteworthy enough to be encyclopedic for Wikipedia's purposes, deservedly or not. Wiki is not paper. If enough people care about it, let them have their page about it. And if "shipping" is the term widely in use, well then so be it... it's not the first case of ambiguity that Wikipedia has had to deal with. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:55, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> First, the shipping problem is very common among the readers of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, which is growing in large amount everyday. As a very common series worldwide I believe that the interpreting of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> series is going to have a worldwide, though might not be very significant, effect on a population, not only a few individuals. Secondly, to many of these readers, choosing their ship is not a random act but is also a belief they uphold, based on and strengthened by continuous changing of reasons, I believe that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> should give an account of the development of these ideas over time, which may help us to understand our own minds. (e.g. moral values) The shipping problem is also a very entry point and an alternative way for us to understand characters in the book better. If the major characters of the Harry Potter series have an entry in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> too, I see no reason why this page, which discussed the relationships (if any) between these characters in such a detailed way, should be deleted. I must admit that I consider myself to be a heavy reader of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> series, and I won't mind if you believe my reasonings are heavily biased, but please tell me what you think too! -- <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputor_f451.html" title="User:Computor">Computor</a> 19:40, 6 Apr 2005 (GMT +0800)

<li><b>delete</b> I have read the books, and seen the movies (and liked both). I read this article in question. It is not an article about popular literature (Rowlings books). It is an article about a discussion held amoung fans of the literature. Furthermore, the way it is written, there is not enough context for a reasonably intelligent outsider to even understand the article. (I pretend to be intelligent, and I still don't exactly know what <i>shipping</i> means in this context. <a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMpearl_818f.html" title="User:Mpearl">Morris</a> 16:48, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> If this article gets deleted, would it be possible to put an abridged version as someone's sub-user page? I really do think the article is informative, as NPOV as you can get with this subject, and deserving of staying, but I've already voted, so I have no more say. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">Hermione1980</a> 20:43, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - The information presented in this article has a very definite bias towards certain "'ships" that seems self-serving, as well as occasionally citing works that do not really pass muster as being particularly well-known or authoritative where their subject is concerned. Moxy 08:13, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>—need for NPOV rebalance and editing aside, the topic is a fascinating (or at least, amusing) and significant phenomenon in a significant fandom. As far as personal research goes, it's no more so than any other self-descriptive community article on Wikipedia, and let's face it, WP's a magnet for such communities. -- <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerey_ed5e.html" title="User:Perey">Perey</a> 09:37, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the Harry Potter fandom is one of the largest and most noted ones on the Web; it would be shame not to have an entry on it. Plus, it basically IS the fandom - without shipping, you have no fandom.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Just trying to sponge some of the acid out of a few comments here. <i>Fancruft</i>—no, not essentially. Fancruft is detailed information on a topic only of interest to hardcore fans. This article is <i>about</i> the fans, not about Harry Potter minutiae. There may be some fancruft in there on the background of the 'ships', but that's no reason to delete the whole article. <i>Original research</i>—hardly. I respect the intent of the 'no original research' guideline, but I dislike seeing it used to oppose articles written on valid personal experience—articles to which rules regarding <i>academic research</i> are irrelevant. <i>Unencyclopaedic</i>—this article is about a cultural phenomenon, so it's encyclopaedic in origin; it's huge in scope and range, so it's encyclopaedic in noteworthiness; and it's not 'speculation about fictional characters', as was claimed. (It's <i>about</i> such speculation, it doesn't essentially consist of it; see <i>fancruft</i>.) If after cleanup and decrufting there's only a few lines left (doubtful), <i>then</i> by all means merge. -- <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerey_ed5e.html" title="User:Perey">Perey</a> 01:44, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <i>"This has driven supporters of this pairing to look for reasons why it could happen on other fronts, resulting in many theories suffering from the same ad-hoc symptoms characteristic of the Harry/Hermione theories they have been so quick to label as irrational, but also in several meaningful finds—mainly in the areas of literary pattern analysis, relatively simple foreshadowing, and Rowling's teasing comments when asked about Harry and Ginny."</i> How inane can you get? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 21:49, Apr 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
