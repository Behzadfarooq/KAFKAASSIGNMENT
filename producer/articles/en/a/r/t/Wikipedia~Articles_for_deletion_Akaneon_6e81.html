<li><s><b>Keep in original format and/or edit.</b> The article uses entirely objective language. Traffic ranking is not the key to whether or not an article is legitimate, it is the factual and objective basis of the article itself. The assertion of significant is made in the comparison and contrast using objective terminology towards other sites. In no place, shape or form does bias occur, the article is written from a neutral tone. If there are no sources listed, please use the 'citation needed' tag where you feel citation is needed. I wrote the article myself, however the tone is non-promotional. If you would like to re-write the article yourself, I have offered to you several times to edit it. I request for 'the interest of fairness' that your deletion record be examined, as I believe that your primary interest is in deleting articles, not editing them. Your actual contribution record is very low and therefore your right to criticize someone else's contributions is in question. Once again I propose to all involved parties that if the article is not in accordance with policies that the specific questionable points be noted so that I can re-write it in a way that will be considered acceptable, otherwise, I propose that the article be left in original untouched format. - Akaneon 02:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<dd>By that argument, nothing would ever be deleted. You're missing the point. THE SUBJECT ITSELF IS NOT NOTABLE.

<dd>That is your opinion on the subject, however for purposes of neutrality the article should be left untouched as the subject matter is equal to the current listings of <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebook.html" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkut.html" title="Orkut">orkut</a>. Why is the subject matter non-notable if the site has equal objective factual content, and the listing has equal objective content to previously listed sites? I call into question your own bias and the fact that you are a close friend and associate of Friday as a potential discredit to your neutrality. Please allow some neutral sources to enter the debate and question for themselves which parts of the article are subjective or not in accordance with wiki policies and/or previous articles in the same vein. Prove that the content is irrelevant. - Akaneon 02:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, but it doesn't mean much when it's one or two guys who are all friends using multiple accounts to attempt to unduly position things in their favor. Also, per nom is a linking statement which must specifically indicate previous statements made. There is no statement made and therefore per nom is invalid in this case as per nom can only be used on a factual basis. No facts have been contributed to this article since creation that indicate specific reasons the article should be deleted. The only 'reasons' listed are simply opinions and not factually based and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt by readers of this topic. - Akaneon 02:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Only assertion of notability seems to be "by association" (that someone from MySpace assisted in its creation), only other sources are primary.

Per discussion above, "someone else got away with it" is not a notability criterion-that just may mean some other page may have slipped by and needs to be sent here as well.

<dd>I heard contribution points and edits were more valuable, from a reliable source. I suspect jealousy amongst the "speedy-delete" teams on wikipedia, as they tend to focus more on deleting other peoples articles than creating new ones. Perhaps they're incapable? - Akaneon 04:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> looking through the Google hits for Akaneon almost all I see is Craig spamming tons of people's MySpace pages saying "If you're a real friend you'll come join" etc. No notability offered through independent, reliable sources. Delete until this becomes a notable website. I also suggest that the author of the article read <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 04:54, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable, fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. For one thing, the article comes off as incredibly spammy, and another, per the nom, it's not exactly notable.
