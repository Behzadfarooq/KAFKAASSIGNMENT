<li>Dear mister Dallimore,</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, please be sure I very much respect your time, experience and extra efforts to ameliorate Wikipedia content as I myself put a lot of energy (!), money and time into direct action in persuit of the common cause and greater good in the global context: <b>serving truth, that truth may serve</b>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, I will get to a final assessment of your comments and conceive a <b>final conclusion</b> in due course...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The world's complexxon is a global affair.</li>
<li>Although I don't regard it as essential nor relevant information directly related to the world's complexxon, but just triggering my personal interest regarding abusive and dominant -industrial- corporate conduct and P3-tangled governmental wrongdoing, named Incorporated Governance, I note that my Trade Mark <b>.E</b> is registered internationally, including China, whereas <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell.html" title="Dell">Dell</a>'s later application in bad faith of a copied, similar sign was refused to be registered by the <a href="../../../o/h/i/OHIM_51b7.html" title="OHIM">OHIM</a>, Alicante, Spain and that the whole Opposition procedure was executed by myself, not educated as a Trade Mark nor Patent specialist but just able to counter very misleading and <i>corporate aggression</i>-linked Office practices like integrated <i>in-house judging</i> and <i>outside influence</i> by <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell.html" title="Dell">Dell</a>'s legal reps. at the Patent Office in your own country, Great(!) Britain, where irresponsible clercs who could not even properly compare dates (who can ever believe this??), consequently had to excuse themselves and at the European <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_for_Harmonization_in_the_Internal_Market_a4b0.html" title="Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market">Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market</a> as well, where following my meeting and very interesting conversation with the president of OHIM, <b>Wubbo de Boer</b>, the head of the Opposition Department, <b>Marcel Boulogne</b>, was dismissed while <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell.html" title="Dell">Dell</a>'s world-wide recognized legal representative <b>Dr. Renck</b> of <a href="../../../l/o/v/Lovells.html" title="Lovells">Lovells</a>, located in Alicante as well(!), was taken off the case by his superiors. Moreover I hereby disclose the OHIM's President's lesson that was instantly learned for good by myself: "The world's biggest problem is lazy return (on investment)", whereas I understood he was telling me: "<b>It's <i>cheap</i> oil stupid</b>"! perfectly translating to aggressive and arrogant global energy-politics, our main subject of debate being the imposing and threatening global political energy-agenda. Compare 'incorporated governance'. Question to you, Mr. Dallimore: "Do you persist in your oppinion and bold statement <i><b>"For example, I note that OHIM's decision was based entirely on their own reasoning and that very little you had to say was taken into account".&#160;:: "Arrogant submission" &amp; Appeal "thrown out"&#160;?</b></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Resulting the OHIM's president's concern about infringement-related corporate aggressive conduct, the Opposition Case Tychon-Dell was thoroughly assessed on legal fundamentals and the Opposition Division's Decision (see Tychon-Dell <a href="http://www.xxell.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xxell.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) therefore reflects a global warning for aggressive TM infringements where emblematic ideograms automatically lock in a new, inventive and distinctive business-method based on implementation of computer programs, be it software or firmware. Moreover, I stipulate designing a better and still distinctive and global triple-web icon is hardly possible, but this problem you see is like you state of no relevance to thr article that has been proposed for deletion. Therefore I invite you to uniquely comment on the article's content so I can reason why your oppinion is possibly of no or minor relevance like I said before.</li>
<li>I do feel very sorry indeed for you as a registered and practicing European Patent Attorney from the UK that you could not resist and decide otherwise than to prematurely jump to conclusions without possessing all the relevant and factual evidence where the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Court_76da.html" title="European Court">European Court</a> of First Instance in Luxemburg has yet to come to a final judgement. I do not have any clue as to your remarkable behavior, obvious intentions, global approach, common ethics and moral intu√Øtion... but I am still curious to learn... please feel free to correct my wording and ask questions: They will be answered with no charge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Provisional conclusion.</b></li>
<li>Inadequately sourced assessments and pre-conceived second-hand oppinions relying on the failing rule of law are no basis for further debate.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell.html" title="Dell">Dell</a>-aware research group concludes that deciding without knowing is a threat for mutual understanding and world stability, merely sustaining global information-terror to keep special interests at the helm. No case-sensitiveness nor case- awareness, due to rigged foresight and lazy brain-power determines the lack of independent investigative urge: the root-cause of error.</li>
<li>Mr. Dallimore's grip on very complex intertwined factual global evidence and patent-happy attitude proves to be unsatisfactory as his disclosed substance of no or minor relevance blurr the possibly emerging process of transparency for independent judgement. <b>Red Herring</b> strategies are in their final days where the claim- and Comma-culture is starting to abject itself; a notion even the great american nation is now apt to grasp: the real and daily compass of costs-reducing ethics and sustainable energy-politics is prevailing at last!. Compare <b>Exxon Task Force</b> under gasgate 1963 <a href="http://www.complexxon.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.complexxon.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The <b>.E</b>-definition of distinctiveness, being firmware as the swift method of software-implemented business programs will prevail and ultimately explain the global complexxon.</li>
<li>Tackling the government's 'comma-failure' by realigning the american dots of economic fundamentalism. We, the people will take further action and no longer stand alone, but unite while serving truth, that truth may serve.</li>
<li>Let alone the evident riks of inflating and invalidating national patent-systems by increasing litigation, the global overall instability and lack of security caused by the lax internationalization of law, it is more than clear that a global dialogue on energy-fundamentals is the only way to reconstruct confidence within the world's most powerful alliance: not NATO but NATA, the North Atlantic Transparency Alliance.</li>
<li>Lax &amp; lazy law linked to institutional resistence, ignorance and incompetence are being denounced by the real-time extra-governmental developments as a mere inconvenience for special interests.</li>
<li>Stephan Tychon, architect, energy-dissident and Chief officer of Change of the World Stability Council, Bruxxelles.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I regard deleted content of my comments to mr.Dallimore's remarks as plain information-terror and ip/copy-right infringement. Stephan Tychon, Maastricht, the Netherlands.</li>

<li>Good job I didn't delete them then, eh? As I said, I <i>moved</i> them here, as the AfD page is supposed to be for voting. And you can regard it as "ip/copy-right infringement" if you like, but since contributions to Wikipedia fall under the GFDL, you have no copyright to enforce. And while we're on the subject of deletions, kindly don't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Complexxon&amp;diff=79843447&amp;oldid=79841524" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Complexxon&amp;diff=79843447&amp;oldid=79841524" rel="nofollow">delete people's votes</a>. That kind of AfD vandalism will get you blocked fairly sharpish; they're very sensitive about respecting process round here. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 15:48, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
