<li><b>Comment</b>: Hiraki is a "<a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">lolicon</a>" artist, defined as: "In Japan, Lolicon means "pedophilia" or "pedophile"." I am concerned that this article exists at the moment without this being made clear, and wonder what Wiki policy is on the matter, as it could be seen to be promoting such material, not just recording the facts about it. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:46, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The social implications of "lolicon" versus "pedophilia" are somewhat different. While the terms are literally synonymous, "lolicon" in this usage means loli-manga - erotic comic books with young-appearing characters. Loli-manga is not seen on the same level as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abuse.html" title="Child abuse">child abuse</a> in Japan. It's legal, and it's generally accepted (and widely studied) in Japanese society that many adult men are attracted to (but not predatory of) pubescent girls. No relevant ghits for 林原光, but about 700 for 林原ひかり. <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">Lolicon</a> used to have a cover of one her books pictured; a <b>merge</b> would be appropriate. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></a> 02:47, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the article on my school, Christian Heritage, I put in the staff list on Suzanne Levy that she is is Abe's mother, incase somebody was wondering if there was any relation between the two, or just to know as an interesting fact, so they could then come to this article to learn about him. Also, if people who read Abe's articles wanted to know about him, they could come here to do just that. (This is an encyclopedia, anyway.)

<dd>I agree that under regular circumstances it might have been too soon to renominate, but the last listing only had six commentors -- not nearly enough to set a precedent to keep or delete an article. And of those six, five were supporters, and four of those five think that AfD is a vote and that simply saying "Keep - notable" is sufficient. The fifth attempted to demonstrate the notability but offered no support for the claims. Like I said before I have no confidence in the last AfD and have no problems with it being relisted and supporting its deletion. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 02:40, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In any event, it's not a fair account. Moreover, it is uncivil to allege that some people "think that AfD is a vote". With respect, <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> has no way of knowing any such thing about those of his colleagues in this project who voted (or whatever more pedantically accurate word is preferred) last time.

<dd>In not just that one but most AfD's I've seen people think that they are simply there to vote "keep" or "delete", when in reality the point is to arrive at a consensus (or come as close as possible). If you do nothing but show up and say "notable" (or "not notable" for that matter), that does nothing to show a skeptical person why this person deserves an article (which, by the way, I'd still like to see happen here).<br />
<br />
As far as me retracting my comments, I don't see why I would. Of the five supporters last time, two did nothing but say "notable", one mentioned only something about her showing up on Google (as though that proves anything), one mentioned only two references to her on Wikipedia that, if you take the time to look them up, do not demonstrate her notability in any way, and finally you started to make some vague claims that, had I been around, I would have asked you to clarify. As far as I'm concerned, the other four voters did nothing but vote and added nothing to any kind of consensus-building. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 08:44, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You should always assume that fellow wikipedians are valued colleagues who are acting in good faith and with due consideration for the benefit of the project, until you see clear evidence to the contrary. That is certainly how I wish to be regarded.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I have no brief for Rosario Isasi, and I don't think she is so notable that it would have been a travesty if the last AfD had gone the other way. However, I happened to know that she is a reasonably prominent spokesperson for certain views, and so I was surprised to see the article listed here. When I checked on Google, it threw up enough information to confirm that I was not imagining things, or distorting things in my mind. Accordingly, I "voted" to keep the article and briefly stated why, without overstating the point. At least some people who followed me also obviously checked Google to see not only how many hits she had (not all that many, actually) but also their quality, which is pretty impressive. There was, indeed, a process of consensus building, which is how this place is supposed to work. From my experience, a lot of people just vote "delete per nom" - I often do this myself if the nominator has said something that I think is clearly right after I've made some quick checks. There is no need to engage in extensive explanations unless requested. Concision does not in any way demonstrate a lack of understanding of the process. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:40, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1. Okay, but I did see evidence. Actions speak louder than words, after all.</dd>
<dd>2. "Delete per nom" is, of course, completely different from "Delete, non notable", assuming the nominator made valid points.</dd>
<dd>3. Her Google results don't seem any different from what would be expected of anyone in academics who happens to advocate a position. I'd prefer to see where her advocacy has sauntered out of academia and entered into a significant public discourse or some kind of other significant show of her notability. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 10:19, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Firstly, the comments or otherwise of the contributors to the other AfD are irrelevant - it was closed as keep, and if you want to challenge that, take it to DRV. Secondly, at least three of the five keep-ers made points (Metamagician, Royboy and Loremaster), and thirdly the only comment of the single delete-er was "nn". QED. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David.Mestel</a> 16:32, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The first AfD is relevant since many are using its existence to justify keeping this article. It is very common to relist articles that do not receive comments by enough people to reach consensus. Also, unsupported and/or erroneous claims are not worth much. Saying "good google hits" is kind of pointless -- you should cite one or two of them, unless it's completely self-evident upon punching her name into Google which in my experience it was not. Finally, it should go without saying that I prefer both keep and delete "votes" to be accompanied by a justification (even if it's just agreeing with someone else's). <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 21:30, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many of the firt Google hits seem to come from pretty reputable sites. But that is irrelevant. You are trying to use this AfD as a kind of "Appeal" from the previous one. USe DRV for that, that's what it's there for. And anyway, six people is enough (subject to DRV), when they're 5-1 united. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David.Mestel</a> 06:57, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> the winners of the state title are notable for that very fact. They first compete against many other delegates to win their state title, and are treated as royalty for the year of their reign. They have the responsibility of representing their state in a national competition, televised live. I agree this article has a probelm wtih verifiable and reliable sources, but I will give it some work later today and see what I can dig up. The main problem is that she was a state titleholder from 1992 - it will be practically impossible to find news sources from fourteen years ago, not least because the internet wasn't up to much back then. Not quite sure what the motive in creating this article was (I have refrained from creating articles from so far back), but really the article's only problem is that she was notable in 1992 (compared to the delegates of 2006, for whom there are numerous newspaper articles - and no, I haven't put them in yet but again, I will spend some time working on this later today). As for the attempted deletion of Soben Huon - bad faith nom or no, there are a number of responses which agreed that delegates are inherently notable. Simply because there are a number of them doesn't make them any less notable - only 51 delegates are chosen, but hundreds (if not over one thousand) of delegates who compete for state titles. <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater">PageantUpdater</a> 03:45, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

The major US sites (IGN, Gamespot, etc.) frequently reference Eurogamer when they have a big UK scoop.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I respectfully disagree. The information is completely valid and is note-worthy. Little is known about the film because of the studio's secrecy of the project. I have seen the film and it is wonderful. Because it is the studio's first, makes it all the more remarkable - - if only Pixar and Aardman's first films were so entertaining! I recently interviewed the guys at Wavescorx Independent for an up-coming article (printing to coincide with the release of the film) and I am the author of these articles. Please reconsider.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The thought is good, but I'm not sure if it would give a workable solution. First of all, there are a lot more languages in IB than Brithenig and Wenedyk only. Even <a href="http://www.langmaker.com/db/Category:Languages_of_Ill_Bethisad" class="external text" title="http://www.langmaker.com/db/Category:Languages_of_Ill_Bethisad" rel="nofollow">this list</a> is far from complete! In order to be complete, I'm afraid an article like the one you're referring to would be pretty exhaustive, and it would also have to list quite a lot of languages that notability-wise would not warrant inclusion. Another thing is that not all IB language would owe their notability to Ill Bethisad only, case in point being <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brithenig.html" title="Brithenig">Brithenig</a>. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 19:29, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

You may like it or not, but there are a lot of people interested in these things.

<ul>
<li>If neither you nor any other IB member have been doing the article writing or the spamming, may I ask upon what grounds you conceive that to be an attack upon you? That being said, I am quite happy at characterizing writing an article about a non-notable subject across several Wikipedias "spamming;" I've certainly created no article myself which in my estimation failed to pass the applicable criteria. That there is a fandom on artificial languages is irrelevant; there are fandoms based around many things which still nonetheless must past verifiability and notability musters. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:50, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I consider it to be an attack upon me ánd the other fifty IB members because of the way you formulated it: "[...] an alternate history project fifty people have bought into [...] That they <i>[i.e. those fifty people]</i> have managed to slip under the radar and spam etc.". It may just be a matter of poor word choice, but you áre implying that all IB related stuff was produced by IB members only. That's simply not true. I also object against the term "spam", which I would define as violent, unsollicited self-promotion. None of these qualifications are true. By using the term, you implicitly attack not the article, but the people who worked on it in (presumably) good faith. Again, if you don't care for the subject, that's fine. But calling articles about subjects you don't care for "spam" is very unpleasant; there are lots of subjects I don't care for myself, but I wouldn't dream of calling them "spam". Besides, if the existence of a fandom doesn't point towards notability, then what does? As far as both Ill Bethisad and Wenedyk are concerned, verifiability doesn't seem to be the issue. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 20:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article passed the previous call for deletion: this means there was not enough clear opposition. Constructed languages aren't "fake" any more than a model railway is a "fake" railroad. The usual ad hominem attacks and misinformation round out the opposition to the article. Naysayers seem to only rely on personal dislike for a subject rather than reasoned dispute. "Notability" is also a red herring: there are plenty of lesser known artists and works of art out there that are and ought to be recorded as part of the deposit of human culture. Elemtilas 22:01, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(User's sole contributions are on AfDs concerning artificial languages) I doubt anyone would call a model railroad "fake." As it happens, there is a model railroad enthusiasts' club in my area, with a large set up and about sixty-five members. Would you consider, under your stance, an article about SSRE's railroad suitable for Wikipedia? As far as notability being a "red herring," your position that lesser works of art deserve recordation notwithstanding, Wikipedia has notability guidelines to determine whether an article can be included or not. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:19, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what if my "sole contributions" are on AfDs concerning artificial languages. That doesn't make my opinion any less valid than yours. Since you understand how a model railroad isn't a "fake" railroad, you already understand how a model language isn't a "fake" langauge. I would consider an article about model railroading every bit as acceptable as an article about conlanging. A short article about a spectacular model railway (like "Roadside America", if it still exists), or a conlang, or some lesser known opus by a not-so-well-known composer are all quite valid. Notability is a red herring because there are no good objective criteria. If your whole artistic world revolves around rap, then the Seasons will hardly be "notable".

<li>Me neither. Since you are referring to the verifiability page, why do you place the burden of evidence upon the creator of the language, and not on the person who wrote the article, or on the third parties who might give their objective opinion? That seems pretty contradictory to me! But for the record, I'm the creator of the language in question, and I'll be more than happy to provide you with any information you need. So, what is it you want to see verified? My website is sufficient proof that the language exists, and is real, so that can't be the issue. Significance? Aside of the two printed sources mentioned by Bo-Lingua, the web is full of references to Wenedyk. Of course, you might argue that the web is not a reliable source, but whether you like it or not, it is a new medium, which has changed the world completely. Therefore, judging an internet-published creation by the amount of books written about it is like judging the quality of a car by the question whether a horse can pull it. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 18:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>As a matter of fact, I can't and won't, for the very reason I stated above. As the creator of the language, it's not up to me to decide what its significance is. My contribution to the article therefore has been limited to adding an interwiki link here and there, and correcting one blatant error. Anything beyond that would come dangerously close to what's described in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. That is also the reason why I haven't issued a vote and only given a few comments. I'll look for the Polish magazine (I should have it around somewhere) and add the data here.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree that verifiability is a bit of a problem but nicknames in <s>Australian</s> sport is an integral part of its culture. A well maintained list likes this is a useful tool for readers for cross referencing.

<li>Half-hearted <b>Keep</b> - previous two make good cases, verifiability becomes the issue - on the other hand, if you can't verify something to do with Aussie rules, it's not worth writing about - nick names are commonly shown in the papers and footy related media. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 01:18, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looking through this list, footy fans would recognise 80-90% of the nicknames without a problem - verifiability is probably not an issue, and it is possible that people are overeacting.

<li>Not to nitpick, but no such policy exists. The closest thing is the rejected <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> attempts at a guideline. In practice of course it is obvious that 99.99% of all school articles are kept on at least a "no consensus".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:47, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While I agree that all schools are notable, is it really necessary to have a one line article telling us that the school is located in the town for which it is named?

<li><b>Comment</b>. While a concensus has evolved, that we should keep all schools surely this at the moment is a speedy candidate as a restatement of the title ie Torquay Girls Grammar School is a girls grammar school in Torquay or words to that effect.

<dd>It <i>is</i> advertising and not information. The purpose of you putting that article here is to make money.

<dd>I understand your point. but if I wanted to make money from this article I would have been much more agressive on the message. I also understand that you are facing a lot of messages like this. But you promote big companies and I think it is quite scary that you don't do the same for small ones. Scooplive is a new concept and I am sure it is good for an encyclopdy like Wikipedia to be up to date. Thanks for your answer.

<p>Non notable&gt; This is a new article and will be expanded on as and when new contributors find it. It is already linked from the GIS page, and a sister page for GRASS GIS (opensource) has been on Wikipedia for some time without deletion. This page has taken some time to compose by hand - all a voluntary contribution.</p>
<p>Advertisement&gt; If Soumyasch had read it properly, he/she would understand that QGIS is a free, opensource project which has been around for several years. If Soumyasch thinks this is an advertisment, then perhaps he/she would add further arrogance and consider removing the entire GIS page along with anything computer related! GRASS GIS and commercial packages already have mention/pages on Wikipedia. This is nonsense.</p>
<p>Bias article&gt; This is a new article and will be expanded on as and when new contributors find it. There is no basis to judge this article as bias. It is exactly as the application is. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Willwood (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillwood_5daa.html" title="User talk:Willwood">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willwood_3770.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willwood">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>As a reply to Willwood, let me make myself clear that I have nothing against QGIS. It is only because of the ad-like nature of the article that I nominated this. Let me point out some instances.</dd>
<dd><i>...is an opensource GIS (mapping) application which is comparable in quality to commercial packages. It is an ideal ‘beginner’ GIS application and...</i></dd>
<dd><i>...is ideal for use on older hardware or running simultaneously with other applications where CPU power may be limited...</i></dd>
<dd><i>...the advantage of Quantum GIS over GRASS GIS is that it does not require the X11 windowing system in order to run, and all round the interface is much cleaner and faster...</i></dd>
<dd>How exactly do you <i>quantify</i> quality? And what does this line do if not promoting QGIS with vague marketing words. The entire article is such, claiming superiority over other softwares without providing concrete evidence for that, thereby making it heavily biased towards the application is trying to promote. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch"><font color="green">so</font></a><a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoumyasch_8605.html" title="User talk:Soumyasch"><font color="red">U</font></a><a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch"><font color="green">m</font></a><a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoumyasch_8605.html" title="User talk:Soumyasch"><font color="red"><b>y</b></font></a><a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoumyasch_8605.html" title="User talk:Soumyasch"><font color="red">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch"><font color="green">ch</font></a> 13:28, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You really should read that page more carefully. It is quite clear that meeting any one of the listed criteria is sufficient to establish notability, but that the list is not exclusive or exhaustive. The guideline also states, quite explicitly, that "<i>Receiving full professorship at a prestigious university, or receiving a named professorship at a reputable university</i>" can be considered a notable award or honor. Since there is no dispute, I hope, that Harvard is generally regarded as "prestigious," it should be clear that the article clearly asserted, and gave presumptive evidence of, notability. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 18:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Please read my statements a bit more carefully; the nominator stated that the article didn't include any "information on the notability of the subject"; your point is that it did include information of that sort, but that the information may not be sufficiently verified or may be inaccurate. Those are two different issues. I was quite careful to note that Eusebeus misrepresented the contents of the article, a point that you don't seem to disagree on. And, besides, the second and third Google primary entries for this search document his status as having chaired the department <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Christopher+Winship+Harvard+sociology&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Christopher+Winship+Harvard+sociology&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:03, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I <b>do</b> disagree on it, strongly; I am quite capable of saying what I really mean, and am in no need of (generally inaccurate) inferences of what others think I mean. As it is, Eusebeus' views on why he does not find a department chairmanship notable in of itself are not only defensible, but not subject to a referendum; he belives what he believes, and I doubt he's asking anyone's permission to do so. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was not the one who initially prodded the article, <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">User:Scientizzle</a> did; I am simply restating the reasons given by the initial prod. However, asserting that being chairman of a university department (even Harvard) is immediate and indisputable grounds for notability is simply <i>ingenu.</i> Chairmanships are served on a rotating basis by faculty and are often avoided assiduously as being a burdensome administrative and political position. There is a standard for inclusion of professors on WP, and while you could perhaps be excused for overlooking this, the fact that San Saba has specifically outlined it above makes your angry demand to speedy keep and your gratuitous accusation of bad faith and dishonesty seem simply absurd. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 16:22, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You might consider telling the truth. I did not say that chairing a Harvard department was "indisputable grounds for notability." I said it was information relating to notability. You posted a claim that the article contained no such information. Were you deliberately misprepresenting the contents of the article, or are you claiming that an obviously inaccurate claim in a prod nomination is a good faith reason to propose deleting on article on an otherwise notable subject? And, despite your snide, uncivil and almost entirely uninformed comments on the notability standards for professors, it will be clear to anyone who actually reads the page involved that San Saba's analysis was undeniably incorrect. Perhaps you should read the page before you propose any further deletions of notable academics. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 17:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, I'm sorry for all my wanton lying. Look, there are perfectly valid reasons to vote to keep. But you state that I misrepresent the article, which notes he was <i>Chair of Harvard's sociology department</i> and <i>Director of the Program in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences at Northwestern</i>. I don't believe that presumptively confers notability, my <i>snide, uncivil and almost entirely uninformed comments</i> notwithstanding. You can certainly disagree with that - adamently if you like. But it is a leap to arrive at an <i>AfD nomination which so clearly misrepresents the contents of the article in question (that) it is impossible to take in good faith.</i> <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 18:39, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He's a full professor at Harvard with a named chair (not the same as chair of the department -- a named professorship is a professorship that comes with its own funding and is considered prestigious to get... though at a well-funded school like Harvard, it may be more the rule than the exception). He was the chair of the department from 1998-2001. He was also the chair of the Sociology department at Northwestern from 1988-1992. This guy is an <i>accomplished</i> academic, nowhere near run-of-the-mill. He meets criteria 3 and 4 of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> easily, and arguably criteria 2 and 8 as well. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:31, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

But you would do well to pay attention to WP:PROFTEST; it actually does have a lot of support, and furthermore, it's there to be informative about academia's own standards for success.

<dd>I am an academic myself, so I fully recognize how these researchers may be <i>important</i>, but generally non-notable. I personally think <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> may be too lenient (8 criteria seem ~equally weighted, but I think they're inherently unequal: there are a lot of mediocre scientists with a large volume of published data, for example, and many awards <i>sound</i> important but mean little to anyone outside of a particular field). I gladly open this up for debate because, as a community, the larger desires of the Wikipedia community should determine academic notability.

Still, it is the author's first novel (he previously co-wrote some game modules for "Silent Death, the Next Millennium") and sales don't appear to be overly brisk. If someone can prove he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as an author, I'd say it would be best practice to create a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Sigler_e343.html" title="Scott Sigler">Scott Sigler</a> article, merge the content there, and add a link to the main EarthCore (the AU festival) article. Basically all I see right now is that the author is releasing a podcast of his novel for download and I don't see how that qualifies an article. It could be of historical interest if "podiobooks" become a well established genre (and the claim of this being the first is actually true), but it's crystalballism to say that at this point.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:58, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Makes no claim to notability in the article. Ten months is long enough to expand, if it was going to happen. Originally created by an IP that has no other edits. Band members added by an IP showing a pattern of being used by multiple real users. Two band members subsequently removed by an IP address that may have vandalized the article... All other edits are deletion nominations/removals, or changing the capitalization of the name. I'd say nobody is working on it.

<li>Off the cuff, for a first pass I'd say exclude everything under a certain diameter (10 km?) unless it has some interesting information that can be added. Alternatively cut off the list at the start of the photographic discoveries, unless the asteroid is interesting. Articles primarily about the origins of an eponym should be merged somewhere.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as it now seems to be verifiable, and Wikipedia isn't censored. It's not a dictdef because it's a social phenomenon (an unkind and uncaring one).

<li><b>Keep and move to Hogging/Sagging</b> these are engineering terms to do with the stress acting upon beams, and not specific to ships in any way.

<li>As the original author of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strength_of_ships.html" title="Strength of ships">Strength of ships</a> I'm sort of biased, but a <b>Redirect</b> there wouldn't cause any serious damage. That article could be expanded (and should be a bit if we redirect, to cover those specific terms in more detail), but is ok for a basic intro. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 21:30, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strength_of_Ships_e5fc.html" title="Strength of Ships">Strength of Ships</a>, which looks like a significant article.

<li>As the author of both articles, I'm definitely biased towards <b>Keep</b>, I did not know what the term meant when I read it in an news.com.au article, so I thought I would look it up at the wikipedia, I did and there was no entry, so I hunted around a little more and found out what it meant. That is why I believe it should be kept. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFosnez_378c.html" title="User:Fosnez">Fosnez</a> 02:37, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't think anyone is arguing that we shouldn't keep an explanation of what they are in Wikipedia. They're notable aspects of how ship structures behave under loads, and something that anyone designing a ship has to take into account. I have a naval architecture degree and agree that we should have some description for sagging and hogging. The question is, in my view, should we have better sections in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strength_of_ships.html" title="Strength of ships">Strength of ships</a> article on sagging and hogging, or separate articles? I don't know that they really have to be separate. It won't hurt to make those two articles redirect to an improved section of the Strength of ships article, I think. For what it's worth, I also added a diagram of sagging and hogging to the Strength of ships article (and, if we keep the other articles, you can add it to those too). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 05:13, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

That's a paradigmatic <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, and nominating an article for deletion without a good faith basis for believing it meets the deletion policy criteria is by definition bad faith; that the nominator's indiscriminate actions affect the good and bad alike is hardly a sign of good faith.

<dd>That is a fallacy. Two wrongs do not make a right. If you feel that Wikipedia would be improved by these articels not being included, then by all means nominate them for deletion and demand consensus. A distaste for popular culture on an editor's own part does not justify applying that bias when the community's consensus has spoken otherwise. It is a vital fact to remember that at Wikipedia we must work toward consensus; doing <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> things is encouraged, but that is only as long as it doesn't go against the will of the community as declared by consensus.

<dd>You've missed my point entirely. I don't reject the community consensus on notability. I accept the low bar it sets. I object to the refusal of a relatively small but quite active and vocal groups of editors to accept that consensus as it applies to certain subjects, particularly knowledge workers, creative artists, and figures outside American-Western-European-based cultures. I think the extensive creation of articles relating to those subjects by a very large number of editors is a much clearer demonstration of consensus than the actions of the relatively tiny number of editors who work incessantly for deletion. We have gotten to a cultural state where "Gee, I never heard of this" seems to be a good enough excuse to nominate something for deletion, RATHER THAN raising legitimate issues on the talk page first to see if anyone can help improve the article. There's a real sickness in the process, and, in terms of encyclopedic goals, it's ludicrous. It drives away new editors. It offends the subjects of articles, many of whom could be valuable contributors. And it continues to expose the project to public embarassment. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 03:02, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think you're conflating different issues here: this isn't about "mediocrity" (I doubt Montgomery is a "mediocre" scientist)--you seem to have willfully misinterpreted my statement above. I simply meant that having a large number of publications does not a good scientist make. (My arguments for and against portions of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> are being crafted now &amp; I will share them soon...) Additionally, as I tried to suggest above, you are conflating "importance" with "notability." These are often correlated, but certainly many examples exist in which one is prominent while the other is missing. Often it's difficult to define either, kind of a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potter_Stewart_d5d7.html" title="Potter Stewart">Potter Stewart</a>-esque <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobellis_v._Ohio_046e.html" title="Jacobellis v.

Maybe this isn't "right," and we should inform the world of the work of good, but unknown (publicly), scientists...that's why I think this is a good thing to debate! -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 00:50, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you've missed my point almost entirely, and you've missed an important point on notability. As what appears to be the most broadly accepted, if not consensus, treatment of notability here says, <i>A topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact. It is an extension of the notion of prominence for biographical articles. It differs, however, from fame and importance; while all articles on "famous" and "important" subjects are notable, not all notable subjects are famous or important.</i> And, given the sheer number of articles from thousands of editors which are created according to these principles, there's much stronger evidence that this represents consensus than the contrary behavior of a relative handful of editors who participate in the AfD process. "Policy is what we do" is an imperfect guide, but it's better than "Policy is decided by whoever yells the loudest." <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 02:45, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I read your point loud and clear. Montgomery is not "known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency," and therefore the impetus to show that he "should be" falls upon those who would vote to keep. The strongest argument is that he won an award--one that is, clearly, also not "known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency" (should it be?).

<li><b>Keep</b> per Mangojuice. The problem with the proftest is that we scientists are too self-effacing. Mostly we want to do our work, get grants, write papers, and get recognized in our field, and wikipedia doesn't fit our image of what recognition looks like. I worked with a man who was on the cover of Science with the discovery of the year one year and he's not in here, for heaven's sake. I would rather have a high citation count or a low grant score than a wikipedia article. But at the same time I think it is objectively true that an academic with one peer-reviewed publication has contributed more to human existence than any pokemon character or Gundam Wing mecha (speaking not of the overall value of the game or manga but of the desire to have separate articles for each separate morph of each monster). Maybe we scientists should start standing up for ourselves! <small>I'm sorry for making a fuss.

The proftest is a very high bar. If "more important than the average actor" or "more important than the average band" were that standards for other bio-like articles then a lot of cruft would go. There are over a million schools in the US alone, if each one gets an article, then WP:PROFTEST seems an overly severe standard for scientists and other professional researchers. There is nothing wrong with PROFTEST, it's simply out of step with other WP standards of notability, where more inclusionist editors have sway over notability standards. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 04:58, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems a shame to delete this, but I've recently become aware of the fact that I've got deletionist tendencies, and the doctir said the best way to deal with this is by AFDing articles.

<li>I should have written rather than implied "in my opinion" to my opinion. There is controversy over whether notability should be used or not (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> outlines the arguments well), so I'm uneasy about an AfD that uses only that argument as grounds for deletion. I think that in this case there are valid grounds for deletion, but four people's opinion that it is not notable (without reference or support for that opinion) is too subjective. I'd be much more likely to be convinced by a demonstration of non-notability than a description. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 21:22, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I added David Anber after his term on the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a> National Council had come to an end. Many Canadians were impressed with the work David did as a National Councillor.</li>
</ul>
<p>National Council, for those of you who don't know, was the highest governing body of the party - a National board of directors of the 2nd largest political party in Canada (at the time).</p>
<p>Elected at age 21, David proposed the resolution, which Council approved, that gave the leader <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Harper_d9dd.html" title="Stephen Harper">Stephen Harper</a> the constitutional authority to move ahead with the merger process of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_1501.html" title="Conservative Party">Conservative Party</a>.</p>
<p>Not only was that merger highly newsworthy in Canada, but it led to the conditions which brought the Conservative Party to government, ironically on David's birthday this year.</p>
<p>Moreover, David has published many articles in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Post_afd6.html" title="National Post">National Post</a> (a Nationally read newspaper in Canada) as well as the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Gazette_61ae.html" title="Montreal Gazette">Montreal Gazette</a>. From the latter publication are quotations in this article on the subject of former prime minister <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Martin_629b.html" title="Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a>.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that he's highly renown, but in the spirit of Wikipedia, he qualifies as a young Canadian who is so immersed in politics, at such high levels, that someone may reasonably want to learn about him. That's what Wikipedia is for.</p>
<p>Finally, some of you might wonder why I have not submitted any other articles. Well, David was the first I had planned to submit and there were a few other names from their involvement in the Canadian Alliance who I was going to post, but I never got around to it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that we should keep this article because it meets some basic thresholds for notoriety. We have to remember that Wikipedia is not just a place for VERY famous people but also a place for people of marginal importance if they have held a major political role, published in wide circulation or taken part in noteworthy events. I know History BA has been on a recent crusade of delete-campaigns, but we need to remember the following: Wikipedia would not be where it is today if every borderline case was deleted. Thankfully, Wikipedia has this information available for people who might want to know about a few "below the surface" details about the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unite_the_Right_0b65.html" title="Unite the Right">Unite the Right</a> process in Canada. 24.43.87.250 16:23, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete</b> He simply isn't notable. We wouldn't include every member of the council. The accomplishments listed seem relatively slight. Two letters to the editor, a motion passed at council to support the premise that the party was built upon (and which user 24.43.87.250 noted was an ongoing process in the article). As for his age, the McGill link in the article indicates that his acclamation resulted from the party's lack of a following in Quebec, where all candidates were acclaimed. In any event his young age doesn't seem to justify inclusion. I understand that the two "keep" votes know him and I'm sure that he's a nice guy but I think that it would be unusual if this article was kept. --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 17:08, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Very interesting that nobody is speaking to the criteria for inclusion. A person doesn't have to be very famous to remain on Wikipedia, but people of minor importance might be notable if they have met one of wikipedia's conditions. Reading from Junkie's reasons above it appears as though Mr. Anber held a Senior position, in a National party. That on it's own meets wikipedia's standards. Second, it is stated that Mr. Anber has made contributions to Canadian newspapers with wide circulation. If that is true, that also meets wikipedia's standards. Does anybody have further information on Mr. Anber's contributions? Third, the Conservative Party creation was one of the most significant political stories for years in Canada. Anybody who had some unique role (from the big players to the smaller ones) in starting, continuing, etc such an event is IMO notable. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittania1_243b.html" title="User:Brittania1">Brittania1</a> 21:13, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just a comment because I've already voted. I'm not sure if this really is the appropriate place to say this but I would take any opportunity to promote Wikipedia. I've noticed that there are a number of new users who are interested in keeping the article, particularily Canpolijunkie who created the article and user:24.43.87.250 who I know has spent a lot of effort on it. And I see that Britannia1 has taken an interest here and perhaps decided to move from a WP reader to an editor. Yet it seems as though the article is headed for deletion. All three of these users have made articulate, reasoned and detailed comments along with your votes and I really hope that this doesn't turn you off of Wikipedia. It really is a wonderful project and it truly is for everybody, just like the slogan says. Unfortunately it is the nature of Wikipedia that our first experience as editors is a often negative one. I just hope that, whatever the vote outcome, you guys can give it a chance and see the way things work around here and hopefully you will all stick around so that we can all work together at improving the project. We don't always agree but there is definitely a place for everyone here. Once you get used to the process and the other editors I'm sure that you will find many more positive than negative experiences here. If David Anber has created an interest that has created three new articulate and energetic editors, then I'd like to thank him for that. And thanks for the space to everyone else. --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 19:55, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per junkie and britania. I actually think David Anber is a complete idiot from my few encounters with him. I also think the merger was a terrible thing and that Stephen Harper is bad for Canada -- that said it was definitely historical and people who played a role in it will be relevant and will have a certain timelessness in 10 or 100 years from now. 137.122.26.128 18:19, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Despite the fact that a note was left on my talk page by one of the article's proponents requesting my input since I had previously done some minor edits to this article but hadn't AFD'd it, I'm <i>not</i> personally convinced of notability here — but like most other Wikipedia editors, I have to admit that there are times when I couldn't always be bothered to actually do the AFDing. I've learned to be especially cautious, in fact, with detailed articles about young guys who give off the impression of thinking they're a lot more notable than they really are; I can usually hear their army of sockpuppets lining up a mile away. Bottom line, for me, is that I just don't see how he's <i>encyclopedia</i> material yet. He's not an elected politician, and even as a backroom boy he has yet to reach the level where the general public would recognize his name (like a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Kinsella_5d74.html" title="Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a> or a <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Long_f84d.html" title="Tom Long">Tom Long</a>.) He's just your run-of-the-mill young party activist who's not really all that notable right now. If he keeps his record of achievement up, he'll probably be encyclopedic soon enough — but he's not there yet. <b>Delete</b>. (And this isn't a partisan concern; I voted to delete Richard Diamond and Cory Pike, too.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:31, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain,</b> since I'm obviously in a conflict of interest. I'm not going to weigh in with a "vote" per-se, but I will make a few comments. Sure, as <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milhouse_Van_Houten_ac8b.html" title="Milhouse Van Houten">Milhouse Van Houten</a> says, "my mom says I'm cool", but I understand how many people feel I'm not notable. I've looked at the comments and am somewhat amused that I've generated such interest though. Here are my observations: First of all, of all the submissions <b>4 Deletes</b> have actually advanced an argument to <b>Delete</b> and <b>3 Keeps</b> have made arguments to <b>Keep</b>. Although many people have piled on, my objective view is that - no matter what topic - the debate should be framed among the posters who advance individual arguments. IMO each "as per so-and-so" vote is really only worth 5% of an elaborated vote for the purposes of this process (and I really do mean IMO in general and not just because it's about me). My next observation is a general one about Wikipedia. This site has been fantastic for me learning anything about anything. I'm a law student and I never imagined that an "encyclopedia" would actually have the depth to point me in the right direction (i.e. on jurisprudence or theory) at some points. But Wikipedia is also more than depth; its breadth of subject matter is also impressive. Although I wouldn't lose sleep at a personal level about being deleted, more generally, I'd be a bit disappointed if fewer and fewer comparable "footnote-type-tid-bits" were weeded out of Wikipedia. I like being able to look up a topic and find little tiny facts that I can't find elsewhere. A few posters to my defense have made this point (that I'm not very relevant, but I might just scrape by). Many of the posters to the contrary never really reasoned out why this is not the case, although I respect their opinions. Best Regards to All; I particularly liked JGGardiner's comment to keep everything in perspective. Cheers. <a href="../../../a/n/b/User%7EAnber_f9d4.html" title="User:Anber">Anber</a> 04:29, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I am very sorry to say I believe this article was written in my name but if you look at my contributions to wikipedia you will see this entry as out of place, for this reason, I am most certain a friend of mine accessed my account and wrote it in my name, he was banned from wikipedia ( for editing articles ) and so I never wanted this to exist and I am outraged how such a clearly flase article still remains on wikipedia. I know this cause the friend in question talked about the Social Imperialist party as his own and I've seen him on wikipedia more than a few times, and I will not bore you with more senseless details. I support the complete deletion of this article, I find it insulting as a Canadian.</li>

<li>The fact that there are several different usages of the term (as mentioned above) in no way invalidates the use of this entry.

<p>DON'T DELETE THIS - mule is in every sense a huge part of the New England youth vernacular.

<p>As the original creator of this article, I feel that given the youth culture associations of the term (the hand-sign, the particular celebrities thought to be examplary) place it beyond the purview of a dictionary. Wikipedia does have an entry on the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_horns.html" title="Devil horns">devil horns</a>. Admittedly, millions of people know that sign, while only hundreds know this one. Nonetheless, it's legitimate and accurate. Obscure, but legitimate. To delete it would simply be to make the Wikipedia less complete. There are two external links here. Avery Score was not a blogger for Gamespot, he was a columnist, with over 300 articles credited to him. The Eskapade page is not a blog either; it's the homepage of an established band. I understand the counterarguments, but I respectfully disagree with them.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>. Seeing as Wikipedia has articles on other slang, subcultures, and symbols, I do not find a reason to exclude this. People come to Wikipedia to learn more about many things. The internet and even Wikipedia itself could be construed as a subculture with just as many slang words and symbols/icons. Why would you neglect something similar just because you haven't heard of it? If people can't learn about something new what is the use of an encyclopedia anyways? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.119.142.185 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.119.142.185_f796.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.119.142.185">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Good point. Unfortunately one fact shoots a hole ithrough your argument: a term such as this could not -possibly- be made up in school one day. Or made up in school over the course of several days. What muledom is and what it stands for is as organic as soy milk: hearty, earthy and completely un-squalid. Something so un-squalid, in fact, that it must be experienced to be believed. But you're all mules, we know this, and we have faith in you to do the right thing. In summary: Wikipedia -IS- for things formed -organically- through -life- over the course of -experience-! 05:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC) St. Alexi the camera-man.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.7.44.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.7.44.231_2bbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.7.44.231">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Please Do Not Delete</b>I first heard the term 'mule' in the greater Boston area in the late 1990s. I'm not sure that the usage can be found in any major print publication, but if you visit any Boston-area highschool, you're bound to come across some 'mules.' The same could have been said of the term 'wicked pissah' when it first appeared, perhaps as long ago as the mid-1970s. Now the term is practically a cultural phenomenon. I believe it's in Wikipedia's best interest to keep this definition available. Thanks. ~~ C.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is most certainly a list, although the prominence of the schools' seals does make it a bit distressing to the eye. Although relatively few schools compete for the college football/soccer championship of the Philippines, the national title of a country is clearly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 00:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of data</a>. If there were something <i>here</i> besides just a bunch of seals, then it could be kept, but there isn't anything. Write about each championship, write how they won, anything significant about it, as it is, this could be replaced with a Category. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:40, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not an indiscriminate collection of data. It's a list of Philippine collegiate football champions. If its defect is that it lacks two sentences describing the existence of football in that country, that defect is simple to remedy. Notable "Champions' lists" are classic encyclopedic material in the coverage of sport -- arguing that they aren't seems a bit absurd to me. The argument to be made is about notability: a national collegiate title easily passes that hurdle also. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:30, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Needs some work (remove/reduce seals to increase readability, expand/explain UUAP nearer the top) but nothing unfixable.

We don't, for example, have a list that's just the results of all the MLB baseball games, and if we did, I'd have the same opinion about that.

<li><b>Merge</b>. But while we're at it we can shuck off the unsourced nonsense and clean it up a tad (we should have a Canadian words page akin to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_words.html" title="Australian words">Australian words</a>, with possibly a different layout, as I proposed on the talk page.) As for words that are used outside of Canada: 1) Briticisms used in Canada are dealth with at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_English_79ce.html" title="Canadian English">Canadian English</a>; 2) the U.S. has given many, many words to Canadian English, but many other words that have little or no currency in Britain, Australia, etc. are equally representative of <i>both</i> Canada and (possibly some parts of) the U.S. (e.g. <i>sawbuck</i>, <i>eaves trough</i>, and the orig. U.S. but now more Canadian-sounding <i>washroom</i>, to mention three words that are not even "slang"). Other words of this kind come from lumbering, farming, landscape features, etc., and many of these have other meanings also common in Britain---which is why they appear on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English_e65a.html" title="List of words having different meanings in British and American English">List of words having different meanings in British and American English</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> separate, because the nature of the article is better presented on it's own. It's a little oddball, but quite entertaining and, I believe, educational. Enjoyed it. One can't easily verify slag terms, especially ones new on the scene. However, from my local standpoint (BC) I recognize dozens that are indeed in common usage here. I feel that active editing can keep the list correct, especially with the removal of some rare/taboo entries. Moving to a Canadian words page also acceptable per JackLumber's comment above. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriplight_bc84.html" title="User:Triplight">Triplight</a> 08:59, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - just reformat and attempt to verify. If <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_words.html" title="Australian words">Australian words</a> can have an article on its own (with localised sayings and things that can't be verified in there either) I don't see why Canadians can't. And for the record, I've read many of these words and noted them in unique parlance amongst many different people in the cities I've lived in (Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Hamilton, London, Windsor, Kenora) See the Aussie words article. If regionalisation is a problem, perhaps people should add where in Canada they are used. If words being used elsewhere is a problem, perhaps we should note that (just as the Aussie words notes common words used in both Aussie and NZ parlance.) <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossilfang_d2eb.html" title="User:Fossilfang">fossilfang</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The unverifiability of one article isn't really a justification for keeping another article with problems of verifiability, imo. If what you say about <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_words.html" title="Australian words">Australian words</a> is true, then perhaps that article, too, can be considered for deletion or at least clean-up. It may be that a merge of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_slang.html" title="Canadian slang">Canadian slang</a> into List of words mainly used in Canadian English will accomplish the purpose of maintaining genuine, verifiably distinct Canadian expression while removing the current free-for-all. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 18:31, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough. Perhaps we can see what the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_words.html" title="Australian words">Australian words</a> article does differently (and also other slang articles/dictionaries) and see how we can cannabalise parts of the present list, whilst keeping the concept of having some sort of list with rules (e.g., specify which locale a slang word is used in, specify if it is shared with American slang or otherwise, delete words that are voted on as being non-representative of Canadian language)? With this in my mind my vote remains the same, with the reservation that set rules be put in place on the talk page and strictly adhered to. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossilfang_d2eb.html" title="User:Fossilfang">fossilfang</a> 06:19, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A Mr David Sale and a Dr Ray Dam claim to have offered to buy MG Rover for $5billion. They say they're from a Thailand-based outfit called the Office of International Treasury Control created by ``Governments of the World of Legal Decadency<i>. They complain that Rover's administrators PWC won't take their offer seriously but say that Tony Blair has acknowledged it in a letter. Downing St says it has no record of a letter but that it ``could still be in the system</i>. PWC has never heard of them. Nevertheless, Dam and Sale have big plans for Rover if their offer is accepted - factories in Longbridge, Russia, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. <b>Alas, the Bangkok number on their letterhead doesn't exist.</b> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/04/27/ccdiary27.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/04/27/ccdiary27.xml" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></dd>

<li><b>Move</b> per Khaosworks. Quasi-legal puffery sounds exactly like typical fraud perpetration, devoid of any verfiable details. But we do need to make this a clean, well written, properly referenced article. I see it this way: if this is a fraud, they won't be able to produce reliable sources and have earned this global outing; if this is really a secret U.N.-sponsored operation, its inability to defend itself with unreleasable, unprovable documents will demonstrate why such things are anathema in free societies. Either way, the article (under an NPOV title) is justified by information provided by reliable sources, per WP policy. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 03:51, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My personal convictions are the same as khaosworks'. I moved the article after a complaint about this article on my talk page and reading through the article and the previous AfD, this was probably a bad move on my part - at the time I saw it the same as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_fraud.html" title="Internet fraud">Internet fraud</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_card_fraud.html" title="Credit card fraud">Credit card fraud</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_fraud.html" title="Wire fraud">Wire fraud</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Click_fraud.html" title="Click fraud">Click fraud</a> and the like. It has now become apparent that this will be difficult to prove as fraud per se and am content to have it moved back to the original location.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sufficiently informed on the subject to know whether this article should be deleted, but at the very least it's <b>highly</b> POV. Any article that's prefaced with something along the lines of "The Office of International Treasury Control, (OITC), appears to be a scam of international proportions." needs a cleanup of epic proportions. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 01:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have attempted to address your concern by changing the first paragraph and referrign, with links, to the OITC own account of their creation (as published in the London Daily Telegraph), and to the newspapers that have not refrained from clearly stating that the OITC is an international scam and a hoax. As I have mentioned in the discussion page, all the original information included there has been taken from governmental websites and well-known newspapers. The so called "sources" presented by the OITC people are nothing but a list of incoherences and bizarre claims, wholly unverifiable. I hope the wikipedians will be able to consider the difference and will allow this very necessary article to remain.24.215.205.163&#160;<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.215.205.163.html" title="User talk:24.215.205.163">(talk)</a> 02:13, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Speedy Delete. Comment. This articles carries dangers that are beyond comprehension. In both cases, Ecuador and Fiji, the newspaper reports are based upon supposition, they are totally based upon flawed information and in the Ecuador case, the press is using its power to destroy a rival. The MG Rover situation stating that OITC offered $10 is nonsense. There is a great deal more to it than that. I am a retired police officer, but I spent a lot of time years ago investigating Keith Scott who is an Australian citizen. I have found that while he does engage in unusual financial dealings, as stated by Police Commissioner Hughes, he also delivers. I know of no case where Scott or OITC have ever engaged in fraud, and they have been operating for more than ten years. Yes there is a file a foot thick on Scott, but there is NO evidence that he has ever committed or intended to commit fraud. When under such surveillance, he would have been arrested and incarcerated years ago if he was a scammer. The newspapers rage in Fiji that landowners will have to mortgage their lands, which has been proven to be total nonsense.</p>
<p>Here is why I say this article is dangerous. 1. It definitely impairs the capacity to do correct due diligence which is available through official sources. 2. OITC will eventually sue these newspapers, of that I am sure. Sefanaia Kaumaitotoya warned the press on this. The Prime Minister in Fiji is now very careful what he says about OITC today, Andrew Hughes has gone silent, even though the government and police websites still carry these statements. Extension of these falsehoods and the perpetuating of them is not only irresponsible, for they are merely supposition born from ignorance, these attacks on OITC are criminal. I know OITC lawyers will be asking for the IP address and identity of the person posting these falsehoods. I am told that a leading law firm in Fiji will be paid by OITC in this coming week to file against the Fiji Times and FijiSun Newspapers and to file against The Commissioner of Police. Is this an empty threat. No. As will be learned this week,it is a fact. I am not certain of the legal liabilities of Wikipedia as such, but you will be hearing from OITC lawyers this coming week</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Fiji have constantly refused to denounce OITC. Why? Because they know better. Posted by Waffleknocka 28/4/2006</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The person posting under the username Waffleknocka has appeared here before, and was one of the first vandalizing the original article to suit the views of the OITC. He uses the IP address 202.47.96.40. As any other interested person can check, such adress is one of the many proxys used to hide and to disguise their real IP online (a Google search will show it in many lists all over the net). So, as usual and working with rather rudimentary means, the OITC people are attempting to hide while menacing other users and the very Wikipedia with supposed lawsuits. 24.215.205.122</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the first, definitely. It is rather easy to make a film these days, given modern technology, so the requirement should be that anyone actually is likely to go and see it. Only films with major distribution deals in advance of being filmed could possibly even begin to justify an article. As for Mr Anderson himself and One Last Job - New York Film Festival mentioned sounds impressive, yes, but it also describes itself as "the underground, low budget and non-mainstream festival", so it might be a step in the direction of success, but I'm not really convinced it's success in itself. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 00:03, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here are my takes, from research.</p>
<p>Check [<a href="http://forestfilm.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://forestfilm.com" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>] under <b>short fiction I</b> nominations and [<a href="http://forestfilm.com/may19b.htm#" class="external autonumber" title="http://forestfilm.com/may19b.htm#" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>] under Jaren Anderson as director and One Last Job as film.</p>
<p>Googled <i>Jaren Anderson One Last Job</i> and it brought up, 2 counts of Wikipedia, 1 count of NY film festival and 1 count of forest film, 2 counts of filmerica festival (<i>where it seemed he made a short film for a 72 hour contest, donation charity, etc.</i>).</p>
<p>I think as a viewer of film, and independent films all, shorts including films made by people with out 20 million dollar budgets, its unfair and people independent films (<i>expecially ones that got nominations from film festivals and what not</i>) should be fought for by wikipedians. More power to you.</p>
<p>Also, I remember looking this up a while ago when it first passed and remember it was IMDB.com but im not so sure anymore. Oh well, hope you guys give it a second look.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>delete</b> Untitled Jaren Anderson Short film ---</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree on this one only because its a short no credable film- I don't think this a true fact, that hes making this film... so I say delete, but one last job is indeed a film, and since I live near the west village theater in New york, I'm gonna see what its all about when it premieres.</p>

<p>Having encountered this article for the first time today, I'm struck by an overwhelming sense that it is part of an elaborate hoax perpetrated by a very long-running and successful troll. There is very little verifiable information in the article to support the idea that "Michael Crook" even <i>exists</i> as an individual, as opposed to a public persona or a project undertaken by an unknown number of people. Of the citations and external links listed at the end of the article, half of them ultimately originate from Crook himself (who, if the article is any indication, can't be trusted to tell the truth about <i>anything</i>), half of the remaining ones are not available at the URLs given, and <a href="http://www.michaelcrooktalksoutofhisass.info/" class="external text" title="http://www.michaelcrooktalksoutofhisass.info/" rel="nofollow">the one anti-Crook site that can actually be reached</a> is far from meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standards and may in fact have been created by Crook himself, for all we know. The talk page is dominated by IP addresses and registered users who have never edited on any non-Crook-related subject ever, as was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Michael_Crook_162a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Crook">the last AfD on this article</a>; how many of these are sock puppets of Michael Crook? This individual/troll organization/whatever is probably notable enough to deserve an article, but the current one is fatally compromised and should either be rebuilt from the ground up using only independently verifiable information, or deleted altogether. <span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 23:36, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I question why this has been brought up AGAIN for discussion. The person in question is notable, he has been featured on FOX news, on multiple radio shows, multiple internet radio shows, has been the subject of more than one lengthy newpaper article, and one only has to Google his name to see if he is of any reputation. There are articles on people of lesser infamy/fame still on Wiki. This guy consistantly finds more things to amke websites about for the sole purpose of attacking people and staying in the limelight. There have been numerous attempts by Michael Crook himself to manipulate the article, yet there has been no reliable sources that will come forward pointing out the items in the article that are incorrect. Why must we go through this AGAIN!!! It was nominated, decided as a keep, and then appealed, and keep was the decision... how many times does this have to happen? It is just silly. Wiki is a source of information for the public, about people that are of interest to the public. Certainly this guy is a public figure. Explain to me whay he is not? I am happy to discuss the details in the discussion area of the article, I highly doubt anyone will be able to produce any real evidence other than their opinions that this guy shouldn't be in Wiki. Sorry, he is here, and he should stay, there are too many supporting reasons as to why he is notable, like him or don't. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.227.177.1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.227.177.1_29e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.227.177.1">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> It is obvious that the previous poster has a vendetta against the subject, else they would have felt strongly enough to sign their name. Wikipedia is not to be used as an attack tool. This subject is no longer notable, and I fail to see the relevance/purpose of this page, other than to attack. As has been said by others, many others make far worse websites, and aren't featured. Why must we go through this again?

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether the poster signs his/her name or not is irrelevant. It doesn't change the fact that he's right. Wikipedia is a a public source of information. Michael Crook has appeared on national TV, as well as many radio shows all over the east coast.

<li><b>Comment</b> No, I haven't a vendetta, and another thing I don't have is an understanding as to the logic of this entry. What I see here is nothing but attack, attack, attack. Heck, Wikipedia is providing free advertising for this cat. Do you not notice that all his "controversial" sites have "For Sale" signs on it? The troops site has a home phone posted on it, whether it's his or not, who knows. So hey..if Wikipedia wants to be a walking, talking commercial that's cool, I just stand firm in my belief that this isn't wikiworthy as he currently stands. He's just one of many bloggers...and you don't give this much hate to all bloggers. Ebn6701</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Much like the Michael Crook article itself, this AfD seems to be attracting a lot of attention from anonymous contributors and editors with few if any contributions other than those to Michael Crook-related topics. Considering the nature and history of this article, I believe we should consider the possibility that some or all of these contributors, on <i>both</i> the Keep and Delete sides, are affiliated with Michael Crook him/her/them/itself, and are attempting to drum up more of the controversy that seems to be Crook's stock in trade. (It seems abundantly clear that this is exactly what happened in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Michael_Crook_162a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Crook">previous AfD</a>, leading to the article being retained, which I strongly suspect is what Crook wanted all along.) --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 16:31, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just something to point out here: most of us have the courtesy to sign our names; this user who is forcing the "keep" issue is yet again from Wisconsin, and is likely a detractor who is not interested in POV. I must agree with the previous 'delete' comment; this subject is not notable, and Wikipedia is not a 'who's who'. Mbn01291</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I actually agree with some of what Michael Crook says. Overall, I support the fact that he says what others aren't willing to say. I believe that even though the facts may look bad to the average reader, it's doesn't make them biased.24.177.115.191 00:37, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> A simple check of the log will show that this particular Wisconsin user has been a volitile detractor of the subject, thereby calling his motives into question. He has taken it upon himself to ensure that this entry stays, despite the fact the subject is not notable, or is he in any way relevant. Mbn01291</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just as notable as Michael Crook Being Mbn01291 and making changes to his own page, like taking off references and changing the detractor site to his... Give us all a break Crook. and yes, this is my first post. I came here by way of Google. Looking over the history, Wiki has been manipulated by Crook. I seems to me, as a newcomer, that it would do the article well to have a good clean edit, and then have someone keep an eye on it to keep Crook at bay.71.227.177.1</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While I am not the subject (the subject, one can tell from the logs, has been banned), a simple Google search will show that the above user is "JoseJump", who by way of the Discussion section and previous voting round, as well as all over the Internet, is proven to have a vendetta against the subject and therefore is biased, and that should be considered in this voting round.

The "Dadada movement" which the article asserts he pioneered draws no hits linked to his name (perhaps another example of his being a "playful man" instanced by things "such as drawing on people's artwork in Lane Hall at Tufts University and peeing on things people don't know about").

<li><b>Keep</b> -- This is a complex subject and I don't know if this is the proper place to fight it out. Eventually, I suppose, this particular page should be turned into a rd to Internet embarrassments or some such. I'm not sure that there's anything particularly notable about one otherwise-average person whose personal indiscretions have earned her her 15 minutes. Indeed, given the general stupidity and carelessness of the human race we may find that this kind of story will become depressingly common (if it does not already threaten to do so). An article may well be appropriate about the general subject of indiscreet images circulated on the net by false friends. If and when such an article is written, <i>this</i> material should be available to editors. My preference now is to <b>Move to workpage</b> until such time as sources can be tracked down and the article fleshed out. It's just foolish to bury the content in the deleted tables. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 02:07, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>, despite merge votes. This is an article about a youth orchestra, the supposed target is a festival.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article should not be merged with Aberdeen International Youth Festival. Grampian Youth Orchestra is a distinct entity, seperate from, although co-ordinated by, the Aberdeen International Youth Festival. The article should not be deleted because the orchestra is an important orchestra for all young musicians in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray, being set up by the education local authorities of these counties. It is a notable youth orchestra and important venture in music education, with celebrated conductors such as Julian Clayton being involved.</li>

<li><b>Reply to Comment</b> Actually, Evan Seeds, it is not bull. Grampian Youth Orchestra is comparable to other orchestra in terms of artistic quality and musical importance. Surely the point of Wikipedia is to provide information such as this, which is of importance to at least 700,000 in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray, Scotland and of a wider imporrance to the musical community worldwide.
