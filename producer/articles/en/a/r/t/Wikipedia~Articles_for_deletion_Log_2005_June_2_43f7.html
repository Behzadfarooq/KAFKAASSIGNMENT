<li>I put it on CSD according to the rules. I love this website. I love humour. I myself created an article about humor, which was under VfD, by the way (<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_joke.html" title="Russian joke">Russian joke</a>).

<li>It is my habit to work on improving articles even if they are VfD.

<li>I'm sorry, but I still don't see where the supposed <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-reference.html" title="Self-reference">self-reference</a> was. There never was a self-reference.

Linking to a particular <i>user</i> of Wikipedia and using the "User:" syntax to refer to the user is a self-reference; it was there when I made my vote.

<li>What's wrong with the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-reference.html" title="Self-reference">self-reference</a>? I don't care about the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guideline.html" title="Guideline">guideline</a> about self-references. In this case, the guideline should not be applied, because it's important to mention <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirlvinyl_dc27.html" title="User:Girlvinyl">User:Girlvinyl</a> to show that there's a relationship between <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> and the Encyclopedia Dramatica. After all, it's User:Girlvinyl who created the Encyclopedia Dramatica. The article should mention that the Encyclopedia Dramatica was, at least initially, created by the user to criticize Wikipedia as a result of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flame_war.html" title="Flame war">flame wars</a> in the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_page.html" title="Talk page">talk pages</a>. That's an important aspect about the Encyclopedia Dramatica that should not be left out, even if Wikipedia users don't like the criticism of their encyclopedia. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 18:16, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, Girlvinyl <i>should</i> be mentioned, but not Wikilinked or referred to as User:Girlvinyl. Ignore the guideline all you like, but "these references complicate forking and the use of Wikipedia articles by others" certainly applies here. A Wikipedia mirror will not necessarily have a <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirlvinyl_dc27.html" title="User:Girlvinyl">User:Girlvinyl</a> to link to. User space should never be linked to by article space. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 18:25, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why should we care about sites that copy the Wikipedia articles? If those sites copy the article, and they don't have the <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirlvinyl_dc27.html" title="User:Girlvinyl">User:Girlvinyl</a> article, because they don't have a User: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namespace.html" title="Namespace">namespace</a>, then that's the problem of those sites, but not the problem of Wikipedia users. In my opinion, the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperlink.html" title="Hyperlink">hyperlink</a> to the User: namespace should also be added. I don't see why we should change that just because other sites copy the Wikipedia article. Those sites should just eliminate the hyperlink if they don't have a User: namespace. Besides, if those sites create forks from Wikipedia, it's <u>their</u> problem, and not a problem for us Wikipedia users. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 18:36, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then we should agree to disagree. I think it's a good guideline – mirroring Wikipedia is a Good Thing™ and it should be as painless as possible. If you feel that strongly about it, take it up at <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAvoid_self-references_d909.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia talk:Avoid self-references</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 18:48, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hey, I like that "we should agree to disagree" <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxymoron.html" title="Oxymoron">oxymoron</a>. If what you don't like is mentioning User:Girlvinyl as <i>User:Girlvinyl</i>, then we can just leave out the name of the namespace <i>User:</i> by adding a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical_bar.html" title="Vertical bar">vertical bar</a> after <i>User:Girlvinyl</i>, so that only <i>Girlvinyl</i> appears. It would look like this: <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirlvinyl_dc27.html" title="User:Girlvinyl">Girlvinyl</a>. I mean, if <i>that'</i>s what you don't like about it.<br />
<br />
I don't see why removing the hyperlinks would be a "pain" to other Web sites that copy the pages. If they have computer programs that can copy Wikipedia articles en masse, then they could just as easily have a computer program that removes the broken User: hyperlinks automatically. It's <u>their</u> problem if they can't automate the process. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 18:36, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That would be true if it weren't made-up.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no evidence this theory exists in earnest. Google only brings back content that references back to Wikipedia, so there's no established presence of it at all on the web. Ross has no books/articles for sale on Amazon, which would be atypical for an established physical sciences academic promoting a theory. A search of physics websites yielded two references to his name...one in association with a physics hoax affair called <a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/weinberg.html" class="external text" title="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/weinberg.html" rel="nofollow">Sokal's Hoax</a> and another in an online physics newsletter <a href="http://www.swin.edu.au/chem/complex/vp/vp04/vp04.html" class="external text" title="http://www.swin.edu.au/chem/complex/vp/vp04/vp04.html" rel="nofollow">Virtual Physics</a>.

<li>Well it's true that you don't like it and it isn't policy, but it's being cited a lot, which I guess makes it a guideline. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:16, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's only a guideline because you put the guideline header on it, replacing the notpolicy header I put on it.

<li>I have stopped discussing it on WP:SCH because you are not using good faith in order to "trash out" anything, but are merely trying to ram your opinion down the throat of everybody else. I have refrained from voting on schools while this was being hashed out, but it appears there is no more hashing out to be done with people who's sole modus operandi is to demand that their opinion carry sway and claim they have consensus support although there is no such thing. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:22, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Are you folks imagining things? The article is <i>inherently POV,</i> and the title is a declarative statement. We would not have an article called History Is Bunk or <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_is_the_opiate_of_the_masses.html" title="Religion is the opiate of the masses">Religion is the opiate of the masses</a> or Pretending to extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit is a horrid thing. The article simply cannot be kept under this title. A merge would be ok, but, let's face it, this vote is showing so many socks, so many people not paying attention to the policy, that I'm not in favor of anything that preserves this title as a redirect, as it will soon be recreated in all its gory. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:54, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Et tu, Geogre? I hate the phrase "this article is inherently POV". Hate hate hate hate hate it. To see you use it is the last straw, really. You know what articles are inherently POV? <i>None</i>. Individual <i>words</i> can be POV, sure. "Horrible" cannot be used in any neutral context unless attributed. Individual <i>phrases</i> can be POV, absolutely. List of celebrities who suck would, if it lived up to its title, make for a POV article, so the title can reasonably be called POV. Heck, I'd give you that an article with that title would probably get POV content as well. But articles can be moved trivially, and are cleaned up in the POV department as a matter of standard operating procedure. The word <i>inherently</i> implies a finality that seems completely at odds with the wiki nature.<br />
In general, merging a slogan article with the article that provides its context is certainly preferable to keeping it separate, as that invites misunderstanding. Technically, we should put quotes around phrases used as titles; I suppose we do not because it makes linking rather unintuitive, and makes for awkward titles. But rallying the delete votes with the appeal to fear that what has a POV title now must be eradicated lest it spawns more POV, going so far as to imply even a <i>redirect</i> will be beyond our capacities to manage: now that is what I call defeatist.<br />
Oh, and opiate of the masses, eh? I give you, sir, <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium_of_the_people.html" title="Opium of the people">opium of the people</a>, which is admittedly not a declarative statement, a horrible excuse for an article, and not meant to bolster my argument—but just for completeness. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:46, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Et me, JRM. Let's put it this way: this title is a statement. It is a sentence, not a clipping, and not a slogan. It is a <i>sentence</i> frequently uttered by the Roman Catholic Church in its campaign against birth control and by the anti-abortion legality people in their arguments against allowing anyone to choose what they would not. It is not, though, a slogan that is a descriptor, like "pro-life" or "pro-choice." Including this title is to bear a POV statement, not a topic. That's why it has to go. The title itself is an expression of POV, and a highly controversial one. As for whether I think someone, somewhere might RC patrol only this article and never miss when it has been reverted to a proselytizing matter, I do not think that we should <i>have to</i> do so simply to avoid the agony of a move, merge, or deletion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:45, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And I do not oppose a move or merge at all. The status as separate article isn't sacrosanct to me. A deletion is another matter, especially on grounds of what we should or should not be required to do. We aren't <i>required</i> to do anything; that's why it's a wiki. This sort of "minimal threshold" argument for what criteria articles should meet in order to not be judged "too burdensome to bear" will never leave the realm of personal opinion. And while I respect yours, I'm equally adamant in not applying such criteria. As far as I'm concerned, the responsibility the collective of Wikipedia editors can bear has not reached its maximum by far. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 16:05, 2005 Jun 3 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reference at the bottom of the page promises to lead to a journal site. If so then it is an odd journal: it has only one article. A legitimate journal that publishes an article which lays out the principles of "space mixing theory" would hardly be called the "journal of space mixing theory": a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here. The article is not published in any known journal, nor does it have any citations.

If the crackpottery in question is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notable</a>, then it's significant enough to be catalogued (in an appropriately short, encyclopedic, and NPOV article). If someone could reasonably be expected to come to Wikipedia asking what "space mixing theory" is, then keep it. If it's obscure enough that nobody would bother, then I don't see why it would be included. This was one of the main points of contention for harmonics theory (now on its second VfD, after I'd thought I could take a break from the drama involved). Of course, both of the viewpoints expressed here came up there too. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:47, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think I understand where you're coming from, although I don't completely agree. Suppose for a moment, that there is only a single source for a particular crank theory. This may be the case with Space Mixing Theory as the Space Mixing Journal seems to be the only source, and there seems to be only a single proponent (thus the charge of vanity). There's nothing that WP can add to simply reporting what that single source says or else it <i>automatically</i> becomes original research. I know you are knowledgable enough to apply accepted physics to a crank theory and point out some of the problems. But unless you have an <i>external reference</i> that does this debunking, you simply <i>can't</i> do this without falling into original research. In the case of Space Mixing, I have no idea why anyone would come to WP hoping to find out about this as The Space Mixing Journal is the sum total of the world knowledge in this "field". Unless there are other references to this crankery, WP simply can't add to what the Space Mixing Journal says in any way without doing original research. As far as I see it, this leaves two options. Parrot the nonsense proposed by the cranks, or just ignore it as non-notable crankery as does all of the physics community and almost all of the rest of the world. <i>Notable crackpottery</i> should be reported in WP, but since it's notable, there will be more to say about it than simply echoing the crackpot's nonsense. I hope this makes my views on deleting this and other non-notable crackpottery more clear even if we don't agree on these points. I do appreciate your efforts trying to reduce the amount of pseudo-scientific nonsense in WP. The crank articles created by others that you edit/rewrite aiming for NPOV are much improved by your hard work. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 02:43, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I feel that in the type of case you object to (if I understand your viewpoint correctly), it would be straightforward enough to delete such articles based on their being non-notable. If a crackpot theory has created enough of a stir to be notable, then arguments for and against will have been made by many people. Not necessarily in reviewed journals, but in enough places that a NPOV article shouldn't count as "original work". For HT, the rebutting material can be found quite readily, mostly in the form of factual articles or texts on the relevant topics (ask on the HT VfD page or talk page for a list, as it's off-topic here). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 04:45, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Under the heading of "Physics" this is original research by far margin, compare scholar.google.com, the pre-print servers, or citebase. It may have minor but signifant followship in philosophy, as this area isn't so easy to decide using online sources, but the author should be required to demonstrate this in the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> but restart later. Again, although there will be a convention, there is no information at this time about the 2008 RNC; it is too early, we don't know the speakers, the venue or city. I am a Democrat and although there are rumors and preparations about certain candidates, I believe it is inappropriate to write a page for a nominating convention when there are no candidates. Plus, it is too early to write a page this early anyway and the current page appears to be uncited speculation (though well-intentioned) like the 2012 election page. I recommend this page be restarted from scratch in the future (say, after the 2006 midterms) after we have more info and I am open to compromise. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue387_7c2a.html" title="User:Blue387">Blue387</a> 08:19, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> The comments made above for deletion have no basis or evidence. This person has a Ph.D. from a recognised university, The Univ. of Texas, which by itself is still not sufficient, but his work in the Buddhist world is enormous, but you would probably need to be Buddhist to know that. That is why he is listed ONLY in the Buddhist section of Wikipedia. He makes no money from tens of thousands of book sales, but if you are not Buddhist, I know that may not mean much to you. Again, that is why he should ONLY be listed in the Buddhist section.Maitreya11 17:55, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>It is vague</b> in that it is <i>not</i> restricted to those who 'survived a Nazi concentration camp' (if it were, the title should say so) nor is it simply those who managed 'to escape from Germany before you were so imprisoned'. Even if those definitions are taken, it is questionable as to whether someone who was not incarcerated would have been. Why only restrict it to anyone who escaped from Germany - what about those who escaped from other countries the Nazis overran during 30s and 40s? Why only those who escaped from countries that <i>were</i> overrun - what about countries that <i>would</i> have been overrun if the Nazis had not been stopped by force (UK, Africa, Russia, Ireland, Iceland, Canada, USA ...)? --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 12:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alright, let's change Germany to <i>Nazi-controlled territories</i>, which is what I should have said in the first place. Regarding countries that <i>would</i> have been overrun, that's absurd. The Nazis had a clearly definable sphere of influence during WW2, at least AFAIK. We could play this what-if game with just about any historical event to make any discussion vague and pointless. It seems to me your beef is with the title of the article and not the content. To me, "Holocaust survivors" connotes a clear meaning; to you, it does not. Perhaps a compromise would be to include a detailed explanation for criteria for inclusion in the list at the beginning of the article. List of people who escaped Nazi concentration camps, managed to survive in such camps long enough to await rescue by Allied forces, or were able to escape Nazi-controlled territory before being encarcerated is a rather unwieldy article title.
<ul>
<li>LOL, I agree with the unwieldiness of that title! However, I still think that including those who were <i>able to escape Nazi-controlled territory before being incarcerated</i> is far too vague and could include almost anyone who got out of the way - since they were almost targets just <i>because</i> they wanted to escape. Such a definition would include, for example, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and dozens (hundreds?) of other 'notable' scientists as well as thousands of political, military and society 'notables'. The Nazis sphere of influence is not so clear to define in terms of Holocaust implementation: in some regions (e.g. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Islands_7556.html" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>), they never quite achieved the political/military/social environment necessary even though they 'occupied' the land while in other areas (e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and to some extent <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>) they had quite a lot of influence without occupation. This is not to say, however, that there is not a generally-accepted map of what territories were at some time Nazi-controlled. I also see no moral, ethical or encyclopedic reason to include those who avoided incarceration by fleeing and exclude those who avoided incarceration by fighting. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 15:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll defer to your greater knowledge of the general topic. Would a list limited to those that survived and/or escaped from concentration camps be more keep-able? I would imagine that the list would be mostly populated with people of this sort, anyway (although I do note that at least one person on the list currently was never sent to a camp). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 15:42, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A list of people who were once in a concentration camp and survived would be restricted and have some meaning. In this case, it should be <b>Renamed and edited</b> to comply: I would suggest the name of "List of notable people to survive a Nazi Concentration Camp." --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 23:51, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your point about playing the what-if game with historical events is, to me, exactly WHY to <b>delete</b> rather than keep this list.

<ul>
<li>I'm really not getting your point here. If, say, Mr. Jones <i>hadn't</i> gotten on your hypothetical sinking ship from your analogy below, <i>maybe</i> he wouldn't have drowned. The fact is, though, he's (hypothetically) dead, and that other people who were not on the ship, but <i>potentially</i> could have been on it, are not (leaving aside those that <i>were</i> on the ship but managed to not die). We can make a list of those that survived and one of those that died; what happened before the ship sank is rather irrelevant. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 15:42, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)

<li>But presumably Mr Jones DID get on the ship. From the single, identifiable incident he can be said to have survived or died <i>as fact</i>.

<li>It is partially relevant but at least someone who died as a direct result of Nazi activity is much more identifiable, with the only possible grey area being whether that was the cause of death (for example, there were no doubt a few people incarcerated who were already near dead from other causes). --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 12:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, clearly not obvious - see above comment by AиDя01D. Surviving the Holocaust isn't like surviving a sinking ship, where you are either on the ship at the time or not.

<li>At least this definition of "notable" or "famous" (whichever) will keep the list down but my objection to this list still stands in that identifying someone as a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Holocaust_victims_ffa0.html" title="List of famous Holocaust victims">one-time member of a concentration camp</a> is one thing but identifying them as having <i>not</i> been put to death by the Nazis is a totally different issue. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 12:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. this list will never be hard to maintain, because the "famous," or if you prefer "notable," qualifier will always limit it to a relatively small number regardless of how one defines "Holocaust" and "survivor." <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmeld1_1b08.html" title="User:Carmeld1">carmeld1</a> 00:11, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> my personal definition of a holocaust victim would not require having been in or died in the camps, that is, both <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Benjamin_6f1b.html" title="Walter Benjamin">Walter Benjamin</a> should be included (as they are on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Holocaust_victims_ffa0.html" title="List of famous Holocaust victims">List of famous Holocaust victims</a>). even if benjamin (suicide at a checkpoint) is debatable, i think most people would consider frank a holocaust victim.

<li>Agreed. One of the minor difficulties I see with this list that I've not highlighted is that people such as Albert Einstein, T.Wonja Michael, Anne Frank etc. belong on both the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Holocaust_victims_ffa0.html" title="List of famous Holocaust victims">List of famous Holocaust victims</a> and this list.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Famous" is an inherently POV term, and even notability is arguable.

<ul>
<li>"Notability" is just the criterion for having an article on a particular subject in Wikipedia.

<p>Normally we delete secret societies because their secrecy makes them unverifiable. In this case there is one twist that might make a difference: the comment that many prominent people have been accused of being members; the accusations would be verifiable. However, there are no examples of accused prominent people in the article currently. Google gets swamped with alternate meanings for "Dark Alliance" when I try to check so I can't prove this is a commonly referenced secret 'society'. If we can't document the accusations of membership in this organization then it should be deleted. <a href="../../../r/j/f/User%7ERJFJR_0643.html" title="User:RJFJR">RJFJR</a> 02:42, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Articles need to be verifiable, and this chart is inherently unverifiable and impossible to list. Bathory, for instance, has been suggested to have killed anywhere from 0 to 600 people, the 600 figure listed here is pure folklore.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Some of the historical cases are questionable - not to mention that at least some may be based of fraudulent accusations or folktale-enhanced body counts - sometimes law enforcement cannot find all the victims or prove all the kills, sometimes the killer may claim more victims that he actually killed and so on.

<li><b>Delete</b>. AFAIK, and I've done some reading on the subject, "# of victims" is often <i>un</i>verifiable; bodies are never found, mass graves contain an unknown number of victims, killers lie about the number of victims (both reducing and exaggerating the count), law enforcement officials sometimes credit deaths/missing persons to serial killers simply to "close" the case (and are sometimes later proved wrong). "Number of victims" is often a best guess done by collating proven victims w/claimed victims w/missing person reports w/alleged travels of the killer w/possible victims. Much less exact than "population of metropolitan areas." <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 16:38, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As a Finn, I'm familiar with this. Let me to give you guys some information: There used to be a www.poispakkoruotsi.com where people could sign a petition to remove mandatory studies of Swedish from schools. (They were aiming to get 15,000 names, but ended up with 8,401 -- they closed the petition in August 2003.) The petition was delivered to the powers that be. In any case, it's gone now -- the site's for sale. Seriously, this is not notable at all. I wouldn't even redirect it anywhere; it just isn't something that's likely to be a relevant entry point of research on Wikipedia for anyone. I mean, it's not even notable in Finland (the topic of there being an ongoing argument against mandatory studying of Swedish is, obviously, but "poispakkoruotsi" itself was just a really minor campaign with no impact; there have been -- and undoubtedly will be -- numerous other petitions of similar scale), let alone on the international scale Wikipedia operates on. It just isn't notable enough -- it isn't likely to be a term used by anyone researching the subject, either.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as I defer to the Finn. However, I'd ask that he rewrite a small stub of information for the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandatory_Swedish_e3db.html" title="Mandatory Swedish">Mandatory Swedish</a> asticle so that this article does not get created again since there is no mention of this petition. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:59, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suppose I could, but actually, I'd rather not. I don't really see any chance of this article being recreated -- it was originally created when the petition was still in existence, presumably by someone who was involved with it or felt strongly about it. (Even then, it was pretty much a vanity page; I'd say it was created not to provide information but to advertise the campaign.) Point is, the petition was already closed and delivered almost two years ago; there's no impetus for anyone to recreate the article now. Like I said, it's not the only such petition ever created and there will undoubtedly be many others... but unless one of them actually proves to be significant enough to have an impact on national policy or is of note in some other way, I'd rather not mention any one of them by name just so as to not afford any one of them status that they really don't deserve. However, I'd be happy to write in a mention of there having been numerous petitions and other similar undertakings to pressure the decisionmakers on this issue, but that none of them have been successful; that's true and not an insignificant phenomenon in itself, even though the particular campaigns have been less than noteworthy. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 10:26, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Added the following to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandatory_Swedish_e3db.html" title="Mandatory Swedish">mandatory Swedish</a> page: "There have been numerous petitions and other similar campaigns undertaken by citizens to pressure the lawmakers, but to date, they have had no significant impact on the established policy and have not attained a great deal of momentum. Thus, while the ongoing national debate is often heated and passionate, it has yet to reach a point where there is enough opposition to mandatory Swedish to force the government to consider a change of policy."

<li>I (and presumably MGM too) was referring to article criterion #1 ("very short articles with little or no context") not general criterion #1 (patent nonsense). I'm pretty certain it would quality, and in fact it's even shorter than the example given under criterion #1... "<i>He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda.

<li><i>Comment:</i> I believe (IANAL) that it's fine to reserve all rights on one copy and GFDL another copy of one's own work, as long as you don't incorporate later changes to the GFDL version by others into the non-GFDL version. It's just dual-licensing. Of course, it's pretty much impossible to prove that an illegal copy is made of the non-GFDL version instead of a legal copy of the GFDL version, but it allows an author to later release a work previously published with all rights reserved without having to go around changing the copyright notice on old copies. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 22:44, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>Use a list of cities in the state the city is known to be in</li>
<li>Use a dis-ambiguation page if the city name is known but wants to know the state</li>
<li>Simply type it in in the URL</li>

Rather odd. HYPS suggests Stanford is among the top four universities, but <b>HYPMC</b> suggests that it isn't among the top five.

<p>"Troll Metal" is not a valid category of Heavy Metal music. The information currently present on the page is insufficient to provide enough motive to identify "Troll Metal" as a genre. The only band mentioned that consistently deals with "troll themes" is Finntroll (most of the page's content consists of information on Finntroll), and one band cannot warrant its own genre. The other bands listed, for example Ancient, have sparse relation to "troll themes" in their works (in Ancient's case, only one EP is vaguely described as "dealing with troll themes"), rendering the "genre" completely insubstantial. This article should be deleted. <a href="../../../o/n/w/User%7EOnwardToGolgotha_3242.html" title="User:OnwardToGolgotha">OnwardToGolgotha</a> 23:35, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I have to admit, this article is remarkably funny in its absurdity:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Finntroll's album covers represent trolls with very different physical appearances. One looks strong and tall and is green, one other is more elfic, his skin is gray-blue and he has pointy nose and ears, one other looks like a dwarf and others are smaller, strong, green, with big noses and pointy-hairy ears. Troll metal is often related to forest metal, since trolls live in forests and we can hear sounds of the forest in various songs."</p>
<p>It must have been written either by someone really inept or, ironically a troll who probably won a bet with his buddies as to how long it would remain undetected. <a href="../../../o/n/w/User%7EOnwardToGolgotha_3242.html" title="User:OnwardToGolgotha">OnwardToGolgotha</a> 06:06, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is neither a vote to keep nor delete, simply an observation - alas, despite the ridiculousness of the genre, it's not imaginary. I can't voice for all the bands, but Mortiis and Arckanum are quite regrettably real. And yes, they do in fact dress up like trolls for performances.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs rewriting but I dont see why it should be deleted? Neologism? Imaginary genre? "Troll metal" returns 11,900 hits on Google, almost all of them dealing with the musical genre. Seems quite notable to me. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 06:51, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article definitely needs to be cleaned up - but it shouldn't be deleted - a lot of metal genres are defined by the topics that they sing about (viking metal, battle metal etc) - if troll metal is deleted then these pages should also go.<a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGil-Galad_cb34.html" title="User:Gil-Galad">Gil-Galad</a>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you're right they should go. Thanks for mentioning it. Maybe instead they should all be merged to a page called Metal subgenres, but there's so little useful information on ANY of them (except some dubious lists of bands) that it's silly to have all those separate articles.—<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 18:19, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
