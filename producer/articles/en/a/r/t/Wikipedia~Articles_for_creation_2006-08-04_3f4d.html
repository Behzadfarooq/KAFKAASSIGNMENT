<p>Dragon Slayer IV&#160;: Drasle Family, a Nihon Falcom origial game, was also realeased through Broderbund for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as Legacy of the Wizard. It is a side scrolling adventure game with action and role-playing elements. Players assume different roles of a five member family- including their pet- in order to uncover their history and defeat the dragon whose minions are terrifying their land. The game is unique for its different characters, members of the game's central family and each of whom must be used to complete the game. Each one- the father, mother, son, daughter and pet- has their strengths and weaknesses and special abilities. Only certain characters may use special items or their abilities to reach certain areas of the game's labyrinthine main dungeon. The game has Falcom's familiar graphic style and incorporates other elements from the Dragonslayer / Socerian series to make it a forgotten gem amongst the better Japanese role-playing and adventure titles.</p>

<p>On August 18, 2004, the bullet-riddled bodies of Lindsay Cutshall, 23, and her fiance Jason Allen, 26, were found on Fish Head Beach in the small coastal hamlet of Jenner, California. Both Cutshall and Allen were killed with a .45-caliber Marlin rifle as they slept in their sleeping bags on the beach. The Sonoma County Coroner's Office estimated that the couple was slain on either the night of August 16, 2004 or in the early morning hours of August 17, 2004. In the days following the murders, the case received considerable attention from the national media.</p>

<p>Both Cutshall and Allen grew up in the mid-western United States. Cutshall was from Fresno, Ohio and Allen was from Zeeland, Michigan. The couple had met in 2002 while Cutshall was a student at Appalachian Bible College in West Virginia. Prior to their murders, Cutshall and Allen had been working as counselors at Rock-N-Water, a Christian summer camp in El Dorado County, California. According to acquaintances at Rock-N-Water, Cutshall and Allen had left the camp on a road trip several days before they were killed. Credit card receipts placed the duo at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco on August 14, 2004. Witnesses also reported seeing Cutshall's 1992 red Ford Tempo in the towns of Guerneville, Sebastapol, Forestville, and Jenner before the murders.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-04_3f4d.html" title="Edit section: Investigation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Investigation</span></h3>
<p>Homicide detectives from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department launched an investigation into the deaths of Lindsay Cutshall and Jason Allen. The detectives quickly eliminated murder-suicide as an explanation to the killings. They also confirmed that none of Cutshall's or Allen's belongings had been taken, and that neither of the campers had been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Camping is prohibited on the rural stretch of beach where Cutshall and Allen met their deaths, but drifters and hitchhikers on California Highway 1 (which runs alongside Fish Head Beach) are known to use the oceanfront site for sleeping. It was originally postulated that a drifter had murdered the young couple and then left the area. Despite an exhaustive effort by detectives, this avenue of the investigation never yielded any solid leads.</p>
<p>In the weeks following the murders of Cutshall and Allen, similar cases in the United States and Canada came to the attention of detectives. On October 19, 2003, Brandon Rumbaugh, 20, and Lisa Gurrieri, 19, were shot to death in their sleeping bags while camping in Yavapai County, Arizona. No suspects were ever identified in this case. Additionally, detectives looked into a double-murder which occurred on Vancouver Island, British Columbia in 1973. While a suspect was identified in the British Columbia case, he was eventually ruled out as the killer of Cutshall and Allen. Perhaps the most tantalizing theory on the Jenner murders is that they were the work of the infamous Zodiac killer. Between 1966 and 1969, the Zodiac was responsible for seven murders in northern California and one murder in southern California. In addition, the Zodiac killer was believed to be responsible for other unsolved homicides in the San Francisco Bay Area. During his reign of terror, the Zodiac wrote numerous letters to the media, taunting them with his willingness to kill and the ineptitude of the law enforcement agencies which were pursuing him. Despite an investigation which spanned decades, the Zodiac killer was never brought to justice. To this day, the identity of the Zodiac remains a mystery. However, because the Zodiac often targeted young couples in isolated, rural areas and sometimes killed with a firearm, he was identified as a possible suspect in the Jenner double-murder of 2004.</p>

<p>In May of 2006, twenty months after Cutshall and Allen were slain, Sonoma County Sheriff's detectives released new evidence in the case, which they hoped would generate new leads. Several pieces of evidence were released, including poems which were found near the crime scene, a hat which was found on Highway 1, an empty 40-ounce bottle of "Camo" beer, and drawings which were inked onto pieces of driftwood near the site of the killings. Besides these pieces of evidence, detectives also disclosed that a possible DNA sample from the killer had been recovered from the crime scene. Nevertheless, this promising piece of evidence had been tested against California's database of DNA samples (which are taken from people who are convicted of felonies in the Golden State), but no match was made.</p>

<p>The murders of Lindsay Cutshall and Jason Allen have never been solved. Cutshall's father, who is an evangelical minister in Ohio, believes that the devil was responsible for the deaths of his daughter and her soon-to-be-husband. In a 2006 interview, Reverend Chris Cutshall stated that he believes the murders are linked to satanic activity. As of this writing, however, no substantive evidence links the murders of Lindsay Cutshall and Jason Allen to satanists.</p>

<p>5400 years prior: Mt. Koltz forms in a large volcanic eruption. To the best knowledge from the few surviving records, it has only erupted once. Mt. Koltz establishes itself as the highest peak of the world.</p>
<p>1200 years prior: The eastern country Doma successfully functions as a state, or this is what they claim at any rate.</p>
<p>1000 years prior: End of the War of the Magi. The Espers are not seen from this point onward. Mage Warriors are persecuted; the survivors form Thamasa. The Goddesses turn themselves to stone; the Statues are guarded by the Espers as per the Goddesses' demand.</p>
<p>980 years prior: Doma's historical record "A Faithful Account of the War of the Magi" is lost. The cause of the loss remains a mystery.</p>
<p>735 years prior: Opening of the World Peace Council. The council leader proclaims the "Esper Eradication".</p>
<p>685 years prior: The Empire is founded as a military state with the goal of policing the world.</p>
<p>600 years prior: "Samurai" are first officially appointed as warriors in Doma.</p>
<p>208 years prior: An Industrial Revolution and cultural renaissance successively flourish.</p>
<p>202 years prior: In the country Figaro on the north continent, Figaro Castle is completed.</p>
<p>199 years prior: Discovery of large deposits of coal. People dreaming of making fortunes gather; industrial states form.</p>
<p>150 years prior: Narshe starts an independent political organization with the intent of commercial solidarity. Transforms from a small state with ceaseless conflicts to a nation with a stable, unified self-government.</p>
<p>120 years prior: Rumors spread that hidden Figaro treasures lay in Mt. Koltz, drawing treasure-hunters into the region. In the end, the existence of the treasure was never confirmed.</p>
<p>84 years prior: After the industrial revolution, the mechanization of Figaro Castle proceeds.</p>
<p>74 years prior: Gestahl of the Empire is born as the heir of line of military officers. Figaro Castle's first submerge attempt fails catastrophically. A temporary royal palace is built in South Figaro.</p>
<p>70 years prior: Strago Magus is born.</p>
<p>68 years prior: Figaro appoints large numbers of engineers to improve the mechanisms in Figaro Castle. It successfully submerges on it's third attempt, and later comes to be feared as the phantom mechanical castle.</p>

<p>54 years prior: Banon is born.</p>
<p>50 years prior: Cyan Garamonde is born.</p>

<p>25 years prior: Locke Cole is born.</p>
<p>20 years prior: Gestahl is elevated to Emperor at the age of 52, demonstrating almost superhuman charisma. In response to the Empire's aggression, Narshe's weapons trade comes to rival it's coal trade. The two states enter a mutual peace accord that could in fact be called a nonagression treaty. Henceforth Narshe takes a position of neutrality, siding neither with the Empire, nor with rebel organizations.</p>
<p>18 years prior: Terra Branford and Celes Chere are born.</p>
<p>16 years prior: First Imperial expeditionary campaign. The Empire claims the southeast continent, and also opens the Imperial MagiTek Research Facility. Terra Branford is taken, along with several other Espers. Terra's mother, Madonna, is killed by Emperor Gestahl.</p>
<p>13 years prior: Gau is born and subsequently tossed onto the Veldt by his father. His mother dies giving birth.</p>

<p>11 years prior: Mog is born.</p>
<p>10 years prior: Relm Arrowny is born.</p>
<p>8 years prior: Second Imperial expeditionary campaign. Immediately after the MagiTek Armor field tests, conquest of the southern continent begins. Figaro forges an alliance with the Empire. In South Figaro, a minor riot, most likely the work of the Returners, occurs in response to the alliance with the Empire.</p>

<p>The Windish March is the area which currently corresponds to the Slovene province of Prekmurje. This area was transferred to Duke Leopold III Habsburg by the Treaty of Neuberg in 1379. The population, while ethnically Slovene, is mostly Lutheran rather than Catholic. Because of this difference and because of its placement as a border land between Austrian territory and Hungarian territory, it was given the name "March" (typical of many border areas). The term Windish is derived from the same root as the word "Wend" (q.v.), a Slavic tribe of ancient origin which, when driven West by invading tribes from the East during the Migration Period, settled not only in the region between the Elbe and Oder Rivers, but were also driven South by the advancing Huns into Prekmurje. The term "Windish" (as used by Hungarians) became a pejorative term, and when many of the Lutheran Slovenes from Prekmurje settled in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, one of their first local clergymen was of Hungarian origin. Thus, the Slovene settlers of that area came to be known as "Windish" because their clergyman referred to them as such.</p>

<p>Bobby Rules is the 2007 release of G. Love and Special Sauce on the new record Lable I Am The Greatest Records. It's pretty much his best work yet. Even better than the albums he released before. Yeah, all of 'em. Most critics found it to far too synth-heavy, one being quoted as saying "It sounds too much like Mother 33 for my tastes."</p>

<p>French pianist, born in France in 1962. In 1981, he was admitted to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Juilliard_School_283e.html" title="The Juilliard School">The Juilliard School</a> on full scholarship (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Steinway.html" title="Steinway">Steinway</a> &amp; Freundlich Fund) and studied with Nadia Reisenberg, pupil of Joseph Hoffman and <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adele_Marcus_1fb9.html" title="Adele Marcus">Adele Marcus</a>, pupil of Joseph Lhevinne. Pascal Nemirovski settled in Paris in 1984 and pursued further studies with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexis_Weissenberg_01ca.html" title="Alexis Weissenberg">Alexis Weissenberg</a>. He has given numerous concerts and master classes in Europe, the United States and Asia. These events were covered by French and foreign radios and televisions, including Alain Duault, on France 3, who devoted a 52-minute television broadcast to him, entitled “Pascal Nemirovski, un pianiste hors normes”.</p>
<p>In 1989, he created at the request of the violinist <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Spivakov_4949.html" title="Vladimir Spivakov">Vladimir Spivakov</a>, the Master classes of the International Festival of Colmar, becoming the advisor and youngest of the 25 guest artists who included D. Bashkirov, G. Graffman, A. Knaisev, V. Krainev and Y. Menuhin and thus bringing together the greatest international institutions such as the Paris Conservatoire, Curtis Institute of Music (Philadelphia), Royal Academy of Music (London), Moscow Conservatory and Juilliard School (New York). This experience would mark him profoundly.</p>
<p>In 1995, following a triumphal recital given at the Louvre Auditorium in Paris, Pascal Nemirovski decided to devote himself mainly to studying the repertoire and thinking about teaching, which he considers ‘an infinite source of enrichment and knowledge, as well as an authentic artistic and human exchange’. He thus follows the thinking of Bernanos who wrote: “Every vocation is a calling (vocatus) that demands to be passed on”.</p>
<p>Since then, he has devoted himself to his students. A number of his pupils from France, Korea, the United States, Japan and Russia have won prizes in piano competitions among them Lise de la Salle.</p>
<p>In 2004, he has just released his first recording, unanimously acclaimed by the press devoted to Chopin, Prokofiev and Scriabin.</p>
<p>He is writing a book on Piano Technique and Pedagogy.</p>
<p>Pascal Nemirovski will join next september the staff of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Academy_of_Music_22b8.html" title="Royal Academy of Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> in London.</p>
<p>Pascal Nemirovski is a Steinway Artist.</p>

"The life of Alexander "Patch" Sturm"</p>
<p>Alex Sturm was a member of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmerston_North_Boys_High_School_a60d.html" title="Palmerston North Boys High School">Palmerston North Boys High School</a> community from 2003-2006 before his contract at the school was exterminated in his 6th form after ex Guidence counceller Stuart Leighton removed him from the community believing Alex was a threat to the lives of fellow students and himself. THe acalades of this young hero are endles, as stories of Alex have travelled from word and mouth, becoming exagerated to the point where Alex began to feel the pressures of bullying and tormenting. Alex's Achievments: 2003: Alex joined the Boys High community, at the College House Boarding Hostel, and actaully made a few friends. At this point he was reasonably safe from bullying. By term 3 of his 3rd Form year, Alex was a loner, thinking he was better then his peers (which of course he wasn't because he was a loser), and had little to do with other human life, prefering the company of the computers of QQ Internet cafe. This begun the downward spiral of Alex's life. Luke Whale another student of the school suceeded in making his life a living hell, bringing down our young hero to the point where Alex would cry himself to sleep (no exageration). Fortunatly for Alex, Luke was suspended indeffinatly for burning down one of the dorms at the hostel, and so Alex was able to enjoy what was left of his life. Alex ultimatly ended his year at College house on a very bad note. The third form student urinated in his bed, causing himself humiliation and complete isolation from any contact with human life. For Alex 2003 was a pretty bad year, however, for him it would get much, much worse.</p>
<p>2004: Alex should not have returned to school. Anyone with any common sence or and brains at all would know that returning would bring torment from peers and teachers alike. However, although Alex was an intellegent young man, he returned to face the fire of a new school year. Needless to say, Alex did not fare too badly through the first term of his 4th form, but QQ internet cafe became more of obsessive refuge on weekends and after school, and after a while, it became the new reason for his bullying. Crunch time occured when Alex ventured into the world of THIEVERY. (coming soon)</p>

<p>Israeli hardcore-punk band from the Tel Aviv area. Formed in late 2002 by ex-members of other israeli hardcore-punk bands such as Nekhei Naatza, Sleep Furious, Dir Yassin &amp; Amnon Itzhak, with two members currently playing also in Melachechei Ha'Pinka and one in Asura and Zman Ptziot. In 2004 they released the 11 song CD EP "Magnetic Storm" on Israel's Boshet Records(also released as a 7" single, minus one track, on the Lengua Armada label in 2006)and in 2005 a full length CD, "Spontaneous Violence", also on Boshet. Between the years 2003-2006 they played about two dozen shows in Tel Aviv, Kfar Saba, Jerusalem &amp; Haifa along with other contemporary israeli hardcore-punk &amp; garage bands such as Nikmat Olalim, Ha'Yehudonim (Los Kikes), Brutal Assault, The Astroglides, Kafa La'Panim Shel Limor Livnat, Monkey Son Of A Donkey, Hikokiri, Asura, Fearful Soon To Follow, Ha'Mashbir La'Agavot, The Girls &amp; with dutch band Makiladoras during their israeli tour.</p>
<p>Smartut Kahol Lavan's 7" recieved an excellent review in the May 2006 issue of Maximum Rocknroll, making it to several of the staff's top 10's. the CD recieved a very good review as well in the August issue the same year. Suburban Voice magazine/ blog defined Smartut Kahol Lavan sound as "a pure, head-spinning barrage but also tightly focused and not following a predictable musical route". UK's Vendetta 'zine wrote that the band play "a particularly savage brand of thrash-hardcore", which is "intense and alien (...) not a band for the casual listener". Band members list as influences early/ mid 80's hardcore-punk bands, mostly north american, italian and dutch but also contemporary bands such as Fucked Up and Gorilla Angreb.</p>

<p>Born in France in 1962. In 1981, he was admitted to The <a href="../../../j/u/i/Juilliard_School_8547.html" title="Juilliard School">Juilliard School</a> on full scholarship (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Steinway.html" title="Steinway">Steinway</a> &amp; Freundlich Fund) and studied with Nadia Reisenberg, pupil of Joseph Hoffman and <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adele_Marcus_1fb9.html" title="Adele Marcus">Adele Marcus</a>, pupil of Joseph Lhevinne. Pascal Nemirovski settled in Paris in 1984 and pursued further studies with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexis_Weissenberg_01ca.html" title="Alexis Weissenberg">Alexis Weissenberg</a>. He has given numerous concerts and master classes in Europe, the United States and Asia. These events were covered by French and foreign radios and televisions, including Alain Duault, on France 3, who devoted a 52-minute television broadcast to him, entitled “Pascal Nemirovski, un pianiste hors normes”.</p>
<p>In 1989, he created at the request of the violinist Vladimir Spivakov, the Master classes of the International Festival of Colmar, becoming the advisor and youngest of the 25 guest artists who included D. Bashkirov, G. Graffman, A. Knaisev, V. Krainev and Y. Menuhin and thus bringing together the greatest international institutions such as the Paris Conservatoire, Curtis Institute of Music (Philadelphia), Royal Academy of Music (London), Moscow Conservatory and Juilliard School (New York). This experience would mark him profoundly.</p>
<p>In 1995, following a triumphal recital given at the Louvre Auditorium in Paris, Pascal Nemirovski decided to devote himself mainly to studying the repertoire and thinking about teaching, which he considers ‘an infinite source of enrichment and knowledge, as well as an authentic artistic and human exchange’. He thus follows the thinking of Bernanos who wrote: “Every vocation is a calling (vocatus) that demands to be passed on”.</p>
<p>Since then, he has devoted himself to his students. A number of his pupils from France, Korea, the United States, Japan and Russia have won prizes in piano competitions among them Lise de la Salle.</p>
<p>In 2004, he has just released his first recording, unanimously acclaimed by the press devoted to Chopin, Prokofiev and Scriabin.</p>
<p>He is writing a book on Piano Technique and Pedagogy.</p>
<p>Pascal Nemirovski will join next september the staff of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Academy_of_Music_22b8.html" title="Royal Academy of Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> in London.</p>
<p>Pascal Nemirovski is a Steinway Artist.</p>

<p>The Ross procedure is a surgical procedure to replace a patient's diseased aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve (an "autograft"). The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a donor graft from a diseased person (a homograft). The Ross procedure has the advantage that no anti-coagulation is necessary (as with mechanical valves), and it lasts longer than replacing the aortic valve with a homograft. The drawbacks are that the surgery is technically difficult and needs to be performed by a thoracic surgeon with considerable experience in the technique.</p>
<p>The technique was pioneered by Sir Donald Ross in England during the 1960s. Since then thousands of patients have undergone the replacement with excellent results. The procedure is done while the patient's heart is stopped and on a heart-lung bypass machine.</p>
<p>Patients who opt for the Ross procedure are usually young and wish to maintain an active lifestyle. The procedure is particularly useful for women of child-bearing age, since Coumadin is contrainicated in pregnancy (it is teratogenic during the first trimester).</p>

<p>The Crimson Key Society was founded in 1948 by the Harvard Athletic Department as a way to make prospective athletic recruits feel welcome on campus. The original Crimson Key members shepherded the recruits to different events, introduced them to Harvard students, and even secured tickets to Boston shows. Today, the Key is no longer affiliated with the Athletic Department. The Crimson Key Society is a not for profit student group at Harvard University. They are responsible for creating and giving the official Harvard Tour - a free student led tour which leaves from the Harvard Events and Information office inside of the Holyoke center. Besides being tour guides, the Society is responsible for creating, running, and staffing freshman week. They greet incoming freshman, guide them to places on campus, answer questions to new students and parents, and set up activities such as the freshman ice cream bash, talent show, first chance dance, and Love Story screenings, among other activities. The Society is limited to 80 members, which means that the comp proccess is very selective. There are three rounds consiting of an application, an interview with one tour stop, and two full tours. The interviews and mock tours are completed by current members who evaluate the compers performance. over 140 people may comp in one year and only 20 or so are accpeted into the group.</p>

<p>"Dictatorul boxului/POVESTE. Fostul vicecampion mondial Alec Nǎstec isi reaminteste cum l-a cunoscut pe Fidel Castro la CM din 1974".</p>
<p>Grav bolnav, ultimul dictator veritabil al planetei i-a predat puterea fratelui sau dupa 47 de ani de domnie în Cuba. Idolatrizat de unii, înfierat de altii, Fidel Castro a avut o mare slabiciune: boxul.</p>
<p>“El lider Maximo” a iubit “nobila arta” din convingere, poate si datorita faptului ca boxul cubanez a urcat odata cu steaua sa. “Era capabil sa asiste si sapte-opt ore non-stop la o reuniune de box. Avea o loja speciala si traia cu intensitate fiecare partida”, povesteste antrenorul Alec Nastac, unul dintre cei mai valorosi “mijlocii” pe care i-a avut România. Multiplu medaliat la Europene, la Mondiale si la Jocurile Olimpice, Nastac l-a cunoscut pe Castro la prima editie a Mondialelor (Havana, 1974). “Tin minte ca si acum clipa în care am intrat în sala pentru gala finala. Am trecut prin multime, si când am ajuns în dreptul lojei în care se afla Castro am salutat. In finala am boxat cu Rufat Rîskiev. Rusul a fost declarat învingator la preferinta, însa toti au spus ca eu am fost câstigatorul moral. Chiar si Fidel Castro a tinut sa-mi transmita acest mesaj, asa ca imediat dupa meci, cum am coborât din ring, m-a invitat în loja lui. M-a îmbratisat, m-a felicitat pentru cum am luptat si mi-a spus ca se mai fac greseli chiar si la acest nivel. Apoi mi-a spus sa stau lânga el pâna la finalul galei. Am fost singurul boxer de la Mondiale care a avut aceasta cinste”, rememoreaza Nastac.</p>
<p>Fotografii s-au înghesuit atunci sa surprinda momentul, însa subit filmele lor s-au voalat. “Aveam arcada stânga ferfenita, plus ca eram plin de vânatai. Nu dadea bine la propaganda comunista ca sa apara Castro lânga un tip atât de tumefiat. Eram pur si simplu hidos, dar presedintele m-a apreciat. Mi s-a parut un personaj fascinant”, a afirmat fostul vicecampion mondial.</p>
<p>Dictatorul de la Havana nu se limita doar la a fi un simplu spectator, ci chiar lua decizii importante. Asa cum Ceausescu a retras echipa de gimnastica a României de la CE din 1977, si Castro a trimis avionul personal dupa boxerii sai la CM 1999 dupa o decizie strâmba a arbitrilor. “Când nu va mai fi Castro, nici boxul nu va mai fi la fel în Cuba”, a mai spus Nastac.</p>

<p>D.S.G.B. (Down South Georgia Boys) was created by little known rapper <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastor_Troy_83f0.html" title="Pastor Troy">Pastor Troy</a> in 1999. The rap group includes Lil Pete the Disciple, Blackout (aka Black 2K), Pinhead the Hellraiser and of course <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastor_Troy_83f0.html" title="Pastor Troy">Pastor Troy</a>. Lil Pete the Disciple, who is originally from <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusta.html" title="Augusta">Augusta</a>, Ga., has performed with Troy for years. Described by the crew as, 'the 1st round draft pick' and 'the one to set it off,' he can be heard on "Vice Versa" (Face Off), "You Can't Pimp Me" (Universal Soldier) and "Respect Game." Pete reps with fellow Atlanta artist <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonecrusher.html" title="Bonecrusher">Bonecrusher</a>'s debut disc, AttenChun, on a track called "Ghetto Song." You can also hear Lil Pete holding his own on Till Death Do Us Part with his solo track, a head-nodding-tear-the-club-up-type-joint, called "Bust Yo Head To The White Meat," produced by David Banner. Pinhead the Hellraiser, who is describes as 'the thinker, the one who is on some other shit' is only on a few tracks due to being briefly incarcerated during the recording of the album. Now he's out, the crew is complete and once again, it's on. "I'm the one behind the all controversy," states Pinhead. Blackout (Black 2K), who is described as 'the damn fool' and 'the onewho is down for whatever,' and Pinhead are brothers. They can be heard trading verses with Troy on "Undefeated" (Universal Soldier) and "Lock and Load," the first record and video that included all four members.</p>
<p>The first single off Till Death Do Us Part is the rough and rowdy anthem, "D.S.G.B.," which will build an even bigger following to their already strong underground fans. Other standout tracks include, "My Block" a smoothed out melodic gangsta joint for all dem dirty boys who rep their block, "I'm Outside Ho," a straight <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crunk.html" title="Crunk">crunk</a> club-banga and warning to all who step to the crew in the club and "Who Down To Ride", a lyrical driveby. 'Till Death Do Us Part', an oath usually reserved for married couples, is more than an album title. It best describes the family-type vibe of D.S.G.B., who are the epitome of the phrase, all for one and one for all. Al Troy (Pastor Troy's brother) is the CEO of their label, [[Chaotic Generation]], and the four-man-crew are more like brothers, "We all ran together even before this music thing kicked off," states <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastor_Troy_83f0.html" title="Pastor Troy">Pastor Troy</a>.</p>
<p>Look out for each member's solo album soon to follow, but even with the solo endeavors where each member will show their individual personas, it will always be all about D.S.G.B "This is just the beginning and it's not a game. This is probably the best release from this camp to date," says Pastor Troy.</p>

<p>Arseblog is a popular blogsite founded at the start of the 21st century by a lone blogger who has plenty of time on his hands. Originally set up as a blog with a response form for comments from friends, the site has evolved into the daily publication it is today and supports a very healthily over-subscribed private forum and a strange, quirky chat room, fondly referred to as the 'Arses'.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of Arseblog still is to air the opinions of Arseblogger toward his primary concern, namely Arsenal Football Club; the only footballing club based in London, England.</p>

<p>Regular forum visitors will be aware of the folklore that surrounds the blog and some of the characters that reside therein. At the time of writing, the forum membership was closed indefinitely, but this reporter did hear that if one was adventurous enough, one could pay a trip to the docks in Barcelona and make contact with an individual who, for a small personal fee, could arrange a membership. Needless to say the dark and mysterious nature of such a task did not seem worth the air fare.</p>

<p>Unlike many popular blogs Arseblog remains largely advert free despite its unquestioned daily circulation and hit rate. While a sponsor would certainly be welcomed to cover the costs of what is now a large undertaking, it is unlikely that advertising bandits would be allowed to take over the site.</p>

<p>Dev Tej Kohli is the name used to register in tens of thousands of online forums and discussion boards. In each case, the name is registered as a user/member and a single message is posted with the following text:</p>
<p>"Hi-this is Dev Tej Kohli</p>
<p>I am new to this forum.</p>
<p>Thnx for accepting my registration ."</p>
<p>It is undetermined what the purpose of these registrations might be. It is also undetermined whether it is software or a very determined legion of humans registering. Due to the sheer volume of registrations completed it likely that an advanced piece of software has been able to bypass the protections that most websites have to stop software programs or 'bots' from registering and submitting information to them. It has also been speculated that the Dev Tej Kohli is merely a test and more nefarious uses for the software's eventual use may include mass spamming and data-mining.</p>

<p>LUIS DIAS Born in Bonao, Dominican Republic in 1953, Luis Dias is credited with being the creator of Dominican Fusion, which merged rock, jazz and blues with over 40 different ethnic rhythms from the Dominican Republic and Haiti. His parents were musicians, his mother a singer, and his father a 'tres' player. Starting in his early teens Luis joined several merengue and rock bands and later as a Psychology Major in his college years, founded 'Convite', a band responsible for bringing back from obscurity rhythms from different parts of the island of Hispaniola, as portrayed in the recordings "Ae Candelo!" and "Convite Convida". After briefly headlining another project called "Madora" in 1979, Luis moves to New York City for the first time (1980) and fronts "La Cofradia" in which Dominican folk music remains the main theme, Dias also starts teaching workshops on Traditional Dominican Music at the Museum of Natural History of New York City. Luis returns to Santo Domingo in1982 and starts up "Transporte Urbano" and this marks the birth of the authentic "rock dominicano", where the influence of the traditional rhythms meets the style and execution of the "american rock". In 1984 Luis releases his first merengue LP called "Luis 'Terror' Dias". In 1985 he was commissioned with the soundtrack for the movie "Las Pausas Del Silencio" which earned the1st. Place at the Philadelphia Film Festival for Best Music. At the same time Luis starts gaining momentum as a composer of merengues, bachatas and ballads on commission. After several years of performing in and around the Caribbean, USA and South America, as well as several dates in France (Paris&amp; Marseilles), Russia (Moscow &amp; Leningrad), Spain (Madrid, Tenerife &amp; Barcelona) and Portugal (Lisbon), Luis relocates back to NYC in the early 90's and, continuing his intense work ethic, begins a partnership with David Byrne in 1995 which results in his song "La Casa" being included in the soundtrack for the film "Blue In The Face" of the same year. In 1998 he releases two CD's, "El Accidente" based on his experiences in NYC, and "La Yola", an acoustic collaboration with Lliam Greguez. In 1999 Colecciones El Europeo, a cultural institution from Spain chooses Luis' work to release a Compilation called JALEO DOMINICANO + HOMENAJE A LUIS DIAS and it marks the first time this organization selects an artist from the American Continent for such honor. For a year, between 1999 &amp; 2000, Luis becomes the vice-director of Casa De La Cultura Dominicana, an organization responsible for promoting Dominican Culture in New York City. Also in 2000 Luis reissues his 1998 recordings "La Yola" and "El Accidente" and for the first time releases the 1985 recording "Vickiana, Las Sesiones", which became very well known in the underground circuit in the mid '80's. In 2001 his "Suite Folklorica Dominicana" premieres at the Eduardo Brito Hall of the National Theatre Of Santo Domingo to great public acclaim. Later that year he returns to NYC and reactivates his band "Las Maravillas" in order to continue his musical journeys and experimentations. Luis also functions as a music teacher in several schools of the NYC Board of Education and continues to work as a composer whose songs have been recorded by dozens of national and international recording artists.</p>

<p>Customer Delight Definition: Measure or determination that a product or service exceeds a customer's expectations, considering requirements of both quality and service.</p>
<p>Keeping your customers - and keeping them happy Over the past 20 years or more, loyalty-marketing companies have created an entire lexicon of terms to define what they do. “Reduce customer churn,” “improve customer retention,” and “build customer loyalty” are among the most commonly used phrases. But what exactly do they mean, and more importantly, what do they mean to your business? Kobie understands that the most important definition of customer retention is the one that makes sense for your business. For example: · To a credit card issuer, retention might be measured in terms of the percentage of cards that are activated, and the number of customers who continue to use the card · To a wireless communications company, churn – the number of customers who change service providers each month - is a very real measure of customer satisfaction · To a retailer, for whom customer loyalty can be a very elusive concept, the focus may be on driving more-frequent purchases, and a higher average ticket</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-04_3f4d.html" title="Edit section: The Swinging Laurels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Swinging Laurels</span></h2>
<p>Had things progressed differently, the Swinging Laurels' story would have had all the dramatic hallmarks of any great music biography, containing all the sublime and ridiculous anecdotes required of any pop star's existence. As it is, they are, only now, being recognised as - with the help of the Internet and a generous dollop of hindsight - pioneers of 80's synth-pop. This resurgence in interest has, no doubt, much to do with the 1980's taking their turn in the nostalgia spotlight. Lay your thumb heavily on your television remote's channel button for a few minutes and see how many 80's musical giants are now reappearing - in various forms - across the dial. For a band whose career highs and lows have been described by at least one journalist as a "last minute goal-line clearance", however, much of the credit for the band's renewed presence must be attributed to, more than anything else, the sheer bloody-mindedness of founder members Gary "Gaz" Birtles and John Barrow.</p>
<p>The short and simple version is that in 1980 John Barrow and Gaz Birtles founded the SWINGING LAURELS. This, of course, ignores the years spent by any musician either locked in a bedroom with a stack of records and a sudden, strange desire to emulate the sounds within, or moving from band to band - in small and, often, sweaty venues, searching for others who hear the same sounds in their head.</p>
<p>This story, also, hinges around the saxophone, an instrument which is today much maligned, but up to and including the 1980's had served valiantly in most forms of popular music and was as much a part of rock and roll's birth as the now ubiquitous electric guitar.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-04_3f4d.html" title="Edit section: Beginnings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Beginnings</b></span></h3>
<p>Gaz Birtles had, following a stint in <b>THE WENDY TUNES</b> been fronting a Ska/Rock band in Leicester, <b>THE NEWMATICS</b>. His friend, John Barrow - who had been, for several years making his way around the country with various bands including <b>BLACK GORILLA</b>. Their hit "Have A Banana" - which saw Mr. Barrow make his Top of the Pops debut - was actually recorded by unknown session musicians. When it began to played regularly in clubs around the UK, record companies realised the need to have a band to tour the "hit" and recruited the band in which John Barrow was currently playing, <b>SISTER BIG STUFF</b>. The group soon became disillusioned with playing other people's songs live, and John Barrow was soon drafted in - on a guest basis - to his friend Gaz Birtles' band.</p>
<p>It was during this period that Birtles and Barrow decided that they would like to produce some more experimental music than previously, with the help of an old Elka organ Drum machine and a Roland SH1 Mono synth, they began to make their first recordings as a sax and synth duo. This relationship soon developed into a serious project and a name was became necessary. Whilst taking photos in a local cemetery Gaz passed a wind blown Laurel bush and the Swinging Laurels were christened soon after.</p>
<p>Birtles and Barrow tried to seduce the Newmatics with their new found direction and name but the rest of the band were not so easily convinced. So, with the help of Newmatics drummer and songwriter, Nick Murphy, they went into 8 track WOODBINE STREET STUDIOS in Leamington Spa, and recorded SWING THE CAT, and PEACE OF MIND under the experienced guidance of producer JOHNNY RIVERS. Johnny was/is (?) an eccentric, experimental producer who helped and encouraged the band to try out wild ideas. It was during this session that Johnny bought out his newly acquired gadget, THE CLAP TRAP and suggested putting it on the tracks. Especially PEACE OF MIND. This was a sonic revelation to the band then. The odd combination of synthetic claps, added to a live drum beat lent the songs an original edge.</p>
<p>The success of the demo convinced Birtles and Barrow that there was a future in the new band and sound. Recruiting trumpet player Dean Sargent (also of <b>SISTER BIG STUFF</b> and <b>BLACK GORILLA</b>) to play Bass Synth. Then they advertised for a synth/keyboard player. The flamboyant Mark O'Hara fitted the bill exactly.</p>
<p>After reworking some of Birtles and Barrows previous demos and writing a selection of new songs, they were ready for their first gig. For this they decided to hit all of Leicester in one night!! Adverts were placed in the Leicester Mercury and 5 different venues were found where they would play 4 songs each and then jump proceed to the next. From the first gig (THE WHITE HORSE in Oadby) to the last one (THE HAUNCH OF VENISON - now the ORANGE TREE on High Street) they went down a storm and people followed them from one venue to the next.</p>
<p>In 1981, on the strength of 3 or 4 instrumental tracks Birtles and Barrow were offered a publishing deal with <b>ALBION PUBLISHING</b>. After pursuing outside record contracts, Albion decided to put out PEACE OF MIND on their own label, <b>ALBION RECORDS</b>. This went on to reach the No 1 slot in the embryonic independent charts.</p>

<p>During 1982, <b>THE SWINGING LAURELS</b> began to gain national press attention and building a solid reputation as session brass players.</p>
<p>During a hectic year they: Recorded a Radio One session for <b>JOHN PEEL</b> Released a 4 track. EP <b>A TASTE OF...</b> on <b>DINING OUT RECORDS</b> Signed to major label <b>WEA RECORDS</b> Played session brass on the <b>FUN BOY THREE</b> hit <b>THE TELEPHONE ALWAYS RINGS</b> , making several TV appearances in support of the single, including: <b>TOP OF THE POPS</b>, and <b>CHEGGARS PLAYS POP</b>.</p>
<p>They also recorded brass sessions for, amongst others: <b>THE APOLLINAIRES</b>, <b>WORLDBACKWARDS</b>, <b>MUSICAL YOUTH</b>, <b>SPLASHDOWN</b>, <b>24HRS</b> and <b>TEAM 23</b> (Later, chart-toppers <b>KING</b>). A Fun Boy Three follow-up single <b>SUMMERTIME</b> also featured the Laurels.</p>
<p>The first SWINGING LAURELS WEA release, <b>RODEO</b>, hit the streets in September, featuring the distinctive percussive influence of <b>SCRITTI POLITTI</b> drummer <b>TOM MORLEY</b>. Despite extensive Radio One airplay, however, the single was restricted to lower reaches of the national chart.</p>
<p><b>CULTURE CLUB</b> producer <b>STEVE LEVINE</b> lent his expertise to the second single Lonely Boy which originally featured a fine vocal contribution by <b>BOY GEORGE</b> but due to contractual objections by his record label Virgin Records was eventually released minus his efforts.</p>
<p>1983 saw the <b>SWINGING LAURELS</b>, in their own right and as a special guests of <b>CULTURE CLUB</b> (at the request of BOY GEORGE who was a self-proclaimed fan) tour the UK. A <b>JANICE LONG</b> Radio One session was followed by a highly-successful Dutch festival tour where they supported <b>NICK LOWE</b> and <b>OSIBISA</b> alongside headline dates of their own.</p>
<p>Due to the poor sales - and the promotional cock-up surrounding <b>LONELY BOY</b> the band parted company with WEA Records in the same year. Rather than signing to another label, however, they formed their own: <b>HAPPY RECORDS</b> based, at their Leicester studio <b>HAPPY HOUSE</b>.</p>
<p>The first <b>HAPPY RECORDS</b> 12" single <b>ZOOM (TAKE THE TEST)</b>appeared in 1984 and achieved critical acclaim. This recording featured the guitar talents of Leicester friend, <b>RICH BARTON</b> who later went onto play with one of Leicester's formidable guitar bands, <b>DIESEL PARK WEST</b>. The B side also featured the experimental track, <b>RAMSI RAMSI RAMSI</b> which used a backwards tape loop taken from <b>SPIKE MILLIGAN'S GOON SHOW</b>.</p>
<p>During 1985/86 the band changed their name to <b>HAPPY HOUSE</b> and and featured regular guest vocals by ex-<b>SPECIALS</b> vocalist <b>RHODA DAKAR</b>. <b>HAPPY HOUSE</b> also saw the band incorporating a live drummer in the shape of <b>PHIL BIRTLES</b> - Gaz's younger brother.</p>
<p>1987 ushered in another SWINGING LAURELS 7" single, <b>PUSH AND SHOVE</b>, again on <b>HAPPY RECORDS</b>.</p>
<p>In 1988, Birtles and Barrow, along with Coalville trumpeter, <b>TONY ROBINSON</b>, were the session brass section with <b>FOOD/PARLOPHONE</b> act <b>CRAZYHEAD</b>, most notably on an eleven-nation tour of Europe and Scandinavia as special guests of godfather of punk <b>IGGY POP</b>.</p>
<p>This was followed, in 1989, by a live T.V. appearance for the Thames Television series <b>THE CONCERT</b> and a slot at the prestigious <b>READING FESTIVAL</b>.</p>
<p>In 1989, one of those moments that changes the course of a musician's life arrived. Due to the Laurels reputation as a brass unit, particularly - with the addition of Robinson - accompanying the well-received <b>CRAZYHEAD</b>, Birtles, Barrow and Robison were invited to audition for the job of live brass section for a new band, formed from the ashes of the recently defunct <b>HOUSEMARTINS</b>. Barrow was unable to attend the audition due to work commitments. Birtles and Robinson recruited a new sax player, KEV BROWN, in his stead and have been with THE BEAUTIFUL SOUTH ever since.</p>
<p>In 1990 <b>NO LABEL RECORDS</b> reissued <b>PUSH AND SHOVE</b> by the <b>SWINGING LAURELS</b>.</p>

<p>In 1991 the Laurels supplied brass alongside SPECIALS Trumpeter and trombonist, ADAM FLYMO for a track by <b>NORMAN BEATON</b>, star of Channel 4 sitcom <b>DESMONDS</b>. Unfortunately Norman died shortly before the track was scheduled to be released and it was shelved. In 1992, they took part on an album by top ska exponents <b>SKA-BOOM</b> for <b>EXTREMELY NICE RECORDS</b>.</p>
<p>The Swinging Laurels wound down throughout the 90's - due to other commitments (a steady job and family for Barrow, <b>THE BEAUTIFUL SOUTH</b> and his own band, <b>YELLOWBELLY</b> for Birtles) but the name never quite went away, with tracks from throughout their session career cropping up on a number of compilation albums and "best of's".</p>
<p>In 1997, a six track SWINGING LAURELS CD was released entitled BE SOMEONE, a return to the original duo of Birtles and Barrow, using an 8 track recorder and Atari computer.</p>
<p>BE SOMEONE was released in 2000 by the Internet-based label <b>www.peoplesound.com</b> and in the same year Barrow completed a highly successful UK/Irish tour with <b>BABY GENIUS</b> as special guests of THE <b>BEAUTIFUL SOUTH</b>. <b>BABY GENIUS</b> also scored a prime time TV appearance on <b>BBC's Children in Need</b> with <b>LOUISE</b> and <b>ATOMIC KITTEN</b>.</p>
<p>In 2001, after 21 years, a 15-track <b>SWINGING LAURELS</b> compilation album <b>GREATEST BITS</b> was finally issued - it is currently available only via www.myspace.com/theswinginglaurels. Tracks were recorded for an album called <b>LEARNING TO COPE WITH HAPPINESS</b> by <b>THE CHARMERS</b> in 2002, and for <b>NORMAL POSITION's</b> album <b>RAVE KILLED THE ROMANCE</b>, the following year.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>===New Beginnings?===</b></p>
<p>In early 2005, John Barrow was in virtual retirement, with Birtles continuing to play session brass for <b>THE BEAUTIFUL SOUTH</b> and tour with his country-pop outfit <b>YELLOWBELLY</b>, when they were both invited to return to the studio, as the Swinging Laurels, for Leicester-based band, <b>ist</b>. Contributing three tracks to the album <b>KING MARTHA</b>, they have continued to join <b>ist</b> on live dates - including the <b>SUMMER SUNDAE</b> festival and are co-writing the follow-up <b>TOOTHPICK BRIDGE</b> due in 2007.</p>
<p>Gaz also contributed sax to the FUN LOVIN' CRIMINALS album, IN THE CITY, joining them on several dates of their 2005/6 UK Tour.</p>
<p>In June 2006, both ist's album KING MARTHA and single HERE WE GO AGAIN reached number one on both <a href="http://yanga.ru" class="external free" title="http://yanga.ru" rel="nofollow">http://yanga.ru</a> and <a href="http://audiofind.ru" class="external free" title="http://audiofind.ru" rel="nofollow">http://audiofind.ru</a>, the first legal download stores in the Russian Federation - the Laurel's first independent number one since PEACE OF MIND.</p>
<p>It is entirely possibly that the story is far from over.</p>

<p>All together now, who wants to be a Zillionaire? I do.</p>
<p>But they got there first. They being Stephan Tomasek (vocals, guitar), Anthony Hall (guitar), Mark Meharry (bass) and Lee Moulds (drums), the first three hailing from different points on the North island coastline of New Zealand and their British anchor hailing from New Essex (OK, Stansted Moutfitchet). Its the perfect psycho-geographic combination; Zillionaire sound both exquisitely chilled and streaked with a lonesome melancholy (as anyone who recognises the nature of definitive music of Kiwi origin will appreciate) but theres urban tension and tenacity in their soul. This is delicate, intricate songsmithery but with a swarthy, slowburning gait. Their debut album Comfort In The Machine infuses both dynamics and speaks of experiences both arduous and joyful. It involves shifting life and soul to the other side of the world; over-fragile Spanish bass players; recording in tiny London bedrooms and famous plush Welsh studios.. All the usual trials and tribulations, then. But the result is an unusually sublime collection of songs.</p>
<p><br />
In December 2005, Absent Friend became their official downloadable debut single, which got airplay via Radio 1s Zane Lowe, BBC 6, Virgin and even got a review in The Sun (a lush and assured debut). The review from thedownloader.co.uk was spot on: Built around a melancholic framework of brushed guitars and frontman Stephen Tomaseks smoky vocals, Absent Friends stands just the right side of Airs coffee-table atmospheric pop as it gingerly pulls at the sun-scorched acoustica of The Belles. Just listen to splendid, fashion-bereft pop classicism unfolding before you.</p>
<p>Tomasek: We dont shy away from a tune that has mass appeal, like Absent Friend or For Someone but at the same time, were very conscious of never being too obvious.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps Zillionaire are the same people as they ever were but theyve travelled from the doledrums to holding a precious debut album in their hands, from windswept New Zealand coastlines to the wide world at your bands feet. Maybe they will be zillionaires by the end of it all.</p>

<p>Formula Vauxhall is a racing championship for identical single-seater racing cars powered by 2 litre twin-cam engines as used in the Vauxhall Astra GTE.</p>
<p>The championship was launched as Formula Vauxhall Lotus, together with its continental equivalent Formula Opel Lotus, in 1988. The cars were built in Bicester, Oxfordshire, by Reynard to a design produced in collaboration with Lotus. The chassis consisted of two aluminium honeycomb "planks", joined at the front by a cast aluminium bulkhead and at the rear by the engine installation. The chassis was stiffened by the front and rear roll hoops which also formed the driver safety cell. The suspension comprised upper rockers and lower wishbones all round, while the 2-litre engine was fitted with Weber carburettors and mated to a 5-speed Hewland gearbox. In 1992, production of the cars was moved to Schübel in Germany, who produced a new bodywork package and added a wooden floor. In 1993 the engines were fitted with Bosch Motronic fuel injection, while in 1995 new front wings and stiffer planks were introduced along with other detailed modifications.</p>
<p>In addition to the British Formula Vauxhall Championship, both a European and a German Formula Opel series have run since the inception of the formula. From time to time there have also been series in the Benelux countries, Scandanavia and Eastern Europe as well as a Formula Chevrolet Championship for the same cars in Brazil. The formula has been the most important route to stardom for young racing drivers in recent times. Many of today's Grand Prix stars, as well as several other well-known drivers, have come up from the ranks of Formula Vauxhall and Formula Vauxhall</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-04_3f4d.html" title="Edit section: U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution</span></h2>
<p>The U.S. Institute provides a neutral place inside the federal government, but independent of other agencies, where public and private interests can reach common ground through the use of non-adversarial, interest-based negotiation. The goals of the U.S. Institute are to:</p>
<p>Resolve environmental conflicts and improve environmental decision-making through collaborative problem solving approaches (commonly referred to as environmental conflict resolution (ECR)) Increase the capacity of agencies and other affected stakeholders and practitioners to manage and resolve conflicts Provide leadership within the federal government to improve environmental decision-making and policies through ECR. The U. S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution was created by Congress to assist parties in resolving environmental, natural resource, and public lands conflicts. The U.S. Institute is a program of the Morris K. Udall Foundation, an independent federal agency. Kirk Emerson has been the Director of the Institute since its inception; Lynne Gillette, Director of Operations, recently joined her. They now jointly lead the Institute with the help of the Morris K. Udall Foundation Chief Operating Officer Ellen Wheeler, Chief Financial Officer Phil Lemansky, and the Foundation’s Executive Director, Chris Helms.</p>
<p>SERVICES AND PROGRAM SECTORS The U.S. Institute promotes the use of ECR, when appropriate, in a variety of settings, from large, multi-party consensus-building efforts to court-referred mediation. ECR services are provided by the U.S. Institute's professional staff and by qualified ECR practitioners drawn from its national roster and related resources. These services include case consultation, convening, conflict assessment, process design, facilitation, mediation, training, and dispute systems design.</p>
<p>The U.S. Institute works across the country with parties engaged in a variety of contentious environmental issues where there is a federal agency or interest involved. The U.S. Institute's program managers focus primarily on the following sectors:</p>
<p>Protected Areas and Natural Resources Management - Mike Eng, Senior Program Manager Illustrative projects include:</p>
<p>Restoration of Natural Quiet to Grand Canyon National Park (Arizona) Restoration of the Everglades Ecosystem (Florida) Cape Hatteras National Seashore Off-Road Vehicle Negotiated Rulemaking (North Carolina) Public Lands and Natural Resources Management - Larry Fisher, Senior Program Manager Illustrative projects include:</p>
<p>Blue Mountains Forest Plan Revision (Oregon, Washington, Idaho) Collaborative Forest Restoration Program (New Mexico) National Off Highway Vehicle Implementation Assessment and National Summit Energy, Transportation and Environmental Quality - Dale Keyes, Senior Program Manager Illustrative cases and projects include:</p>
<p>FHWA / U.S. Institute Collaborative Problem Solving Workshops (Regional and State) St. Croix River Crossing Assessment and Conflict Resolution (Minnesota, Wisconsin) Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant Expansion (Arizona &amp; Sonora, Mexico) Litigation and Administrative Proceedings - Cherie Shanteau, Senior Mediator / Senior Program Manager Illustrative projects include:</p>
<p>BLM Roseburg District Road Access Mediation (Oregon) Pilot Mediation Referral Program for Department of the Interior's Board of Land Appeals (National) Native American and Alaska Native Environmental Program - Sarah Palmer, Senior Program Manager Illustrative projects include:</p>
<p>Tribal Trust Asset Mediation (Oklahoma) Government to Government Consultation Assessment (Alaska) Program Evaluation System - Patricia Orr, Program Manager</p>
<p>The U.S. Institute has developed a Program Evaluation System to assess outcomes and effectiveness of ECR activities and overall Institute performance. The U.S. Institute has partnered with several agencies to assure that: (a) evaluation design and development efforts are not duplicated unnecessarily (b) common methods for evaluating collaborative processes and collecting and analyzing data are established; and (c) knowledge, expertise and resources are shared to yield broad scale benefits from improving the application and practice of ECR.</p>
<p>PROGRAM INITIATIVES The U.S. Institute is involved in several initiatives to advance the practice and effective use of ECR. For example, the U.S. Institute has:</p>
<p>Chartered the National ECR Advisory Committee Launched a Multi-agency ECR Case Evaluation Study Coordinated the Federal Interagency ECR Initiative Hosted four National ECR Conferences ECR Practitioners: Referral and Advice Program - Joan Calcagno, Senior Program Manager</p>
<p>The U.S. Institute manages the National Roster of Environmental Dispute Resolution and Consensus Building Professionals. The roster includes more than 260 qualified practitioners with experience as professional mediators and facilitators in environmental, natural resources, or public lands conflicts. A Transportation Sub-Roster includes roster members who have specialized experience.</p>
<p>Background information on all of these qualified ECR practitioners is available from the U.S. Institute and directly from the website: www.ecr.gov/roster.htm. Contact the roster manager at roster@ecr.gov for assistance in selecting an appropriate ECR practitioner.</p>
<p>Native Dispute Resolution Network The Native Network is a resource for those seeking assistance from a collaborative conflict resolution practitioner where American Indian, Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian people and environmental, natural resource or public/trust lands (including cultural property and sacred sites) issues are involved. Network members include Native practitioners and others who work with Native communities. For referrals to Network members or to become a member, please contact nativenetwork@ecr.gov, or visit nativenetwork.ecr.gov for more information.</p>

<p>"""</p>
<p>The main problem regarding the recycling of most plastics is that it's currently a heckuva lot cheaper to make new plastic from raw materials than it is to recycle existing materials. For example, soda bottles consist of several layers, each engineered to be slightly different: One layer prevents oxygen from entering the bottle, one prevents carbon dioxide from leaving the bottle, one layer has an antibacterial component to keep microscopic bugs from feasting on the sugars inside, etc. These layers have to be separated during the recycling process, and added complexity increases the cost.</p>
<p>Most plastic raw materials are byproducts of oil refining, and as the price of oil rises, so does the price of plastics -- we'll probably see more of a push to recycle in a few years.</p>

<p>The inside reeks of the 1960's, with faux stone, globe lights hanging, and the ever-present ceiling tile. The Indian theme comes through as you see a plastic backlit sign that touts the Totem Pole Dining Room, Pow-Wow Cocktail Lounge, and the famous Hall of Tribes.</p>

<p>The Hall of Tribes, like most of the hotel, is filled with real and fake Indian artifacts. The Hall of Tribes is like a mini-museum inside the motel that pays homage to the tribes of America, with separate rooms for the Winnebago, the Dakota, etc. The hall adds profusely to the kitschy feeling of the motel.</p>

<p>The motel features 225 rooms that vary in degree of luxury. The motel also features an indoor and outdoor pool. Both feel somewhat dated, and also feature the always prominent Thunderbird logo.</p>

<p>VVP Engineering College - Rajkot was established in the year 1996 to cater the need of the Student Population of Saurashtra Region in Gujarat for excellent Technical Education which previously had to go to far-off places because of lack of a Modern Institute in the Capital of Saurashtra - Rajkot. It is run by Vyavasai Vidya Pratisthan (VVP) Trust and managed by Rajkot Nagrik Sahakari Bank. It is recognized by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and Affiliated to Saurashtra University (awarded 4-Star by NAAC-UGC).</p>
<p>From its modest beginning in 1996 to a sprawling full-fledged 30-plus acres gigantic campus, the insitute has made tremendous progress with students from far and wide of India, coming to garner quality. Currently the Annual Intake is 420 Students and the Institute offers Excellent Education in Mechanical, Chemical, Electrical, Electronics &amp; Communication, Computer, Information Technology and Biotechnolgy Branches of Engineering. A Bachelor's Degree in Engineering (B.E.) is awarded after completion of 4 years of Undergrad Education with specialization in any of the above Branches.</p>
<p>The Campus is well-equipped with most modern Laboratories where students perform practicals so necessary for good technical understanding. The overall Infrastructural Facilities are above par - which is quite evident from the fact that the campus building was adjudged the "Best Architectural Campus Building" in India in the year 2002. The College also has more than 150 Full-Time Dedicated Faculty Members, all of whom are well-qualified and experts in their own fields, working under the able guidance of the chairman of the institute - Shri Pravinbhai Maniar. The Insitute has also made rapid strides in the matter regarding Student Placements, and in the recent years, it can boast of getting jobs to most of the students with Recruiters including TCS, Satyam, L&amp;T, Wipro, Reliance, Essar, Infosys etc. - big names of the Indian Industry !!!</p>

<p>The game consists of two seven-minute halves. At the begining of each half, a team captain is assigned for each of the two teams playing, as well as three other competitors who will have the opportunity to "buzz in" when a question is asked. The questions that are asked are trivial. First, a "toss up" question is asked. Any competitor is allowed to buzz in at this point(They are, however, not allowed to confer with other teammates). If the question is answered incorrectly, no points are lost, unless one of the competitors attemps to answer the question before the proctor is finished reading it. If it is answered correctly, then the competitor's team will be asked a bonus question. The bonus question is not asked to the opposing team. Team members have the option of confering before answering. If the question is answered incorrectly, no points are lost. At the end of the first seven-minute half, each team has the option of substituting players and captains. The game then continues for until the end of the last half. The team with the most points when time us up, wins.</p>

<p>"Good Morning Good Mornning" is the fourth song on side two of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Sung by John Lennon, it has been derided by some critics as the most dispensable of the album's tracks, although it is an unmistakeably driving, bouncy song. Lennon was reportedly inspired to write it after seeing a TV commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes and its crowing rooster. The song features heavily distorted horns and a stinging guitar solo by Paul McCartney, who plays a descending figure reminiscnet of his solo in "Taxman," from Revolver. The Beatles apparently could not come up with a suitable ending for "Good Morning Good Morning," disguising its fadeout with all sorts of pet and barnyard sounds -- including a cat whose meow morphs into a bark -- as well as the Beatles themselves blowing on toy trumpets. Lennon said the animals were supposed to appear in the order they might be eaten by the next, ie, from small to large, but a listen to the track reveals that this is not so. The line "It's time for tea and Meet the Wife" references a British TV show at the time.</p>

<p>Bigga Haitian is known as the first Haitian singer to break into the Jamaican reggae scene, composing and voicing his own lyrics.</p>
<p><br />
Born Charles Dorismond in Port Au Prince, Haiti, Bigga hails from a musical family. His father, Andre Dorismond, was the lead singer of The Webert Sicot Group, pioneers of Haitian dance music known as Kompa. Bigga immigrated to New York City at the age of 8 and grew up amidst the pulsating rhythms of reggae music in the vibrant Jamaican community of Flatbush, Brooklyn. Bigga knew that he was destined to become a reggae singer after seeing Admiral Bailey perform his hit tune "Big Belly Mon" at Manhattans Reggae Lounge in 1981. At this moment, reggae sensation Bigga Haitian was born.</p>
<p><br />
Bigga has been blazing up the stage for more than 20 years, appearing with reggae legends Shabba Ranks, Beenie Man, Sizzla, Capleton, Cocoa Tea, Junior Reid, and Buju Banton, among others. Bigga broke into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s, opening for the Ruff Ryders, Lil Kim, and Jay-Z at New York City's Randall's Island. Today's most talented Haitian singers, such as Wyclef Jean, credit Bigga as an influence.</p>
<p><br />
Many of New York's legendary venues have hosted Bigga's performances including SOBs, B.B. King's, The Lion's Den, Satalla, and Galapagos Art Space. He has also performed at festivals in Jamaica and the Caribbean, including a show hosted by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell.</p>
<p><br />
Bigga's first album, I Am Back, features a remix of his dancehall anthem, "Haiti A Where Me From" which was a number 1 single on the Haitian charts, and is still a staple of Haitian radio to this day. He followed this success with his second release, Binghi Mon, which includes "Tribute to Patrick Dorismond," featuring Barrington Levy's "Murderer" anthem. Tribute was produced by Jah Life, who also produced the original Barrington Levy recording Bigga recorded two singles, "Red Carpet" and "Sexy Body" at Freddie McGregor's studios in Jamaica which were originally released on McGregor's Big Ship Records and later featured on Doctor Dread's RAS Records' compilation Best of the Best, Vol. 5 (Freddie McGregor Presents: Best of Big Ship 1). Bigga has also recorded tracks with artists such as Yvad, Ken Boothe, and Denroy Morgan of Morgan Heritage.</p>
<p><br />
Bigga Haitian continues to write, record, and perform future classics. He recently signed to Walkup Records and is currently in the studio working on his third album.</p>

<p>Dodongas (Pronounced Do-dohng-us) are an explosive lizard-like creature found in The Legend of Zelda world. They come in a variety of sizes, from the small Dodongas that will pop out of the ground and attack Link, these can also be used as bombs, as all Dodongas explode when you kill them. The medium sized Dodongas are a bit harder to kill then the small ones, Link has to side-step around and slash at their tail 4 or five times, the blast they make after being defeated cannot be shielded so get a safe distance. The boss of the Death Mountain Cave is a giant Dodonga, when it inhales to use it's fire breath throw a bomb into it's mouth, after the bomb explodes hit it with your sword and it will roll around. After repeating the process 4 times it will roll into the lava in the middle of the room and get stuck as the lava around it hardens.</p>

<p>Over lunch, Charlotte complains that she can't get pregnant with Trey, despite her best efforts. While on the other hand, Miranda has the exact opposite problem. It seems her lazy ovary combined with Steve's lonely ball somehow managed to get her pregnant. Miranda is less than thrilled with the news, and decides to have an abortion. Both Carrie and Samantha support Miranda’s decision; while Charlotte becomes angered and storms off. Carrie later admits to having a one night stand with a waiter named Chad back in the 80’s, while Samantha admits to having several done over time.</p>
<p>Back at Carrie’s place, Carrie tells Aidan about Miranda and becomes horrified when he finds out that Miranda isn’t going to tell Steve about the pregnancy. Carrie decides not to tell Aidan about having had an abortion herself.</p>
<p>While Samantha is having trouble being honest to (guest star) Lucy Liu at lunch, Charlotte is having a hard time hearing the truth from a fertility doctor who finds out that she has only a 15 percent chance of getting pregnant. Upset, Charlotte leaves the doctor’s office only to bump into an unhappily pregnant Miranda. Charlotte tells her the news of her infertility problems with Trey, and runs off.</p>
<p>After hearing of Charlotte’s dilemma, Miranda becomes increasingly worried that she’s not making the right decision, and asks Carrie to accompany her to the doctor’s office. Carrie agrees, and waits with Miranda. While sitting in the office, Miranda starts to wonder if this is her only chance to have a baby, and finally comes to the conclusion of keeping the baby. Everyone supports her decision, including Charlotte who decides to investigate more of her options for motherhood.</p>
<p>Finally, Carrie decides to go back to the restaurant where she met Chad twenty years ago. She tells Chad who she is and what she had done, but Chad still doesn’t remember who she is. Carrie leaves, believing that she made the right choice, and heads home to Aidan. Carrie confesses her secret to Aidan who is non-judgmental toward that decision made 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Samantha relationship with Lucy Liu comes to an end when she fires Samantha for lying to her over a “free” Birkin handbag.</p>

<p>The 82nd Airborne Division, nick named the "All Americans", was originally the 82nd ID(infantry division), during World War 1. The unit gets its nick name from the fact that the all of the original unit's volunteers were from only the 48 states. After the war ended in 1918, the unit was deactivated. In 1942, the 82nd was re-activated as an Airborne Division (Airborne Assault). The 82nd Airborne was used near the end of the African campaign, the Normandy campaign, Operation Market Garden, and in The Battle of the Bulge. Just a little after midnight on June 5, 1944, the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions jumped out of the planes, pulled their cords, and hoped to god that they wouldn't draw any attention from German Ost(or East) troopers. Due to the misdrops, paratroopers from both units linked up with eachother and look for anyone from their squad, or an officer to get word on their leader's position. It was crucial to link up with anyone after hitting the ground, since most paratroopers lost their legbag(which contained their weapons, ammunition, grenades, explosives,hygiene kit, bandages, rations, and knifes.) in the jump. Finding someone with a weapon when you don't have one is a good idea. On D-1, the day before D-day, the 82nd studied their own objectives along with those of the 101st, and vice versa. Both units were parachuted behind enemy lines in Normandy to support the beach landings on utah beach. The 101st's main objective was to link up with the 4th ID on utah beach. After 4-5 hours of combat and searching for squad members to link up with, on D-day, June 6, 1944, at 6:30 am, the 101st and 82nd Aiborne divisions cleaned up the German Ost battalion troops that were coming off of utah beach, and were resupplied after the 4th ID moved their equiptment ashore. The 82nd's main objective was to take the town of St. Savoire, France. The town had been shelled by US Army Artillery and had been under Naval bombardment, one of the only standing structures in St. Savoire was the Castle. Some 101st Squad leaders chose to fight in St. Savoire to support the 82nd. The 101st's main objective had been to liberate the City of Carentan, France, and to drive off the german counter attack at hill 30. The fighting between the 6th German Falshrimjager regiment and the 2nd and 3rd squads of the 502nd PIR(101st Airborne) was so intense that HQ sent tanks from the 2nd Armored Division to reinforce the defenders. The 101st had a hell of a time maintaining a foothold on Carentan, and it wasn't any easier when it came to defending it. It is said that Carentan was almost nothing compared to St. Savoire. On D+15, near Cherbourg, France, Col. S.L.A "Slam" Marshall interviewed many soldiers from both units.</p>

<p>Balam Soto, a self-taught Mayan artist originally from Guatemala, has developed a unique style of Contemporary Shamanic Art. Through a fusion of vivid color, semi-precious stones, glass, mirrors, beads and other materials, he creates three-dimensional paintings and masks that represent and honor the intrinsic beauty and depth of his subjects at their spiritual core.</p>
<p>Balam Soto, native shamanic art</p>
<p>“My deep connection to my ancestry inspires me to paint; through my art I explore the beauty and magic of the world. I blend that which the eye sees and the senses feel in a union of physical and spiritual form.” The heart of his artistic style lies in his work as a Mayan shaman; through his art he explores the healing relationship between art and the observer. During the process of creation, the artwork comes alive and guides him; the result is a visually colorful and energetically powerful representation of his vision of the spiritual realms.</p>

<p>Yannick Djalo was born in Guinea Bissau 5th of May 1986 and he came to Portugal at 7 years of age. He started to show his abilities on the court of futsal with Forte de Casa and rapidly he started to pla for the Associação Desportiva da Estação (ADE) of Covilha. Becuase of his good qualidades he moved to Sporting, but moving to Sporting ADE offered to sell him to Benfica but Benfica ahd alot of foreign players. His talents started to grow and never stooped with his studies. At age 16 lazlo Boloni ex Coach of Sporting called him for a friendly at the end of the season. Boloni bet with Yannck if he scored that he would have to give him a pack of coke, Yannick won the bet with a beautiful goal. Later on his career he was part of the junior team that won the youth championship of Portugal with coach Paulo Bento. He was loaned to Casa Pia last year, and scored 16 goals. At age 20 he played for the under 20 Portuguese team. Paulo Bento, now the head coach of Sporting, called upon the services of Yannick Djalo for the pre season of 2006/07. Yannick's recent game was against benfica where he scored 2 goals agains them winning the match 3-0 and going on defeating Deportivo La Coruna to the Guardiana Cup.</p>

<p>Wolfang Doeblin is arguably one of the four major contributors to probability theory in the first half of the 20th century up to World War II (the other three are Khinchin, Kolmogorov and Lévy). His work contains several profound results, and his importance is also due to his innovativeness and introduction of new methods. He laid many of the cornerstones of the modern theory for Markov chains and processes, to be developed after the war by others. The article in Mathematical Reviews on the historical paper by Paul Lévy [8] from 1955 about Doeblin's work states that:-</p>
<p>It is a pity that this tribute to Doeblin's genius was written without reference to later developments of his work. After all there can be no greater testimony to a man's work than its influence on others. Fortunately, for Doeblin, this influence has been visible and is still continuing. On limit theorems his work has been complemented and completed by Gnedenko and other Russian authors. On Markov processes it has been carried out mostly in the United States by Doob, T E Harris and the reviewer. Here his mine of ideas and techniques is still being explored.</p>
<p>Considering Doeblin's short career, it is remarkable that he published 13 papers and 13 contributions to Comptes Rendus; for bibliographies, cf. Paul Lévy [8] or Lindvall [9]. In his work on the theory of Markov chains and processes, his main field, we notice major contributions to: Markov chains with general state spaces, Jump Markov processes, the coupling method (innovation), and diffusions. The importance of these is to a large extent due to Doeblin's emphasis on path methods rather than analytical ones; much of what is standard approaches today stem from him. The book by Doob [3] from 1953 has been crucial for the development of probability theory; for a large part of its contents on Markov chains and processes, Doeblin's work is the base.</p>
<p>Concerning Markov chains with general state space, Orey [5] from 1971 states that:-</p>
<p>It is essentially Doblin's theory as completed during the quarter of a century following the publication of his papers that is presented here.</p>
<p>In Doeblin's mine of ideas, the coupling method was paid attention to by very few until the early 1970s; then the time was ripe to explore it, and the method is now a major tool in probability theory, with applications ranging from elementary theory to front research.</p>
<p>The term "diffusion" was not coined until the 1950s. Nevertheless, the first steps were taken in the 1930s. This type of process were the main interest in the last phase of Doeblin's mathematical career, interrupted by World War II; the spare time he had as a soldier was spent on this. The results presented (without proofs) in Comptes Rendus are remarkable, and so are the contents of the file that was sealed in February 1940 and not opened until May 2000. It contains pieces of what we now call stochastic calculus, including a version of Ito's formula.</p>
<p>On Doeblin's work concerning sums of independent random variables, Feller [4] writes:-</p>
<p>The interest in the theory was stimulated by W. Doblin's masterful analysis of the domain of attraction (1939). His criteria were the first to to involve regularly varying functions. The modern theory still carries the imprint... [This concerns weak convergence in arrays]. The last result was obtained by Doblin in a masterful study in 1940, following previous work by Khinchin (1937). [This concerns the so called Doeblin's universal law.]</p>
<p>Doeblin also contributed to the theory of random chains with complete connection, some of which was used in a paper by him on ergodic properties of continued fractions.</p>
<p>Doeblin's life and fate are remarkable and gripping. His father was Alfred Döblin, a medical doctor but best known as author; the novel Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929) stands out among his many books. Wolfgang was born in Berlin, but he spent his first three years behind the German front in World War I, in Saargemünd where his father volunteered as an army doctor. At the peace in 1918, the family moved back to Berlin, where the reputation of the father, as author and left-wing participant in political and cultural debates, started to rise.</p>
<p>Warned by friends, Alfred Döblin left Berlin for Zürich the day after the Reichstag-fire in February 1933. He was on the black list of the Nazis: a Jew, controversial for his political views. Wolfgang stayed until May to finish school. The sojourn in Zürich lasted for the summer 1933 only; the family settled in Paris after that.</p>
<p>Doeblin immediately made a strong impression in Paris; Fréchet was his adviser, but Doeblin also got in touch with Paul Lévy, with whom he wrote his first note. He received his PhD from the Sorbonne in 1938, but at that time he was far into topics beyond or not related to those of his thesis. He was enrolled in the French army in November 1938 for military training, and called up for front service in September 1939. This means that his mathematical career comprised only five years of concentrated work.</p>
<p>In February 1940, the Nazi invasion was expected to come in the spring to follow, and Doeblin decided to file his work on diffusions at the Académie des Sciences in Paris. The part of Lorraine where he was commanded fell in June. With the Nazi troops just minutes away from the little village Housseras, he decided to take his own life there rather than giving himself up as a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>Housseras is located some 100 kilometres from Sarreguemines (French after World War I), the place where Doeblin had spent the first three years of his life.</p>
