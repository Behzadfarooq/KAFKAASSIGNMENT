<p>Normal approximation is used to determine if a sample survey can be approximated using a normal curve (bell curve). Statisticians have determined thatwhen both np is more than or equal to 10 and n(p-1) is more than or equal to 10 then a normal approximation may be made.</p>

MBI, which stands for Macheneh Bonim in Israel, is a summer program in Israel run by Habonim Dror North America. Participants travel around Israel and learn about the land in the context of <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habonim_Dror_79db.html" title="Habonim Dror">Habonim Dror</a>. It is open to post 10th graders. The aims of the program are for participants to gain leadership skills that can be brought back after the summer to their Habonim Dror communities in North America.</p>
<p>Participants also learn about <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> in a historical context, with emphasis on the early <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">Kibbutz</a> movement.</p>
<p>The participants come from the seven Habonim Dror North America camps, which are located throughout <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> (in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>).</p>
<p>One week of the trip is spent on a Kibbutz, so that participants can learn about the modern Kibbutz movement and interact with Israeli teenagers. MBI-ers also participate in Yom Habonim Dror, during which they convene with Habonim Dror members from around the world.</p>
<p>Participants are divided into buses, with four <i>madrichim</i> (counselors) each. Two of the <i>madrichim</i> are North American, and the other two are Israeli.</p>
<p>Following MBI, participants can attend Habonim Dror's biannual <i>Veida</i>, and make movement-based decision. It is also on MBI that participants receive their <i>chultzot</i>, or work shirts, which make them official movement members.</p>

<p>Herring's law of equal innervation is used to explain the conjugacy of eye movements (saccades) in stereopic animals. The law which was proposed by Herring in the 19th century proposes that conjugacy of saccades (eye movements) is due to innate connections in which the eye muscles resposnible for each eye's movements are innervated equally.</p>
<p>This theory is in contrast to the theory proposed by Von Helmholtz (1911) which states that conjugacy is a learned, cooridinated response and that the movements of the eyes are individually controlled</p>

<p>The Magnolia Projects is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in not only Louisiana but maybe in the U.S. It lies in the Uptown part of New Orleans, LA, and is located in the notorious 3rd Ward community. Just like any other projects, it consist of drugs, killing, prostitution, and even proverty. But Magnolia is not exactly like any other housing projects. It's style or in other words the way it is built makes it looks dangerous. In the Magnolia, the project also contains some of the most dangerous gangstas, thugs, and some of the most notorious gangs, in Louisiana itself. The most notorious gang in the Magnolia is called the Soulja Rags. It is probably ranked number 5 to about 2, as one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the U.S. Another difference is, that the people in this neighborhood, probably makes more money than any other housing projects in the U.S. When dudes like gangstas and thugs sell drugs, they make at least one to about maybe three thousand dollars a day just by selling drugs. Proverty is probably one of the biggest problems in the Magnolia Projects. Rappers Lil' Wayne, Juvenile, Soulja Slim, Baby AKA the Birdman, Mannie Fresh, Turk, &amp; former Cash Money rapper BG, are all from the Magnolia. Other rappers like Master P, C-Murder, Silkk the Shocker, and son of Master P Lil Romeo are all from the 3rd Ward area{Calliope Projects. Magnolia is the most dangerous neighborhoods in this country today.</p>

<p>Pat is widely considered to be a legend because of his sexual endevours and his overwhelming charm. It is not uncommon for Pat Jones to seduce and take advantage of numerous females, often in a single night. The girls observe Patrick's pimp nature and seducing features and mistake him for being a kind, honest, and gentle soul. How wrong they are. Upon realizing their assumptions, Pat promptly uses the girls for his own sexual delights. The most clear example of this is when Pat was able to "hook up" with four girls in one night the night of the annual Junior Assembly Dance (names will be left annonymous for appropriate and obvious reasons).</p>

<p>Robert Morey is a career fundamentalist Christian minister currently based in <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irvine%2C_CA_d4ed.html" title="Irvine, CA">Irvine, CA</a> and the author of 33 books.<a href="http://www.logos.com/products/details/2181" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.logos.com/products/details/2181" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Morey received a Ph.D in Islamic Studies from the unaccredited <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">Louisiana Baptist University</a> in 2003<a href="http://www.faithdefenders.com/cbus/faculty/Faculty.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faithdefenders.com/cbus/faculty/Faculty.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

Recently, Morey had made national news with claims that Pakistanis terrorists âsmuggled 'dirty bomb' into U.S. from Canada.â <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=26891" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=26891" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>There has been much debate about Moreyâs credentials. While Morey received his degree from LBU in 2003 he has maintained the title of Dr. before this date. For example in 1997 <a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/1-15-97.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/1-15-97.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and he told the Assist News Service he âbegan researching Islam when he was a pastor at New Life Bible Church in central Pennsylvania during the 1980s.

Paul Westhead is a basketball coach known for his innovation and high scoring teams. He has been the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago Bulls, and Denver Nuggets in the NBA, leading the Lakers to a NBA title in 1980. However, he is perhaps best known as the head coach of the NCAA's Loyola-Marymount Lions which made it to the final 8 in the NCAA tournament following the death of star center <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Gathers_3bdf.html" title="Hank Gathers">Hank Gathers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal.html" title="Personal">Personal</a></p>
<p>Paul Westhead was born on February 21, 1939. He graduated from St. Josephs (PA) in 1961. He and his wife Cassie have four children: Monica, Patrice, Paul Jr. and Julie.</p>
<p>Coaching Life</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Salle_c7e0.html" title="La Salle">La Salle</a></p>
<p>Westhead coached tge La Salle Explorers from 1970-1979 and finished with an overall 142-105 (.575) record.</p>
<p>Coaching record at La Salle: 1970-71 20-7 1971-72 6-19 1972-73 15-10 1973-74 18-10 1974-75 22-7 1975-76 11-15 1976-77 17-12 1977-78 18-12 1978-79 15-13 Totals 142-105 (.575)</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Lakers_c195.html" title="Los Angeles Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a></p>
<p>After his stint at La Salle, he took a job as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers under Jack Mckinney. Mckinney was seriously injured in a bicycle crash 14 games into the season, and Westhead took over as head coach. Westhead lead the Lakers to a 60-22 record that year, second best in the league, and into the NBA finals. While leading in the finals 3-2, Westhead first showed his innovative side for which he would later become known. His star center <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kareem_Abdul-Jabaar_5843.html" title="Kareem Abdul-Jabaar">Kareem Abdul-Jabaar</a> was injured with a badly sprained ankle. Instead of going to a subpar backup center to fill his slot, Westhead decided to insert his point guard, Earvin "Magic" Johnson to play his first pro game at center. Magic responded with 42 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and three steals. Johnson became the first rookie ever to win the Finals MVP Award.</p>
<p>Westhead followed the championship with another solid regular season finishing 54-28, however they lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs 2-1. Westhead started his third season with the Lakers by winning 7 of his first 11 before being uncerimoniously fired despite having the third highest winning percentage of a Lakers coach in history (.691). Rumors were reported that Westhead had become unpopular among some of the players, particularly star Magic Johnson. He was replaced by legend <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Riley_ff67.html" title="Pat Riley">Pat Riley</a>.</p>

<p>Westhead followed his Lakers ouster the next season being hired as head coach of the lowly Chicago Bulls. While they inproved from 5th to 4th place in the Central division under his watch, the team finished a dismal 28-54, and Westhead was once again let go.</p>
<p>Bulls Coaching history</p>
<p>1983-84 28-54 (.341)</p>
<p>Loyola-Marymount Lions</p>
<p>It was with the Lions that Westhead would garner his highest level of notoriety. He installed a run and gun offense unlike any that had previously been seen in basketball history. The system involved running on offense and pressing on defense non-stop for all 40 minutes, leading to a new style of high scoring basketball.</p>
<p>The Westhead innovations paid dividends for LMU in his very first season, 1985, taking them to the post season for the first time since 1980. In 1986, the Lions made the NIT tournament, winning versus Cal in the first round before losing to Wyoming in the second.</p>
<p>1987 was the first year that two transfers from USC, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Gathers_3bdf.html" title="Hank Gathers">Hank Gathers</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Kimble_ce51.html" title="Bo Kimble">Bo Kimble</a> were able to play for the Lions. The team finished a school best 28-4, including a school record 25 game winning streak. They scored 100 or more points in 23 of their 32 games.</p>
<p>In 1988, the Lions won their first West Coast Conference championship since the 1960's, and went to the NCAA tournament winning it's first round game versus Wyoming 119-115. They then lost in the second round to North Carolina 123-97.</p>
<p>In 1989, LMU won it's second straight WCC championship before losing to Arkansas in the NCAA tournament. Hank Gathers became only the second person in NCAA division 1 history to lead the nation in both scoring average (32.7) and rebounding average (13.7). Also, Westhead coached LMU in the (to that point) highest scoring game in division 1 history. With both teams running a version of Westhead's run and gun style, LMU defeated US International University 181-150. The game produced records that still stand for the most combined points in a game (331), points by a losing team (150), and combined field goals (130). In the two teams other meeting that season LMU won 152-137, where the teams attempted a combined 245 field goals, still a division 1 record.</p>
<p>1990 was the year Westhead and Loyola-Marymount became household names. Bo Kimble lead the nation in scoring at 35.3 points per game, while the Lions lead the nation in team scoring at 122.4 points per game. In the game that began the buzz about Westhead's coaching style, LMU lost an overtime game to Shaquille O'Neal and LSU 148-141. However, this year would be best remembered for the tragic death of Hank Gathers. Gathers was feeling sluggish early in the season due to the medication he was taking for an irregular heartbeat. He later decided to stop taking the medicine, and on March 4, 1990 during the second round of the WCC tournament, Gathers collapsed following an alley-oop from teammate Terrell Lowery. Gathers would die later that night due to complications connected to his irregular heartbeat. The rest of the tournament was cancelled and LMU was awarded their 3rd straight WCC championship. LMU became an 11 seed in the NCAA tournament and were not expected to last long without their leader Gathers. Bo Kimble, Gathers best friend, vowed to shoot the first free throw of each game left handed to honor his fallen friend (Gathers had shot free throws left handed to try and cure a poor free throw percentage). He made all of the lefty free throws in the tournament. In game 1 versus favored New Mexico State, leading scorer Kimble had 4 early fouls. Traditionally, star players would be taken out of the game, but Westhead contraversially left Kimble in the game. Kimble never did pick up his fifth foul and finished with 45 points in a 111-92 win. The second round game versus defending champion Michigan is known as an all time tournament classic, with reruns appearing on ESPN Classic routinely. LMU scored more points than any team in NCAA tournament history beating Michigan 149-115. Jeff Fryer finished with 41 points on 11-15 three point shooting, while Kimble added 37. In the sweet sixteen, LMU faced Alabama. Alabama tried to control the pace of the game and held LMU to half of their scoring average. However, Westhead and LMU adjusted and triumphed 62-60. Finally, eventual champion UNLV beat the Lions 131-101 ending their cinderella run in the round of 8. Kimble still managed 42 points.</p>
<p>The national spotlight of the tournament run brought former NBA coach Westhead back into the favor of NBA owners, and he was lured away from LMU following the 1989-1990 season.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Nuggets_e448.html" title="Denver Nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a></p>
<p>Westhead was hired by the Denver Nuggets to run his "Paul Ball" system of run and gun basketball starting in the 1990-91 season. It was believed that Denver was the perfect location to run such a style because of the elevation of the mile high city, tiring opponents with the frantic pace. Westhead predicted before the season that with the extra eight minutes the NBA provided over the college format "there will be 200 point games". Westhead was the talk of the league, with analysists seemingly split over whether Westhead was bringing excitement to the NBA or making a mockery of the game as a whole. Denver, began putting up incredible scores in the preseason, outdone only by the incredible scores being put up by the opposition. The Nuggets lost one preseason game to the Atlanta Hawks with a record score of 194-166.</p>
<p>The experiment started slowly and never got on track. The Nuggets lost their first game 162-158 to the Golden State Warriors, on their way to an 0-7 start. After beating Minnesota for their first victory they lost their next 4 and stood at 1-11. Westhead continued to run the system he was hired for despite grumblings from players and management, finishing his first month at 5-19. However, the team suffered through another long losing streak (8 games), and following a 146-99 loss at Seattle brought the Nuggets to 7-29, Westhead seemingly lost full control of the team. For the rest of the season he would run a style, while still fast paced, was more typical of the NBA. The team, which suffered from major injuries all season long and was undermanned from the start didn't improve with the newer more standard style, and finished a dismal 20-62.</p>
<p>There is much discussion of why "Paul Ball" failed so miserably in the NBA. Westhead critics claim his style could never work on the NBA level because the super conditioning of the pro athelete does not lead to the opposition tiring as easily as the college athelete does. Also, the press style defense was broken too easily by the superior passers and ball handlers of the NBA. Westhead supporters note the teams dismal performance under the more typical NBA pace as an indication that the teams talent was inferior and the main factory in the teams poor performance. Also, Denver received some criticism for drafting Chris Jackson at #3 in the draft instead of Bo Kimble (who later went #8 to the Clippers). It was thought that a player such as Kimble who was already familiar with the system would have helped the team to adapt to it. Corey Gaines, who played for Westhead at LMU, made a short appearance on the Nuggets roster this year. While the argument still continues, the Westhead system has continued to pay dividends throughout the college ranks, inspiring teams such as Troy State who scored 252 points in a game versus DeVry (252-141), and Grinnell whose offshoot called "The System" employs many of Westhead's strategies.</p>
<p>Westhead returned to the Nuggets for the 1991-92 season. While still running a generally fast paced system, the full "Paul Ball" system was long gone. Denver finished 24-58 while averaging only 98.6 points per game. After the 1991-92 season Westhead was fired.</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Mason_c15c.html" title="George Mason">George Mason</a></p>
<p>Westhead returned to NCAA division 1, becoming the head coach of George Mason University. Westhead was unable to gather the talent level he desired at GMU and suffered through four poor seasons there. With this perceived lack of talent, Westhead never fully institued his run and gun system and only scored over 100 points 18 times in 4 years. Westhead butted heads with players often including star guard Nate Langley. Westhead left following the 1996-97 season.</p>

<p>Other Coaching</p>
<p>Westhead coached in the ABA in the 2000-01 season. He then coached in the Japanese professional league for two years before returning to the ABA for the 2003-04 season. He then became an assistant for the Orlando Magic for 2 years before being hired to coach the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA for the 2006 season. He has stated he will bring back his "Paul Ball" system with the Mercury.</p>

<p>The Animal Crossing Mafia (ACM) is a fierce group known for their acts in the game "Animal Crossing: Wild World" for the Nintendo DS. The group came together on GameFAQs.com's "Animal Crossing: Wild World Online Boards" on December 22nd, 2005. At first it was just a bunch of people who met to have fun, but later become a fight for power on the boards. The ACM made their group as a homage to Quentin Tarentino's hit movie Reservoir Dogs, with codenames associated with colors. The leader of the ACM is Robby(aka The Boss). At the time of the establishment of the group, Robby was the only one with access to hacking equipment on the boards. This had given the ACM a mighty edge over everyone else. The rest of the group is as follows: Brian, Jimmy, Devon, and Sphinx. (Mr Pink, Mr Brown, Mr Blonde, Mr White). They were not known very much across the boards until they started wrecking havok upon many innocent towns. Their trademarked attack is chopping down the unsuspecting victims trees. The most popular and controversial attack was that of Mrbuzzerbeater. The Mafia allegedly chopped down all of Mrbuzzerbeater's trees and stole his throne for initiation, but later refused to let him in. This started a wide range of chaos throughout the board, because the Mafia had not come public yet, and their organization was not known. Mrbuzzerbeater claimed that Jimmy stole his throne, and Jimmy refused that any of it took place. This started wars of people on the Mafia's side and on Buzzer's side, and it eventually ended when they admitted to it all happening. Right now, the Mafia's actions have not been known, but rumor has it that they are still up to their troublesome ways.</p>

<p>Rahul was once a normal student of TIS, in a ghetto country called Uzbekistan, until Ronaldinho visited him and started learning soccer from this juvenile teenager. Whenever people asked him his secret to being such an excellent player, he always said that he had learnt this from Ronaldinho. Thus, Ronaldinho started praying to Rahul everyday.</p>

<p>An "unmarked police car" is a police car that has no exterior light bar or any kind of marking or decal to indicate that it is police car. They are generally of the same make/model as regular police car, most commonly a Ford Crown Victoria with P71 police package. To make traffic stops, they use blue/red lights mounted inside the vehicle. Sirens and air horn are also used. They also commonly have push bumpers, spotlights, mobile date terminal. They are primarily used for traffic enforcement. Because of their stealth, low-profile appearance, it makes it easier for the law enforcement officer to look for aggressive drivers. High ranked officers and officers of specialized units such as SWAT maybe issued an unmarked police car that they take home, because it allows them to respond quickly to emergencies even if they're off-duty.</p>

<p>I don't know much about this film datawise. I kow it was directed by Bill Couturie, and that a lot of famous actors voiced pats in it, and that it was released in 1978. What I do know is that it really helped me and my classmates get a felling for what it was like to be getting these messages from sons, grandchildren, brothers, and husbands, and not much else. My Uncle, who is a Vietnam veteran, said that this was one of the best tributes to Vietnam vets that he'd ever known. I think that a film that has touched so many people should not go unoticed or unmentioned. Thanks!</p>

<p>Indonesia is currently the fourth largest producer of coffee in the world. Coffee has a colourful history, and has played an important part in the growth of the country. Indonesia is blessed with an ideal geography for coffee growing. The longitude ad latitude of the country means that the island origins are all well suited micro-climates for the growth and production of coffee. In early days the prominent coffee under Dutch rule was Arabica. The coffee was introduced to the archipeligo via Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka). The Dutch Colonial Government initially planted coffee round Batavia (Jakarta), and as far south as Sukabumi and Bogor. Coffee plantations were also established in East Java, Central Java, West Java and in parts of Sumatra and Sulewesi. Around the turn of the century the Arabica crops were devestated by Coffee Rust, wipping out the bulk of the Dutch root-stocks. Coffee at the time was also grown in East Indonesia- East Timor and Flores. Both these Islands were originally under Portuguese control- the coffee was also Arabica but from diferent root stocks. The coffee in Eastern Indonesia was not effected to the same degree by rust, and still today some coffee in East Timor can be traced back to the 16th and 17th century.</p>
<p>The Dutch responded to rust by importing and planting Liberica coffee. This variety had a short lived poplularity and was also affected by disease. The Liberica cherry can still be found through out Java, but is seldom used as a commercial crop in Indonesia. The Liberica coffee bean is much larger than either Arabica or the Robusta cherry- however it shares more in commn cupping wise with Robusta.</p>
<p>Robusta replaced Liberica and is still the stock crop today. It is not the coffee Indonesia is famous for, but makes up some 88% of exports from the country.</p>

Euroipods (www.euroipods.com) is owned by Eurogiveaways Ltd, a marketing company based in the UK, that uses a Multi Level Marketing model (MLM) to give out free ipods to anywhere in Europe. Often mistaken for a pyramid schemes, Multi Level Marketing schemes require the user to:</p>
<p>1) Sign Up 2) Complete an offer from a range of products and services (Currently on Euroipods the lowest offer is Â£5) 3) Refer some freinds under your name:</p>
<p>5 Friends - Free Ipod Nano 5 Freinds - Free Xbox (regular) 7 Freinds - Free Ipod Video 10 Freinds - Free Xbox 360</p>
<p>This model is often confused, wrongly, with a pyramid scheme. With pyramid schemes, every peron on the chain has to get a larger number of people to take part to gain a reward, so evantually this number becomes unrealistic and the pyramid collapses leaving people short of money.</p>
<p>See the DTI for definition of a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>The rules of a MLM scheme are simple and upfront, refer X freinds for a product, and stay the same if you are the first member, or last member to join the site.</p>
<p>Testimonials of previous members who have gained ipods and free gifts can be found on the site.</p>

<p>Leukaemia Research (LRF) is the UK's only blood cancer charity that fund resaearch into leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and other lymphomas, myeloma and the related blood disorders.</p>
<p>The charity was founded at a local level in 1960 after a mother lost her child to leukaemia and felt that no one else should have to go through the same. Rapidly more branches of the charity form across the UK , leading to the creation of the national charity. Today over 160 voluntary branches exist across the UK, fundraising to help fund research into the blood cancers diagnosed in 24,500 people in the UK every year.</p>
<p>Leukaemia Research supports doctors and scientists within hospitals and academic institutions throughout the country to work on a wide range of projects from basic laboratory research through to clinical trials in patients. The charity spends about Â£20million each year on its research programme.</p>
<p>The charity has some well-known celebrities supporting the cause including ex-England cricket hero Ian Botham, BBC's Match of the Day's Gary Lineker, the Calendar Girls, ex-spin Labour doctor Alastair Campbell and former world 10,000m champion runner Liz McColgan.</p>

<p>The Coffee Quest games are a series of Java-based first-person adventure games created by Blazing Games, Inc., in which the objective is to find all the items needed to brew a cup of coffee: the coffee machine, coffee beans, coffee grinder, coffee pot, a source of water with which to fill the coffee pot, filters, and cream and sugar, and to bring them all back to an electrical outlet. These items are scattered throughout a maze, varying from relatively small to very large, depending on which maze the player chooses. Also hidden in each maze are blue and green keys, used to unlock the rooms containing the quest items.</p>
<p>Coffee Quest 1: A basic maze game with no monsters, only the quest items and keys. Maps: Original, Ice, and Underground.</p>
<p>Coffee Quest 2: Introduces stationary monsters and a weapon inventory. Maps: Original, Hazardous Hedge, Deadly Desert.</p>
<p>Coffee Quest 3: Features monsters that move and a multilevel dungeon.</p>
<p>Coffee Quest 4: Downloadable only.</p>
<p>Coffee Quest 5 and 6: In progress.</p>

<p>Thanks To SEAN ORGAN for thses words. x</p>
<p>a.P.A.t.T â â D.I.Y creativity at itâs left field best</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The delightfully awkwardly named and even more awkwardly sounding a.P.A.t.T are from Liverpool (and they donât sound like the Beatles â well unless you play the white album sideways on a broken CD player during a lightening storm).</p>
<p>Hey look, you canât write mere words about a.P.A.t.T, this really is beyond dancing around architecture.This is all very listenable, its not as fragmented as we may be implying here â it is very fragmented but not in a way that stops it flowing rather positivelyâ¦</p>
<p>a.P.A.t.T are so easy to listen to when they really shouldnât be, it should just be a mess My CD player says thereâs 66 tracks, the CD cover says 8, I heard at least 103 (or maybe it was just one long piece?).</p>
<p>Theyâre a band, donât go thinking this is some wise-ass cut-up studio nerd â a whole gang of them in masks and anti-radiation suits or something like that. Hey look, if you want something challenging, something beautiful, something different, something violent, something soothing, something like you never heard before then this is where you need to go this weekâ¦â¦</p>
