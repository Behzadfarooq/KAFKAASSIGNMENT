<li><b>Comment</b>: The main reason that search results within Google do not turn up very significantly more "hits" is that most of the medical literature on the web is available only through an https (secure protocol) or otherwise requires log-in with a password to access relevant articles. This is typical of professional medical literature on the web. Indeed the New England Journal of Medicine search result appears to have come up only because of a meta-tag embedded in that particular page. The relevant aritlce itself is not available without payment of a subscription fee and logging into the secured portion of their database... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 15:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So are you saying that if I went up to any doctor and asked them what Hickam's Dictum was a notable percentage of doctors should be able to tell me what it is? Notability has nothing to do with what it is, as say a balancing point for Occam's Razor. Notability would have to do in this case then, how notable it is within the medical community. How many people are at least familiar with what it is. While it may have been cited in three different journals, unless its actually notable inside the medical community it falls under only being notable to a small group, and according to wikipedia that qualifies as non-notable. As it is, from the google search its quite obvious the public at large likely has no idea what Hickam's Dictum is. I haven't seen the citations from the three journals, so I can't tell if they're major or minor citations, how often it was cited, and what the context for the citation was. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:46, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Reply: I am asserting that physicians as a class are increasingly aware of this term in professional discourse with one another. Yes, a very significant number of physicians will have heard of this principle today, and a competent physician will tend to immediately understand its significance in diagnostic methodology. The original statement, a combination of tongue-in-cheek with extreme seriousness, appears to be "People can have as many diseases as they <i>damn-well</i> please." It serves as a counterbalance to the standard concepts of Occam's razor and "Osler's rule" (commonly stated as "One disease to a patient", named after the late 19th Century physician <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Osler_1c34.html" title="William Osler">William Osler</a>)... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 19:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine then. All I was looking for was notability. When I asked for a source of notability on the article page, you removed the prod and told me to go through the deletion process which I did. Having never heard of this and with no real information or sign of notability resulting from google, it wouldn't be the first time someone tried to push a theory on here that wans't notable. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:43, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I often heard this sentiment expressed by seasoned practitioners when I was learning the ropes of statistical consulting in medical research settings. Naturally I was disillusioned at first to find out how practically useless <a href="../../../o/c/k/Ockham%27s_razor.html" title="Ockham's razor">Ockham's razor</a> and the often allied <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayes%27_rule.html" title="Bayes' rule">Bayes' rule</a> were in actual practice, but it was an illusion well dissed. But I doubt if Google hits are a good test of notability, as I don't remember hearing the many variants of this maxim under this exact name. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 05:14, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually then, thats a vote against notability. Its not a particular abstract theory. If people aren't referring to it by name and actually calling it that, then its not notable. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In fact Occam's razor and an extreme version called Osler's Rule (often casually stated as "one disease to a patient") are standard in the medical lexicon of the 20th Century. Occam's razor is an oft misunderstood principle, because it does <i>not</i> demand that every diagnosis be reduced to a single disease involving the simplest possible qualities and quantities. Rather, it demands <i>all</i> possible diagnoses (hypotheses) that explain all the symptoms be considered, shaving away any unnecessary elements in the hypothesis — which may well still leave multiple possible diagnoses remaining under consideration while investigating further. It is a conceptual <i>razor</i>, not a hatchet; but because of the extreme variants such as Osler's rule and other misunderstandings of the principle, counterbalancing principles such as Hickam's dictum have become necessary to keep excessive "reductionism" in check. The balance being: "As simple as possible (in keeping with all of the complexities of the situation), but no simpler than necessary to solve the problems". ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 15:12, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>JA: I said only that "I don't remember hearing [it] under this exact name", and though that may speak only to my memory, cog.sci folks can tell you that people in general are better at remembering the gist of information content than they are remembering the incidentals of a particular syntactic utterance. Plus, I know all sorts of heuristics and theorems and stuff that have different names in engineering or psychology than they do in mathematics. And then, of course, others have already testified to the eponymous Dr. Hickam being immortalized in reputable sources. If you review the pages on <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Ockham_3735.html" title="William of Ockham">William of Ockham</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/k/Ockham%27s_razor.html" title="Ockham's razor">Ockham's razor</a>, you will note that it is customary practice in this area to attribute a historical accumulation of interpretations, and even the sediment of subsequent syntax to the legendary harbinger of a distinctive idea, even when these glosses and not a small measure of pure shine have yet to be found among his or her works, but are only asserted to share its spirit. Funny though, I do remember the <i>damn well</i> part, and will insist on its being restored for the sake of idiomatic accuracy. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 11:16, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
