<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Nowadays he is known worldwide, thanks to the Evo tournament video and others. The video is watched even by people who doesn't have much knowledge about the game, due to this dramatic characteristic. A well research would evidence that others countries makes his fame also. Examples are communities in Orkut.com dedicated to him: <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=8410635.This" class="external free" title="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=8410635.This" rel="nofollow">http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=8410635.This</a> should be considered.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - He is not known here except in the hardcore gaming community. He is VERY known in Japan. He doesn't get coverage in the States? Might as well remove all entries about all singers that don't sing in english while you're at it. I'm telling you he means a lot to the Japanese gaming community, they've made Ascii Arts of him on <a href="../../../2/c/h/2chan.html" title="2chan">2chan</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenkouNova_1b23.html" title="User:DenkouNova">DenkouNova</a> 22:54, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think that he is in fact notable. He's an international champion of what he does. International champion surfers and Magic card players are in here, so why not this guy too? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 03:54, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Surfers get coverage. Magic card players (as much as it pains people to admit) also get coverage. Street Fighter players do not. Even at the height of SF's popularity, they never got any notable coverage. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 03:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Daigo is equally notable as Jonathan Wendel in the gaming community. Also, Daigo is notable in Japan even among the general gamer, not just SF players and has been featured on a DVD. Also he has a imdb profile and is written in gamespot. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That IMDB entry is for "Bang the Machine", an out-of-print documentary about the SF scene. I was the one who submitted the info on the players that appeared in that movie; otherwise he wouldn't have an IMDB profile, which is all kinds of ironic. And the GameSpot "article" is just rankings for EVO in 2003. If your claims about him being known in Japanese circles is true, then it should be rewritten with <i>verifiable</i> sources as such, and "I know a Japanese guy who totally knows Daigo" doesn't count. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 06:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> more notable then any of these "Category:Magic:_The_Gathering_players".

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Um...the last time I checked AfD are because people have A. Fake articles, B. Articles that are unverifiable C. Article of zero notablilty. Much of the information on Wikipedia is found randomly, mainly through the well-organized link process (ie hyperlink in a different article, and lists) this is what make wikipedia great. In fact this is what most people do. For example lets say a person interested in the "History of SF" accidently stumbles upon "Daigo Umehara" in the Street Fighter article. If you are stating that this is not random, or the person has no interest in "The Best Player in SF" then I can say with 100% certainty that you have no idea what you are talking about. SF has a large enough following of causal players that people not searching for the best SF player or even the SF tournament scene would be interested in reading about Daigo. Lets take another example: The other day I "randomly" stumbled upon <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kardashev_scale.html" title="Kardashev scale">Kardashev scale</a>. I came across this while reading "<a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_economics.html" title="Energy economics">Energy economics</a>" which linked through the category to Kardashev scale. Now that was completely random, I also found Kardashev scale to be one of the most interesting reads in my life. Therefore, Lilithborne, you are done stop talking. 71.248.218.111 05:22, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is the last comment I'm going to make regarding this, because you obviously are not willing to listen to reason. The majority of articles that go through the AfD process are biographies of people considered not notable. This is just another one of them. I played SF for a long, long time and I'm pretty sure I know more about Daigo than you do. (A-Guy, anyone?) However, unlike poker, whose players have widespread popularity, SF remains, as MCB eloquently put it, an insular gaming community that rejects "newbies", ironically when they need new blood the most. "History of SF" on <i>Wikipedia</i> should be about the game in and of itself; the tournaments held, for the most part, failed to influence its evolution in any significant way. Now, as someone who has been playing SF seriously for about seven years, rest assured that you, like many other fanatics before you, greatly overestimate the influence of SF on society. So, since reason's lost on you, I'll leave it at this: Daigo Umehara is not notable enough for an encyclopedia entry and that, my friend, is that. What happens after this point is not up to you or me, but the admins. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 06:07, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would like you to know that I am not part of the SF community. I rarely play SF and see it nothing more than a causal game. I found this article to be notable and interesting. I stumbled upon this article through the category, japanese people. Therefore if I find this article to be notable, it probably is, since I do not belong in the interest group. 71.248.218.111 18:38, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
