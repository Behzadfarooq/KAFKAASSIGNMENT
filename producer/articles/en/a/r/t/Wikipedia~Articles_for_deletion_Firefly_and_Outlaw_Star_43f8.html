<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 14 opinions to "delete" (2 anon or very new users discounted), 6 opinions to "keep as is" (3 anon or very new users and one known troll discounted) and 4 that appear to prefer "keep as merge". While the community's opinion on the claim of "original research" remained ambiguous, I will note that the samples presented of specific outside sources were successfully rebutted.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a decision that this content should not remain as an independent article. However, there is not the overwhelming consensus necessary to delete the content. Despite arguments and counter-arguments, conflicting opinions continued to be added to the discussion. I am going to call this as a "no consensus" decision.</p>
<p>However, noting that the content was originally part of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly_%28television_series%29.html" title="Firefly (television series)">Firefly (television series)</a> article, I am going to place a copy of the content on that article's Talk page, redirect this article there (to preserve GFDL) and ask the editor/readers of that article to make the final determination of the use or removal of this text. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:54, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Easy, because, like I said in the second part of that sentence you skipped over, this is completely non-notable. A couple of people thought there were some similarities on the internet. The Lincoln-Kennedy thing is widely reported. I've seen newspaper articles on it, I had a worksheet on it in elementary school.

'nuff for you, or you want more? Just hit Ctrl+F 'Outlaw Star' and you'll find numerous other fans who believe there is at least some connection between the two.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The first and third links have persons unfamiliar with the series making this comparison, then being corrected by people that have actually seen all of the series. In the second link a person made the comparison, but after being chastised said "I was being slightly facetious." The fourth involved someone claiming Whedon plagiarized Outlaw Star, which I doubt a fan of Firefly would say seriously. The fifth mostly seemed to be people insulting the show, including comparisons to Outlaw Star, Trigun, and Cowboy Bebop. The sixth link seems to have involved persons who were not fans, and did not seem very familiar with the show. The seventh is a Wikipedia mirror. On the last page you linked to, the comparison was only made before the person watched the show, and I did check the other five pages of the thread to see if it was mentioned later. These links only show that a few persons on the internet that are unfamiliar with, uninterested in, or dislike the show have made comparisons to other Sci-Fi/Western shows like Outlaw Star, Trigun, and Cowboy Bebop, which does not justify this page's existence. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethoeph_fb67.html" title="User:Sethoeph">Sethoeph</a> 03:47, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>To be honest, I really think the speculation section of the main article is a bit too much. There is <i>always</i> speculation among science fiction fans. This show just <i>wasn't big enough</i> to have developed speculations that are significant to people who aren't fans. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 22:04, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia." Personally, I think the connection is worth mentioning. I don't think it's necessary to explore it at great length. (These are not exactly brilliant deductions. They are in fact fairly obvious.) As an individual article I feel that it's more of a fan essay than an encyclopedia article. It would make a wonderful article on a fansite. Perhaps such an article (on a reputable, well-established fansite) would make a useful external link. I happen not to think it merits coverage as an encyclopedia article.

<dd>Key word being "discussing". Wikipedia is not a venue for opinion, which this article strongly implies; the opinion being that there is some sort of connection between the two series. Otherwise, why create the article, besides to report on people's beliefs (which this article fails to do so)? Still otherwise, articles for the sake of comparsion are inane. George W. Bush and Willaim Clinton have netural-colored hair, were presidents at one time in their lives, have wives, wear suits, and lives/lived in the White House! Let's make a article that details every aspect of their lives that are the same! No. I can be swayed by the fact that it's believed by many people, but the article isn't written like that. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 04:45, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. The comparison is well-known in fandom in a way that 'George Bush and Hulk Hogan' is not, and while in some literal sense it's original research, so is just about any popular culture article. However, much of it is ridiculous. There are genuine points of similarity between the series like the "space western" setting, the girl in a box, and the Chinese influence. These are enough that people have noticed them--and then grasped at straws in their search for more. Elements like a musclebound warrior and a mystic, which can be found in almost any series, are not reasonable as similarities between the two shows. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 21:40, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Most of the compasisons are downright ridiculous. Yes, let's compare a smart kid with a warrior woman who can kill you with her pinky. Let's compare a irritable catgirl who was an actual ambassador to a high-class prostitute sarcastically called 'Ambassador' in one episode by the captain who disrespects her profession. And whoever suggested that Mal and Kaylee have an adversarial relationship clearly only ever saw the episode Shindig--and only half of it at that. Would you keep up a page that compares Lost to Gilligan's Isle because they both involve people stranded on an island?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the refurbished article is no original research according to whats said on original research: "In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims that are easily verifiable by any reasonable adult, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources." I have to note, that I found this page only because i was interested in the article (as a firefly fan, searching for crossreferences) and it gave useful knowledge to me. It says in which points the two shows in question have things in common. Just stating facts resulting from the original film material (primary source), nothing more nothing less. Offering facts to the user i thought is the aim wikipedia has. Crossreferencing between entrys is a thing lacking as much as it's necessary to get a view on a topic in its whole width when you doing a research via wikipedia (I'am not speaking of linking from Lincoln to every other "President of USA"-Entry). Linking to similar things is the lowest level of crossreferencing. Declaring on what facts a crossreference is build on is a true help when you wan't to find out about the value of a crossreference. As I saw the crossreferences on Firefly article to other shows, I asked me why are they crossreferenced and where are the relations. This article gave me the understanding of that. So besides from passing the wikipedia guidelines on original research, this article was a chance of getting the knowledge (not an speculation) on which facts the crossreference of Firefly and Outlaw Star (I heard of before) is based on.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is not hard to draw comparisons between stories by selectively taking generalized aspects of the plot or characters. Last night I read a comparison between the Lion King and Star Wars that was more convincing than this. Whilst it can be fun and entertaining coming up with them, such comparisons do not make for good encyclopedia articles. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethoeph_fb67.html" title="User:Sethoeph">Sethoeph</a> 22:34, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
