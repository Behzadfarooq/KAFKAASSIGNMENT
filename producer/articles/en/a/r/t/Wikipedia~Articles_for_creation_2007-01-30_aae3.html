Pan Mei Chen is a famous, much beloved Pop Singer of Taiwan. She has been recording since the late 80s and has a large fan base in much of Asia, especially in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Mainland China(and of course in her native country). The style of her music is what might be called folk pop. A singer-songwriter who incorporates influences from 60s-80s rock(her favorite band is Guns-n-Roses), folk music, smooth jazz, on occasion 90s techno, and indigenous traditions, Pan Mei Chen has forged a unique musical style and distinct personality. In a culture where most female singers stress the feminine, a tomboyish about looks and demeanor define Pan's personality. Though very attractive, her image is striking for its toughness and grit. In this regard, she may be compared with the character Priss of Bubblegum Crisis(anime)--also rock star. It should be noted that her in youth, she was often mistaken for a boy. She loves air rifles, various sports, and motorcycles. There is something slightly butch her about her, which is nevertheless nicely offset by her obvious beauty.</p>
<p>Pan Mei Chen has enjoyed longevity and popularity, resting on her abundant talent and ability to adapt in the fast changing world of pop music. Still, the loyalty of her fandom lies in the fact that she's a unique personal artist. Unlike so many pop idols in Asia who are created and disposed by the industry with predictable regularity, Pan Mei Chen has been a exemplar of confidence, strength, and individuality. There is something of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young in her musical personality. There is also something of Dusty Springfield, Stevie Nicks, and Pat Benatar about her. Her creativity and style are not limited to any one school of music. She is truly eclectic and adventurous--both an artist and a professional.</p>
<p>Pan Mei Chen is multi-talented, skillful with play guitar, piano, harmonica, and drums. Though many of her songs were written by herself, she has used material written by other songwriters to great effect.</p>
<p>Her albums include "Don't Go Away", "A Guy Who Doesn't Know How To Love", "Look for a Rainy Day", and "Leaving You".</p>
<p>Pan Mei Chen was born on June 30, 1969. Her height is 160 cm and her weight is 45 kg.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b> - perhaps I'm missing something here, but I'm having trouble understanding the subject's notability based on the text you provided.

<b>Peegs.com</b> is the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_University_4db1.html" title="Indiana University">Indiana University</a> branch of the Rivals' network of recruiting Web sites and was founded in the late 90s by Michael Pegram, who aptly named his site after his nickname: "Peegs". The site was formely an IU fan page devoted to recruiting and other things Hoosier basketball, until Rivals bought a share of the site, spurning Pegram to quit his day-time accounting job to head, at the time, the only media outlet completely devoted to following IU basketball recruiting.</p>
<p>The subscription-based site and its message boards have served as breeding grounds for Indiana fans' rants, raves and rumors and has broken a handful of stories surrounding the Indiana program - including the resignation of former head basketball coach <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Davis_24fb.html" title="Mike Davis">Mike Davis</a>, which was long purported on the Peegs' message boards before any media outlets reported the story.</p>

<p>JWPce is a simple Japanese-language word-processor that runs on Windows 95,95, ME, 2000, XP and CE platforms. It is designed for non-native speakers of Japanese who want to produce Japanese-language documents.</p>
<p>The default installation has English-language menus. Language packs for other languages are available and JWPce is designed to make adding further language packs straightforward.</p>
<p>JWPce offers many facilties that are useful to students of Japanese such as detailed kanji information (using KANJIDIC), a built-in dictionary (using EDICT and similar dictionary files) and various Kanji lookup methods.</p>
<p>JWPce supports multuple file encodings and. It does not provide facilties for vertical text, nor does it provide facilities to specify different fonts within a document. However, JWPce does allow the user to customize the fonts used to display text in the various parts of the wordprocessor.</p>
<p>A key feature of JWPce is that it runs smoothly on Windows CE and Pocket PC platforms. This allows learners of Japanese to use a PDA as an electronic Japanese dictionary.</p>
<p>JWPce is written in C++. The source code is available for download.</p>

<p>Turner Magazine is an international youth magazine. It was founded in December 2006 by Mfonobong Nsehe, a Nigerian student at Daystar University, Kenya, and it is published by Klepmany &amp; Temedia Inc. Turner Magazine has generated a lot of controversy over its list of the 'WORLD'S 40 MOST INFLUENTIAL UNDER 40,'initially published on the magazine website, www.turnermagazine.com. The list paraded such individuals as hip-hop moguls, Sean Combs and Sean Carter (Jay-z), business moguls, Mark Shuttleworth and Kurma Birla,entertainment personalities such as Tyra Banks, Beyonce, Mariah Carey and Jamie Foxx, as well as royalty such as Prince William of England and Prince Haakon of Norway, as being the most influential people in the world under 40. Turner Magazine also has other features such as inspiration &amp; motivation, sexuality, fashion &amp; lifestyle, and Dating &amp; love. The magazine aslo has a special feature called 'People not to envy', a column which parades prominent young people round the world who the magazine believe are not worthy of emulation. Paris Hilton was the first person to appear on that section of Turner Magazine. As at January 2007, Turner Magazine promised to come out as a printed version in February 2007. Unconfirmed reports claim that American media giant, AOL Timewarner is offering the publisher, Mfonobong Nsehe $20 million to purchase the entire magazine. The reason being that AOL Timewarner owns Turner Broadcasting company.</p>

<p>The reason the longhorn is the state and college mascot is because in the 1830's their where an abundance of longhorns and the longhorn could survive and feed of any type of vegitation.It was considered a hearty and strong animal and was chosen to be a mascot for Texas because it represented the tough, rugged state of Texas.</p>

<p>Son of a couple of pastors from a Independent <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a>, Ton Carfi has started his musical learning at the age of 9 in a local ministry, outstanding himself some years later as a soloist among the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenors.html" title="Tenors">tenors</a> from the so called Raiz Coral <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">Choir</a>, one of the current surpassing brazilian groups in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black.html" title="Black">Black</a> <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospel</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Music</a> genre.</p>
<p>He printed his unique inimitable personal style while performing songs such as <i>Te louvo</i> and <i>Tocou-me</i> in the "Pra louvar" Album from Raiz Coral Choir, <i>O amor de Cristo</i> and <i>Há um lugar especial</i> in the "Obrigado" Album from the Link4 <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartet.html" title="Quartet">quartet</a>, a derivation from the Raiz Coral <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">Choir</a> and <i>Tu és fiel</i> in the <i>Black So Dream</i> Album, a seminal work. In 2005, he leaves the Raiz Coral <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">Choir</a> and the Link4 <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartet.html" title="Quartet">quartet</a> to engage thoroughly in his personal career.</p>
<p>His timbre uniqueness, his versatile interpretation for songs plus his unsurpassed vocal technique has provide him with the phonograph industry respect and appreciation, given rise to invitations from some celebrities within the "Gospel" realm for propiciaram-no o devido respeito do mercado fonográfico, motivando convites por parte de figuras conhecidas no meio <i>Gospel</i> para participações - como "backing vocal" ou como "solista" - em gravações de diversos artistas, tais como Comunhão e Adoração, APC 16, Marquinhos Gomes, <a href="../../../p/g/_/PG_49f3.html" title="PG">PG</a>, Ministério de Louvor Toque no Altar, Vanessa Jackson, Coral Kemuel, Luciano Claw, Daniel Ribeiro, Sérgio Saas, Iamara Alst, entre outros.</p>

<p>A comoção que causa no público leigo em questões musicais com sua interpretação <i>sui generis</i> já é uma grande qualidade <i>per se</i>, uma expressão naturalmente temperada pelo choro na voz. Sua técnica vocal apuradíssima é caracterizada por um riquíssimo cabedal de ornamentos vocais, que inclui o domínio sobre o <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibrato.html" title="Vibrato">Vibrato</a> em diferentes freqüências, quebras intencionais entre modos vocais (Voz de Peito e Falsete / <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yodel.html" title="Yodel">Yodel</a> ), <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appoggiaturas.html" title="Appoggiaturas">Appoggiaturas</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melismas.html" title="Melismas">Melismas</a>, Improvisações e compressão com Laringe Alta, aliado ao belíssimo <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timbre.html" title="Timbre">timbre</a> que distingüe sua voz de <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenor.html" title="Tenor">tenor</a>, também privilegiada por uma ampla extensão.</p>

<p>Apesar de possuir alto quociente de inteligência musical, fato comprovado por sua facilidade em rapidamente assimilar novos conceitos e técnicas, desconstruí-los e recombiná-los em novas criações, Ton Carfi é deveras consciencioso com seu corpo discente, demonstrando atenção, respeito e paciência no trato com seus alunos.</p>
<p>Os menos habilidosos são altamente beneficiados pelo senso de ordem e didática que caracterizam o sistema de orientação vocal desenvolvido por ele, um curso forjado no decorrer de alguns anos de pesquisa, compilando o conhecimento vocal acumulado nas experiências vividas no laboratório propiciado pelo ambiente do Raiz Coral, na troca de informações com cantores de alto gabarito, como Leonardo Gonçalves, e na investigação autônoma que o levou à construção de um sistema de educação musical para cantores.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/u/b/Sublight_Records_db00.html" title="Sublight Records">Sublight Records</a> produced the following press release:</p>
<p>'Manchester, England's GARETH CLARKE is simply going to blow your mind and make you remember why you started listening to electronic music in the first place. With his beautifully arranged stutter of wild electrons, intense rhythms and vibrant melodies this 22 year old wizard is among the brightest new producers to grace the Sublight Roster and the world of intelligent dance music. Clarke began creating music at only the age of 13, first picking up drums, guitar, bass and the like then playing with a few bands through college until stumbling upon the potential faultlessness of composing on a computer where he found his true voice.' <a href="http://www.sublightrecords.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sublightrecords.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>Dana L. French (1958 - ) is a prominent U.S. computer scientist working in the fields of business continuity, disaster recovery, and high availability. He has designed and written numerous software packages to automate the processes of disaster recovery and high availability. He is most noted for his approach to system administration as an automated process, rather than an interactive one. His work as a programmer and system administrator has influenced the design and implementation of Unix systems in organizations all over the world and is the source of the commonly used phrase "enterprise wide unique". His business function approach to system administration has caused a global shift in the way Unix system administrators perform their work.</p>
<p>He operates several companies that specilize in providing business continuity services to large world wide organizations. These companies provide services that include consulting, disaster recovery facilities, application and business function hosting.</p>
<p>French is well known in the Unix community for his advanced shell programming skills and is a noted advocate of Korn Shell programming. He provides source code for most of his programming work on-line free of charge. One of his most well known shell libraries is "shell curses", which is a shell script implementation of the "C" language "Curses" library. Another is "kshSQL" which is a Korn Shell implementation of a complete SQL database system. French is also the author of "shunix", which is a project to implement all of the GNU Unix utilities entirely in shell script code.</p>
<p>French is also well known as providing a MicroEMACS binary executable repository for a very wide variety of operating systems. MicroEMACS is a widely used programmers text editor. Linus Torvalds, the developer of linux, is a notable MicroEMACS user, and is known to frequent this site. French has provided continuous access to this repository since 1995.</p>
<p>French currently works as a business continuity consultant, and teaches courses in disaster recovery planning and Korn Shell programming. He is an author and publishes articles on these topics regularly.</p>

<p>Slobodan Pajic is an artist using new media in original ways. Inspired by the formal beauty of abstract, natural phenomena, Slobodan Pajic employs chance techniques at the limits of technology and translates the forms he thus creates into videos, photos, films, objects and installations. Pajic follows progress in physics and adopts the latest technology in a quest for new forms, new materials and new techniques.</p>
<p>BIOGRAPHY Born August 16, 1943, Slobodan Pajic arrived in Paris in 1966 to study art history at the Sorbonne, but was soon prompted to reorient himself to his own painting. He lives and works in Paris and has become a French citizen.</p>
<p>During the 70s, his abstract, geometrical art brought him success, but his passion for new media, as “new supports” for creation, soon won out. One of his first solo shows was the organization of space with laser light at the American Center in Paris. As soon as 1/2 inch video equipment was available, Pajic began to work on a series of short videos unlike anything which has ever been done : Exploiting the incapacity of the video scanning pattern to register isolated instants in their entirety, Pajic introduced abrupt changes by breaking reflective surfaces before the camera.</p>
<p>The new Pompidou Center in Paris lent their post-production facilities for a compilation of these short films and provided one of the first showings. The positive reaction of critics prompted the Musée national d’Art moderne to commission Pajic to produce the first artist’s video in their new, two-inch video studios. Untitled 77 : Passage From Closed To Open Space, an abstract film in saturated color, continues to occupy a unique position in the history of video art.</p>
<p>In 1980, Pajic settled into a new studio in Paris and began a series of installation pieces employing video screens and projections.</p>
<p>An Image Reflector consists of a mirrored video screen on the wall, before which is placed a video monitor with an abstract, repetitive film, accompanied by an electronic signal. As the spectator approaches the screen to see the film, his or her own reflection becomes part of the experience.</p>
<p>The Image Captors are typically composed of a large video screen on a wall, before which is placed a projector on a plexiglas pedestal. The screen is prepared with a mixture of phosphorescent materials which capture the projection and restitute it in the dark, only to be replaced by another. The image fades slowly, in the same way as an impression in short-term memory.</p>
<p>In 1996, the French National Museum of Modern Art commissioned an installation from this series. The result, a large multi-screen installation Mémoires the was presented in the exhibition Made In France. To the sound of a rocket-launcher called “Stalin’s Organ”, images of war on 16 mm film in decomposed motion imprinted a prepared video screen, then abruptly disappeared, leaving the after image to slowly fade in silence. On the other side of the room, 4 projections of fixed images of combats and refugees appeared in violent bursts and disappeared into darkness. The piece was an altogether moving indictment of war and aggression.</p>
<p>In the early 80s Pajic began a series of pictorial works based on the inability of laser light to pass through certain distortions of material. Creating his own filters, he produced abstract, chance patterns, which he then transformed into arresting pictorial works. A series of installations, in which laser patterns slowly evolve in space, followed.</p>
<p>At the end of the 90s, he started work on a series of Electrophotograms of vegetable matter. Based on the Tesla effect, popularly known as “Kirlian photography”, the images are composed of minute points of light. The use of computer technology restores to the image all its brilliance and complexity.</p>

<p>Haiwalkons theory of sponges states that on the Earth's surface, sponges are volitile. This was proved incorrect in 1984 by an Icelandic Scentist called Thrustmaster. His ideas were that sponges were gay, and regularly raped young, vunerable children in the bath. His theories were popular at the time because he was rich, and well repected. Earning him a rightful place in society, and followers. After 20 years of touch research; in 2004, Harold Scholes and Jake Wood introduced a new theory, called the Theory of Pipe Clay Triangles, which disproved Thrustmasters ideas. Their theory states that there are 650 gazillion Venezuelen trench duelling mooses on the Earth, and you are within a centimetre of one everywhere you go. This defies Thrustmaster's theory of gay sponges, as it shows that mooses are not proportional to sponges. The equation of Pipe Clay Triangles goes like this:</p>
<p>Koala Bear<sup>2</sup> = (ΔSponge) ÷ (7 + Jockstrap)</p>
<p>(Answer in Metres)</p>
<p>Koala Bear x Armadillo = Koala Bear<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Koala Bear x Armadillo = (Compass ÷ Norwegian Mine Shaft<sup>2</sup>) x Semen of righteous mammel</p>
<p><br />
Even though; (Compass ÷ Norwegian Mine Shaft<sup>2</sup>) x Semen of righteous mammel <b>does not equal</b> (ΔSponge) ÷ (7 + Jockstrap)</p>
<p>It is proved correct because sponge acts as a catalyst.</p>
<p>We can now confirm that that <b>Freight train x stuffed mongoose = Rastrick Hgh School</b></p>
<p>These ideas were not accepted at first because they contridicted Mendel and Charles Darwin's Theories, but because a mongoose has mircopenis, but with a 30 tonne bellend, the theory was eventually accepted.</p>

<p>On January 29, 2007, on Stephen Colbert's <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_Central_c9d4.html" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a> show, "The Colbert Report" he encouraged his fans to change the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a> to say <i>"Reality has become a commodity",</i> saying that the first person to do so would receive five dollars from him.</p>
<p>Immediately following this statement, a torrent of viewers flooded the article, changing it to say nothing but "Reality is a Commodity" for 5 minutes. The entry has since been blocked to avoid further tampering.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
This isn't the first time that Stephen Colbert has urged his fans to change a Wikipedia article. In an earlier episode, he asked that the article on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephants.html" title="Elephants">elephants</a> be changed to state that the number of African Elphants had tripled in the last six months, therefore insinuating that they are not in fact, going extinct.</p>
<p><br />
He explained his gesture by saying this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, any user can change any entry, and if enough other users agree with them, it becomes true. ... If only the entire body of human knowledge worked this way. And it can, thanks to tonight's word: Wikiality. Now, folks, <b>I'm no fan of reality, and I'm no fan of encyclopedias</b>. I've said it before. Who is Britannica to tell me that George Washington had slaves? If I want to say he didn't, that's my right. And now, thanks to Wikipedia, it's also a fact. We should apply these principles to all information. All we need to do is convince a majority of people that some factoid is true. ... What we're doing is bringing democracy to knowledge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kurt Grundman is the #4 best parallel parker in the United States of America. He has been #4 for the last 2 years. He previously was the 2nd best parallel parker in the United States but was recently passed by Mark 'Booster Seat' Seiler and Micah 'Range with the Range' Bycel. Grundman has repeadetly tried to discount both Seiler and Bycel by saying they use 'performance enhancing techniques.' According to reports, Bycel doesn't even drive a car. "All I know is that I am the best" boast Grundman, who also claims he is in the top 5 of nearly everything that is rank-able.</p>
<p>Grundman is coming out with a book, due out in 2008, called "Packers- The Grundman Story"</p>
