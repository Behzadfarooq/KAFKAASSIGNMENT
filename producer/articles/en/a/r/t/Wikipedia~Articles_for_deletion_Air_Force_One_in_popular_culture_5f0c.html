<li>Oh good, we have a volunteer! Bear in mind that there are TWO articles (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_VC-25_8fed.html" title="Boeing VC-25">Boeing VC-25</a>) which deal with the current AF1s, and you'll have to watch them both. I RESENT your assertion that editors who don't wan't to deal with the cruft are simply lazy. I have fought cruft for months here on Wiki, and they do NOT add THEMSELVES. Many crufters will fight tooth-and-nail to keep their items in the articles (see <a href="../../../f/-/1/Talk%7EF-15_Eagle_b20c.html" title="Talk:F-15 Eagle">Talk:F-15 Eagle</a>'s battle over Transformers). As I detail below, as long as Wiki policy permits itms like these, they have to go somewhere. I have yet to encounter a crufter who objects to having a separate page for their items, but they just want them on Wiki. I am totally for banning ALL unsourced cruft, and will join you in this fight if you want to challege the current rules. But for now, having pop-culture pages is an acceptable compromise on the issue under Wiki's current policies and guidelines. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 16:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I much agree here. Trying to maintain a popular article where people add pop-culture references every day gets futile after a short while. The leaf pages, IME, lessen the maintenance burden significantly. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 15:44, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The way to fix bloated pop-culture items is to BAN them, esp. since most are unsourced. Until then, these articles are legitimate, and should remain. This IS a PRUNED list; I participated in the pruning on several occasions. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 16:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article was created (by me) after a split of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> page (which covers the history of the name and callsign), and the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_VC-25_8fed.html" title="Boeing VC-25">Boeing VC-25</a> page (which covers the current planes uses as AF1). Because of the split, it was confusing to have two separate Pop culture sections in both articles, with the same items being added to each list by editors unaware of the other list. ALL items on this page at this point are there because of consenus over several months of editing and pruning of the list on the main article. Most serious avialtion editors in <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAIR_f7cf.html" title="WP:AIR">Project AIrcraft</a> would rather not have pop-culture items at all, but as long as Wikipedia permits them, pages such as this are a suitable compromise. I will oppose re-adding this material back into the main article on that page, if it happens. It will only cause confusion in the furture. If you don't like cruft, then try get Wiki policy changed to ban it; deleting pages like this is not the way to go. As long as crufters feel they are allowed to add their cruft to Wikipedia, it has to go somewhere; better here than cluttering up the main articles. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 16:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - an indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture any reference to a president's being on a plane, since "Air Force One" refers to <i>any</i> airplane on which the POTUS happens to be flying. <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">Better here than in the main article</a> is a terrible justification for these "...in popular culture" articles. If editors don't want the material in the articles they maintain, then they should remove it and keep removing it instead of dumping the problem off on another set of editors by splitting it off. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:47, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Unless it's vandalism, repeatedly removing items will violate <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. This is official policy, not a guidline, and some idiot admin will block me for it. So in the real world, your suggestion to keep deleting is just not practical, and VIOLATES policy. Besides, crufters have friends, and they can gang up to form a concensus to keep the most inane items imaginable, and then you're screwed. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 17:32, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with BillC. Until a policy is created banning such articles, they have a right to exist if their topic is notable enough, can be sourced, is non-POV, etc. This topic is notable enough to justify an "in popular culture" article. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>And again, that's a guideline, not a policy. In this case, it's better here than in TWO places, as explained in detail above. Whether one like Pop-culture pages or not, one really should consider the actual intent here, which could have been uncovered by a little reasearch. It was easy to find out who created the page, and ask the creator why he felt it necessary. But that was not done in this case (others might accuse one of being lazy). - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 19:04, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand that it's an essay. At no time did I suggest that it was anything other than an essay so I'm unclear as to why you felt the need to remind me of it. Essay or not, BHTT is still a piss-poor argument and if the best or only reason for having an article is because the information in it is trivial clutter from the main article, then that ought to be an indication that the information shouldn't be <i>anywhere</i>. I also understand why you thought it was necessary. Thinking that you couldn't possibly be more wrong in your reasoning doesn't mean that I don't understand your reasoning. The big problem with your reasoning is that now, instead of there being two articles to monitor for garbage content, there are three. That doesn't really strike me as accomplishing, well, anything. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:19, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not really a BHTT argument, because the Pop-culture content is sufficient for a stand-alone article. The case at <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">WP:BHTT</a> deals with splitting unsuitable content, rather than deleting it. In this case, cruft has been pruned, and the article contains substantial items like major motion pictures, books, etc. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 21:33, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Not all "trivia" references are trivial. Some are important. The summary style link in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> is excellently written leading to this breakout article. The subject matter of this article includes notable books by well-known authors, high-budget Hollywood movies, and songs, of which Air Force One is the primary subject, not a mere mention in passing. This kind of article is an excellent reference intersection of several items on the same subject matter but which aren't otherwise linked. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 19:41, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Ambivalent</b>, delete it or keep it, but <b>do not merge</b> with Air Force 1. Good technical and encyclopaedic articles are distracted by excessive trivia and are ruined by volumes of cruft. <a href="../../../e/m/o/User%7EEmoscopes_e222.html" title="User:Emoscopes">Emoscopes</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/o/User_talk%7EEmoscopes_6c98.html" title="User talk:Emoscopes">Talk</a></sup> 20:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> article is long, and splitting off a section is normal editorial practice, as was splitting off <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_VC-25_8fed.html" title="Boeing VC-25">Boeing VC-25</a> because it was an obvious content dividing line. Further splitting off the popular culture is a logical choice, because the relationships to the main article are more tangential, and including the trivia in both articles is redundant. With a major motion picture, books, etc. there is more than enough verifiable content for a stand-alone pop-culture article. The arguments here against popular culture content sound like <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDON%27TLIKEIT_90f9.html" title="WP:IDON'TLIKEIT">WP:IDON'TLIKEIT</a> IMHO. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 21:07, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The material is notable by definition (especially the films and TV references), and yes, there actually are people interested in cultural references to aircraft such as this one. This article and others like it, are part of an effort of <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAIR_f7cf.html" title="WP:AIR">WP:AIR</a> to accommodate information that needs to be mentioned somewhere other than in the aircraft's technical article. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 02:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Here's what's stupid: if a subject is <i>too</i> notable, popular culture lists are deleted for having too many entries. It's only on subjects of less notability that "in popular culture" lists are made and kept for.

It's stupid that the less notable it is in popular culture, the more likely the list sticks around. Also, some of these votes seem like <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> to me and are arguing that there are some people who are <i>interested</i> in this, which isn't a factor on if it should be kept or not.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 04:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Dear god no!</b> Please don't create any kind of policy solely for the purpose of allowing or disallowing "in popular culture" articles. Case-by-case consideration, even if time-consuming, is the best approach. That said, most of this article is verifiable and indeed verified through primary sources (i.e., the films, books, etc. themselves). However, the main article has a short "in popular culture" section that I believe is an adequate replacement for this list (although it could use selective expansion--of analysis, not additional instances). So, <b>redirect without merging</b> to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> as this is a plausible search term. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:46, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
