<p>Patent nonsense. Not only is it an article about fringe original research, but at least one of its anonymous proponants has been using it as a platform to insert Time Cube nonsense into other sensible and useful articles like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Mean_Time_c038.html" title="Greenwich Mean Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a>. Consider this image caption: "<i>The unique harmonicity of the 4-corner quadrant division proves the supremacy of the number four.</i>" <b>This is <i>not</i> encyclopaedic.</b> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 10:51, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There have been many votes to keep with a clean up to better reflect Time Cube as an internet phenomenon and remove the "original research" in line with Wikipedia. I have attempted such a clean up which has significantly slimmed the article. Could anyone seeking a clean up of the article please review my version and edit or expand on it as necessary.

<li><b>Comment</b>: No, I'm voting on keeping the article, and suggesting a rewrite. I'd heard of Time Cube long before I'd heard of Wikipedia. This site has gained some notoriety, even if the content is considered a notch above or below crankworthy. If I had the time or inclination to rewrite the article, I'd have done so. As is stands, I'm simply letting others know I feel it's worth keeping, once improved. From there, the community can muster up all the improvements it likes. I never said I'd come back to visit the article at all. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 06:09, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Completely noteable. I've seen Ray on Tech Tv. Even if the Timecube theory is fringe and quack physics, it still is a noteable theory in that it is popular.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Cleanup</b> I know many here simply want the page to be cleaned up, but I suggest those people read the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Cube_Archive_4148.html" title="Talk:Time Cube/Archive">archived discussion</a>. There is someone who apparently has vast amounts of time on there hands, who will fight any attempted cleanup at all turns. This page has been edited away from a page about Gene Ray's Time Cube website into a troll for parody sites like CubicAO, and it will stay that way without considerable devoted attention from someone. I suggest that unless you personally are willing to cleanup and maintain the cleaned up page, that you vote for the practical choice under the circumstances. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheradenine_c92d.html" title="User:Cheradenine">Cheradenine</a> 16:11, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The practical choice is to allow the article's NPOV to remain, and not make baseless accusations of auxiliary sites being parodies and other such prejudiced remarks. Maybe you're talking about the choice that is practical for censoring Truth and forcing Academian beliefs upon readers.<br />

<li>Reminds me of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a>. We have no article for his "Temple of Hayah," but that is not nearly as discussed as this "time-cube" seems to be. As long as it's a fair article and not a fanboy piece or a hatchet job, <b>keep</b>.

<li>If you look at the (long) edit histories of this article and of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Ray_871d.html" title="Gene Ray">Gene Ray</a>, and the comments on the talk pages, you'll find that several editors share the suspicion that 211.28.*.* is the dynamically-assigned IP address range that Gene Ray himself uses. For the months prior to this article coming up for VFD (for the third time), many edits to these two articles have followed a pattern: Gene would edit the article from a 211.28.*.* IP address, and another editor would then either neutralize or revert the added content. Interestingly, it was Gene himself who removed the first VFD notice on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">02-01</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:55, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uncle G, why is it that you are engaging in unfounded "ad hominem" attacks instead of addressing the actual content of the articles? As I have pointed out many times, I am not Gene Ray; and it seems to me that contrary to the conduct that should be adopted by a useful and productive Wikipedia user, you are intent on taking sides and fighting against users whom you dislike. This results in the quality of the actual content being overlooked and compromised. Again, you need to focus less on conspiracy theories against users such as myself, and more on the actual content of Wikipedia articles. 211.28.24.43 08:42, 2005 Apr 28 (according to history <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:33, 2005 Apr 28 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> as far as I can tell (reading he archived discussions etc.) 211.28.*.* is <b>not</b> Gene Ray, but rather the author of the parody/troll site <a href="http://www.cubicao.tk" class="external text" title="http://www.cubicao.tk" rel="nofollow">CubicAO</a>. Read any of the interviews with Gene Ray and this ought to be clear. Effectively this Wikipedia page has been overtaken by trolls who are using it to promote their own parody/troll site for their own amusement. Anyone who cares to read the discussion page and use the Wayback machine can trace the development of this particular trolling effort. I've attempted to clean up the article. Please edit or extend, or at the least drop a word of support for the edits into the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Cube_3824.html" title="Talk:Time Cube">discussion page</a>.

<li>Cheradenine, <a href="http://www.cubicao.tk" class="external text" title="http://www.cubicao.tk" rel="nofollow">CubicAO</a> is a serious site; and if you have legitimate objections to the content of article <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>, you will need to explain the specific flaws, rather than making up conspiracy theories about the writers being trolls. 211.28.24.43 08:42, 2005 Apr 28 (according to history <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:33, 2005 Apr 28 (UTC))</li>

<li>"started"? It has been going on for over a year. Speaking as one of the editors who has from time to time over the past months neutralized or fixed 211.28.*.* modifications to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_Cube&amp;diff=9346244&amp;oldid=9335867" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_Cube&amp;diff=9346244&amp;oldid=9335867" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Ray_871d.html" title="Gene Ray">Gene Ray</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gene_Ray&amp;diff=9440093&amp;oldid=9384381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gene_Ray&amp;diff=9440093&amp;oldid=9384381" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gene_Ray&amp;diff=9380910&amp;oldid=9358698" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gene_Ray&amp;diff=9380910&amp;oldid=9358698" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, I think that it is highly probable that 211.28.*.* will <i>not</i> lose interest. Xe has, after all, been doing this (adding text which has to be neutralized, reverting other editors' changes to xyr own version with edit comments claiming it to be the "NPOV" one, accusing a wide range of other editors of "POV" and "ad hominem attacks" on talk pages) since at least January 2004 (where 211.28.*.* was even then commented upon in the VFD discussion).
