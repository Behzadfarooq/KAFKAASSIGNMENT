<li><b>Delete</b>, since there's nothing to merge. We have two sentences: one of them states the obvious (that the township has schools), and the other makes the unlikely claim that "Bensalem Township is often recognized by having a very diverse student body of many different nationalities" -- unlikely, because there are literally millions upon millions of towns and districts across the world that "have very diverse student bodies of many different nationalities", and it seems quite implausible that this one is actually considered particularly noteworthy (just 436 ghits for <i>"bensalem township" diversity</i>; the first one is about diversity of extreme sports, and the second one is for the sentence "The low level of diversity within the student population..."). — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Probable hoax. The screenshot included as a source for this article, which purports to be of a cnn.com article about this topic, appears to me to have been photoshopped. Unless cnn.com filled their article with spelling and grammar mistakes.

<li>The screenshot, uploaded by MatthewSoprano (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewSoprano_0fa7.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewSoprano">contribs</a>), clinches it. There's little need to check Google News for articles about Australian gangs (although I did that anyway — there aren't any). This is a hoax. The fact that an uploaded screen shot is given as verification, rather than a simple {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">cite news</a>}}, is highly suspect straightaway. But the clincher is that there are no such web pages on CNN by the URLs that can be seen in the screenshots, the URLs in the screenshots don't match the datelines of the purported articles (one is 2006, the other 2005), and the titles of the two screenshots differ and are well below the standard of literacy that one finds at CNN. <b>Delete</b> this, Image:Magnums.jpg, and Image:Themagnums.jpg. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:16, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it's in the proper spirit, or something reasonably close. Brainfuck hasn't exactly taken the world by storm either. My suggestion: stick a brief mention of Pi into the Brainfuck article, delete the Pi article, and leave it up to the regular Brainfuck editors (who probably aren't reading this afd) whether they want to keep the Pi mention or not. (Actually, I see there's already a wikilink in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainfuck.html" title="Brainfuck">brainfuck</a> under "related languages", so just change the wikilink to an external link, and again, leave final disposal up to the brainfuck editors). <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 09:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

The absolute minute that anyone provides sources in the article or on AfD to provide verification that Fox News (not FrontPageMag, as that publication is of borderline notability and no reliability) frequently interviewed and then covered this guy, however, my vote will change to keep. When you put your face on national television repeatedly, you are a public figure. We don't delete articles because they're inconvenient for the person being written about; to do so would encourage the writing of hagiographies and that is <i>not</i> in the spirit of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 02:50, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</s>

The professor is a notable public figure and became embroiled in a parallel to the Ward Churchill case, and was commented on several times by figures of note.

I already identified the blogs as "left-leaning," if you consider them "far left," say so in your response, rather than editing me in a way that makes it look like <i>I</i> called them far left. If anything, my post about them being blogs was misleading, because the first two articles were actual media articles I found through the two blog listings.

<b>Strong Delete</b>. My husband Jens and I live in Florida, and I have known Bill for 15 years. Jens served with him in Bosnia and elsewhere, and I greatly doubt he would have ever spoken with a reporter about his military background. Jens still can't tell me much of what he did or where he went, and my guess is the reporter was misinformed by someone else about Bill's background and then had to blame him to cover her own you know what. Whether you think Bill deserved tenure or not, it isn't beneath a university to dirty someone's reputation in order to gain leverage, and my husband and others I've talked to think that someone from the university probably fed the reporter misinformation so they could blame Bill for it later. Something really horrible happened to Bill and his wife 5 years ago which is how and why he left the Army, and it would make him a very sympathetic person if he could talk about it. Whatever the case, it was a tempest in a teapot and it is long since over. Bill is out of teaching and is now working in insurance in New York or New Jersey. Wikipedia policy is not to include bios on living people that aren't notable. This man and his family deserves his privacy and for this article to be deleted. Barbara
<ul>
<li>Barbara, editing other users' comments is considered bad form on Wikipedia, especially when it changes the meaning of what they say. Don't change "turned out to be lying" to "had allegedly lied" (which was what the articles were saying, not me personally). Don't change me from saying "not sure if this controversy is notable enough" to "this controversy is not notable enough." If that is your opinion, you make your own case, don't make it look like I'm making it. This sort of thing only serves to push me towards voting to Keep. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 05:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I apologize, Groggy Dice. You are correct to admonish me. I admit to being a little emotional on the subject, because I know Bill and I am upset that he was treated badly.

<ul>
<li><b>HOLD ON!</b> Are all of the last few voters actually reading the article? The ironic effect of the heavy pro-Bradford edits is that it makes it hard to see how the article can be seen as a "personal attack" piece. It describes how he "graduated <i>summa cum laude</i>," received various degrees and honors, "served at the War Gaming and Simulation Center, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Defense_University_e351.html" title="National Defense University">National Defense University</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_McNair_eeca.html" title="Fort McNair">Fort McNair</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and was an advisor to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shalikashvili," "authored numerous law review articles," and "was named a Dean's Fellow in recognition of scholarly excellence." The controversy is a section at the bottom, and gives as much space to Bradford's charges as to his opponents'. All mention of the military record issue has been removed, which appears to be the sore point. While the controversy's <i>result</i> may have been one-sided (his resignation), Wikipedia's <i>coverage</i> of it is not.</li>

<dd>There needs to be an actual discussion here, not just taking claims at face-value that he's non-notable. Maybe both "author and subject want it deleted," but the only real reason the author's given is that the subject wants it deleted. He hasn't said why he created the article in the first place, and why he apparently thought the subject was notable then. Has everyone read the articles from the <i>Indianapolis Star</i><a href="http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051204/COLUMNISTS02/512040470" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051204/COLUMNISTS02/512040470" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> and <i>Inside Higher Ed</i><a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/06/bradford" class="external autonumber" title="http://insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/06/bradford" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, or did my mention of "left-leaning blogs" lead some to not look closely? I mentioned that one Google search I ran got 15,700 hits, which contains a lot of false positives, but would normally be enough for people to explore the possibility that he might be notable. I've come up with a more selective search<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22william+bradford%22+%22chiricahua+apache%22+OR+%22indiana+law%22+OR+roisman+OR+%22ward+churchill%22+OR+%22indy+law%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22william+bradford%22+%22chiricahua+apache%22+OR+%22indiana+law%22+OR+roisman+OR+%22ward+churchill%22+OR+%22indy+law%22" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> that gets 800 hits.

<dd>I also turned up a copy of one Dean's Report <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kOZ-idRLuKsJ:www.indylaw.indiana.edu/alum/DeansReport/200304.pdf+%22william+bradford%22&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kOZ-idRLuKsJ:www.indylaw.indiana.edu/alum/DeansReport/200304.pdf+%22william+bradford%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">(Google cache)</a><a href="http://www.indylaw.indiana.edu/alum/DeansReport/200304.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.indylaw.indiana.edu/alum/DeansReport/200304.pdf" rel="nofollow">(original PDF)</a> which on p. 36-38 lists his recent accomplishments of 2004. It describes several papers he'd published or presented, a couple of positions he'd been appointed to, and notes his appearances in the media. Many of these are local, but also cited are NPR Morning Edition, Fox National, John Gibson, and Radio France Info. It says that he was interviewed by the Charlotte Observer, Spokane Spokesman-Review, the Associated Press, the Daily Tennessean, and the Atlanta-Constitution. At the end, it say that he was nominated for the "American Bar Association Law School Division Henry J. Ramsey, Jr. Award for Diversity." He may want his privacy now, but if he failed to achieve Wikipedia-level notability, it was not for lack of trying.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see that this is someone who needs to be an entry in an encyclopedia, virtual or otherwise. In my estimation, a person ought to be notable or important in some extraordinary way to merit inclusion, and I just don't see that this is the case here. I think it is especially true if he is no longer even a professor, and therefore being described incorrectly by the entry. The fact that the editing history reveals so many conflicting/contradictory bits of "information" makes me even less willing to give any credence to the article in any form. If both the subject and the author desire deletion, my opinion is that they should have the final say.Owmyeye 21:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC) (Note: Sorry, I posted this in the wrong place initially).

<ul>
<li>You have some valid points, but overall I disagree with them. George W. Bush also has a "conflicting/contradictory" editing history, but that's not grounds for deleting his article. In fact, controversy can be an indication that the subject is notable enough for people to care about. If Wikipedia adopted a policy of deleting articles because partisan edits made them unreliable, controversial topics by the thousands would go. As for the subject wanting the article deleted, I believe that should hold NO weight. Everyone has warts, and as someone else has pointed out, the writing of articles cannot be held hostage by its subject. That's the Daniel Brandt precedent. Suppose Charlie Manson decided he didn't want to have a Wikipedia article, somehow convinced the entry's creator, and argued that they should have "final say" and that he was "no longer even a cult leader!" (Though we don't know <i>for sure</i> that Bradford wants his Wikipedia entry deleted, that's what YHoshua says, but he hasn't come back to the discussion to elaborate, and we haven't heard from Bradford directly.) Back to notability. I would agree that he may not be "extraordinarily" notable, but that's usually not the standard applied on Wikipedia, and the more I've dug into this, the more I'm leaning to the view that he's notable enough. Now that I've seen a photo of him, I do recall him being a guest on cable news. If a Wikipedia entry for Bradford had been created before mid-2005, before this mess blew up in his face, I'm sure he would have been pleased. And at that time, I'm also sure he would have taken umbrage at a move to delete it on the grounds that he wasn't notable enough. That's the tragedy here: here is someone who eagerly sought notability and had the gifts to achieve it, now forced to seek obscurity. He had remarkable achievements, but was undone by the need to claim still-more remarkable achievements. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 00:22, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. He fails <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Regardless of whether or not he wants to delete the entry he doesn't meet notability. His credentials are nothing special for a tenure-track asst. prof. The controversy is essentially local -- this happens all the time where someone is denied tenure and claims he has been discriminated against based on race, sex, polical affiliation, sleeping with the dean's daughter, <i>etc</i>. Some of them have been discriminated against, others have not. Some win, most don't. He probably had a little more than his 15 minutes of fame because there are groups who like to push the point of view that conservative faculty are discriminated against. I see nothing beyond local interest. If he becomes a poster child for the Student Bill of Rights, then we can revisit the issue. Right now, he's simply just another relatively anonymous former-assistant professor. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedE_69df.html" title="User talk:TedE"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TedE_bca7.html" title="Special:Contributions/TedE"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 05:08, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<b>Definite Delete</b>. Looks like third parties with political agendas used this former professor for their own purposes, but inherently he doesn't even come close to meeting the criteria for notability as a professor. He was a useful tool for about 5 seconds. And Barbara's comments make a lot of sense.

<li>"Silvestre," he himself wanted to be "used" and actively sought to enlist those "third parties," which milked the case for a lot longer than "5 seconds." David Horowitz's Frontpagemag gave the case at least two months of heavy coverage, and he mentioned it regularly in his appearances. Even after Bradford's downfall, an excerpt<a href="http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=21249" class="external autonumber" title="http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=21249" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> from the introduction to his new book (focusing on Ward Churchill as his poster "anti-child") makes a mention of Bradford's case. "Barbara's" story would actually make this case more newsworthy than the mainstream version. As for the author realizing that he had "unfairly treated the subject," I think it would be a good idea for <b>everyone</b> to view his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;oldid=30125811" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;oldid=30125811" rel="nofollow">original version</a> of the page, since the current version has been so heavily watered down. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 17:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>Definite KEEP</b> I think it's time to admit to myself that I've decided to vote keep on this article. Having my comments tampered with has led to dig far deeper into this matter than I ever expected to, and what I've found has convinced me more and more that this is a keeper. Also, I've come to realize that some people are drawing their conclusions from the current state of this article, which differs greatly from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;oldid=30125811" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;oldid=30125811" rel="nofollow">original version</a>. I'm going to do what I probably should have done a long time ago, and re-edit the page to resurrect an earlier incarnation. Don't jump on what <i>appears</i> to be a steamrolling bandwagon- look very closely. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 17:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am proposing this article for AfD because it is an example of the dangers of crystalballism: the information available on the internet for a proposed 2007 Woody Allen film does not, in large part, match the information to be found here. Some of the information in this article originally matched a film to be released this summer by Woody Allen, entitled Scoop (that information, I must note, has since been removed; but its original presence in the article gives the impression of very poor research on the part of the author). A good deal of the rest of it, including the title, cannot be verified, since no references are to be found in the article. A search for the title brings 0 ghits. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 02:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Grandmaster Ka...i agree my attempts have probably not been good enough....i have deleted all other attempts which either aimed at supplementing any other article or were posted in any other category. My aim is not to vandalise any article on wikipedia or advertise this concept. But, the fact that the concept had found widespread appreciation in a developing country like India which still faces numerous challenges for the implementation of Information Communication Technologies in Education is worth a look. Also this endeavour has been on for 5 years now. So i thought maybe it was worth a mention on Wikipedia....maybe, you could give me one last chance. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 210.7.67.88 (<a href="../../../2/1/0/User_talk%7E210.7.67.88.html" title="User talk:210.7.67.88">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_210.7.67.88_3f24.html" title="Special:Contributions/210.7.67.88">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>keep</b> I've searched Wiki quite a bit and seen pages no different than this. Like 'Furcadian Wrestling Federation', that's some guild on Furcadia. What's the difference besides the fact that ISP will make entertainment available to everyone while FWF will only appeal to certain others who have Furcadia? Also the reason I hesitate to call ISP a company is because isnt a company something that has an infastructure and makes a profit? ISP is completely profit free.

<li><b>Keep</b> Within Therianthropy, a good portion of us call our culture Therianism rather than Therianthropy. Same how Christianity and Catholism are alike, but different names and small notable variations. We mainly beleive in the same things, but alot varies between both. I also do not suggest merging them, as suggested. It's just a headache for us then, prolly resulting in a debate of/and deletion and reinstatement of this article. If we want to be defined as Therians under Therianism, let us be then; it's not bugging anyone. And yes, the article needs to be reworked. I didn't mean offense by 'the cool group', i was just saying that because I really think it is an awsome group to be a part of! ^^p Mix Bouda-Lycaon 05:31, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> — I was originally going to second merge to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a>, but this article has no substantial content at all and definitely violates the NPOV principle ("cool group"? please!). So there's really not much here worth merging. Add a line to the Therianthropy article mentioning "therianism" as an alternate term, maybe, but I can't see any need for more than that.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I gotta say I would think that something that has grown from an utterance in a forum to over 4,000 google hits and it's placement in several people's prominent vernacular over a short course of time is in and of itself worthy of a wiki entry. The Newspaper that has used this term in articles does not keep open public archives of material past 2 weeks as it seeks to recieve payment for past archived content. Granted, this may not be newsworthy to someone outside of Akron, Ohio but to us.. it is. What about links in articles. For example in the Akron wikipedia entry is it of note to anyone besides Akronites that there is a Talk radio station at WAKR 1590? or that there's a Downtown Akron partnership? Hows is it grounds for removal based off of the fact that it "Is only fully understood by residents of the city"? Part of the terminology's charm and long lasting nature is that it's based off of local flavor. For you to call that nonsense, simply because you don't get it, is a shame. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/p/f/User%7ECpfa_eljefe_0863.html" title="User:Cpfa eljefe">Cpfa eljefe</a> (<a href="../../../c/p/f/User_talk%7ECpfa_eljefe_040c.html" title="User talk:Cpfa eljefe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cpfa_eljefe_7035.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cpfa eljefe">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. Firstly, as a member of the www.coolpeoplefromakron.com forums and website, I don't appreciate your rudeness, and I agree with the above "Don't Delete" entry on every point made. Simply becasue it is a local term, one used by the residents of that city, doesn't mean it is not appropriate for "Wikipedia." A child in Akron may look up such a term as "akroness" to use in a local culture HS newpaper article, term paper, or professional journalist using it in an article that you couldn't find (<a href="http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/news/columnists/david_giffels/14617541.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/news/columnists/david_giffels/14617541.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/news/columnists/david_giffels/14617541.htm</a> or <a href="http://www.kansas.com/mld/ohio/news/columnists/david_giffels/13966638.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kansas.com/mld/ohio/news/columnists/david_giffels/13966638.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kansas.com/mld/ohio/news/columnists/david_giffels/13966638.htm</a>). By the way, it hit on almost 5000 on google, and 12 websites. And in rebuttal to the sloppiness comment, Kitia, would it be too hard to post something like "Akroness of this entry may cause deletion, please keep entries in article form." instead of simply tossing it aside without any contemplation, therefore giving the person/persons a chance to tidy up their entry?

<dd>Uh, neither of those articles seem to use the term "Akroness".

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. Both of those articles use the word as summarized in the Wiki entry in question. CTRL-F is handy for searching in page. As to your point that Wikipedia is merely for summarizing information that has already been published.. The term 'Akroness' has been published on CPFA, used as a title/theme in multiple DVD creations, referenced in above linked articles, and found it's way into the common vernacular of city residents. All things start out small, as ideas passed from one to another and then grow from that seed. This phrase is way past the seed form and I'd call it more of a sapling. A community tree if you will. I support it staying for it's documented popular culture roots and continual growth in our fair city. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/p/f/User%7ECpfa_eljefe_0863.html" title="User:Cpfa eljefe">Cpfa eljefe</a> (<a href="../../../c/p/f/User_talk%7ECpfa_eljefe_040c.html" title="User talk:Cpfa eljefe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cpfa_eljefe_7035.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cpfa eljefe">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. Uh, your professionalism is flying out the window...sorry about that. You (and I quote) "summarize information that has already been covered in published sources. Period." Exactly what we are trying to do; give you the definition of a word that has been used more and more since it's conception, in multiple published sources. I doubt everyone in Akron got it the first time Mr. Giffels wrote it into his newspaper article. He used the more editorial appropriate spelling of "Akron-ness," but whether you say goodbye or bye bye it holds the same concept. We don't know, but he may have originally written "akroness" and when his editor saw it, asked him to correct it. While I was getting my degree in Mass Media I had many an article corrected, spelling grammer, etc. But I digress...saying that simply because a word, phrase, expression, etc. is a neologism, meaning that it is simply new, not the second definition in Merriam-Websters Dictionary of "a meaningless word coined by a psychotic," fails the arguementative test of tradition. Simply becasue something is new doens't mean that it isn't worthy of note. Also, I agree in geological terms the word is but a nano second old, but a word that been used in the regular vernacular of many an Akronite for the past 2 years, I stand, is worthy of said notoriety. All we want is our word to become notorious, and not in the negative conotation that a "bad guy" would be considered, just well known. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.221.23.191 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.221.23.191.html" title="User talk:209.221.23.191">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.221.23.191_277e.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.221.23.191">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. See now you're just insulting us, and that is rude. I don't appreciate that. I can only assume that you make "ad hominum" attacks becasue you, at this point in our discussion, have run out of intelligent things to say. I am disappointed that the people at wikipedia, a website that has very much good information, would be such poor arguers. Though amusing, your euphemisms for "deletion" are still uncalled for. And to make a rebutttal to your comment C. Fred, somebody invented the first words at the so-called "airdock" one day many years ago. The first words weren't instantly used by every speaking person on the planet. When American Sign Language was developed by Galludet it was only used by 3 people until they started teaching other deaf people the language. So our word is not yet used by the mass populous, neither is the word "dubs" (meaning 20" wheels on a vehicle) but you have a Wiki page for that. Thanks.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It appears that when the article was created, the subject was making headlines for some statements he attributed to a politician, which drew possible lawsuit threats.

<li><b>Delete and comment</b> Sad case, but with the number of murders in Canada alone, being a murder victim in and of itself doesn't provide notability. As for why there's a category for murdered children, categories serve as "meta information" for a host of articles. In and of themselves, they are simply descriptors added to an article, which then allow one to find other articles in that vein. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 16:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article doesn't do a very good job of explaining this, I admit, but the notability of the Shepherd case was that it led to a judicial inquiry which recommended a major overhaul of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>'s system of child protection, because it was held that the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_Aid_Society_6bee.html" title="Children's Aid Society">Children's Aid Society</a>'s failure to protect her from parental abuse was a contributing factor in her death.

<li><b>Retool or delete</b>. My attempts to find a Taiwanese Communist George Chang on Google had no success, though interestingly, there was a pro-independence George Chang who was arrested by the authorities. Our article on the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwanese_Communist_Party_273c.html" title="Taiwanese Communist Party">Taiwanese Communist Party</a> says that the island's communists decamped to the mainland at the end of the Civil War, and that "promoting communism" is still illegal. It says that there basically is no Communist Party on Taiwan and that all efforts to start one have been abortive. The man who is trying to start one is called Dai Chung. Thus, there is a question whether this article is of any truth. However, we might want to have an article on the independence activist, who doesn't have a lot of hits, but apparently had a moderately notable arrest in 1992, or one of the other George Changs that some editors would insert into the article, only to have them deleted. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 12:06, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A tricky one, this. As a New Zealander, I've never heard the term used and it feels like a neologism. It's a virtual orphan, too, only linked from a disambiguation page. Truckloads of ghits, but they're all for different things (A Buddhist magazine, various travel companies, and more often than not qa chance juxtaposition of words). I'm not convincved. If it is an accepted term, then it's likely as not more of a wiktionary thing anyway as it's unlikely to grow beyong definition length. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:16, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yeah, whatever. Merge. (And to address your concern, "merge" means leave redirects, so there won't be redlinks). <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 18:21, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, IDispatch is not just any old interface - it's the specific interface you need to implement if you want your COM object to be accessible from VBScript/JScript, and it's used for programmatic control of MS Office and probably assorted other things too. IIRC, OLE Automation is also distinct from OLE/COM in general in that OLE/COM has a many different interfaces for different objects, each with a fixed set of methods, and you need to provide the definitions for all the interfaces you need to use at compile-time, whereas OLE Automation only uses IDispatch, all of the methods of an object can be called via that, and the methods used don't need to be known at compile-time. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 17:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correct, the point is that while IDispatch made important new uses possible, in a pure technological sense, this is all the same stuff under the hood. I'd really like to see a historical explanation in the COM article about how COM programming evolved over different generations of Windows as these interfaces appeared, but in any case, Automation arose as part of that evolution. Remember that COM encompasses both Automation and non-Automation uses.
<p>So I still haven't seen any sensible argument (as opposed to "prevent redlinks") presented in this AfD for keeping the articles separate, but as someone suggested, the talk page is maybe a better place for that discussion.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Even if Microsoft is trying to change the terminology (they do that a lot and it's really annoying) this term is still routinely and commonly used. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:04, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eh? Why a separate article instead of a redirect? Am I missing something? I never could stand the way they kept changing terminology, and generally referred to all these things as ActiveX more or less on purpose when I was programming this stuff, even when that wasn't strictly accurate. I would have loved it if they'd put all the relevant docs in one place instead of making me constantly navigate the MSDN maze. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 18:21, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've looked now and feel the same way as before. Do you know anything about this subject? Do you know what IDispatch is, for example, and to what extent its presence makes an object different? I didn't look at the other articles before because I didn't feel that I needed to, having spent more time programming COM than I want to think about (shudder). I don't mean to be giving you a hard time, and I'm sorry to have been so flip, but I'm knowledgable enough about this subject to feel that I know what I'm talking about when I say I think we're better off with it all in one article and having the related terms redirect. It's Uncle G, on the other hand, who doesn't seem to realize that merging with redirects doesn't leave redlinks (and of course "merge" means fix the backlinks). And he hasn't made any cogent arguments of anything except that the old term is still in use, which I haven't contested. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 18:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is my contention that editors are acting too harshly in the particular instance of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> edit, and that the reason for such extreme harshness is a lack of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> in the users carrying out those edits, myself included.

<li>The specific vandalism incident is non-notable, even if it was mentioned offhand in several blogs. However, the <i>term</i> is clearly original research. A search for "blosting" google gives 335 results, mostly typos. The fact that somebody is trying to make a neologism out of abusing our website annoys the heck out of me, but the <i>reason</i> we're deleting the article is that it violates about a half-dozen of our policies for the inclusion of articles. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you stating that the original "vandalism" of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> is non-notable, or this specific article? I understand your reservations about adding an article specifically devoted to Blosting (it seems premature), but I do believe the so-called "blost" of Chocula is significant--or at least as significant as the other events in the Cultural References category. The inclusion of information about the Chocula "blost" in this area of the Chocula page is fully in line with Wikipedia's policies regarding editing of and addition to existing articles.--71.106.80.32 20:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No reference to the vandalism of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> article should appear in that article. The article is for <i>facts about the cereal</i>, not for <i>facts about the article on the cereal</i>. This is per <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a>. Please read our policies more carefully; I must <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume</a> (in the absence of significant evidence to the contrary) that your incorrect assertions about them are made in error and not out of malice. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have read <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> and am very familiar with it. I believe you are misinterpreting, and am willing to concede it is without malicious intent. The WP:ASR refers specifically to references such as "According to this Wikipedia article" (which the Chocula reference is not), and goes on to make clear that, "Wikipedia can, of course, write about Wikipedia...If, in this framework, you link from an article to a Wikipedia page outside the main namespace, use external link style to allow the link to work also in a site with a copy of the main namespace content." The information about Chocula's edit as verified by aforementioned sources should be included with external links in either Cultural Refs or External Links section of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a>.--71.106.80.32 21:13, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uh, nope. ASR may not explicitly spell out the obvious fact that <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> is not an article about edits to the article, but it is unquestionably a blatant self-reference for us to clog articles with facts about previous edits to the article itself. It is against the fundamental fact that we're writing an encyclopedia, not promoting ourselves; just the words "avoid self-references" themselves make this clear. (If the vandalism of the specific page somehow magically became notable, there would be an article on that on a separate page—but I don't think that could ever happen.) Further discussion of this should be in the talk page of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> article, although I doubt there's much point. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 21:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>WRGPT - WRGPT is not a website. It is a free, no fee, no prizes, no sponsors email-based poker tournament that has been in operation for 15 years completely by volunteers for the enjoyment of 1100+ players. WRGPT is a small part of the history of the net and the history of poker. It was started out of conversations on the newsgroup rec.gambling back in 1991. Please do not delete this entry.

<li><b>Keep (please)</b> - I am the definitive source for the tournament since 1999 and have discussed the history with those who preceeded me. I have been asked by many users why there wasn't a Wikipedia article on WRGPT so I decided to write one. Certainly there are many useless articles that should be deleted but this one should not be in that category. There are several articles in Wikipedia, for example, on relatively unknown poker personalities. This article is useful to many and harms none. --Kidtire 00:11, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

On doing a little research of my own, it appears that notable poker players such as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Ferguson_9f77.html" title="Chris Ferguson">Chris Ferguson</a><a href="http://www.quizkids.com/wrgpt/wrgpt4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quizkids.com/wrgpt/wrgpt4.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Raymer_b629.html" title="Greg Raymer">Greg Raymer</a><a href="http://www.quizkids.com/wrgpt11/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quizkids.com/wrgpt11/" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> have taken part in this tournament. The FAQ for <code>rec.gambling.misc</code> has some info on it<a href="http://www.bjrnet.com/RG/general.html#H2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bjrnet.com/RG/general.html#H2" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>. A volunteer run internet-based poker tournament that mostly antedates the web is the kind of quirky stuff that a mainstream encyclopedia would miss and Wikipedia is so great at covering, and it is certainly notable for being perhaps the only email-based poker tournament. In any case, I think the label "SPAM" is unnecessarily harsh for a site that's volunteer run on donations and doesn't blast the viewer with thousands of ads. Full disclosure: I myself don't know anything about poker, but, being from the generation that grew up during the golden years of USENET, I admit to being rather biased in favour of organisations that had their start in newsgroups. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 01:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. WRGPT is part of poker history. It can easily be verified by current WSOP players (e.g. Andy Bloch, 2nd place winner of the $50K HORSE tournament 2006). WRGPT predates on-line poker.

<li><b>Comment</b> I mean absolutely no offense, but that's without a doubt the <i>worst</i> voting rationale I've ever seen. So sockpuppets are voting for it- how does that change the merits of an article? I'm putting down "keep," and I'm not a puppet. If <a href="../../../d/o/y/Doyle_Brunson_0182.html" title="Doyle Brunson">Doyle Brunson</a> somehow made it to AfD, and a bunch of socks said to keep it, would you want to delete that, too? If you think the article does not assert notability, then that's one thing, but your contribution to the discussion is about as useful as a sock's. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 12:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> it's not expounded upon well, but <i>flood of sockpuppets</i> is a usual signature of an article that needs to be deleted, the same way <i>The article about this band is written in the first person</i> is a usual signature that the article needs to be deleted. In this case, the flood of sockpuppets is a result of the article's total failure of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> et al. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I, on the other hand, think sockpuppetry is one of the more valid reasons to delete an article. It is considerably more objective than the notability guidelines that can be interpreted in any number of tortuous ways. I have voted keep above, and will stick to it because my rationale remains unchanged, but there have been many instances in the past where I have changed by vote to delete based on the disgusting amount of puppetry in an AfD. The article currently doesn't stand on its own merits, and my attempts to spur constructive discussion on Talk:WRGPT and <a href="../../../k/i/d/User_talk%7EKidtire_f77e.html" title="User talk:Kidtire">User_talk:Kidtire</a> (the author of this article) have been met with stony silence. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 20:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The point is that Doyle Brunson <i>wouldn't</i> have a bunch of socks voting in that AFD, unless you're counting on all the members coming over from the Doyle Brunson RPG Forum, which, by the way, would be the most awesome forum ever. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The WRGPT article is not SPAM so does not fail that criteria. Although the Verifiability may be considered a little weak as it is from other Internet sources; mostly USENET articles, discussions and announcments. Some of these sources have been added to the article. As for Vanity, there is some reason to believe this might fail as the article mentions the author only because the author was asked many times why there wasn't an article about WRGPT in Wikipedia and the author plays a significant role in the operation of WRGPT. Therefore it does not fail all the mentioned criteria "with a passion" as mentioned in this comment. -Kidtire 17:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It looks to be a fairly serious award given for having relevant material published. However, at this point I think it would be better suited to have the article <b>renamed</b> <i>Albert G.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. This article is mix of a bio on the person and simply lists the two adwards. The group that makes the adwards is a red link. Notablity is a question here.

<li>Basketball is not a mainly amateur sport either, yet college-level basketball players are explicitly covered by the highest level of amateur sport clause. I will grant that the wording of the guideline is a little vague, but I think as far as football is concerned the highest amateur league (the English Conference, Serie C, French 3rd Division) is probably sufficiently notable.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 21:02, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Just as basketball is a very professional sport in the US, yet the "highest level in mainly amateur sports" overtly encompasses US college level (including basketball). The clause may be badly worded, but I think the college sport mention shows that it's not just athletics/swimming/gymnastics that's supposed to be covered. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 17:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, but while professional football players in Europe are signed up young, and can be playing in the first team aged 16 or 17, in the US basketball or American football players usually attend university and only start playing professionally when they graduate. So, the entire setup is different. (Also, many professional US teams aren't really, they're equivalent to football reserves.) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 23:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On second thoughts, the criteria for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> are sufficiently vague (and contentious to judge from the talk page there and at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28athletes%29_2ecf.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (athletes)">Wikipedia:Notability (athletes)</a> that I can't really justify using it to justify a keep vote.

<p>Original research, not a reputable source, not an important subject. Could be a hoax. I'm also adding many other pages in the category "Maltese nobility". Either they are unsourced, or they come from a small family of web sites. None of these web sites cite their sources. This subject would be of minor encyclopedic interest if a <b>reputable</b> source could be found. Historically, they may be interesting (but not without a good source). As for now, they look like vanity pages. Even if they do exist and have some bona fide claim to their titles, they would still be vanity pages if they're not mentioned anywhere in a reputable source. I'm not an expert, but apparently something like Burke's Peerage is a good source. There is no use in listing all of these baronies/noblethings as separate entries. It is promotion or vanity. Apparently it is all based on a single web site anyways. The user who made most of these has been notified on his talk page <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">User:Tancarville</a></p>
<p>At best, they could make a single page referring to Malta nobility, their committee, with good sources, and then put in a link to their web page. Many of these pages were already listed as unsourced or original research.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should consider letting the article writer put in better sources. In these types of articles, the reference should be to an individual page in these books or at least a chapter, so that someone can borrow the book in their local library and check them. But since nearly all of these pages are written by a single author, and these types of pages may embroil Wikipedia in the less-reputable sale and promotion of old useless or practically extinct nobility titles, I think it is better to delete them. Also, note the possibility that most of the text here has been copied wholesale from one of the older book sources, hence breaking copyright/GFDL.</p>

Several things have changed since then: verifiability and reference requirements have been substantially tightened, and the number of Maltese nobility articles has substantially increased, and arguably reaches to dubious claims or minor figure.

I'm inclined to say <b>delete the lot</b> as unverified and very probable, if elaborate, hoax - additionally, I think some serious fact-checking by someone with access to detailed and reliable books on Maltese history is in order. Depending on the findings of the research, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_nobility.html" title="Maltese nobility">Maltese nobility</a> needs to be substantially rewtitten/expanded to explain either why there is such a ridiculously high density of noble titles, or to explain the fact that all of this is a hoax (which in itself seems widespread and notable enough to merit a mention in the article).

<li><b>Answer</b> The Maltese were closely aligned with the Knights of St John and the Papacy. Of course there was never more then 5% of the population that were titled, though up to 10% of the population would have been nobility. 45% that claim to be of noble ancestry. The rest of the population were made up of working class people and slavery. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 08:34, 25 July 2006 (EST)</li>

There are no notability concerns here; if the claims in these articles are true, then they are valid entries for an encyclopedia. However, I have to agree with the above posters that the lack of reliable sources is fatal. For example, the "references" section of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counts_of_G%C4%A7ajn_Tuffie%C4%A7a_7fa5.html" title="Counts of Għajn Tuffieħa">Counts of Għajn Tuffieħa</a> contains two websites (neither of which appears to cite any sources other than the other) and some "Unpublished research papers", which are obviously completely useless for our purposes.<br />
I am not convinced that there is any hoaxing going on. It's a commonplace that small European nations have disproportionately large aristocracies, and I can't see anything obviously implausible in the claims of the sample of articles I checked. However, the simple fact remains that Wikipedia requires that it be possible to verify articles in their entirety from the sources cited -- all the more so when the article has been accused of being a hoax! -- and at present I'm not capable of that, which means something is badly wrong. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 20:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tancarville also posted this on JanBrogger's userpage [User talk:Jan Brogger]: Do you really know what your doing by deleting all of the Maltese nobility? There are already previous requests for deletion and some were deleted and some were not. If its all based on references then check and ask. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 08:39, 21 July 2006 (EST)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tancarville has now added the exact same set of references listed above to all the pages. This is an improvement, but still falls short of adequate references. First of all, the references themselves must be improved so that it would in fact be possible to get the books. Citing "various editions" is imprecise - please provide at least 1 or 2 actual editions and their info (ISBNs/publisher, year etc). For any recent books, ISBNs should be listed. The "Adami Collection" is clearly inadequate - is it a book? When, where, by whom was it published? According to a Google search the Adami may be "The Adami Collection Database birth records for Malta ". The second problem is the preciseness of references. You cannot simply cite a whole database, and similarly it is not good practice to cite a lump set of 10 books. For each and every noble title, actual page numbers or at least chapters should be produced. In Library of Congress and Amazon, the only book I found of the ones listed "Nicholas de Piro: Casa Rocca Piccola: Home of a Maltese Noble Family, 74 Republic Street, Valetta, Malta: An Historic House, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1871684757</a>".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I did find the Publishers Enterprise Group. Apparently all the books he has listed are available from their web site. E.g. "The Genealogy and Heraldry of the Noble Families of Malta (Vol1)" is listed at <a href="http://peg.hanut.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=317&amp;Identifier=c24a405c8efa07e7e1e8e2908682e07d" class="external autonumber" title="http://peg.hanut.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=317&amp;Identifier=c24a405c8efa07e7e1e8e2908682e07d" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> and has ISBN <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 99909-0-329-8</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Let me reiterate again that it is sources and original research that is the problem - I have nothing against Maltese nobility. In fact, I would be quite happy to have the articles there if in fact they have good sources and only a minimum of original research. As an example of what I think is acceptable research and sourcing is:
<ul>
<li>referencing the Adami collection with an actual record number, or enough information that I can find it myself (potentially).</li>
<li>Enough detail on the books to easily be able to retrieve them, with precise enough references (chapters at least).
<ul>
<li>Well these references cover all of the Maltese nobility, but I will need to go through each one to cite page, chapter, isbn etc. Thats no problem, but I shall need time hopefully completed in several days. I do realise that I was asked before and never got around to completing this task. This certainly has gotten myself to do something that should have been done originally.<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 22:41, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And still, Tancarville has not answered the "original research" charge. His pages clearly state that this is his own research, which is not allowed. What is his own research, and what is taken from the books?</li>

The Present Count is also quite easily found in Malta!!!-- Lastly, this is a hoax claim <a href="http://www.geocities.com/princeofcomino/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/princeofcomino/index.html" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 08:34, 25 July 2006 (EST)

<li><b>Question</b>: "The Present Count", you say. I took a look at <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_nobility.html" title="Maltese nobility">Maltese nobility</a> and there read: <i>The Maltese nobility consist of those titles of nobility recognised by the British and those titles never presented to, or failed recognition by, the Royal Commission, even though the titles were of historical relevance. .&#160;.&#160;. and Foreign titles which were either confirmed or inherited by a person of Maltese descent.</i> That's slightly unclear at the start, but toward the end it seems to me to indicate that the nobility is a matter of the <i>past.</i> My reading of articles about Malta informs me that Malta is a republic, a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected unicameral assembly. I see no particular space within this for nobility and no mention of nobles. Oddly, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Category%7EMaltese_society_95fa.html" title="Category:Maltese society">Category:Maltese society</a> lacks an article on Maltese society, but again as I look around I see no indication of the significance of this "nobility". I therefore tentatively infer that, whatever significance Maltese nobility may have had in the past, it is now merely a matter of personal amusement, snobbery (membership of "old money") or whatever. (And the "now" seems not to date from independence; rather, <a href="http://www.maltadata.com/maltavot.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.maltadata.com/maltavot.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> seems to imply that political significance of the nobility disappeared in 1921 if not earlier.) What significance does membership of the nobility have now? If it has no real significance, then what's the justification for describing those "title holders" (such as the present "Count Sant Fournier") who postdate its loss of significance? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:33, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I couldn't listen, as the file is in proprietary Windows format. I did skimread two or three of the interviews, and the gist seems to be that, whatever significance the titles had in the past, they have no significance now. (A contino writes: <i><a href="http://www.maltagenealogy.com/SME/Vellabonavita.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.maltagenealogy.com/SME/Vellabonavita.htm" rel="nofollow">I doubt the general population occupies any of its waking hours thinking about the nobility.</a></i>) This reinforces my view that coverage of the "nobility" should stop when the nobility ceased to have political or social significance. Again, I don't claim to know when that was, but my impression is that it was no later than 1921. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:08, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't understand who it is that you are asking here. As for me, no, I don't believe that "Maltese nobility" is, in its entirety, a hoax. But the long list doesn't impress me at all. Let's take "Sir Temistole Zammit, Kt.Bach." as an (interestingly named) example: I'd say that if he is noteworthy for what he <i>did</i>, he deserves an article; and that if he's slightly noteworthy for what he did, he deserves a part of a larger article -- but that his mere existence in some genealogical record is not something of any concern to Wikipedia. I'm also wondering why nobody has explained just what the significance (to Maltese politics, economics, society, etc.) was of its nobility, when and how its significance (apparently) fizzled to nothing, or why it is worth mentioning who have been the Counts, Continos, etc., of what, <i>after</i> this fizzling to nothing. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 01:49, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sorry, this is just too wide. Every fictional character in existence has at least one catchphrase, often many.

<li><b>Keep but rewrite</b> It bothers me that so many people are so persistent in VfD this article.

Keep in mind that to date, the main page alone boasts 4.5 million hits and as Joshua mentioned earlier, is routinely used by TBC as a resource.

That does not even include the forum and fanstuff wiki's it has had to expand into. If there are deficiencies in the article, then I urge the community NOT to take the easy way out at do blanket deletes, but to correct those deficiencies and improve the article. How hard is that. Even if it's not "in the news" it is popular enough to many users across the wiki (just do a regular <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Homestar+Runner+Wiki&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Homestar+Runner+Wiki&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" rel="nofollow">google search</a> and skip over the first few hits and you'll notice people talking about it in their blogs and everywhere else. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStux_2586.html" title="User:Stux">Stux</a> 05:04, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A rewrite during the AFD is fine. I've done it myself to have articles saved and so far it's worked, but perhaps I only pick easy ones.

<li>A few of the debaters, including myself, brought up all the notablilty of this Wiki, and there is not enough of it for it to merit its own article.

<li>The article has been reasonably condensed and I added two references (one is from flashforward but documented by the wiki). I do have one question: where do we draw the line in notability? Does it need to have 15,000 articles? Does it need to be mentioned at least three times in a local newspaper for a city of the size of 100,000? Different people have different measuring sticks which shows how fuzzy this line really is. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStux_2586.html" title="User:Stux">Stux</a> 05:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm assuming that the article has been improved since the inital complaints, because it certainly does have sources. It is not affiliated with TBC (the creators/owners of the Homestarrunner IP and website, for those not in the know), so I don't see why it should reasonably merged into the Homestarrunner article any more than <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a> should be merged into the Star Trek article. In fact, other than content quality, I see no difference in the uniqueness or viability of this article. Perhaps what we need to do is create a WikiProject Homestarrunner and include this page in it? Maybe that will give it the credability it needs to get equal treatment with other fan wikis. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWestonWyse_9040.html" title="User:WestonWyse">WestonWyse</a> 12:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The majority of fan wikis seem have no articles at all, or to get deleted, because the ocntents are almost without exception unverifiable from independent secondary sources. A short paragraph on the parent article is fine, but fan wiki articles in general have a cruft factor of close to unity - I'm sorry, but the world at large really does not care about anything more than the fact that they exist. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, actually, the Homestar Runner Wiki is one of those few exceptions.

I personally think this is more notable than Memory Alpha and Wookiepedia, however, it's not notable enough to warrant an article (mainly because this Wiki has become much more than just a fanwiki). <b><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Sir Crazyswordsman</a></b> 15:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As mentioned above, soccerbase.com has no record of him ever having played in the football league, which would seem to suggest that, while he may well have been on the books of Coventry and/or Millwall, he apparently never played a professional match for either club and therefore surely receives no notability as a result. As an aside, I'd also question whether he would be necessarily notable even if he <i>had</i> played for either or both of these clubs. There's an awful lot of journeyman players out there who have played a handful of games for lower division teams (which both Coventry and Millwall are), but I don't think that means that they automatically merit an entry on Wikipedia.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:21, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

Rambling off somewhat, I have to say that I personally don't think that every player who has ever played in the "fully professional" Football League (of which there must be literally tens of thousands) can be considered notable just by that fact alone, but that's probably a debate for somewhere else.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I might be wrong but that looks like a hoax to me. There is no Google hit for a Fineous Farrier, there are no references given and why is the article called <b>Fin Smith</b>?

<dd>Having been asked to explain my vote, I observe on further inspection that his father (to which I thought the article should be redirected) doesn't actually <i>have</i> an article to redirect to, while the company mentioned -- which might have been the other logical target -- has only a one-line stub. This therefore appears to be the most detailed entry on any of the related subjects. I remain of the opinion that a single article on the Kelloggs would be preferable to several, but as we don't <i>have</i> several, there doesn't seem to be any such problem. I am therefore changing my vote to <b>keep</b> and expand, at least for now; perhaps the father could also be discussed in this context, to give a broader, more detailed article. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> for further clarification: since a redirect would make no sense when the only possible target article does not mention this man at all, the minimal sensible outcome, if the consensus is to delete or redirect, would be to <i>merge</i> this with the article on the company. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:21, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Note that the article has been considerably improved since the above "delete" votes were cast: a number of previously absent claims of notability have been added.

<li>--AFISX 19:12, 20 July 2006 (UTC)Well guys...I'm sorry to have caused a stir. Stoomie has a dedicated following among the younger Internet musical community and these folks have been asking us to put up a Wikipedia page for him. We wanted to wait until the album dropped and was available in big-name locations but this is scheduled to happen this coming Monday (July 24th) and as such, things around here have been a bit insane. We put up the page a couple of days early so that a) we wouldn't have to do it during the fulfillment rush and b) it would already be there for viewing when the album drops. We will, of course, abide by whatever you decide. Please keep us advised of your wishes; we can always replace the page at a later date.</li>

<p>Sigh. Though this was deleted just a week ago, the article was reposted. Speedy deletion tag was removed by admin as the content was not identical. Admin then placed a PROD tag on it which was removed with the edit summary "the predecessor to this article should have never been deleted" which shows the editor has clearly gone against the consesus of other editors. Previous discussion here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_vehicles_in_the_Halo_universe_98f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of vehicles in the Halo universe">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_vehicles_in_the_Halo_universe</a>. We've already had the discussion and such, so hopefully a speedy delete is still in order. Let someone take it to articles for undeletion or deletion review or whatever.

<li><b>Delete</b> Halo is notable. I don't play video games, but even I can recognize it as notable. However, the game itself does not confer notability to every aspect. This coverage is superfluous. This is not the right forum for this coverage. I'm starting to feel like a myna. Oh, and the fact that it was recently deleted doesn't really help it. Circumventing deletion review and taking matters into one's own hands = bad form. GassyGuy 13:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I feel bad that I think this should be deleted, given the amount of work put into it, but I can't help but think that the listed moves are not coherent and unified enough to be actual <i>moves</i> worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia, when in reality moves such as the "Duckwalk" have probably been done a couple times in different variations within the last 50 years without coming at all near the point of the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonwalk.html" title="Moonwalk">Moonwalk</a> or something like it. It also seems that many of the titles of the guitar moves are made up because they lack an actual name. Why do they lack an actual name? My guess is that it is the author who identified the move as a distinct and notable entity. It seems that any interesting motion performed by a guitarist is likely to end up on this list, and I just can't see being good for our encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 16:31, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is a referative work and sheds the light on lots things in rock-n-roll history. Certainly, it's not in the best condition now: lots of unreferenced info around, lots of "made up" titles, broken formatting, etc. I'm trying to tidy it up, generally, it following ways:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Titles should be either clear, known to everyone (referenced, not made up) names of moves, or just bare descriptions (for example, I doubt that "Playing behind the back" can be named otherwise or it's not clear for everyone what this title refers to)</li>
<li>Move description should include clear and brief descriptions of actions involved and refer to particular persons. A good reference is a photo or short animation of a person doing it.</li>
<li>Move should include description of famous performers of this particular one, an inventor (if applicable), history of development of move, info on various variations, info on performances captured on video.</li>
<li>Article should be fixed to use neutral, encyclopedic tone, without using "you do so and so" and that kind of language.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guitar moves are pretty popular, has its traditions and long history. While current metal bands may thrash the whole scene and it looks pretty average, aggressive and extreme moves in 1950-60s looked really shocking. As for obscurity of the material - we have articles such as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_guitar.html" title="Air guitar">air guitar</a> or <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggling.html" title="Juggling">juggling</a> that also list various moves and techniques and even whole categories such as <a href="../../../j/u/g/Category%7EJuggling_patterns_and_tricks_9b15.html" title="Category:Juggling patterns and tricks">Category:Juggling patterns and tricks</a>. Also, the article can be a good source for beginner performer to find some interesting thoughts to spice up his performance. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyCat_699e.html" title="User:GreyCat">GreyCat</a> 17:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Provided that each "move" is sourced. These sources just shouldn't mention a performer specifically performing the actions associated with a "move", but must describe it as a "move" or some variation thereof. As it is, unsourced ones should probably be removed until sourced. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 18:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is rather important than useless. It is true that there are some moves in rock and roll world, or music industry in general. However it is very possible that the names of the moves and the definition were not come from reliable sources.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I'm not very familiar with the field of Christian music. However, the problem with the Christian30 Covergirls doesn't seem to be with the subjects, but with Christian30. Since we don't have categories like Entertainment Weekly Covergirls or People Mag Covergirls, we obviously shouldn't have a category for an obscure site. But the girls themselves seem to be legitimate, and there doesn't seem to be a general movement to delete their articles. What C30 seems to be doing is like this: I start a site called "Celeb30," then go on Wikipedia and put celebs like Keira Kneightley into my "Celeb30 Covergirls" category. That just means that my category should be deleted, not that the Keira entry should be deleted as NN. In this regard, the very fact that Christian 30 is trying to "claim" her is actually an <i>endorsement</i> of her notability. I also note that in the Google search posted earlier is a 700 Club guest bio<a href="http://www.cbn.com/700club/Guests/Bios/Christine_Caine080205.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbn.com/700club/Guests/Bios/Christine_Caine080205.aspx" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> result. I don't see how Christian30 could fake that! The fact that the 700 Club would have her on as a guest argues for some level of notability. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 17:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Her bio gives the title of three books by her and publisher of one. I'm not sure she meets the author test or the music test, but when you start piling up a weak notability in field X, a weak in Y, etc... you get a weak result that is stronger than any individual field's results. Amazon shows one book about rank 200K, one about 400K, and a couple out of print in the 1.2 Mil and 2 Mil zones. Searching her name also brings up some CDs and some works by other authors. Looks notable for field, probably more so in Australia than the states. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:03, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

After all, it didn't turn up the Adelaide Advertiser result that Google News did. For instance, is this an up-to-the-minute database, and how far back does it go? If it was not instantly updated, it might not catch people whose notoriety was recent (though that doesn't seem to be the case here). Also, how broad is the selection of publications, particularly of Christian/evangelical ones? It is possible for someone to have notability in a subculture, but to be "flying under the radar" of mainstream outlets. I noted in my own remark that one thing that swayed me was information about being a guest on the 700 Club. However, her prominence even in evangelical circles appears modest. And it looks like the article will be deleted for copyvio anyway, unless somebody knows enough about her to rewrite it in a way that doesn't copyvio. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 21:36, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Weak keep</s></b>. I believe the term is used offhandedly in Jon Hein's book regarding Kramer, suggesting to me that it existed independently outside of Wikipedia. Someone would have to Nexis the work of most TV critics to really make sure. Also, I would really like it if Wikipediatrix didn't use the same abusive text for all these nominations. It leads me to further doubt her <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> (is it really necessary to stick your own vote in when you made the nomination? That makes it look personal). Although, I admit this is a bit more open-ended and could quarrel with some of the entries (I would never have described Sipowicz, ever, as a supporting character), that's what we have editors and talk pages for. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:09, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's everything abusive about it. Using both "contrived" and "made-up" is redundant and unnecessary as they both mean the same thing here (especially when they modify "neologism," which implies the same thing). The only reason to do it is when the writer or speaker feels one word does not adequately convey the depth of their negative feelings, cf. "international world Jewry", as used by antisemites.
<p>Further, reusing the same text for another nomination suggests some sort of grander agenda (which, to be fair, you've copped to elsewhere).</p>

<li><b>Neutral Comment</b>. In regards to Daniel Case's suggestion about a Nexis search, I was actually crazy enough to search for "fonz! syndrome" in the <i>News, All (English, Full Text)</i> database and found a single story, from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Orange_County_Register_03f1.html" title="The Orange County Register">The Orange County Register</a>. That 2000 story used the term "Fonzie Syndrome" to refer to actors who become identified to a single role that made them famous. I hope this helps. --- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">talk</a></sup> 01:22, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I, too, have tried to find secondary sources that describe the purported syndrome described by this article. Unfortunately, most (of the few) web pages on this subject are like <a href="http://alanphipps.blogspot.com/2006_04_16_alanphipps_archive.html" class="external text" title="http://alanphipps.blogspot.com/2006_04_16_alanphipps_archive.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> in that they <i>cite Wikipedia as their source</i>. (Others turn out to be simple non-GFDL-compliant mirrors of Wikipedia.) The article cites no sources. Editors have argued on <a href="../../../f/o/n/Talk%7EFonzie_syndrome_eab6.html" title="Talk:Fonzie syndrome">Talk:Fonzie syndrome</a> over what the syndrome actually is, but not a single source defining it has been cited on that talk page, and requests for sources for any of this have remained unanswered there. Editors have claimed that this concept existed prior to the Wikipiedia article, but no sources have been presented to demonstrate that. The <i>Orange County Register</i> story (Barry Koltnow. "Shaft, first and forever: Actor Richard Roundtree reprises the role that made him famous in the 1971 action film.", <i>Orange County Register</i>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">07-15</a>.) is, as <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> says, about <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Roundtree_5140.html" title="Richard Roundtree">Richard Roundtree</a> with the reference to Fonzie syndrome apparently being nothing more than about the strong association of certain actors with their most popular rôles. That is nothing like the syndrome discussed in this article.

<li>Well done with the research! That's the sort of use of Google (to locate actual source material, rather than merely to count hits) that we need editors to do more of. Looking at the sources, you appear to have a fairly verifiable definition of what a breakout character is (albeit that there's probably a better source available than that), and two verifiable instances of breakout characters. That addresses the concern of original research, since now editors and readers can confirm that the concept discussed by the (proposed rewritten) article exists outside of Wikipedia and has gained traction in the world at large. I therefore change to <b>rename and heavily rewrite</b> to be about <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakout_character.html" title="Breakout character">breakout characters</a>, as per the sources located (and whatever further sources editors locate). You'll have to refactor the introduction quite drastically; and you'll have to start the list of characters from scratch, but you have sources for three (Barney, Fonzie, and Clouseau) already. I strongly recommend requiring that every character in the list be accompanied by a source acknowledging xem to be a breakout character. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Having been asked to explain my vote, I observe on further inspection that his father (to which I thought the article should be redirected) doesn't actually <i>have</i> an article to redirect to, while the company mentioned -- which might have been the other logical target -- has only a one-line stub. This therefore appears to be the most detailed entry on any of the related subjects. I remain of the opinion that a single article on the Kelloggs would be preferable to several, but as we don't <i>have</i> several, there doesn't seem to be any such problem. I am therefore changing my vote to <b>keep</b> and expand, at least for now; perhaps the father could also be discussed in this context, to give a broader, more detailed article. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

The whole <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_England_1e1e.html" title="List of schools in England">List of schools in England</a> is very large and will only get larger as more schools are added. It needs to be split up and in some sort of way organised better than it curtrently is. I have found a list of all Local Education Authorities in Engalnd and have split that list up into the 9 regions. I have then looked at the combined list for all schools in England and pulled out the relevent ones for this region and tried to put some order to them (currently the list of schools in England uses various methods of listing withing the same list. With the break away articles I am trying to bring some order and regular structure to the lists so they are eaiser to follow and more useful. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 15:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> But not every school is worth an article on it's own. People have been debating this for a long time and I've seen many people argue on here that a simple list of schools for each LEA would be better than each school having an individual article. If schools are not notable enough have individual articles then the <i>category</i> function will not list them. While a school might not be notable in itself to warrant a whole article, the fact it exists is an important factor and very useful information. Getting hold of lists of schools is extremely hard (I had to spend ages when adding all the schools for one LEA to the main England list searching out the school names (that one LEA had over 100 schools, there are over 150 LEAs in Engalnd and I beleive over 20,000 schools)). I will admit though that the name is perhaps not the best name for the list, perhaps something illustrating that the 'East' is one of the English regions would be better. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 15:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Such lists do already exist for every US state. The other parts of the UK also have such lists (which I noticed were split out of a single article for the whole UK about a week or so ago. I'm sure other countries will also have simialr lists. But this idea of lists was a compromise I had heard talked about many times when reading the arguments for and against individual school articles. rather than a tiny stub article on every school, just giving the info of type of school, location, size etc, the list gives all schools in one area, (which is the way the list will likely be most useful) with this information in just one large article instead of 100 or 500 or 1000 separate articles. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 12:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You're right (it exists for Canada also, but only for certain provinces). But I've taken a look at the country listings and it's very inconsistent. I'm still of the mind that it's unmaintainable (and probably a lot of the other school lists are unmaintainable as well). I'm not picking on you personally - it's an incredible mess. (E.g. why are only international schools in Shanghai in the China list? Why isn't BC (a fairly large province) included in the Canadian schools? Why is the listing of schools in Quebec only art schools? What about school-like institutions? What constitutes a school?) --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can I ask those of you who have voted 'delete' to have a look at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Yorkshire_and_the_Humber_e9a0.html#Barnsley" title="List of schools in Yorkshire and the Humber">Yorkshire and Humber</a> region list to have and see the entry for the LEA of Barnsley there. That list contains the age range of the school, the type of school (eg connunity, voluntary aided, voluntary controlled and the place the school is situated and any specialist status the school has. I hope to also include the number on roll too when I can find them. The ultimate goal is to have the same on all lists for all schools in the country. Obviously this will take some time and needs the pages setting up and them worked on.

<li><b>Delete.</b> There is no article on Schools in the East or Schools in the East of England. Why not? Because it is not an encyclopedic topic... because there is nothing conceptually similar about them. They do not embody a characteristic style of architecture, or a particular educational philosophy, or a common history. They have no more in common with each other than "Schools whose names begin with the letter C." In general, if there is no article on X, there should not be an article entitled "list of X." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:11, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Then I suggest you nominate for deletion the 50 or so list articles for lists of schools in the US for each state. There are no articles to go along side them of exactly the same name either. Why is there no article of the same name? Becuase the article which would contain the information in an article called Schools in the East of England would actually be contained in an article either on a more specific area or a more general area and would also be entitled education, eg <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_England_c7c5.html" title="Education in England">Education in England</a> or Education in Cambridgshire. And you say there is nothing in common between schools in the article, well within each such section of the article there are similarities. For example, you see the structure in Buckinghamshire contains upper, middle and lower, where as Cambridgeshire has Primary and Secondary Schools. Some LEAs will show lots of Grammar Schools, others wil have none. Maybe Educational establishments in the East of England would be more suitable? Alos, I say again, the reason there is this article is becasue one single artilce for the whole of England or the UK would be too huge to keep as a single article. What is really silly here is that people on here have been arguing for a long time against individual article for all schools, with the suggestion articles on education within each LEA, which lists the schools and gives only the basic information, eg type of school, local, size etc, with only the most notable schools having their own articles. Here we have the startings of such a system and yet people are still not happy and want to get rid of even the most basic collective articles on the subject. I really don't understand it. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 12:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The whole education structure is mess I agree (probably because schools aren't encyclopedic per se), but even if one was to accept your reasoning that it should exist because it can't be found anywhere else, the list you've created is just slightly less unmanageable than a whole list of schools in England. It's already huge and I guess you've barely started. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 12:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd guess the current list here is about 1/3 to 1/2 complete. That is however only a rough estimate. Then there would be finding the information on each school which would make the article more worthwhile. But the current state is a start and there is a clear end point to it too, which, once reached, means the artciel would only need updating when a schools changes, eg closes, a new one opens, a specialis is added/changed etc. It's not really an open ended lsit. Large yes, but certainly it has it's boundaries. And I'd say it's a very useful list too. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 12:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Everson_e5bd.html" title="Michael Everson">Michael Everson</a> himself reverts any modification to the page from his own personal writing, be it addition or subtraction, even when factual information is added.

<li>Autobiography is highly frowned upon and sets a poor example to other editors</li>
<li>Since Everson himself states he is one of the numerous co-authors of the Unicode standard, maybe he should be merged with a small portion of a larger page listing all of the Unicode authors.</li>
<li>The links at the bottom of the page to evertype.com are a commercial site where he is advertising products, so by definition, him writing his own article about himself and his products on Wikipedia is nothing more than thinly veiled spam</li>
<li>This article is a fine example of what user pages are for, and all of its content should be on User:Evertype instead of here.</li>
<li>This article does not cite any sources that are not primary. He has a source cited of his own personal website and two links to interviews with himself.</li>
<li>While this article has been vandalized numerous times by trolls, it is also important to note that reverting vandalization is not justification of content and we can't turn a blind eye to the fact that Evertype has made a mockery of Wikipedia not only in his original violation by writing the article himself but through continued reversion to this vanity page to this very day. He is not remorseful in action despite numerous "apologies".</li>

He's worthy of maybe an extremely brief mention in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode.html" title="Unicode">Unicode</a> on what fonts he's made, but why does anybody at all need to know all that about him, why do we need a picture of him looking very color-coordinated in front of a landmark in Iran, or have a seperate page for him whatsoever?

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Michael Everson is a very well-known and influential expert (I am tempted to write "celebrity") in the world of coded character sets and typography. I have known about his work since the mid 1990s, i.e. long before Wikipedia was conceived. There can be no doubt that he clearly deserves an article in Wikipedia, an encyclopedia with a readership that has showen a particularly keen interest in matters related to computers. This includes important specialist technology leaders such as Michael Everson. I cannot find anything in the article that would seem out of place in a detailed encyclopedia article and I very much welcome Michael's contributions to keep the article accurate, authoritative and up-to-date. Most importantly, <b>I</b> found reading this article most interesting and insightful. Should it be deleted, I will not hesitate to rewrite from scratch an equivalent article, which is likely sound very similar. This 2nd vote for deletion is entirely unfunded and a petty and disappointing vendeta against a notable Wikipedia contributor. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkus_Kuhn_4bd1.html" title="User:Markus Kuhn">Markus Kuhn</a> 18:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your suggestion of rewriting the article yourself would, for once, actually be a step in the right direction to obeying the rules and making the article up to some sort of NPOV. If one is to base judgement of Everson's notability by the entry he wrote, he is like a God, the master of letters and linguistics who all but invented Unicode. Anybody who checks up on the facts finds this to be embellished and inflammatory. He won't link to Unicode.org because that website shows he is less of a contributor than at first it may appear, and joined the project at a later date than many. --<a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay_9627.html" title="User:SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay">SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay</a> 21:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your last remark indicates to me that you have very little first-hand familiarity with the history and evolution of both the Unicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 project, that you have not been for years on the relevant internal mailing lists and committee meetings, that you are not a regular reader of the countless very well researched documents that Michael Everson has contributed to the working groups in charge of ISO/IEC 10646 over the past decade, but that instead you are quick to form strong opinions after a very superficial search on a few web sites written for lay audience. With regard to rewriting the article from scratch, well, I am to a first approximation as lazy as anyone else and am certainly most happy to let the man himself provide the raw material to get started, which I am then most happy to trim and extend in scope and language as I see fit for an encyclopedia entry. Just like with any other Wikipedia article. Please work a bit harder on finding a pragmatic balance between treating the no-autobiography policy as a strict and irrevokable religious dogma, and the practicalities of getting high-quality and authoritative biographic information into Wikipedia. Did it never occur to you, that the vast majority of biographies out there of living people written by others are relying almost exclusively on raw information provided by the person concerned? Most dispicable of all, you have so far been only some anonymous coward.

The very fact that the page has not changed at all and is not *allowed to be changed at all* through you and Everson's (is he your friend or something?) reverts is further proof that this page does not belong on Wikipedia. It's a MySpace, and you know it. To answer your accusation that the VfD itself is somehow abusive, it's been over an entire year since the last time and a whole lot of people have tried to change this page and it just seems to be getting reverted continuously, even on the occasion something new is found out about him.

Unicode is a very big thing, if you/we/i try making only 100 existing characters or symbols on your/our own, only the drawing steps or to maintain proportion will make you realize how hard this is, let alone, all the other steps needed to finally make only 100 glyphs as a standard. After so many peer reviews, and no biased POV, this article is a very good collection of WP. Even if he has started or edited this article by himself, anyone was alaways/anytime allowed to rectify/correct, with a reference/proof, if there is/are any mistake.

<dd>My response to that: There's been a whole lot of talking about how notable he is. If there's so many institutions verifying all of this information how come links to unicode.org keep getting reverted, how come ON unicode.org he wrote his own bio as well, which echoes this article, and how come he only references his own website and interviews about himself? Could it be because if you research the issue, Everson is a much more minor contributor than you think he is to Unicode? Tell you what, why don't you give me some sort of number here on how much he's done vs. total number of typefaces and we'll see how notable he really is. --<a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay_9627.html" title="User:SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay">SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay</a> 06:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In 1986-1987, At Xerox, Huan-mei Liao, Nelson Ng, Dave Opstad, and Lee Collins begin work on a database to map the relationships between identical Japanese (JIS) and Chinese (simplified and traditional) characters for quickly building a font for extended Chinese characters. Xerox users (e.g. Nakajima of Toronto) were in fact using JIS to extend the small Chinese character set. This leads to a first discussion of Han Unification, the pros &amp; cons of which are written up by Eric Mader. At the same time at Apple, discussions of a universal character set are sparked by the Apple File Exchange development. Mark Davis begins Apple's participation in ANSI X3L2. From February 1989, working group meetings starts more frequently, starts the foundation of Unicode Consortium, (which formally founded in 1991). (At this point, most probably less than 25 active founding members). November 1988, Lee Collins begins building the Unicode Non-Han database and defining the initial repertoire, the first database for the Unicode names and mappings. The Unicode Standard was first published in October, 1991 (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-201-56788-1</a> ). Unicode 1.0.1 (Volume 2)(June, 1992)(<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-201-60845-6</a>). Unicode 1.1 (June 1993)(Previos 2 publications and Mark Davis' Unicode Technical Report #4:The Unicode Standard, Version 1.1) is actually known as real Unicode. UTF-8 borned in 1992. Even in June 1994, Michael Everson was Irish representative (official member CEN/TC304 and ISO/JTC1/SC2/WG3). I've found Michael Everson's papers (Unicode related N956 at JTC1-SC2-WG2 archive) from March, 1994. Michael Everson released "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everson_Mono_Unicode_5d3d.html" title="Everson Mono Unicode">Everson Mono Unicode</a>" font in 1995, After more than a year in development. Which is world's 3rd Unicode font. Before him, first was Charles Bigelow &amp; Kris Holmes' "<a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucida_Sans_Unicode_1e4a.html" title="Lucida Sans Unicode">Lucida Sans Unicode</a>" font in 1993 (Shipped in Win NT 3.1). Second was, "Unihan" font by Ross Paterson in 1993. UTF-8 was formally adopted in ISO 10646 in 1996. Unicode 2.0 (August 1996)(ISBN: 0201483459 . 9 major authors). Unicode 2.1.2(May, 1998. Prev 3 publication and paper of Lisa Moore, Unicode Technical Report #8, The Unicode Standard, Version 2.1). Unicode 3.0(Sept, 1999, published in 2000. <a href="http://www.unicode.org/book/u2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/book/u2.html" rel="nofollow">ISBN 0-201-61633-5</a>). Since 2000 (from the version 3.0), He is one of the Co-author of publications of Unicode Standards, out of total 12 (principal) authors (Joan Aliprand, Julie Allen, Joe Becker, Mark Davis, Michael Everson, Asmus Freytag, John Jenkins, Mike Ksar, Rick McGowan, Lisa Moore, Michel Suignard, and Ken Whistler). Unicode standard is now going under very important changes (ie <a href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/index.html" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a>) to enhance the standard for applied fields, based on the papers, where Michael Everson is one of the co-author, out of total three authors.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>complete rewrite</b> This article, as is, is an autobiography, and a rather unverifiable and boastful one.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I made the AfD. Vanity, redundancy, unencyclopedic. I'm sure Unicode is wonderful but Everson is not notable enough to warrant a seperate page. He is one of 12 primary co-authors to unicode, therefore hardly deserving an individual page. (Unicode 3.0 (Sept, 1999, published in 2000. <a href="http://www.unicode.org/book/u2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/book/u2.html" rel="nofollow">ISBN 0-201-61633-5</a>)) Delete or merge to Unicode. As a matter of fact, if you look in the Acknowledgements section of that book, (it's a PDF) you will find he is the 6th out of 12 listed and there is a lot less about him than some of the other contributors. Wow! This is a very revealing book. Ken Whistler is listed as the "Driving force behind the Unicode project" (he has no Wikipedia article) and several others as well that are acknowledged for doing more than he has done. --<a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay_9627.html" title="User:SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay">SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay</a> 18:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prod removed by author.

After prod removed, another sentence was added: "(Though an analogy will avialable in hard-copy in January 2007)." I'm not sure what to make of that, but, at best, it's claiming it will be notable at a later date, and WP is not a crystal ball.

That that is how the material should be apportioned among the article titles is obviously required by simple common sense. So a question arises: Should this AFD tag be put on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>? I've only superficially glanced at the material; it appears to be one of those things used in statistics applied to psychology that are better-known among statisticians in psychology departments than anyone else.

<li><b>Confused issue</b> Hmm - I think that has somewhat muddied the waters, and I am not sure that moving an article in the middle of an AfD discussion was best thing to do. The material which I think is utter gobble-de-gook, and which caused the original AfD is now at: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>. I am a reasonably competent mathematician, and have taught statistics for many years, but this article seems to be almost meaningless pseudo-maths, and has already been described by other editors of maths articles as "whacky" and "... like abracadabra ... ". What is the next step? should I tag <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a> as AfD? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmath789_8910.html" title="User:Madmath789">Madmath789</a> 14:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> probably simplest to withdraw this AfD and start a new one for <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>. The two current votes could be copied across. I generally agrees with Hardy that <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity.html" title="Homogeneity">Homogeneity</a> should be a disambig page or a redirect to one. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 15:50, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Week keep</b> and extensive rewrite. Basically it looks like there is not much stats going on here. We have a set of fairly standard correlation matricies correlating the variables p,q,r. The authors have then taken examples of a few special cases where there is a logical relation between the variables, say p implies q and given examples of the resulting correlation matricies. The illustrations don't really illustrate the mathematics well. Some of the matricies look suspect, no examples of real data are given, just synthetic data, giving 0 for some correlation coefficients where you would really expect some small non zero numbers for real data.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Walk into a math library, pick up a journal of a branch you do not specialize in, and it is likely (very) to look like gobbledygook. Ditto for electrical engineering, chemistry, or virology. The appearance of gobbledygook to a non-specialist should not be a criterion for deletion. The journals and authors cited are certainly not made up (Chronbach! He wrote the book used in a tests and measurements book I had decades ago.) This article appears to be perhaps written by an expert in a subfield. Meta-analysys is real. However, the article is way less approachable than the article on, say analysis of variance, which is far less technical but of far greater application. I agre one can have more than a nodding acquaintance with stats, read the article, and still not be sure what it is about. More definition and some simple explanations would be good.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:15, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per arguments made by Edison, immediately above. In fact, when I go into a math library, I make a point of picking up a journal in an area I do not specialize in, and I make a concerted effort to read and understand it. And, amazingly, I often can understand it, because it is usually well-written. If the topic is particularly difficult, good articles do provide overview sketches for the required background. The problem with this article is not that it deals with a difficult, abstract topic, but rather that it is so poorly written, that one cannot make sense out of it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 18:03, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The entirety of the page is just a summary of the movie, and includes some parts that the writer aparrently made up, i.e. the Beast's human name. The page is therefore redundant and pointless, and contains some bad information. EDIT-- Since my initial complaint was lodged, the article has been redone to include her other appearances. It's fine now, save that there's a very long synopsis of one movie, and "Prince Adam" is not mentioned in the movie or its screenplay. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edmundog (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edmundog_4a77.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edmundog">contribs</a>) 16:40, 20 Jul 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are countless articles on Wikipedia about fictional characters whose storylines are clearly explained in the article about the story in which they appeared. The <b>Belle page</b> is no different. And I would never, I mean <b>NEVER</b> make things up about anyone. I said Beast's name is Adam because I have seen it stated on the IMDb.</li>

<p>This one's a borderline case of notability, which why I've AFD'd it instead of simply asking for a speedy deletion. Most notable clain he has is being a <i>first cousin</i> to one of the regicides of Charles I. A secondary claim of notability is being a great-great-great-grandfather of Thomas Jefferson. While we do have articles of relatives of some notable people, the relationships here are so remote that I can't see any reason to keep this article unless Wikipedia were a genealogical database, which it is not. <b>Delete</b> <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caerwhine</small></a> 17:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please re-read my comments. The <i>story</i> is trivial, not the <i>publication</i>. They're articles on a pizza joint that owns a conversation piece, not articles on a "notable establishment".

<li>If you actually look at the articles which are cited, you'll realize this is more than just a "pizza joint." This establishment is a local fixture.

<li>Definite keep on the Australian franchise chain, not sure about the American chain but it seems to have operated in a large area for quite a while, and the fact that it is bankrupt now does not mean it does not deserve an article. Overall possibly actually a <b>dual renaming</b> to reflect the different geographic areas with dab statements on the top of each article. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 12:06, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It does apepar to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for the first use. My vote is to move the current article to Pizza Haven (Australia) and convert the current name to a dab. Besides the second chain listed, there is at least one other in Canada. There could be more. So with a common name a dab would be best in my opinion. The US chain does not appear encylopedic so a brief summary in the dab article would suffice, and that's another reason for the dab at the main name space. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 21:17, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm inclined to suggest delete per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (article cites itself?!). However, some sources do seem to be provided ... but I honestly can't follow what this article is claiming and how these sources seem to apply. Though sources are cited, I can't make heads or tails out of them (or the article) enough to verify anything. This may be a notable topic in Islamic tradition. However the article, as written, requires a massive cleanup. I would not oppose the article being deleted so something new (and more clearly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourced</a>) could replace it.

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the oldest online gay community websites in the UK. Any particular reason Artw is on this crusade against homosexuality-related articles? 217.196.231.46 20:42, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. OUTeverywhere is the most significant (I would guess the largest in membership) website of its kind in Britain, if not worldwide, ie a consciously non-sexual, non-commercial gay and lesbian online community.

<li><b>Neutral</b> OUTeverywhere does not meet the notability requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I am unsure that this is sufficient for deletion on websites that cater for minority groups due to their nature, but consistency should be maintained with the Thingbox article. Additionally, OUT is also a fully commercial site (it is no longer non-commercial) and this article could be considered advertising if it fails to meet notability requirements. <a href="../../../t/e/p/User%7ETeppic74_a359.html" title="User:Teppic74">Teppic74</a> 21:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I think it has achieved some cultural relevance and thus notability: some fringe plays have references it (directly or indirectly) and it has achieved some notoriety/cultural relevance.

<li><b><s>Conditional neutral(???)</s></b> If the site was founded as long ago as 1995 and that can be documented, that's somewhat notable in its own right for this type of site. The web was just barely starting to take off around then. I don't have an exact sense of those times but many things were being done that were quite new, and thus could be thought of as pioneering. Documentation added so far (about just about everything) is quite skimpy however; self-released press announcements aren't <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 23:44, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Change vote to <b>delete</b>. On further research there was more happening by 1995 than I realized. Salon.com and Amazon.com both launched that year, and Amazon had VC funding in 1994.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: How many gay social networking websites are there that enable gay people to meet away from the scene and without the usual sex obsession of gay meetup websites? One. It was also the first gay social website in the UK. Whether that happened in 1993, 1995 or 2001 is less relevant than the fact it was the first. OUTeverywhere publishes some of its media coverage. See these: Independently written and edited interview <a href="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/attitudejanuary2006.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/attitudejanuary2006.jpg" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitude_%28Magazine%29_9ce3.html" title="Attitude (Magazine)">Attitude (Magazine)</a>, major page feature <a href="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/pinkpaper28april2005.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/pinkpaper28april2005.jpg" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> in the UK's gay newspaper Pink Paper, and OUTeverywhere is referenced by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29_f6cd.html" title="The Sun (newspaper)">The Sun (newspaper)</a>'s agony aunt Dear Deidre <a href="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/thesun28dec2005.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/thesun28dec2005.jpg" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> in referring people to good organisations to help with 'coming out' support. 217.36.233.38 08:42, 25 July 2006 (UTC) DG</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: OUT is a commercial website where paying members can meet each other. The circumstances (sex-related or not) don't make it notable, as with the thingbox site. Minor coverage in the gay press or references to the URL don't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirements. 84.92.141.190 13:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I'd not read "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself... includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations." to exclude gay press or other UK-wide (in circulation) media. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottkeir_a23e.html" title="User:Scottkeir">Scottkeir</a> 00:32, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Even as a member of this website, I think this entry should be deleted, as the website should be treated in the same way as other community websites (e.g. the deletion of 'Thingbox', which triggered this discussion).</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The assessment of OUTeverywhere's encyclopedic entry on Wikipedia should be judged on its own merits, on facts and independent research, and not a 'battle' by users of either OUTeverywhere or Thingbox (which includes many disgruntled ex-OUTeverywhere users). There are numerous commercial websites described on Wikipedia with a notable history and/or heavy contribution to social networking. 200,000 people (mainly gay/lesbian/bi, mainly UK) have so far signed up to OUTeverywhere in its 11 year history; this can be verified by signing up and checking account numbers. 82.68.195.78 08:44, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem with moving it back agin is because of the content. Montgomery Burns' state of mind was created from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Burns_2d82.html" title="Montgomery Burns">Montgomery Burns</a> because this content was too unwieldly, and made the main article unreadable. But splitting off the minute trivial detail into a separate article was probably the wrong approach. What is really needed is some serious copy-editting to boil it down to its essence, and remove the list of references to all the instances of his memory lapses. The section in the main article has achived this, and to merge all of this trivia back into main article would degrade the quality improvement. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 14:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The subject is notable in the history of physical game media - remember when <i>FF VII</i> was praised for having so much content it <i>needed</i> 3 discs?. With this platform the opinion generally changed. Multi-disc gaming on the PC was notable at one point, but after a few years virtually every game used multiple discs so it wasn't really notable anymore (the same thing is happening to DVD-ROM). But in the history of the GameCube it is still notable given the system's eventual death, and the specialized nature of the titles, usually third-party PS2/Xbox games that were ported to the Cube or particularly expansive games designed for the Cube, like <i>Killer7</i> or <i>Tales of Symphonia</i>. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 22:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That assumes that every 2-disc GC game will itself be notable enough to cover in Wikipedia. So far, every game but one has its own page, so I suppose it may be true when the list is complete. However, it is similar to my rationale for keeping <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_PlayStation_2_CD-ROM_games_fe07.html" title="List of PlayStation 2 CD-ROM games">List of PlayStation 2 CD-ROM games</a>, if turns out there are a significant number of non-notable titles, a Category wouldn't suffice.. If it turns out every 2-disc game does have an entry, then I'd easily support deletion of this, but it's a little too early to tell. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 04:45, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Gaydar article provides useful and reasonably balanced information on a prominent international website for the gay community that has played a significant role in changing the courtship mechanism over the past 8–10 years. The article concerns not just the website, but this social environment. The article has potential for expansion. It is no mere promotion for the website and, indeed, contains criticisms of the site.

<p>This page should be deleted for a number of reasons. First and foremost, he is non-notable. His name reveals only about 560 google hits, most prominent of which are wikipedia or wikipedia related pages (such as Answers.com), and webpages hawking his stuff. Secondly, the article suffers from being autobiographical, in that almost all of the article was written by Mr. Bugbee and his wife. Furthermore, the vast majority of claims in the article are subjective and completely unsourced. In short, the article is a messy, largely unverified biography about a non-notable individual that fails the criteria for inclusion. Edit: All of sources are either a)tiny webzines, b) concerning a local event or c) mention the subject only in passing. <a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetruncate_24c6.html" title="User:Detruncate">Detruncate</a> 20:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- 360 unique hits, then. Well, a user with no previous edits by the name "Amy bugbee" and another with the name "Shane Bugbee" edited the article several times. The creator of the article user "Cyril Grey" created about 5 longish articles out of whole cloth. The first one wasShane Bugbee, and all the others were subjects that had links to Shane Bugbee, and all lacked proper citation. Given that you're an inclusionist you will presumably be in favor of keeping everything, regardless of guidelines such as notability, which is the one that I'm primarily concerned with.

<li>Please refer to the definition of <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> - finding fault with my personal viewpoints is irrelevant to our discussion on the merits of this article. Please cite the edits in question, though there is still no proof that the editors you speak of are in fact the subject or his spouse. It is an assumption, even if said editors declared themselves to be the subject or his spouse on their talk pages. Finally, there is still the assertion in the article and the reliable sources, which is more than enough to establish notability, regardless of whether or not the article's subject or his spouse edited the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Publishing <b>ANSWER ME #4</b> is justification enough. That zine was polarizing and widely discussed. Label the article as self promotion, but keep it.<a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhosts%26empties_0e07.html" title="User:Ghosts&amp;empties">Ghosts&amp;empties</a> 03:53, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>- To clarify, Bugbee published a reprint of ANSWER Me! #4 seven years after the original edition—the original edition is the one that caused all the controversy. Nearly all of the polarization and discussion occurred long before Bugbee's reprint. Bugbee had no hand in the magazine's creation. A review of all his "accomplishments" would show an identical pattern—attaching himself to noteworthy events or people while creating nothing of note himself. This, I believe, is a crucial distinction. Shawarma Chondroitin 13:51, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. What stands out among all of this is the fact that Bugbee himself—as a creator—has produced nothing notable or lasting. He hasn't written anything or filmed anything or recorded anything of note—absolutely nothing. Again and again, he's merely attached himself to notable people. If Forrest Gump is notable merely by squeezing himself into a photo op with LBJ, then I suppose Bugbee is notable. Otherwise, he very clearly isn't. Again, the Google search of his name (as a phrase) yielded only 502 hits. Look closely at the first few pages of hits—every one of them is linked to a site which Bugbee hosts. If that's not evidence enough that he needs to be deleted, I'm not sure what is. Look closely also at early versions of this page—they included an ad for, of all things, a soda-pop company which Bugbee apparently owns. That seems like conclusive evidence that he wrote his own profile. Shawarma Chondroitin 13:18, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nearly all of the edits involve typos, the idea that this page was created by the subject as self-promotion (following the links, this seems highly plausible), and the topic of the subject's notability/obscurity. I was considering a vote for inclusion until the subject compromised his own credibility with the above statement. I must now vote to delete. Adam Burton 10:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's pretty telling that he refers to this <i>article</i> as his "<i>profile</i>" — as if Wikipedia were some kind of Myspace-like site.

Taken with the things others have pointed out about the questionability of any involvement at all in a lot of his purported accomplishments, it would take a lot to convince me that this person is notable enough to warrant a biographical article. --<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">Ptkfgs</a> 19:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Subject links to an unreleased book as evidence of his notability. The page he links to lists a book which also touts names such as John Aes-Nihil, Fred Berger, Jonathan Haynes, Stanton Lavey, Jonathan Shaw, Nick Bougas, and Shaun Partridge. What do they all have in common? None of them have a wikipedia profile. Adam Burton 10:34, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. So "Shane Bugbee" has appeared to declare himself notable. Well, this is what his detractors have been saying all along--his wikipedia page is a vanity page, and it seems obvious from a review of the evidence that he was the one who created it. I have never heard of this person until now, although he surrounds himself with famous and/or notorious people. I believe his page violates the spirit of Wikipedia. 63.242.155.58 13:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Entire profile appears to have been written by Shane Bugbee as self-promotion. I agree with prior opinions stating that surrounding oneself with notable people does not make oneself noteworthy, unless one creates something noteworthy themselves. A scan of Bugbee's "creative output" reveals no products/artifacts that have sold remotely well or been remotely successful or noteworthy. A small mention in some East Coast free weekly "upcoming events" column seems like little more than a reworded press release. If that alone made someone noteworthy, every indie rock band on the planet would deserve a wikipedia profile. 68.80.86.90 20:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I dislike the direction this AfD is taking. I suspect sockpuppets are at work and there are personal agendas on both sides.

<li><b>Comment</b> Inevitably, dismissing, debunking, and deflating the notability of someone who is attempting to be notable will seem somewhat personal and quite possibly harsh. However I agree in that we should strive to be civil, but also honest. The exact problem we have here is that this IS the community, or at least all of the community who cares about this article, so when you're referring to the community I'm not sure what you mean. Don't bandy about accusations of sock puppetry without any evidence, though. Just because a user is new to wikipedia does not mean that a) their opinions and arguments are invalid or b) they are a sock puppet. <a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetruncate_24c6.html" title="User:Detruncate">Detruncate</a> 03:50, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This dud is non-notable and his book on Gacy was self-published. Its not like a major publisher produced it 617USA</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> A search of "A Question of Doubt" reveals it was published in New York in 1991. Bugbee is not listed as publisher or co-author. In fact, the only links I could uncover which associate Bugbee with the book are a scant handful where Bugbee himself is claiming this. It's possible he reprinted the book, but it seems as if he's either fabricating or heavily embellishing the facts about exactly who co-wrote the book with Gacy. 68.80.86.90 14:15, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>Comment</i> The book "A Question of Doubt" is listed as being published by "Craig Bowley Consultants." A search of the phrase "Craig Bowley" alongside the word "Bugbee" yielded zero hits. 68.80.86.90 14:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Don't you ever get tired of constantly making things up to try to *win* your point? The point isn't whether "most" of the diaries are x y or z. The point is that *some* of what she says, is very relevant to the history of this region. So stop trying to spin this discussion by masking what's really going on here. You refuse to even read the diaries to see what they say, but suddenly you're an expert on them? And you constantly mischaracterize what's in the diaries, in the Afd, in the Review, and now here. Anyone who reads them can see the value of the source. And if she is valuable as a source, then she needs an article to explain WHO she was. That's pretty simple. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 21:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Undent. Oh I understand it quite clearly, as it's been discussed ad absurdum in these multiple attempts to wipe our history out. <i>Clearview, founders and pioneers</i>, Frances Smith, 1982. John Brown &amp; Co. Everett. states&#160;:" Miss Ellis' diaries, should they ever be completely published promise to be a significant source for the history of the Pacific Northwest, she having come here in its infancy in 1883 and lived here her entire life. I here give a brief biography and a few pages of some example stories that were gleaned from just a few of her journals, and proofread by my publisher, but space cannot allow me to publish more". <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 21:48, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom (and nearly a speedy as an attempt to re-create a deleted article). I recall that past commentors had some serious concerns about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>. I also think it may be difficult to verify some of the claims in the article. One such claim is that Ellis is "one of" or "the only" narrative, first-person sources of information for the Pacific Northwest. For example, one would have to comb the Hudson Bay Co. archives, various university libraries, and state and provincial archives to ensure that there are no such other first person accounts of life in what is now Washington and B.C. for this time period. I am also a bit concerned because the creator of this article verges on <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a> (as can be seen in this discussion) and acts in a manner that is <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">overly possessive</a>. That, however, is not a reason for deletion, it's just a concern about the constant appearance and disappearance of this article.

<li>Logically, if Ellis is is "'one of'" or 'the only' narrative, first-person sources of information for the Pacific Northwest", historians covering the time and area should be leaning heavily on her material for their research -- yet mention of her seems notable by its complete absence from Google Books, Google Scholar, or even Worldcat. <b>Delete</b> on verifiability grounds and on making a suspect claim about her uniqueness as a diarist. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:24, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your argument fails logic. This source has not been easily available for historians to consult. The only persons who have consulted the works are the sources I cited, whose works are local in scope, and limited in copies (to my knowledge at least).

Although the article claims that she was a first-person source for "many newsworthy events," the article doesn't mention a single "newsworthy event," except perhaps claiming to have met Chief Joseph. All I see are lists of moves from town to town, jobs she took, and comments on her family members. Where are all these events she is supposed to have witnessed? --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 04:00, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well if these rambunctious editors would relax, you'd get a chance to see them. As it is, they keep deleting the article *as I am creating it*. It's going to be hard to prove notability, if every time I find another notable thing the article gets deleted again. And she wasn't a girl number one, and I think watching Tarkio get created from nothing is notable, since there is *no* other narrative source which claims that for one thing. That isn't the sole notable thing, but again this comment proves another editor refuses to actually read the diaries. Editors who vote, and yet refuse to acquaint themselves with the situation shouldn't be counted. Just like the one who claim "not verifiable" and yet refuse to attempt to verify. Verifiability is not whether it's *easy*, its whether its *possible* and Kittie passes that test with flying colors. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 04:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>, having interviews with people is great, and something you'd expect any reasonable gaming site to have, but it's just not useful to list every site here that has ever interviewed someone notable.

<dd>The assertion that <i>"this site is very relevant to the gaming community"</i> may be true, however that does not necessarily mean it is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia. Please read the criteria <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">here</a> for the "ground rules" used by WP editors to determine the notability of a website. Membership and Alexa rank are not official criteria, but they can be helpful when there are no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> references. For example, if and when the site has multiple reviews published in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable and reputable sources</a>, then it should pass muster here. Until then, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an internet guide, nor is it a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a>. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWine_Guy_7420.html" title="User:Wine Guy"><font color="#000080"><b>Wine Guy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWine_Guy_c683.html" title="User talk:Wine Guy"><font color="#000000"><small>Talk</small></font></a> 19:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

I can understand you saying that our sight is non-notable, it is very new, and has not had time to grow, however information and reviews of games are immediate things, simply created after a game is created, how can these be considered non-notable? If there is some guidlines for the editing or removal of external links to further information on a subject, please post a link to such guidlines, if there is not, should this user be reported for outright vandalism?

<dd>Hi there. Wikipedia accepts contributions from every user, however some do not fit Wikipedia. Imagine if people adds every single review from every single site about a game. <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Occasionally_acceptable_links" title="Wikipedia:External links">The first External link style guide</a> about occasionally acceptable states that, <i>for albums, movies, books: one or two links to professional reviews which express some sort of general sentiment.</i> That is the closest for games, it is currently being discussed if general reviews should be accepted. Having reviews from <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpot_fd17.html" title="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamespy.html" title="Gamespy">Gamespy</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurogamer.html" title="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="../../../1/u/p/1UP.com_c6a3.html" title="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> and meta reviews like <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameRankings_5585.html" title="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metacritic.html" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, having the review of a non notable site with a forum of around 200 members and virtually no Alexa rank is not acceptable. Also, massively adding hyperlinks without discussing them in the talk page of the articles to see if there is consensus for adding them can be considered <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a>.

<dd>Maybe I need to clarify that, when we talk about Non notable, we are referring to Wikipedia standards like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which may or may not acknowledge other kind of notability. In example, the daughter of an actress may be notable by public standard, but an article about a newly born baby, unless inheriting a notability title like Count or Duke, is usually considered non notable. It is not an offensive term, but people new to Wikipedia may find it not appropriated. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 06:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: So by your own words, games that have no listed reviews would be fine to add our reviews to, that is funny, because the majority of the games to which I added reviews did not already have them. Also I find that notable intellectual work, such as reviews and along with other things, does not have to be created from something, someone, or someplace in and of itself notable, in order to have reference to a community or the world. I do not think any kind of content should be decided to be non-notable, simply because where it came from is not-notable. Using your own example, that would be like calling a book or some other form of intellectual property non-notable simply because it came from a non-notable person, while calling another book or work of intellectual property notable simply because it came from a notable person. I would equate judging our reviews of games as non-notable simply becuase our site is considered by <b>YOU</b> to be non-notable to be judging a book by the way you, personally, see the cover....MasterIkrit 09:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never said that. I was referring to the fact that, existing IGN, GameSpot, Gamespy, Eurogamer, etc, sites with a long life and proved reliability, there is little need of new reviewers.

<li><b>Delete</b> because it's only notable to members of this club. Also, as the nominator says, it isn't verified and is vanity.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This organization is described in print in the U of T student handbook and in at least one of the U of T student newspapers, so ample verification material exists. There's probably administrative paperwork about them kicking around somewhere also (there was a crackdown on the group in the late 1980s/early 1990s, which would have left a paper trail). The difficulty (for the Wikipedia article) is that this paper trail is literally on paper, and so not web-accessible. For relevance/notability, per description on <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrute_Force_Committee_83ce.html" title="Talk:Brute Force Committee">Talk:Brute Force Committee</a>, this group is notable to everyone in Engineering at U of T (kind of hard to miss the cannon being fired on random days, or miss the group's participation in orientation), and their activities (though likely not detailed background) are known to other groups both on- and off-campus.

<li><b>Comment</b>. While information exists on BFC, there's not much there other than "it exists" and "it pranks other schools" (maybe even not that much). It's not even that the paper trail is "on paper" - you'd probably need some sort of privileged access to view it as well, since it has to do with University policies. Anyways, it falls under <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">student organizations</a> and I'm not sure it's notable with that criteria anymore. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 05:16, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've checked <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, and it looks like most or all of the items mentioned would be acceptable as _sources_. Establishment of notability would require a publication that was neither affiliated with the BFC nor a student newspaper to mention the BfC, which is a more difficult test (though I'm pretty sure they'd show up in newspaper archives from the timespan around the crackdown, I'd certainly have a hard time citing one without spending a very large amount of time in a library). That having been said, neither <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> nor <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is actually a policy (though <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> may eventually become one in the future). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 06:13, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know enough about the subject to cast an informed vote either way, however if kept the title of the article needs to be changed, as the term "Obscure" is a POV statement in this context.

How does one decide what is "obscure" or "obsure enough" to make the list. There could be literally thousands of random factoids that could be included here.

How does this list not turn into <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>? <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 17:08, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the article's creator, I'd like to make a case for it. I've heard all kinds of bizarre statistics and supposedly superlative occurrences in baseball, and I was thinking that it would be fun to see a list of them. It seems like perfect trivia for a list page. To respond to a couple points raised: First, I do think the article can be found via the categories listed at the bottom of the article. In particular, somebody seeing what baseball lists are contained in Wikipedia might be intrigued enough to click on it. Second, "obscure" is a somewhat subjective term, but baseball is so over-statistified that there will be clear cases of obscurity. Every pitcher or hitter has a stat sheet with categories you'd expect to find, i.e., <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_Run_Average_b497.html" title="Earned Run Average">ERA</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_%28baseball%29.html" title="Triple (baseball)">triples</a>, <a href="../../../r/b/i/RBI_b2ca.html" title="RBI">RBI</a>, etc. The two examples I cited would clearly never be found on a player's permanent record, and likely were only discovered by sports commentators who have full use of highly specialized record-searching software. I would say they are obscure almost by definition. Third, as a couple users pointed out, the list will grow. I was only able to think of two examples offhand, but this is something that will come up semi-regularly. Baseball more than any other sport obsesses about statistics. As a result, some pretty bizarre stats appear fairly regularly. However, people who follow baseball are interested in them in spite of their obscurity. I would say this legitimizes a Wikipedia list on the topic. Finally, I did make a point to properly cite the examples I came up with, and would expect future entries to do the same. Obscure statistics can usually be traced back to articles or sports punditry, so this list can grow legitimately. If the worst that you can say about this article is that it looks "a bit silly," you're falling prey to the same subjectivity you accuse the article of containing. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkyfry_2cab.html" title="User:Sparkyfry">Sparkyfry</a> 17:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, however I find the inclusion of real-life people a bit problematic since this list is supposed to be about "characters". Therefore the Real World fellow and Ryan White should be removed from the list since neither are fictional characters by any means. This could probably stand to have a bit of an introduction added to address the portrayal of HIV+ characters. And while it isn't HIV, it might not hurt to make a reference to <a href="../../../t/27/p/T%27Pol_7e66.html" title="T'Pol">T'Pol</a> from Star Trek, who was given an HIV-like condition (later cured) in <i>Enterprise</i> as an intentional metaphor for HIV.

<li>The list is entirely unmaintainable - I note that all of the TV shows are western in origin. What about Asia and Africa??? There <i>must</i> have been many TV shows with many characters who are HIV+.</li>
<li>Is it not just a little presumptive that all characters who don't mention that they're HIV+ aren't???? Maybe the characters don't feel comfortable telling their workmates or friends - just like in real life.</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Maybe it should be changed to "List of fictional characters with HIV/AIDS".

The article is woefully light on material and the only two notable things are that he's the president of the International High IQ Society and an author of puzzle books, both of which are already mentioned on the IHIQS Wiki entry.

<li><b>Comment</b> I was the original AFD nominator, I did so because I inquired about his notability months ago and never received a response. As far as I can tell he still fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (ie: playing pro). The referenced article about the Italian team states <i>"Melchionni said he expects to play for Benetton but has not yet signed the contract."</i> and he is not listed in the roster at said team's <a href="http://www.benettonbasket.it/" class="external text" title="http://www.benettonbasket.it/" rel="nofollow">website</a>. If he is actually signed and with the team, than I think it should be mentioned in the article. With that said, I'm staying neutral in this AFD as I have no particular motive to get this deleted. I'd be content to wait until the beginning of the Italian basket season and see if he is playing. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 13:26, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough, questioning what does and does not belong here is healthy and makes for the best possible set of articles which is what we all want. Doing it twice in the span of a couple weeks does not sit well with me however. (I know you personally did not do this, just a general comment regarding this second nomination) My feeling is that a former captain of one of the top teams in collegiate sports <a href="http://scoreboards.aol.com/basketball/ncaab/team/duke/34593/team_news.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://scoreboards.aol.com/basketball/ncaab/team/duke/34593/team_news.aspx" rel="nofollow">[84]</a> would make someone pretty notable. In addition the article linked above states that Benetton offered him a contract, and he expects to sign it. I can't imagine a senario where he would not be playing for them in the upcoming season, but as you say maybe we can just wait a few months. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 17:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Borderline college players who get a contract offer from Europe tend to wait a while to be sure that an NBA team doesn't pick them up as a free agent. That's not very likely to happen in his case, so signing with Benetton is a formality. He'll be playing pro on one of the best European teams unless he gets a better offer. BTW, as above, I also question why this was AfD'd again so soon. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWine_Guy_7420.html" title="User:Wine Guy"><font color="#000080"><b>Wine Guy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWine_Guy_c683.html" title="User talk:Wine Guy"><font color="#000000"><small>Talk</small></font></a> 06:44, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
