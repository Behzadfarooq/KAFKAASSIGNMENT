<ul>
<li><i>A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide. Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used. We aren't teaching people how to talk like a Cockney chimney-sweep. However, it may be important in the context of an encyclopedia article to describe just how a word is used in order to distinguish among similar, easily confused ideas, as in nation or freedom. In some special cases an article about an essential piece of slang may be appropriate. For a wiki that is a dictionary, visit our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The list currently has approximately 1462 entries with new words being added every day. Of those, only about 108 <s>(0.7%)</s> (7.6%) are sourced, mostly from a few old slang dictionaries and one unreferenced website. This article is inherently unverifiable, because it includes contemporary street slang and foreign words that are not included in any reliable sources, With no modern sources available it is impossible to be sure that the descriptions of usage are correct and NPOV. Many, if not most, entries are derived from original research, and some are possibly made-up by users, or at least neologisms. So it irredeemably violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. And the article itself is a direct contradiction to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>.</p>
<p>For those who vote to "Keep" this article I'd ask them to try to answer these questions: "How can we source this?" and "How many of the entries will you take responsibility for sourcing?" -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 05:29, 17 March 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 05:29, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I note that the prior AfDs had people voting to keep but wanting the article sourced, which has not been addressed. A number of people voted to keep because the list is "useful," but without it being sourced, it simply is not useful or reliable.

<p><b>Keep</b> Though proper citation may be difficult, the article should be kept. Fans of linguistics/etymology will probably agree. Some of these words are not even offensive/used any more("Tojo", "3/5er"), but the history of how and why they came into use is still important/interesting. If the article is deleted, consider moving these historical entries someplace else or creating new entries for them. Also, how important are credible sources for <i>slang</i>, the origins of which cannot always be easily traced? --Soulburglar 05:24, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> I have been working on this article for months, adding citations from printed dictionaries because Will Beback asked me to. Right now, there are about 115 citations in the article, and that number is growing rapidly.
<p>This list is a remarkable work, comprising over 1400 entries written since June 2003. Deleting them will do more harm than good, possibly creating hundreds of disgruntled vandals and sowing ill will throughout the world. It would also be deleting possibly the most comprehensive and up-to-date list of ethnic slurs available. Further, it sets a bad precedent, threatening to change Wikipedia from the largest encyclopedia ever written into one of the smallest. The current insistence on verifiability was instituted <i>after</i> many of these definitions were written. This discourages others from writing articles in the future for fear that a future policy will result in their contributions being deleted.</p>
<p>If anyone here thinks the list should be in Wiktionary, they should move it there before nominating it for deletion. I would be much less reluctant to support this deletion if these entries were in Wiktionary, formatted (theirs is much more complex than our own), and accepted by the prudish administrators there. I certainly don’t mind that it is on Wikipedia right now, though, because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. The word <i>encyclopedia</i> comes from the Greek words <i>enkyklios paideia,</i> meaning "general education," or "well-rounded education." In a general reference book with almost no size constraints, almost anything can be included. <i>Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged</i> defines an encyclopedia as "a work that treats comprehensively all the various branches of knowledge and that is usually composed of individual articles arranged alphabetically". Stroll by a library reference section and you will find encyclopedias of agriculture, of computing, of bullfighting, and so on. Another example I always like to give is the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Enciclopedia_universal_ilustrada_europeo-americana.html" title="Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana">Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana</a></i>. It contains embedded French, Italian, English, German, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese.html" title="Portuguese">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan.html" title="Catalan">Catalan</a>, and <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> dictionaries. At 119 volumes, it is almost as large as Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I also want to say that I enjoy reading and editing this list because I find the strange <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idiom" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:idiom">idiomatic</a> expressions in it to be fascinating. English slang is one of the most unusual things in the world. I think that the social effects of a list of words can be easily overemphasized, as these simply show others the degree to which racism exists, rather than encourage it. Deleting articles such as these really helps hide the problem, which could make it worse.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 07:15, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> That Wikipedia is not a dictionary or lists of definitions has existed since 2002.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;oldid=14102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;oldid=14102" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> As for whether the list could be judged "remarkable" or "the most comprehensive," that really depends on how reliable it is, and 0.7% isn't very reliable at all. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 07:34, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply.</b> I have <i>six</i> printed slang dictionaries at my house that I checked out from a library, so trust me when I say that the vast majority (about 75%) is verifiable. I also have access to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (OED) and <i>Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged</i>. The OED is the largest dictionary of English ever created and M-W is the second largest. Also: 108 is <font size="3">7.4%</font> of 1462--not 0.7%.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 07:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> My apologies, I merely copied and pasted the percentage; I'll round you up to 8% and that still isn't very good. The list has no reliability as a whole at present, and whatever value it gains will be the result of your admirable efforts. It just doesn't belong here, and that has nothing to do with "social effects" and everything to do with policy. Transwiki might be a good case, they're awfully short over there on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Ethnic_slurs" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Category:Ethnic_slurs">wiktionary:Category:Ethnic slurs</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 08:11, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply.</b> No worries. I would be much happier, though, if it were moved via transwiki rather than just deleted. I edit on Wiktionary often. The editors there are a bit <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prudish" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:prudish">prudish</a>, and their formatting is dramatically different from ours--but it's worth a shot if it means saving the list.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 08:19, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't dispute that conscientious people have put a lot of work into this. Yes, its disappearance would be rather a pity. Well, let it be offered for transwikiing. Also, those keenest to retain it may note that it is GFDLed, so they may take it wherever they wish. Yes indeed it's an extension of WP's coverage of racism, etc, etc., as claimed above; and in a similar way that a list of, say, Hebrew words glossed in English would be an extension of WP's coverage of Hebrew -- which would not make the list encyclopedic. And what about <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offensive_terms_per_nationality.html" title="Offensive terms per nationality">Offensive terms per nationality</a> etc etc, we are asked. They too are not encyclopedic (just as Flattering terms per nationality would not be encyclopedic). Dictionary entries aren't encyclopedic, and congeries (or thematic lists) of dictionary entries aren't encyclopedic. As for the notion that if this is deleted it will surely reoccur; well, that argument could be used to justify inaction in the face of all sorts of behavior on WP: spamming, the insertion of untruths, vandalism, etc. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:29, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>transwiki</b>. This is useful information. I ended up here to find out what 'Wop' meant, and this was exactly what I was looking for.

<li><b>Delete</b>, as was said before, Wikipedia is NOT a dictionary. Furthermore, some of these entries are laughable, and could go on forever. There are billions of people in this world, and everyone could potentially be offended by some word or expression. I use words like "Navajo", "Apache", "Negro", and "Good ol' Boy" every day and nobody seems to find any of it offensive. If this article stays, it should be highly edited to include only the most common ethnic slurs, otherwise this article will become a circus, with people including ludicrous expressions that most people have or never will hear before.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, As an undergrad student, I wouldn't use the vast majority of this information in a paper for fear of it being erroneous. Either delete the information that is not sourced, find a source for it, or get it off of wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Move all unverifiable slurs to a subpage of the talk page, and place a notice at the top of the talk page that people should try to find sources for them. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 16:23, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a useful list (one of the few on Wikipedia) and, as has been pointed out, both interesting and valuable from an entymological point of view.
