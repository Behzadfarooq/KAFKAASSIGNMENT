<li>This is nevertheless a valid exercise in computer science; the point was to create a language with certain 'absurd' properties (e.g. self-modifying code) and challenging computer geeks to write code in it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The existence of a real programming language that is written as l33tspeak is somewhat notable. 193.167.132.66 12:35, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As the author of the article and the language, I (somewhat predictably) vote <b>keep</b>. The article is about the language, not the author, and I didn't write it for money or personal glory - I just thought people would be interested. There's a pretty good selection of obscure esoteric languages with little real-world use already described on Wikipedia, for people who happen to be interested in such things. In my humble opinion l33t's unusual syntax makes it as notable as any other esoteric language. There have been people other than myself writing interpreters and programs for l33t, which to me implies that there is some interest in it. I won't be offended if the page gets deleted, but I felt it was a valid contribution to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Other esoteric languages are on Wikipedia, what makes L33t so different, just because it's not in wide use? Who uses Brainfuck for their day to day programming needs? It's just there to prove that it can be done. Some people probably do, and just because the article is written by the author (well, on top of its lack of use) is no justification for deletion. Mind you, I think it would be better of more of the article were on a website dedicated to the language, but the article's rather detailed and well written, so why not keep it? <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApplegoddess_1a4f.html" title="User:Applegoddess">Applegoddess</a> 05:22, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I cant believe this is up for deletion! This language is obviously not in wide use - the purpose of esoterics is not to be used, but to be explored, experimented with, and laughed at (with). Given that l33t language actually does exist, this article is therefore factual and worthy of wiki. It's true that google doesnt have much else on this language - which is why the Wiki article is even more so a valuable resource! --<a href="../../../e/a/t/User%7EEatMyShortz_1fd5.html" title="User:EatMyShortz">EatMyShortz</a> 03:06, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, its not a place to publish new research. This is not "new research" - it is factual as I stated. I use Wiki as a "primary source" - that's more or less the whole point, it is a place to find information without having to track down individual sites. l33t does have a site, but its more handy here, and better for Wiki. I think the volume of users who want to keep this page should speak for itself, but if deleted, this could also set a dangerous precedent for an awfully large number of other pages on Wikipedia, including about 50 other esoteric languages. --<a href="../../../e/a/t/User%7EEatMyShortz_1fd5.html" title="User:EatMyShortz">EatMyShortz</a> 12:25, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
