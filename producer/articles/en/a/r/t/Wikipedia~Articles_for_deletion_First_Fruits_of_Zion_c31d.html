<li><b>Keep</b> These are notable authors of published books, and leaders in the Messianic Movement. If an author has multiple books, and FFOZ is a publishing house, I believe it more than well fits the definition for notability and inclusion in a public encyclopedia. Also other wikipedia articles link to them; and the FFOZ and Boaz articles are the developing result and consensus of Wikiproject: Messianic Judaism, Messianic Jewish editors, and the general editing community that has worked hard to develop and expand information about Messianic Judaism. There is no <a href="../../../g/o/b/Gobbledygook.html" title="Gobbledygook">gobbledygook</a>, and the articles do not violate any rules in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">WP:Vanity</a> - on the contrary, they are also notable, published subjects that have a near-majority following in Messianic Judaism. You'd be hard pressed not to find a Messianic who hasn't heard of Tim Hegg, Boaz Michael, or First Fruits of Zion and the One-Law Movement that is within scope of Messianic Judaism. Perhaps before you guys jump into deleting articles, that you might actually bother to post specifics as to EXACTLy what is wrong with them per Wikipedia policies, and how they are NOT notable according to other (and lesser known) publishers and authors that actually DO have Wikipedia articles. It would help if you stayed away from vague generalizations. In the meantime, I ask the admins to end this nonsensical request quickly, and keep the articles. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 01:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Inigmatus: Yeah right, it's not gobbledygook, it's full of lies and deceptions, from the get go. Bald-faced ones too: Like these: "First Fruits of Zion (FFOZ) is a Torah teaching ministry" now does that make <i>any</i> sense? What "Torah" are they teaching besides the Christian <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospels</a>?, which are definitely not "Torah" (check out the term at the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> article.) Would anyone believe a statement like "Yeshiva XYX teaches the New Testament"? there is no such creature on this planet because it is <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshivas</a> that teach Torah while it is ministries that teach the Gospels, both being true statements, let's not get confused ok? Also these names "One Law movement" and "Grafted In movement" are complete <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoligism.html" title="Neoligism">neoligisms</a> if ever there were any, and saying that non-Jews somehow become "Jews" by accepting Jesus is total <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hokum" class="extiw" title="wikt:hokum">hokum</a> because no Christian worth their salt believes or says that. Now the claim that "FFOZ's motto is, "Proclaiming the Torah and it's way of life, fully centered on Messiah, to today's People of God" is truly comic because, again, what "Torah" are they proclaiming exactly? Wouldn't this be called <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_advertising.html" title="False advertising">false advertising</a> if someone were to claim "Proclaiming this second hand car to be good as new" when in truth the thing has it's engine missing and won't even sputter when you turn on the ignition? This is really funny: "1. They believe themselves as righteous..." or "They follow all commmandments of Adonai" very humble of them don't you think, when was the last time you heard of any serious group, even the most respected, arrogantly calling themselves "righteous" and that they follow "all the commandments"&#160;? hmmm, even the ones not to follow a false prophet? And there is more. It's a pathetic stub and one fears where such an article would go were it allowed to mushroom and grow out of all proportion to reality. Yeaa, let's all do a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reality_check" class="extiw" title="wikt:reality_check">reality check</a> whilst we're about it. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 02:59, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IZAK, I can applaud your zealousness against anything that smacks of Christianity; but I think you have issues of confusion in your understanding of Messianics, FFOZ, and Boaz. First, you are correct, no Christian would claim to be a Jew by faith alone in Yeshua. Second, we're not Christian - we don't celebrate Christian holidays, we don't eat Christian food, we don't even share the same worship day. Third, if you really want to know what Torah they are teaching, please feel free to pick up the latest edition of the Stone Chumash, or your nearest Tanakh. Fourth, FFOZ has theological reasons, I am sure, that allow them to claim to "follow all the commandments of Adonai." Fifth, I don't see what substance your comment adds to the discussion of this AfD. Perhaps you can be a little more specific and stay away from such generalizations such as "its full of lies and deceptions" or "there's no such creature on this plant" or "these names are just neologisms." Come on, if you're as much a wiki fan as I am, I would think you could be more constructive. I encourage you to keep sharing with the group the reasons why you feel these articles should be deleted, but if you don't offer anything more specific than generalizations as accusations, then please don't bother posting and let the wikiprocess continue to move this discussion to a <b>speedykeep</b>. Otherwise, please refrain from engaging here a discussion over semantics, as VfDs are not the best place to engage Messianics in debates over their faith. I'm sure you'll spare a lot of people grief by keeping this VfD on topic. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 04:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Inigmatus: I very much resent that you are now stooping to accuse me of "zealousness against anything that smacks of Christianity" which in itself is a total lie! I have done nothing against Christianity-related articles on Wikipedia and in many instances I have worked on improving them and their categories. It is <i>not</i> "semantics" to point out that when dealing with newly founded groups that have just created their own new slogans, that it runs afoul of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>.

<li>IZAK I apologize if I came across as paternalistic and threatening. I addressed your objections based on logic, facts, and truth. I was rather disappointed that your commented more on my paternalistic tendencies than on any of the answers I gave you to your objections. However, in the interest of time, I don't find any of your objections meeting any specific criteria for VfD. Can you please present more specific and NPOV reasons for the VfD, according to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVfD_d394.html" title="WP:VfD">WP:VfD</a>? <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 20:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

But <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is very clear that the burden is on the people who are writing the article to provide solid citations, not on the person challenging it to show that they don't exist. Much of what is on the web does not qualify as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, so just saying "it gets Google hits" doesn't count for much. The morass of weak quasi-citations in these articles as they stand tells me nothing: book titles without publishers, authors or ISBNs, web links which are just sitting their in a list with no indication of which are used as sources, and none of which offhand look like they would stand up by the criteria of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I promise you that unlike some of the people commenting here I do not have an animus against the the topic, but so far this is the sort of article that does not obviously meet notability criteria. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 08:54, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The people who say to delete the Messianic sites are simply rabid anti-Messianics who routinely lie about us. Like take IZAK. He is simply lying when he says that FFOZ and Boaz Michael don't teach Torah. That's the whole thrust of their organization, teaching Torah, as is easily verifiable by going to the website. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaccabeeAJB_e5f3.html" title="User:MaccabeeAJB">MaccabeeAJB</a> 23:03, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Um, MaccabeeAJB: Regardless of your direct personal attack, why would I lie? I have nothing against anyone who teaches Torah and I have nothing against anyone who wants to be a Christian, it's a free world as they say. But I do have a big problem when people who believe in Jesus, by any definition, not just me personally, are thus Christians, claim that they are teaching "Torah" which implies that they they are teaching "Judaism" -- which they are not. It is they that are trying to sell "the big lie" that if you coat belief in Jesus and Christianity in enough "Judaism" and "Jewish" and "Torah" jargon, then that will fool people into somehow buying into their false advertising. Let the Christians practice Christianity and the Jews practice Judaism, but when <i>anyone</i> says that "Judaism can be Christianity" or that "Christianity is somehow Judaism" we have to conclude that something very fishy and abnormal is taking place. Why create confusion? Only the gullible and the ignorant may be ensnared or taken in since 99.99% of people who have spent any amount of time studying Torah and Judaism know that <b>"Messianic Judaism" is not Judaism</b>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:42, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
