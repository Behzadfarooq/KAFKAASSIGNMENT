<li><b>Keep</b>. It was tagged by an anonymous unregistered user which takes away from the credibility of this article being tagged for deletion. Mr. McCloy is the sole survivor of West Virginia's largest media event and disaster in quite some time, and I think he is deserving of an article since his name will be forever tied to this event.

<li>I agree with Antaeus here. This article is assuming lots of things, and relies on little information.

<li><b>Delete</b>; he isn't notable. If he writes a book, he'd be notable, but as-is, he's just a random name and a picture in the media. There isn't enough useful information about him, and even if there were, his only "claim to fame" is this mining disaster. He should simply be mentioned in the mining disaster as the sole survivor. Mining disasters happen fairly frequently, and surviving random disasters (unless you survive, like, 10 in a row) is not noteworthy enough for an article. If he writes a book or brings down the Bush administration with his testimony about how they beat coalworkers with sticks, then he's notable. But surviving? No. That'd be like mentioning every single soldier who has been mentioned on the news for dying in Iraq; it just isn't noteworthy enough. 69.59.212.172 05:29, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Right now, Mr. McCloy is notable considering the current media coverage of his condition and survival. He's not just a random name and a picture in the media, but on the contrary, he is a media darling and has the potential to recover and be outspoken about the events that took place within the mine. He is the only eye-witness to what occured within the mine before his recovery and has the potential to write a book, which meets one of your criteria for making a notable person. Also, not every single soldier has four days of intense media spotlight directed towards them including non-stop 24-hour footage of their ambulance being taken to the hospital and journalists reporting their vital signs and progress from the parking lot of their hospital. To deny Mr. McCloy his deserved and merited status is ridiculous. His name will forever be attached to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Sago_Mine_disaster_7928.html" title="2006 Sago Mine disaster">2006 Sago Mine disaster</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> in general. --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaponer_c591.html" title="User:Caponer">Caponer</a> 05:50, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - If this guy becomes a media sensation, which he might, then having his own article would be acceptable. But assuming that he's going to become one and then writing an article is just not for wikipedia. Because then we'd have to keep articles on "up and coming" singers and actors who are just seeking some publicity/promotion. But anyway, all the information here should just be added into a section on the mine disaster. And I've voted <b>merge</b> on other AFDs only to have my vote counted as keep. I would rather have the thing deleted. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 06:42, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> for now since he's obviously pivotal in this whole ordeal.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>, Not notable. Unknown outside the USA. If he ever does become notable, the redirect can change to a stand-alone page. We don't write articles based on sympathy.</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>, as Mr. McCloy does not presently warrant an article. As it presently stands, all the information about him that is encyclopedic relates to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Sago_Mine_disaster_7928.html" title="2006 Sago Mine disaster">2006 Sago Mine disaster</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffTL_9c74.html" title="User:JeffTL">Jeff Lipschultz</a> 16:27, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> as listed above, perhaps under "survivors" in the main category. For all the emotional ones out there, merging doesn't take away from importance or prominence - it is just a more appropriate place, possibly even better, consider the fact that maybe a user in Colombia wants to read about the survivor, and cannot recall his name; a survivor's section in the main article would prevent such.

<li><b>Merge</b> Agree with Jay. It is right to merge this into the 'Sago Mine' topic because this site ONLY talks about the disaster that happened to him and NOT his life story. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHousefan_eb2d.html" title="User:Housefan">Housefan</a> 12:43 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> for now, especially if nobody's going to expand it to include actual biographical data about him. Other than his birthdate, everything covered in the article occured after the incident. Many news sources are reflecting on details about his life before the accident, so it shouldn't be hard to fill out, but that should probably wait a couple weeks until we know how significant of a figure he's going to be (because let's face it, if he dies tomorrow, he'll just fall in among the other victims and won't be so noteworthy). -<a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDividedByNegativeZero_aca4.html" title="User:DividedByNegativeZero">VJ</a> 12:55, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Kinda borderline, but this mine story has gotten a lot of attention. The dead miners probably don't need individual articles, but the sole survivor may be notable enough to qualify. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:07, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. All those that advocate deletion because all of the information in the article pertains to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Sago_Mine_disaster_7928.html" title="2006 Sago Mine disaster">2006 Sago Mine disaster</a> should be voting to delete (many of) the articles on sports figures or celebrities that contain little biographical information and instead focus on the notable information about the person. No attack meant. <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppzter_c70c.html" title="User:Appzter">appzter</a> 01:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No attack meant in saying, incorrect analogy. A sports figure or a celebrity (well, most celebrities) actually <i>take some action</i> that makes them notable. Randal McCloy, on the other hand, was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and the only notable thing that he did was endure longer than the others. Someone said "I'd like to see you breathe CO for 42 hours and not die. I think that makes one pretty notable." Well, no, it doesn't; it may qualify you for the Guinness Book of World Records, but it doesn't make you encyclopedically notable. Now <b>if</b> the various predictions that have been made for Randal McCloy <b>did</b> come true -- that he's going to be a major spokesman or get his own talk show, or <i>something</i> -- <b>then</b> those actions would be an argument for keeping a separate article instead of merging. But none of those things have happened <i>yet</i> and we don't know that they will. According to the latest news, his biggest achievement is having some signs of brain activity even though he is still not out of a partial coma. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
