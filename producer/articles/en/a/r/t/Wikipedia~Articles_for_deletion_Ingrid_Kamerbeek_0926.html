<dd>Could it be that German Wikipedia section has other principles than the English section?</dd>
<dd>At Wikipedia Germany it is stated that an admin should propose new articles for deletion only as the outermost thing to do. He should consider every other aspect prior to putting an entry to the AfD list. He should be a helper of good willed editors not a hindrance.<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 16:41, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Userfy</b>. This seems to follow almost the same principles as Rodney Chang; but there seems to be a bit more external support for Chang than for Kamerbeek. Both seem to be at the border of notability (and both pages were sloppy vanity jobs, as initially created); but Chang seems to nudge past notability threshold, and Kamerbeek doesn't. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:59, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The above (read: below) comment was meant for the Rodney Chang Deletion Discussion page but it was closed quickly. So I put it here because this is true for my entry too:</p>
<p>Here is a note which I wanted to post at the Deletion Discussion Page but found out it was closed in rush. Find out why:</p>
<p>1st of all for admin Jossi - Wikipedia Newcomer policy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Please read.</p>
<p>On January 4th, 2006 it was the 1st time I looked up Wikipedia. I set up the article "Rodney Chang" in good faith. Dr. Chang is a well-known artist with good reputation and he has nothing to proof. 10 degrees including 2 doctorates. That alone is more than the usual human achieves in a lifetime. Out of the blue I found myself in court. This court calls itself Wikipedia. And claims to be an open-source. Nobody tried to assist me as newbie, vice versa.</p>
<p>Moreover I found out that the admin is a digital artist himself like Dr. Rodney Chang (Pygoya). Dr. Chang is worldwide known as digital artist and cyberart pioneer. Jossi Fresco, the admin, is not. Jossi Fresco has set up the below announced articles at Wikipedia. Jossi Fresco is not in the Wikipedia encyclopedia.</p>
<p>But he puts himself there by self-promoting his images along with texts about digital art. This is a clear conflict of interest. He cannot act from a neutral point of view. Could it be here is an admin who tries to hinder a worldwide known digital artist with good reputation and proven third-party achievements to get the place he clearly deserves?</p>
<p>Could it be he wants to keep his power position as an admin with special powers at Wikipedia to keep his reign over the digital artist area online at Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Some facts which speak for themselves. The admin Jossi is editor of the following Wikipedia entries:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art" rel="nofollow">Digital Art</a></p>
<p>He himself uploaded 2 of his own images to represent the theme. Is this a neutral point of view? He promotes his artwork in an article uploaded by himself using his art to demonstrates what digital art is. Is he so well-known to do so? Is his art accepted worldwide? Dr. Chang's is.</p>
<p>Search Google for Jossi Fresco. Search Google for Pygoya</p>
<p><br />
Here's a third party view:</p>
<p>On the discussion page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Digital_art" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Digital_art" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Jhocking says:</p>
<p>Along the same lines, however, I just realized yesterday that the example images further up the page are both by a single artist, and he added them himself. *cough* self-promotion *cough* Jhocking</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_painting" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_painting" rel="nofollow">Digital Painting</a></p>
<p>Again Jossi shows one of his images as self-promotion.</p>
<p>Moreover watch the weblinks from this site. And note the images of whom to find there! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArtingrid_6243.html" title="User talk:Artingrid">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Artingrid_18be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Artingrid">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Because you now also mention Webism! So you know what is going on at Wikipedia. Dr. Chang and I didn't know about Wikipedia behavior till January 4th, 2006. But we found out! Of course the admin doesn't stand for Wikipedia. But he represents Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The article Webism was put to Wikipedia End of 2004. Neither Dr. Chang nor myself did know this. We were not informed. We as the founders of Webism Movement never had the chance to give facts. Everybody interest should read the Webism deletion debate. It speaks for itself.</p>
