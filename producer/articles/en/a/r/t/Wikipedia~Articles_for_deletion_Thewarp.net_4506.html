<li>as a long time warper i have to say that A;exa has it all wrong, or that their info is slightly out of date. the site has been updated and is home to close to 550 members WORLDWIDE. not to mention MOST members post twice per day. -CB

<p>Also as a long time warper and after reading the alexa entry on the site i will add that their information is a couple of years out of date. i might also add that a number of other non noteworthy sites are on wikis lists. also, the article is not finished yet, i am sorry to some it reads like an advert, but then again most adverts for websites on wiki read along the same lines.also, bear in mind that the site has just gone through a rebuild, so many of its former users have not yet returned.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, somebody on your forum stated that there were Wikipedia articles for websites they had not heard of. That's no argument for them being non-notable.

<dd>Because, at the moment, it's 'big fry' enough to be considered a useful resource for those seeking further knowledge <i>about the hobby</i>, but not big enough to warrant an article <i>about the website</i>. I believe that the soon-to-be uploaded rewrite of the article is a little stricter on the external links list than before, so don't be surprised if it vanishes from there too in the near future. -- Saberwyn</dd>

<p>actually, ive just taken note of the url black rift has supplied for his text of the discussion. that webspace belongs to angelis mortis, a now banned user who as well as attempting to blackmail the site owners, spent about 3 years doing nothing but being a boring gimp who as well as starting various flame wars and posting troll bait, eventually got banned because everyone just got sick of his constant posts about northern ireland. i knew he would be behind this in some way, he is bitter because his own site got canned and when he came back to the warp he forgot that everyone remembered what hed done last time around. nice try A_M, if this wiki entry gets deleted, ill just keep on putting it back.<a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">pikachu</a></p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> lets look at this objectivly shall we...</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>1. the article hasnt even been up 3 days, and is in the process of being finished, but yet people who know nothing about the site etc are being allowed to have a say.</li>
<li>2. already, 2 (former) users have reared their heads in one form or another and added their $0.02 to the discussion. comments they have made bear all the hallmarks of sour grapes. FYI, the users in question were banned from the site for being unable to exersize the MINIMUM amount of self restraint the warp asks for.</li>
<li>3. comments on theawrps current status being used to justify the deletion are to be honest, pretty irrelevant, as the site is going through a series of major changes and is not yet back up to 100% operating capacity. as one of the site administrators, i can vouch that site visits are slowly climbing back up to the amount the warp had before its troubles, and every day we get more members, either returning users or new members.</li>
</ol>
<p>in short, condemning the site and the article before its had chance to get on its feet is nothing more than snotty elitism. <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">pikachu</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Thanks Black_Rift for informing me of Pikachus bullshit. My god Pikachu you do tell a lot of crap and retell stories changing things.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>-Firstly my site was never canned, my mate who hosted my account ended his business attempt when he moved to work at Intel. I also never left the Warp to come back to it. I frequented the Warp as i ran my site, my site was once part of the Warp don't forget till i realised to move away from it would be better for my site overall and it was. Haven't you noticed Pikachu how NON of the runners of sites on the Warp Network frequent your forums? They used and abused the 2MB free space and advertising the Warp offered.</dd>
<dd>-Secondly i was never banned for troll bait or Northern Ireland or anything like that, i was banned for being passed on staff forum postings. I was subsequently unbanned by the site owner when he realised i didnt hack the site and that one of you mods passed me info especially about your slander and libel. I was only banned afterwards by BrotherDrake the former owner for no reason other than his loathing of me.</dd>
<dd>-Thirdly even your site boss and several other mods agreed with me on this; i defended myself in those flame threads, i didn't start them, i only defended myself to which more assault was poured onto me when the other person couldn't admit that they were wrong.</dd>
<dd>-Fourthly i didn't blackmail BrotherDrake, ask him did i ever demand anything off him. I only stated to him that i didn't sign a confidentiality form, he automatically assumed it was a blackmial attempt. Yet no such threat or demand was ever made so technically no blackmail.</dd>
<dd>-Fifthly BrotherDrake hated me because i wasn't scared to stand up to him and his demands for money. He demanded money for the site when he did nothing for it other than let it die, i challenged him on this. He loathed me due to my frequent shows of fearlessness whe i tcame to talking back to corruption of the Warps heirarchy. I love the Warp and was sad to see it in the sorry state as he left it in.</dd>
<dd>-Sixthly the Warp is so shitly run by you and the others that you let morons roam around the site. I've had no problems on any other forums on the net, in fact on some i am very respected for my input, on the Warp the only problem was my standing up to Drake and a few corrupt mods who abused their powers such as you. Did you know i was going to be made a mod on the Warp? Yeah i was so much a badguy that i was gonna be alongside you in the ranks. Yet my promotion was canned when Drake assumed i was attempting to blackmail him.</dd>
<dd>I personally don't care if this wiki page gets deleted or not, i do however object to the bullshit you seem to keep posting on the article and here. Shall we leave me out of this now and return the point of this debate; the deletion of this wiki article? Trying to make other debaters here look bad when your own history is very dubious isn't a good thing. My $0.02 on this wiki page is as follows:</dd>
<dd>My vote on this Wiki page is reserved as its a 50/50 decision for me; Its a yes for deletion when it comes to the behind the scenes backstabbing that plagues the site. However its also a no for deletion as the site was once great and i beleive that under Nekiel it can become great again and that LordBunny's vision can come back stronger than ever. I'm only posting here primarily to refute the libel being posted against me.</dd>

<li><b>comment</b>: thanks for restoring the page feller, but after we have talked about it we have pretty much decided to host the "history of" page on the warp somewhere, firstly to stop people tampering with it and secondly because of the surprisingly snobby attitude of wikipedia users who seem to judge a site on its alexa rating as opposed to its content or user contribution level.I, as the original author of this article, hereby request for it to be removed as soon as it can be. anyone wishing to view the finished thing is welcome to come and have a look at it on the site once i get it finished off. <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">pikachu</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.65.64.4 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.65.64.4_4552.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.65.64.4">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>comment</b>: The Alexa rating Pika does give an indication of site popularity and as you can see on Alexa the Warps traffic has dropped considerably over the last 2 years. The Warps traffic rating is boasted by its more successful affiliated sub-domain sites such as Tigers of Veda (which is advertised on the GW Gateway) and Liber Astartes (which is scheduled to depart your network). On Alexa as they are part of the www.thewarp.net domain they are included in your traffic ratings.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In fact Pikachu a great idea for your redone version of the Warp.Net Wiki article would be including sections on the networks affiliated sub-domains seeing as they supply most of the sites traffic.
