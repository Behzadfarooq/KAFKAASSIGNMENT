<li><s><b>Weak delete/merge with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a></b>.</s> To the extent that Brandt is notable it seems to be largely because of Google Watch, which I don't think is notable enough in itself to justify an entry on its (co)founder. Nor does the rest of his bio or activities seems all that notable. Much of the GoogleWatch-related material will have to be merged into <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a> anyway, which will lead to substantial duplication. Brandt's antagonism with Wikipedia over this article should not substantially affect our judgement on whether he is notable; but the fact that Brandt does not wish to have a Wikipedia entry should not either lead to the perverse judgement that that opposition in itself is enough to justify keeping it. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 23:59, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If he was just the founder of Google Watch, I'd vote delete or merge. But he has a lengthy history of activism which has been covered at various points by important publications, including the New York Times.

<li><b>Keep</b> per everyone else, especially in light of likely bad-faith nomination. Kudos to Brandt for finally trying to work within the system, though, rather than simply going straight to Jimbo and throwing legal threats around. Note that precedent for keeping articles like this abounds: <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashida_Kim_6a74.html" title="Ashida Kim">Ashida Kim</a> has survived two AfDs in the last two months.--<b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawson_a883.html" title="User:Clawson">chris.</a><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClawson_988f.html" title="User talk:Clawson">lawson</a></b> 01:42, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> ...... the Wikipedia page about Brandt focuses mainly on draft dodging, Google-Watch, and Brandt's enemies. Because of this, a good case could be made in court that, unlike a magazine article, something like Wikipedia that carries the gravitas of a REAL encyclopedia (at least in some naive readers' minds) can perform a spin-doctoring sort of character assassination by focusing almost entirely on these negative things. I don't think he is going to EVER going to let go of this, so it might behoove Wikipedia to honor his request to delete the page, and save everyone involved a lot of B.S. down the road. This "he's a public figure and so we should be able to print whatever we want about him" line makes it sound like you people think you're reporting for a muckracking newspaper, not editing an encyclopedia. (Of course, an encyclopedia is supposed to be a definitive reference work, and how can you have a definitive reference work whose pages get completely rewritten twenty times a day, by anyone and everyone, from preteens to the mentally ill?) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.78.217.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.78.217.117_5892.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.78.217.117">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Excuse me, Jucifer, but just who the fuck do you think you are? You've continually removed every single change I've made to the Brandt page and continually call me a "sockpuppet for Brandt" even though BRANDT HIMSELF DELETED my version of the page I spent well over an hour trying to clean up. Apparently in YOUR mind, anyone who posts anonymously must automatically be Brandt! I see no reason not to post anonymously, especially with all the B.S. that is flying around here. Also, any retard could take a moment to ascertain that my IP address is from BellSouth, which does not serve Brandt's home state of Texas. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.78.217.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.78.217.117_5892.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.78.217.117">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Certain Keep</b> I merely add my voice to the many great thinkers above.

<li><b>Keep</b> clearly notable. Sorry Brandt but the fact that you don't like how wikipedia works doesn't mean we shouldn't have an article on you and/or our article shouldn't be editiable by anyone just like all our other articles. I will add the page to my watchlist and revert any vandalsim or POV edits. I'm sure plenty of other wikipedians will do the same.

<li><b>Comment: bad faith and process</b>: those remarking on a "bad faith nomination" do not appear to have read <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDaniel_Brandt_eca9.html" title="Talk:Daniel Brandt">Talk:Daniel Brandt</a> sufficiently, where I repeatedly suggested the article be AfD'd (to settle the issue either way) and others appeared to agree. Again, that the nominator <i>may</i> be Brandt and that Brandt has pissed us off collectively is not a sufficient reason for us to ignore our own procedures and guidelines and precedents on inclusion criteria. We should avoid the impression that we are looking for reasons to justify the original article creation (in order to defend Wikipedia's actions in the face of external criticism), rather than treat the case neutrally. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 10:10, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually he isn't blocked. If you look here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ADaniel_Brandt" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ADaniel_Brandt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> you'll see that a 7-day block was added (and is mentioned on his talk page) but it doesn't take effect because another block (namely my own) was added first. For a discussion on this see <a href="../../../t/a/_/User_talk%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_daa5.html#Daniel_Brandt" title="User talk:Ta bu shi da yu">User_talk:Ta_bu_shi_da_yu#Daniel_Brandt</a> and my talk page. Either way it wouldn't be entirely rigged, his comments couldn't overcome this many votes. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 01:31, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, he is blocked. I just asked him to try voting, and he said he was blocked. Interesting standard for a fair election: "Either way it wouldn't be entirely rigged." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.230.174.128 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.230.174.128_dc7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.230.174.128">contribs</a>) 21:09, November 6, 2005.</small>

<dd>Hmm, odd (I guess the system doesn't work the way i thought it did). Alright I'll unblock him then, but if <i>he</i> acts up he'll just get blocked again. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 02:36, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>By the way this isn't an "election" or even (technically) a vote.

<li><b>Keep</b> He is notable, if barely so.
