<p>This page is subject to high levels of bias towards this establishment. Wikipedia's goal is to give only the facts to readers, not an article creator's view of the facts. This line if of particular disturbance however: "the school's success is due to a well-rounded curriculum, skilled teaching staff, strong work ethic and a school-wide academic focus". No lines such as this should be featured in Wikipedia articles, as not only do they offend patrons of this online service, but they have no basis or evidence to support them. The reason this article should be deleted instead of changed, however, is because much of the information is misleading and/or deceptive. For example, the information that "BGS has consistently outranked all other Queensland high schools" is false. How is this statement justified, and upon what is it based? Also, "In most sports that BGS competes in, it ranks well compared to other schools". Where is the evidence? I have checked records of the school and found that in many sports it does not rank well, rather faltering quite near the bottom of the GPS competition's ladder. In conclusion, much, if not all of the Brisbane Grammar School article is plagued by bias and clearly deceptive information. This article cannot be redeemed, and must be deleted. <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 11:32, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - are you seriously suggesting that you want one of Brisbane's Greater Public Schools deleted entirely because of few lines of bias!! Mate, simply remove the lines in question, place a notice at the top of the article and leave a message on the talk page just like you would with any other biased article. Do not put it up for deletion, especially if it is a high school. This school far and away meets the requirements of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> so therefore this article should be KEPT!!!

<li>I am fully aware of the ability to clean up an article, but this article needs to be deleted. I have the sneaking suspicion that the comments above have been posted by patrons or teachers at the school. Stop now, because Wikipedia does not tolerate such disgusting deceptive behaviour. 'Jcuk' made an alarming statement: "clean up, as per the schools policy". This only confirms my belief. What you are doing is absolutely disgusting. This is Wikipedia. Wikipedia does not conform to some school policy, it conforms to the Wikipedia policy. Now, unless you actually have something to say, all of you Brisbane Grammar School users keep your patriotic hoopla to yourselves. --138.130.222.209 00:51, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What Jcuk meant by "per the schools policy" (note lack of apostrophe) is not "per the policy of the Brisbane School" but rather "per the Wikipedia policy regarding school articles". Also, those of us that are here often and the administrator who will make the final decision can easily tell who is a <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">meat/sock puppet</a>. Please be civil; I don't appreciate your accusing us of "disgusting deceptive behaviour" on behalf of the school. I never even heard of it before this AFD. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>â€”<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">01-07</a>&#160;00:54<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>

<li>I'm sorry, I didn't mean that as an accusation of bad-faith puppetry - it was pretty obvious you were most likely the same user. I just meant that you should be careful in accusing the rest of us as meat/sock puppets.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> What a joke! Why not discuss this on the talk page? Not delete the article. I sense this nomination was inspired by a personal dislike of the school. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmerk_66f2.html" title="User:Smerk">Smerk</a> 13:51, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article as it stands is shows no bias above what is to be expected given Human Nature. I suspect, given the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tall_Poppy_Syndrome_561b.html" title="Tall Poppy Syndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a> that surrounds the School, that Paaerduag is simply trying to harm the School (and satisfy himself) by putting this page up for deletion.

<li>If you even dare to mention that I am leveling ENVY towards whatever this school is (I actually live in Canada), I resent you. I simply point out faults in the article, and that is all I have done. For you, 'Theheadhunter', to think I am guilty of a personal dislike for the establishment in question, you would be severely mistaken, and I think that YOU should keep your comments outside of this page because it is YOU that has emotional attachments to this school. Oh, and incase someone else is going to criticize me of lying about my identity, I assure you ALL that <b>I am Paaerduag</b>.</li>
