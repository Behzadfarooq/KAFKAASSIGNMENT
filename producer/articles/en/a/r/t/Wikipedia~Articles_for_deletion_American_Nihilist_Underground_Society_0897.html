</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not sure if I have enough contributions to vote but nonetheless I will add my opinion. ANUS has been around since 1987 and publishes all sorts of written literary and philosophical work. I don't think its fair that Gay Nigger Association of America gets put up for VfD 5 times and wins each time and then someone comes here and complains about something of a similar (but obviously different) vein. I think the attention that ANUS members have received on the Internet through its websites (more than one), contributions to Metal, and insights into the philosophy of nihilism make it noteworthy. Also, the article is hardly vanity any more than the entry about <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> is vanity. It also smacks of ignorance to say that ANUS is just a website when it is far more that, ANUS exists outside of its web presence and the website exists only as an extention of what they do. Just becuase it has a funny name doesn't mean it deserves to be deleted. Also, I would like to note that on many VfDs of past, I have seen votes for keep removed because they were "sockpuppets" or people who haven't contributed enough or whatever but votes for delete never received such scruitiny. Just something to keep in mind if you really are interested in being objective. -[[User::Dmdx86|dmdx86]] 19:05, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yet another user whose only contributes have been to ANUS, aside from voting in the GNAA VFD months ago. A sockpuppet complaining about accusations of sockpuppeteering; how droll. -<a href="../../../p/h/t/User%7EPhthoggos_09f4.html" title="User:Phthoggos">leigh (φθόγγος)</a> 19:53, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>So just becuase I have voted for something unpopular to some and helped edit the page for this entry it makes my opinion invalid? I am not a sockpuppet as I did not create this account for the purpose of stuffing the votes here. Interesting how you don't have anything else to say to counter my arguments but wish to block people merely becuase they agree with unpopular groups/entries. Dmdx86 20:07, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Abstain and comment</b></s> (Changed to <b>Delete</b> based on further information and evidence regarding trolling and sockpuppet activity.) I don't know enough about this org to vote at this time, but I <i>will</i> verify that an org of this name has at least been around awhile: I can specifically remember it going back at least to 1997, which alone puts it ahead of the vast majority of VfD canditates. I do think that if kept, it should be cleaned up: philosophical and musical interests should be retained, but trolling and IRC activities should be removed as unworthy of encyclopedic mention. Leaning towards keep and cleanup at this time, but will reconsider deletion if more information should arise. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:26, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I am roughly in agreement about IRC; to me, it's a means to an end. Trolling will be explained in a future article about what happens when discourse dies (rest assured it will cite the use of the term "sock puppet" by paranoid Wikipedians); as a nihilist, I don't believe in "good" and "evil" or other philosophical Absolutes (non-philosophical absolute: I enjoy candycanes), thus I can't say I'm against trolling as a means, especially when the audience is as ill-informed as most are in the current time. Because of that, however, it's important that we as nihilists uphold the value of trolling, since discourse is dead. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">Prozak</a> 03:18, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This may be a misunderstanding. I'm not saying anything about trolling or IRC on any moral grounds. It's the non-encyclopedic quality of it that concerns me. As I said below, Wikipedia is essentially a huge online reference book. In 20 or 30 years' time, people will still be looking up <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> and possibly even <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Green_7cfd.html" title="Tom Green">Tom Green</a>, but is anybody going to need to know what so-and-so said in IRC last Tuesday or how many times they posted on 4chan? Hell, no. Just because something is true or accurate doesn't mean it should necessarily be put in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 04:20, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, and there's also a middle ground between IRC and Tom Green; I'm not really sure anyone will care about those two even in fifty years, seeing how Martin Luther King plagiarized everything he ever "wrote" and Tom Green is, well, mediocre as well. ANUS has, as you said, been around for a long time and raising more hell than not. If WikiPedia cannot recognize that, I suggest it is the vanity of WikiPedians speaking. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">Prozak</a> 04:29, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trolling is talked about in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>'s entry as well as the Gay Nigger Association of America's entry. GNAA has survived VfD 5 times, so I think it was been pretty well established that talking about trolling is acceptable. Also, it is totally unfair that a newish article in progress gets put up for VfD before it has a chance to be improved. --dmdx86 Dmdx86 19:32, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that is precisely the problem. If trolling is a major part of this org's activities, then the org itself likely isn't important enough to be on WP. Both of the above are bad examples: Slashdot is obviously notable for much more than anything related to trolling, and the fact that GNAA has been up for VfD 5 times should clue you in that many of us here at WP don't consider trolling groups encyclopedic (and besides, GNAA would seem to be more famous than ANUS anyway). Think of it this way: this is an encyclopedia, a research tool for the ages. When somebody accesses WP twenty or thirty years from now, do you really think they'll give a crap what someone said on some forum or IRC channel? Of course not. Now, if ANUS really supports musical and philosophical interests, and has made contributions to those fields, tell us more about them in the article, and the less (if anything) said about trolling, the better, so as to keep it encyclopedic. As it stands my vote is leaning toward deletion unless additional evidence is provided as above. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:04, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't seem to remember that GNAA won each and every one of its VfDs. Just because a vocal hypocritical minority doesnt like something does not indicate lack of encyclopedic value. May I note that what Wikipedia considers "encyclopedic" differs quite alot from what a printed encyclopedia would consider to fit that definition and not print even half of the stuff Wikipedia lists. I see all sorts of obscure social and cultural things on Wikipedia but when someone posts something that totally contradicts what most of you accept as the norm in society, you all go nuts. How can ANUS describe its philosophical and metal contributions (which are on the webiste which you obviously did NOT visit) if the page is going to get delted anyway?

<li><b>Keep.</b> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">Prozak</a>) The site has been around since early 1995; before that, it was a directory on the old paranoia.com (you DO remember that, don't you? if not, I suspect a newbie, no offense). Previous to that, it was represented by an FTP space for the undiscovered country ezine, one of the first ezines and arguably the first in literature. Previous to that, it was represented well on a series of bulletin boards, most notably the Apocalyptic Funhouse, which if you called Houston in the 1980s you will remember. Here's our old text file archive on textfiles.com, a site you also hopefully mention: <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ANUS/" class="external free" title="http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ANUS/" rel="nofollow">http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ANUS/</a> And regarding incoming links, your Google syntax is broken; try this: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=link%3A*anus.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=link%3A*anus.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=link%3A*anus.com&amp;btnG=Search</a> which will yield you "about 2,240 English pages" linking to anus.com or subdivisions thereof. Finally, I find this voting process to be the kind of pathetic clique orientation/in-group psychology that makes the Internet post-1996 quite pathetic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is where I draw the line. I realize we set a precedent with the GNAA, but Wikipedia is not consistent. The article as it stands gives no independent sources, it lists only activities established by the ANUS itself, and there is a strong reason to suspect that all of the factual content has been supplied by ANUS members. This makes the article unverifiable. As an inclusionist, I'm careful about judging notability, but I don't compromise on verifiability. The article waxes prolific on activities that have not been established to have been noticed by anyone outside of ANUS, other than those they have brought to attention themselves by self-admitted trolling. The GNAA was borderline. This, IMO, is on the wrong side of the border. The threshold for verifiability is far too low. Multiple independent references are needed, and they must be reasonably accessible. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a primary source, nor is it an index for any association of individuals who think they are notable (regardless of whether that association is formed to play chess or to promote nihilism). On those grounds, delete.<br />
Also, I'd like the supporters to take into consideration that <i>Keep</i> votes by new accounts are not helping your cause. We've seen this before, and it only convinces people that you're acting in bad faith, and that your articles should preferrably be deleted just to make sure you don't bother us. Don't do it. You're free to argue the article's merits for inclusion, but don't try to pretend your votes are accurate representations of members of the Wikipedia community (and we do rather want that, to make sure that you understand what we're trying to do here in the first place). We won't buy one-shot votes anyway, and it's just going to tempt people into voting on the authors and "what would happen" if we had such an article. Keep in mind that this vote will be tallied by a human being, who will take legitimacy of votes into account. Getting the most <i>Keep</i> votes in does not mean automatic victory. This is one discussion you cannot win by just opening a can of members and supporters, and pointing out how unfair they are being treated by us. You need facts, you need to exhibit an understanding of our policies, and you need to make a coherent argument. I have seen none of this. I wish you the best of luck with your organization, but I don't believe Wikipedia can have an article on it without compromising its integrity. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 02:52, 2005 Jan 17 (UTC)

<li><b>ANUS cited in press release</b>. The End Records quoted us regarding Darkthrone, one of the founding black metal bands. See press release <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~asiller/cite.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.uvm.edu/~asiller/cite.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Also, did I mention we're in Mecklermedia's "On Internet" going back to 1994? That's a print publication of Internet sites. Oh, and of course the home of the Heavy Metal FAQ and the Death FAQ! These links are in the now-deleted ANUS entry on WikiPedia. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">Prozak</a> 20:30, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>My balls hurt</b> It was already deleted a while ago, there's noway all you geniuses posting "delete" after the "speedy delete" mention could have ever seen it.</li>
<li><b>You make a valid point: there are a lot of people voting for deletion that haven't even seen the page!!!!! I believe that the Deletion crowd has been gathering up unqualified people just to vote for delete. This is obviously scandalous and I believe that there is a concentrated effort to undermine this organization</b> --Iconoclast 03:04, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I also wish to <b>comment</b> that since the article was deleted, there is no way for voters to see what it looks like or -- as I suggested -- to improve it and try to make it more encyclopedic and more NPOV. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 23:35, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
