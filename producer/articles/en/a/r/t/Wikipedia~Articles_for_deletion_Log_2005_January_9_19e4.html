<li>In defense of the entry (by the person who originally wrote it), the entire reason that Wikipedia was chosen as a place to make this information public was because there are no Google hits (isn't the point of an encyclopedia to be a central authority?). The game has a following in Florida, and I've had people ask for a complete set of rules. I'll repost it on my personal web page, regardless of the vote here. 11 Jan 2005</li>

<p>Not really encyclopedic. Sort of a dictionary definition, but not even really notable as that -- sort of like having an entry for "crumpled piece of paper" or something. I'm actually a stagehand and have never heard of a "gaffer ball" -- only maybe "that ball of used gaff tape" or something. <a href="../../../k/m/c/User%7EKmccoy_af23.html" title="User:Kmccoy">kmccoy</a> <a href="../../../k/m/c/User_talk%7EKmccoy_b427.html" title="User talk:Kmccoy">(talk)</a> 00:44, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This isn't an encyclopedia entry. I have a ball of used gaff tape in my booth, and all gaff tape that I pull up goes on the ball, just to see how big a ball I can make over a year or 3. This isn't a real thing, more of just something to do with used tape when your bored.

<li><b>Keep</b> and fix. Realnames was a real company that tried to fix a real problem with trying to find information on the internet. It wasn't the biggest dot-com failure, but also wasn't the smallest. For a small bit of the background on the company, see <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/sereport/article.php/2164841" class="external autonumber" title="http://searchenginewatch.com/sereport/article.php/2164841" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>If you think that you can change the article so that it establishes <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>, then <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">go for it</a>. It doesn't as it stands, however. And I note that your "quick Google search" turned up exactly the same single article about RealNames ceasing to exist two and a half years ago as <i>my</i> quick Google search did. Is the criterion for notability here the fact that the company ceased to exist? There have been an awful lot of companies that fulfil that criterion. Come on! Why was the company notable <i>when it did exist</i>? What did it <i>do</i> that makes it more notable than, say, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_International_Web_Police_ae4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/International Web Police">InterGOV</a> (which we decided <i>wasn't</i> notable)? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:49, 2005 Jan 9 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> valid stub about stupid <i>but widely publicized</i> theory. The book mentioned is <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0060937203</a>. I remember being extremely annoyed that some of the NPR-related mail-order gift catalogs were at one point pushing Mozart-effect snake-oil products. I trust the stub will be expanded in a suitably NPOV way. By the way, not that anyone has suggested it, but the stub does not read like advertising to me, and the book and associated CD's and other paraphernalia are old enough that it's not likely that the article was inserted for a promotional purpose. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:14, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suggested the stub be expanded in an NPOV way. Well... I've expanded it myself. As for notability, it led Georgia governor Zell Miller in 1998 to propose a $105,000 a year line item in the state budget to provide a classical music recording to every baby born in the state. For me, that clearly makes it notable. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:48, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>Conner is founder of Resistance for Christ which was "Regarded as a hoax by many in the begining". (I agree it's likely a hoax).

<li>Conner, the author of the manifesto claims he is "an Agent of the Lord" sent to fight Satanism perticularly in pop culture. His publicity stunts have included sarcastic ambush style interviews with various individuals from the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_Church_d620.html" title="Mormon Church">Mormon Church</a> and the FreeMasons to protests on Hollywood Boulevard. Despite Conners sometimes bizare antics, the manifesto contains historically accurate information and an in depth analysis into the ideologies of the globalists agenda creating the New World Order. Conner has penetrated the Alan Colms Show on Foxnews Radio, the Michael Savage Show, the Paul MacGuire Show and more.

<p><b>Not a hoax, the website is www.the resistancemanifesto.com. The book is real, it's called The Resistance Manifesto it's selling for $14.95. DO NOT DELETE.</b></p>
<p>Please DO NOT DELETE. This is a factual website revealing the truth about 911, just like Alex Jones, Charlie Sheen, Ed Asner, many government officials, etc. who are speaking out about the Bush/Blair/Sharon involvement in 911. This is historical and exposes that evil elite sponsor evil politicians to perform evil deeds to keep the masses in confusion while the evil elites and their collaborators steal the masses lives and wealth through wars they orchestrated while funding both sides in the conflict.</p>
<p>Do Not Delete. While I will agree that John Conner has a tendancy of being more than a little outspoken. At times his antics can make a person wonder if he is truely dedicated in what he believes in...or if he is just having fun while exploiting popular conspiracy theories for sake of noteriety, or if he is just a straight up looney tune. For all I know...it could be that he is any of the above. Now, something I do know is that if you take a look through his book, The Resistance Manifesto....you will find fact after verifiable fact. I challenge anyone who believes his information should be deleted to read his book, go through it subject by subject....and prove it to be a hoax. Better yet...ask him for the resorces in which he gathered his info...and verify his research. I'm sorry to have to be the one to say this....but...his book is factual. Don't take my word for it....Look into it for yourself. If you choose not to...Who are you to delete anything? Just because you have chosen not to be informed on the truth...does not mean you can be ignorant in your proclimations about him. Universal Truth is not measured by mass appeal. He has spent countless nights researching his data. Can you say the same?</p>
<p>Do Not Delete. John Conner fights for the rights of every man. He's progressively exposing the secrects of the illuminaries. He has his own character, but once you know him you'll propably end up seeing him as a good guy trying to help us all and especially the poor fellas. Research first, condemn after.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> it's a legitamit article (re www.theresistancemanifesto.com) and the irresponsible people who voted to delete should, in future, bother to research subjects before passing judgement. This is all too often with these people.</li>

<li>Do Not Remove, I own the book The Resistance Manifesto and refer to it often. I have heard John Connor call in on multiple am radio talk shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>DO NOT DELETE. We need to give populations good informations.As mass media dosen't tell the truth, dosen't mean we don't want the truth! Maria</p>
<p>DO NOT REMOVE! JOHN CONNER IS GREAT HE CALLS SEAN HANNITY AND ALAN COLMES FREQUENTLY TO CULTURE JAM THEM! HE MAY HIDE HIS REAL NAME BUT HIS ACTIVISM IS LEGITIMATE HE FIGHTS FOR YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ANTI BUSH what more can you ask for?</p>
<p>KEEP John Conner and The Resistance Manifesto are cited in several Wikipedia Articles and is a legit topic DO NOT DELETE Here is one example from WIKIPEDIA&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_single%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_single%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_single%29</a> And the first 10 or so votes for deletion are invalad.</p>
<p>"Wikipedia is not a forum for unregulated free speech. Wikipedia is not a soapbox</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<pre>
  1. Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a "sympathetic point of view" for every article.
  2. Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: "Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so." [1] Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.
  3. Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.
</pre>
<p>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a place to publish your own thoughts and analyses. Please leave the following out of Wikipedia:</p>
<pre>
  1. Primary (original) research such as proposing theories and solutions, original ideas, defining terms, coining new words, etc. See Wikipedia:No original research. If you have done primary research on a topic, publish your results in other venues such as peer-reviewed journals, other printed forms, or respected online sites. Wikipedia will report about your work once it becomes part of accepted human knowledge. Not all information added to Wikipedia has to be from peer-reviewed journals; but strive to make sure that information is reliable and verifiable. For example, citing book, print, or reliable web resources demonstrates that the material is verifiable and is not merely the editor's opinion.
</pre>
<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not:Genealogical entries, or phonebook entries. Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line). Relatively unimportant people may be mentioned within other articles (e.g. Ronald Gay in Persecution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered). See m:Wikipeople for a proposed genealogical/biographical dictionary project." I apologise for the cut and paste oddessy, but all the information was taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT</a> and unfortunately, it seems like the article in question has no place in wikipedia.</p>
<p><br />
KEEP ARTICLE DONT DELETE I take it someone at Wikipedia is a homosexual and is offended by parts of this article. This article is written objectively is made to approach a neutral point of view. The NYPOST, SmartMoney Mag, Rollingstone, and all the other publications which are cited in this article must be less important than wikipedia, since wikipedia seems John Conner isn't a newsworthy person.</p>

<ul>
<li>You could try edit every single day, but I think you are going to get approximately the same number of active voters. Active voters population does not change that fast. So editing the list once a week will be fine too, as long as this list is used for statistical calculation of the population percentage that has to participate on a Vfd poll, in order for the poll to be valid. If you really want accuracy, why dont you try to hire a daemon to do the job for you. Also, could you please answer me <b>why active voters are the people who voted for the last 5 days</b>? Why not the last 7 days? You seem to want accuracy for the list of active voters and the fact that it is not edited every day bothers you, but you cant explain why this 5 days initial value is considered an accurate and correct value, can you? All lists are similars, they change when time passes. Whats the difference with that list?
<ul>
<li>Yeah! correct. <b>If you really want accuracy, put this 5 days initial value in a poll</b>. As long as this 5 days initial value is decided by a small minority, it is not an accurate value. Active voters should vote in order to define what the correct number of days is. Its Active voters' responcibility and right to define how small or how large their community should be.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see what purpose the page serves. It seems like its an attempt to get a list of people to complain at by J.Random User following an article of theirs being deleted. However, it doesn't distinguish between who voted in the poll for that article, whether any user has voted in one poll or 100 polls or what someone's vote is (i.e. there is little point hassleing someone about the deletion of your article if they voted to keep it) - it therefore doesn't improve on the VfD page for each article. If a list like this <i>is</i> needed (which I don't agree with at this point in time), then a list at Wikipedia:Wikipedians who have voted in VfD polls would be more apropriate. -<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 12:27, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this list is to define Active Vfd Voters, and use that number for the calculation of the minimum voters (as a percentage of the active ones) that have to cast a delete vote on a Vfd poll, in order for the poll to be valid and for the proposed for deletion article to be deleted. <b>I hope that you agree that if you have a population of 400 active voters, you just CANNOT delete an article in case in a time period of 5 days just 4 voters voted for deletion. can you? So a minimum participation in a vfd poll should be defined somehow, in order for the vfd poll to be a valid and legitimate one</b>. I dont care about the name. I agree with you that a list at Wikipedia:Wikipedians who have voted in VfD polls in the last 5 days and a list Wikipedia: Active Vfd voters as a redirect to the same page is more appropriate.

<li>Actually, I think that having 4 voters vote for deletion is quite sufficient in many circumstances.

(It would waste almost as much space as <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson's</a> 'policy statement' votes.)

<li><b>Comment (Disagree)</b>: Do you think that having just 1 voter's vote for deletion is also quite sufficient? And what about 4 voters' vote for deletion in a population of 9000000?

<li><b>Of course we are majority!</b> As I said in my vote, in order for this poll to be valid, after <b>7 days</b> voters' participation should <b>exceed 12%</b> of the List of Active Vfd Voters. Current participation is 28/307 (9%). But as long as <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority_rule.html" title="Majority rule">majority rule</a> is going to be used to extract the decision from this poll and as long as all current votes are DELETE votes, this means that the result is not going to change even if the rest 3% cast a KEEP vote . So this article is a candidate for speedy delete, I think we dont have to wait for 5 days. (unless of course a lot of people change their mind suddently wich I think is not very likely, or unless suddently 29 new people arrive and vote KEEP, witch also I think it is unlikely to happen too).

<li><b>Delete</b>. I feel left out, I had no idea that I'd spent so long away from VFD that I wasn't considered "active"! Although this article is, to use a term I enjoy, codswallop, I wouldn't mind seeing something along these lines; it would certainly give the deletionist/inclusionist factions something to talk about, if their records were up on display. On the other hand, if such a page actually began to form, it seems like certain users might abuse the VFD process to manipulate their statistics on the list. Although accountability is nice, I'm not sure we need this.

<p>I made a few edits. I was reading through the article and saw "Limit Break", "limit break", "Limit breaks", "Limits", etc and thought there should be a uniformed punctuation to the term. If anyone disagrees, just change it. I just thought if the article was to stay it should be smart and look as if someone proof read it. -- <a href="../../../c/u/a/User%7ECuahl_d81d.html" title="User:Cuahl">Cuahl</a> 20:26, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe we could add a pop culture tag here, though I'm not sure if it has any real meat to it.</p>
<p>But I think gamers tend to use (as was noted) <i>limit break</i> as an encompassing term.</p>
<p>That, and in Fallout 2, the character Cassidy, after taking a (critical) hit sometimes remarks "I wish I had a limit break."</p>

<p>In FF9, when the characters entered trance mode, they would gain a corresponding "new appearance" (even besides the flashing light effects). The ones I know of are:</p>
<p>Zidane: Changes to a more "wild" appearance (as with Kuja), fur replaces clothes. Vivi: Clothes become more like his fellow black mages'; his hat is straightened, and all his clothes are made more ornate with gold (or some metal) accentations. Steiner: Armor becomes somewhat more ornate, his face is covered by a metal mask. Freya: Her clothes are changed to more traditional dragoon-like armor. Quina: He/she becomes this bizzare black-and-white chef.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember Garnet's, which gave her long blonde hair (which could've just been the lighting from the trance effect).</p>
<p>Anyone out there have a complete/more detailed list?</p>

<p>I made an edit to the Kingdom Hearts section of Cloud's limit breaks. The attack Cloud uses in Kingdom Hearts 1 and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories where he transforms and flies while slashing, is also called "Omnislash." This is verified in KH:CoM when he uses the same attack in the game and it is called "Omnislash" and in the Kingdom Hearts Ultimania Omega which lists the attack names. The names of the attacks of KH:CoM come from their corresponding attacks in KH.</p>
<p>Also, Cloud has the same attack in Kingdom Hearts 2, minus the use of the wing..and it more closely resembles his original Omnislash attack. This attack is also called "Omnislash" as verified in the Ultimania Omega of KH2.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Question: For the FFVI desparation attacks, it says "can only be used once." Does this refer to once per battle, or once ever? I think this would be a valuable point to clarify. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichenbach_c753.html" title="User:Nichenbach">Nichenbach</a> 05:31, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Mentioning the most memorable ones (Omnislash and uhh....) as examples seems fine to me. At the moment, this article irks my WP:NOT a gameguide sense. -- <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakabaka_f36a.html" title="User:Bakabaka">Bakabaka</a> 10:13, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

I think the <b>list</b> may be OK (like what was listed for FF6, "Character Name - Limit1, Limit2, Limit3") without all the descriptions. That would then allow searchers to find the page if they only hear other people talk about 'Renzokuken' they can find the article. Also, putting it in a set format of a list may discourage future bloat of the article. -- <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevragnarok_789a.html" title="User:Revragnarok"><font color="#696969">RevRagnarok</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevragnarok_52e4.html" title="User talk:Revragnarok">Talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Revragnarok_e131.html" title="Special:Contributions/Revragnarok">Contrib</a> Reverts</sup></span> 11:10, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I put in Final Fantasy Tactics and took out the City of Heroes reference--the skill referenced in COH is an extremely common one in MMORPGs and it didn't really relate to limit breaks or FF anyway. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurahan_6708.html" title="User:Durahan">Durahan</a></p>

<p>Um, the co-op attacks in KH2 are called "Limits." This seems to be an obvious Limit Break refernce and is more worthy of mentioning than "Drives."</p>

<p>In the Japanese version of FFVIII, these desperation moves were called Special Arts, shortened to Special in the Status Menu.</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b>, Wikipedia is not a playfield for cultists and exers (which i am myself, due to my resume). That was and still is my strongest opinion.

<p>Not encyclopedic. The article doesn't actually discuss "Palestinian occupation", or definitions thereof. Searching on Google, the term "Palestinian occupation" seems to be rarely used, and when used, ususally refers to an hypothetical situation where Israel would come under Palestinian occupation, or to the situation in parts of Lebanon during the civil war. The article doesn't mention any of these, but instead discusses (very briefly) the term "<a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupied_Palestinian_territories_0c81.html" title="Occupied Palestinian territories">occupied Palestinian territories</a>", for which we already have a better article. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriber_46ab.html" title="User:Uriber">-- uriber</a> 20:42, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia: namespace, so may not belong here. OTOH, it's blatant original research hanging by the merest thread of real-life happenstance, and the article itself states it's a 'cultural experiment', i.e. an attempt to popularise a neologism.

I just don't see this company as notable at this point, even if their product might eventually be.

<li>Well, if the vote about the company goes for deletion, it won't be the end of the world... ;-). They will proof over time how much more notability we need to accredit to them, and if a negative vote now was deserved or not. I agree that not every open source software product is notable. However, this technology definitely is. (You can see at Freshmeat how fast it is going up in popularity. Its usefulness you can only really guess by testdriving it yourself. Maybe the world will take another 6 months to realize.) <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPipitas_5c3c.html" title="User:Pipitas">pipitas</a> 23:08, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
