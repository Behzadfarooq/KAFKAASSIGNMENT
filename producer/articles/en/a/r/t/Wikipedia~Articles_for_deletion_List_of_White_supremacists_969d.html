<p>It's inherently POV. Before, at the earliest, 1920, most notable public figures in the U.S. and many other countries expressed white supremacist ideas. The number of white supremacists is so large that any list is going to be limited, which means that we're going to be unfairly singleing out certain people as racist. A related problem is that almost no one these days (not even <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a>) consider themselves white supremacist, so labeling them as such is POV. Finally, it has been suggested that the article be restricted to people notable for their white supremacist beliefs or who are leaders in the white supremacist movement. The problem here is, who decides who is notable for white supremacist beliefs and who isn't? Again, I don't see any way to put the list together that isn't inherently POV.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> if you look at this very VfD page, you'll find a lot of people deciding what is and isn't notable. There is nothing inherently POV about judging someone to be notable or not. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">malathion</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalathion_119a.html" title="User talk:Malathion"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:20, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - simply a list of people who express a certain belief. It shouldn't matter that "almost no one these days" calls themselves that, as a list can encompass historical figures as well. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:53, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As repulsive (or not, depending on one's POV) as this list might be, as BD2412 said, it's a list of people who express a particular belief. We have lists of other things just as potentially problematic here, but it's an encyclopedic matter (if only for the historical figures alone) and should be retained.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 20:34, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> to List of modern white supremacists. It seems from this discussion like the historical change in attitudes that the nominator mentioned is going to be an issue; I see a lot of people here using slippery slope arguments, and if there's technically nothing preventing, e.g. Abe Lincoln from being listed due to his many pro-slavery statements, the slippery slope would get ridiculous and the article would just become a free-for-all. However, I think the definition of this list <i>can</i> be pinned down, if limited to a certain timeframe. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 23:24, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> because it's an unmaintainable list. If one believes, as many do, that white supremacy was systematic and inherent in western society before the Civil Rights movement, then practically anybody can go on the list if you can pull up a quote that would justify their inclusion. Yet, to do so would be to apply modern moral standards to historical people, a practice which presents POV problems. There are already problems with, for example, Margaret Sanger, Woodrow Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson appearing on the list, and conceivably it could go on forever: Shakespeare, Jack London, H.L. Mencken, FDR, Lincoln, George Washington, Mark Twain...??? It might be possible to exclude historical figures, which would keep the list limited to people like David Duke who clearly belong. But in practice, is that really going to happen or is the list going to be cluttered up with edit wars by people who insist that their own POV be represented by the inclusion of one historical figure or another that they don't like? Alternatively I would support a name change to "List of notable modern white supremacists". <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 02:43, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is a list of contemporary white supremacists in the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacy.html" title="White supremacy">White supremacy</a> article (which is also controversial).

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article is detrimental to the Wikipedia project as it's <i>potentially</i> the opening of pandora's box. With a white supremacist list, there will be lists of all other things popping up, furthermore, there is no segregation between 'white supremacist' and 'white seperatist' or 'white nationalist', many of the people on the list at the moment express anti-white supremacist views. It's flawed and a waste of space, next we'll have other fanatics listing black supremacists and every other ethnic group which will all fall down to a mamoth name calling and labelling tantrum, something we <b>don't</b> need! <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">Jachin</a> 13:31, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - First of all, the name is spelled wrong, move it and make that w lowercase if kept. Anyway, we should not single out whites for being supremists, but, if they are well known to be white supremists, what's it going to hurt to keep a list on Wikipedia?

<li><b>Delete</b> I find the notion of "white supremacy" alone to be, more often than not, a laughable mirespresentation of any semblance of racial awareness or interest expressed by any White. Let's face it: supremacists don't really exist anymore, and if they do, Sharon or the powers that be behind the oddly named "Aztlan" movement should be named in similar manner. This list is useless and, what's more, ignorant. The term alone sounds comical, much like the overused term "racism," today a meaningless moniker used to smear any opponent of the prevailing religion of egalitarianism, much like "heretic" was once employed. Some simply do not share the views of the lumbering majority, and the voices of the dissenters amount to just a bit more than "supremacist" ideas, but very valid concerns which should be presented in a fair light.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If this list were to be kept, it would have to include nearly every white person before 1900. And many blacks as well - most black people in the United States would have said publicly (if asked to do so) that white people were fit to rule over black people - to say otherwise would be suicide. So who's a white supremecist and who's not?

<li><b>Delete.</b> I agree w/the originator of this VfD that any proper list of white supremacists would be endless and that any list we could come up with would, necessarily, be POV. I recently added the names of several dead U.S. presidents, along with a few others, to the list to make a point: white supremacy is a pervasive ideology -- and has been, for centuries. We might just as well undertake to make a list of people who are <i>not</i> white supremacists. A fairly convincing argument could be made that such a list would be shorter. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 02:35, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The list already appears to be going along the lines of 'almost anyone who's white can be labelled a white supremacist', which is why it's a stupid concept and detrimental to the Wikipedia project, it's all opinionated drivel <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">Jachin</a> 03:51, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Could easily be libellous. Who's going to check to make sure all these people really are white supremacists? Moreover some of them (like Sen. Byrd) are apparently on the list for things they did in the distant past; I don't think it's fair to put him on a page whose title implies he's a white supremacist <i>now</i>. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:29, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Uh, I added Harry Flood Byrd (D-VA) to the list. He was a racist, old fart who croaked in 1966. You're probably thinking of Robert Byrd (D-WVA). <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:25, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think your entry of Harry Flood Byrd, whomever he happens to be, is a substantial example of why this list is a moot concept. He was a 'racist' and an 'old fart'. I'm not quite sure which applies to declaration of white supremacy out of those two? On one hand, almost all white 'old farts' (pre-1930's) are white supremacists, yet almost all 'racists' would be, by capita, not white as whites are not a majority and racism is a proven facet of the human psyche. So in theory, how can we list 'racists' in a 'white supremacist' list when most racists aren't white?</li>

<dd>The fact ultimately remains, there is not enough underlying definitive quality of product provided by this article, the concept is a loose name-calling / labelling project similar to a nazi death-camp, except in this modern era of 'enlightenment' where we forego our forefathers who worked to put us in a position with so much leasure time that we can damn the entire history of human development as an evil empire, we are instead handing out more than just stars of david to people.</dd>
<dd>We had the 'communist' badge of the post-WWII era, dozens more between, and now we have our current 'terrorist' badge. The question is, where do we draw the line at generic stupidity of attempting to label or catagorise everything into big broad sweeping statements? It all smacks of witch-hunt mentality that I, as a human, have always wished we'd have gotten over by 2005. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">Jachin</a> 10:57, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're trippin' a bit, Jachin, though we essentially agree, I think, on this list. No. Racism isn't a come-with kinda thing; it's not, <i>ipso facto</i>, automatically part of being human. That's far too facile; it reads like somone was looking for an excuse. Your argument may pretty much be correct in the case of whites, given the pervasiveness of the ideology of white supremacy -- which has been my experience. It certainly has not been my experience with regard to many peoples of color (though, it seems to me, Asians (of the Far East) rank pretty high on the list of folks with racist tendencies). Be that as it may, there is absolultely no question of Harry Byrd's racism or white spremacist beliefs and policies. And, yes, white supremacy <i>was</i> pervasive in a particular time period -- but it is pervasive, still; it simply has been sublimated to political correctness, its prominence among those in the news pretty much relegated to backroom/backwoods/boardroom/country club conversations, instead of front-page media quotes and explicit public policy agendas. But then -- oops -- there're always the public slips/foot-in-mouth gaffs; the atrocities, like the lynching of James Byrd, that surface from time to time. Again, white supremacy is so pervasive, it might be easier to make a list of who <i>isn't</i> one than who is. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:20, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Split and rename</b> to List of white supremacy theorists and List of white supremacist politicians. To merit inclusion, white supremacism should be a <i>major</i> and <i>essential</i> (and I mean "essential" here literally, as in "constituting the essence of") part of the person's ideology/policies. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunes_c5a1.html" title="User:Junes">Junes</a> 11:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>The problem with restricting to strict criteria, or with trying to keep it to people for whom white supremacism was essential or major or some such is that this is also POV. If you are going to keep people off the list who were clearly, by word and action, white supremacist (like <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, for example, or <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, or <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> or even <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>) then you are going to hugely minimize the extent and power of white supremacy as an ideology. You could make a pretty good case that white supremacism was a central part of the ideology of America for the first couple hundred years of its existence -- it's enshrined in the Constitution, no? The problem isn't that there's a threat of the list being too large and therefore libellous -- the problem is that for the list to be inclusive is impossible, and that a non-inclusive list is hopelessly POV -- both unfair to the people on the list (since their white supremacism is not properly contextualized) and unfair to people of color (since it downplays the power of racism in our culture.) <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahB_93fe.html" title="User:NoahB">NoahB</a> 14:50, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You got a point there, but I don't think it's enough reason to give up on what could be a potentially useful list. I think the list should be designed with this usefulness in mind. I don't think anyone interested in the history of white supremacism would be helped much with a link to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> or <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, on the other hand, may be a useful addition - that's for the editors of this list to decide. If, after a few months or so, this article turns out be nothing but a bait for edit wars, I'd have no problem with deleting it. For now, I have faith in the Wikipedia process of establishing criteria for inclusion (this is what we do constantly, not just for this list). To prevent people from thinking that these were the <i>only</i> white supremacists in their days, some sort of introduction text could be provided. (By the way, we have a List of anti-Semites that would arguably have a similar problem). <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunes_c5a1.html" title="User:Junes">Junes</a> 09:11, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
