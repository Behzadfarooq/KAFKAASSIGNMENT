<p>Corner (route) THe corner route is essentially a mirror of the post pattern route. The reciever runs about 12 yards striaght up (like a fly route) then makes a 45 degree break towards the sideline. Typically the catch is made just over the reciever's outside shoulder. This route is particuarlly difficult because rarely can the ball be "bulleted" to the receiever; instead to beat the cornerback (who is covering the wideout) the quarterback must pass over the corner's head. This in turn means that defences can see the ball in the air and react accordingly. Additionaly this route does not allow for many yards after the catch. Although one more note is that because of the position of the pass, the safety often times has difficultly blocking or intercepting the pass directly.</p>
<p>another variation is a fake-post corner. It starts like a normal post pattern where the reciever breaks towards the center of the field for about 3 steps. Then the reciever breaks towards the outside. The use of this is that the safety drops down to try to jump the post route. Then the reciever breaks for the outside and the quarterback throws a deep ball.</p>

<p>Jane Bryan (born Jane O'Brien on June 11, 1918 in Hollywood, California) was an actress at Warner Brothers studio in the 1930's. She played important supporting roles in several notable films, including "The Old Maid" and "Marked Woman" with Bette Davis, and "Confession" with Kay Francis. In 1939 she starred opposite Paul Muni in "We Are Not Alone." Although her performances were well received and she was a promising young actress, Bryan retired permanently from films after her marriage at age 21 to Justin Whitlock Dart, Sr. Dart was CEO of Rexall Drugs and later of Dart Industries, and was a close advisor to Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>Thrush Pants have a long and varied history. Originally found in the Sumerian ruins in the Tigris &amp; Euphrates Fertile Crescent, modern thrush pants bear little resemblance to their ancient counterparts. Experts believe that the "thrush" was derived from a small, flightless bird similar to a quail. The "pants" part came from the garment that many people use to cover their legs.</p>
<p>There is a common vaginal fungal infection known as thrush that some "thrush" scholars associate with the pants. Modern research, however, has debunked this myth. Vaginal Thrush and Thrush Pants are not related, unless of course, the wearer of the pants happens to have a nasty case of vaginal thrush.</p>

<p>Players are able to play as one of three unique races including Humans, Moon Elf’s and Orcs and within each race they will be able to choose from one of eight different classes depending on their chosen race. Each of these classes will have a host of unique features that players will need to master in order to become true masters of their class, this will present a challenge to both new and seasoned players alike.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing features is it’s ability to accommodate both the hardcore PvP fan as well as those looking for more solo action in a quest based game. Players will find themselves able to take part in massive real time battles between guilds accommodating hundreds of players. Or for those that wish to engage in more solo based play they will be able to partake in an extensive range of quests to explore the world and level their skills.</p>
<p>There is more to ArchLord than just the above, there are many features of the game that you really must experience first hand to get a feel for the depth and quality that this game offers. ArchLord has something for everyone, but do you have what it takes to become the ArchLord?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-20_91e3.html" title="Edit section: Dondon Hontiveros">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dondon Hontiveros</span></h2>
<p>Dondon Hontiveros (Born Donaldo Hontiveros) is a Filipino basketball athlete coming from Cebu playing for the San Miguel Beermen team in the Philippine Basketball Association. He is married to fellow Cebuana, musician Gail Blanco, whom he shares a four year-old son with.</p>
<p>A true native, having been born in Cebu City in 1977, Dondon studied and honed his basketball skills in the land of his birth. Just like any accomplished athlete, success did not come easy for him. In fact his initial foray into basketball was greeted with heartbreak and disappointment.</p>
<p>He fancied basketball at a young age and tried to enter the sport at a competitive level in his first year of high school. But at that time, since he lacked the height, no one took notice of the young Dondon. Fortunately, the young Dondon had a growth spurt by the time he was in 3rd year so he was taken into the high school basketball team of Don Bosco Tech.</p>
<p>At last, they started to take notice, although his first year as a member of the team was spent mostly on the bench. By the time Dondon became a high school senior, he was already a regular on the team. At this point, he was already as tall as the team’s center. Hontiveros’ jump to the next level – college basketball – suffered a minor setback when he ended his senior high school year with an injury.</p>
<p>To keep himself competitive, he played in the intramurals at University of San Jose-Recoletos. Dondon eventually played college ball at the University of Cebu for three years. His skills blossomed while playing college basketball, and it was at that time that this Cebuano was geared for big-time basketball.</p>
<p>The year was 1998, and it was also the year that an ambitious initiative called the Metropolitan Basketball League (MBA) was making waves in its bid to be the professional league to rival the PBA.</p>
<p>Dondon Hontiveros was taken by the Cebu Gems, and he wasted no time in showing his offensive prowess – dominating opponents with his skillful moves, showcasing a run and gun type of offense, true to the tradition of Cebuano cagers.</p>
<p>After the 1999 season of the MBA, when the league’s popularity was beginning to diminish, Dondon requested to be released from the Cebu Gems to try his luck with the PBA.</p>
<p>The San Miguel Beer franchise eventually hired him. Soon, Dondon found himself a vital cog in the pro team’s offensive rotation.</p>
<p>Even if followers of Dondon’s career can safely say that their idol has arrived, this 27-year-old Cebuano has shown that he has transcended success and is now looking forward to what he can do for Philippine basketball.</p>
<p>Hontiveros’ vision is to bring back to his native Cebu an organized basketball clinic program, in order to provide for his hometown a truly effective way of discovering and developing talent from the grassroots level.</p>
<p>Dondon is proud of his Cebu basketball – the passion in the way the game is played in his hometown. But having been exposed to Philippine basketball at its highest level, he also recognizes the lack of training in the fundamentals of the game there, thus his vision to uplift the game in his roots.</p>
<p>So what is the secret of Dondon Hontiveros in his ascent as the Cebuano’s pride in basketball? With a natural humility this young man’s reply is: “commitment to excellence and the willingness to sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Martin Chenery is a person known only by some, and of those, know him well. He started off life in a small country town. He grew to become a strong boy by the age of 11, when he lifted a tree trunk out of the ground for his father's farm. Later in life he would meet a group of boys who he admired all day long, for their courage and wits. Martin went on to be a bass player in his teen years. By the age of 18 he had admitted his homosexuality to his family and friends. It was accepted, seeing that most could tell it was going to be that way. After High School he met a Spanish man who he settled down with and went on to play Representative Rugby and pursued his dreams.</p>

<p>Coastal river in Western Algeria (West of Mostaganem, East of Arzew) formed by the confluence of two smaller rivers ( Sig and Habra); its course is surrounded by marshes (20.000 hectares)which were partly drained between 1958 and 1962. In 1835 the French troops of General Trézel were defeated there by Emir Abdelkader. A folk tradition of the 1950s tells about the presence of a crocodile or alligator in that zone : a skull was discovered around 1951. Nowadays the remaining marshes have been declared a Natural Reserve by the Algerian state owing to the great variety of birds and plants in that area.</p>

<p>AE all its Vienneses, it is probably Paul Federn (1870-1950) who appeared in Freud like most gifted and most reliable. It comes into contact with Freud since 1903 and joint consequently to the first psychoanalytical meetings to have been held without never to have been itself in analysis. Quickly, its institutional medical practice leads it to work with patients psychotics and since 1906 it undertakes the analytical psychotherapy of a catatonic patient.</p>
<p>With the passing of years, Paul Federn was acquired the regard of Freud so that it is with him that Freud asked to take his place when it was withdrawn from the public life about 1924. In addition to becoming president of the Company Viennese of Psychoanalysis, posts that it occupied until 1938, Federn also assumed the follow-up of the customers of Freud.</p>
<p>In 1938, Federn, like several other had to flee Austria. It settled in New York where it continued its practice while playing an important part in the training of the American analysts. He was the analyst of Aichhorn, Bibring, Fenichel, Meng, Reich and of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Its work relates to especially the psychoses and the psychology of Ego. Federn committed suicide on May 4, 1950 of a shot whereas it was known reached of an incurable cancer.</p>

<p>The infromation concerning the Staff of Magus is far and few, but a little infromation is better then none. The staff is one of the last surviving relics of the age of dreams (many of which were distroyed by the king prist of istar), named for its owner Magus, who is considered one of the most powerful mages of the dragonwars. The staff was given as a gift to Raistlin by the head of the wizard conclave, was a great show of regret for having put the young man, who was only in his twentys, through such a test. The staff has many powers that even Raistlin didn't know about, some we have seen in the novles include: returening to the posseser of the staff when lost(seen in "The Brothers Majere"), the power to glow when the word "shrank" is uttered (seen through out the novles)</p>

<p>In today's fast pace hactic and busy life, people are bound to suffer from anxiety. And now ther is a new form of it disturbing mobile users all over the world. This is called ringxiety or fauxcellarm.</p>
<p>This word was first coined by David Laramie of California’s School of Professional Psychology back in May 2006.</p>
<p>When people do not receive call on their mobiles and theie cell phones do not ring then they start thinking that they are the least important people and people do not call them. And sometimes at its extreme people think that their cells are ringing while they are actually not.</p>

<p>The Guaíra Falls (also known as Sete Quedas) was at one time considered the largest waterfall on earth in terms of sheer water volume, by some who attempt to keep track of such things. In reality it is hard to judge due to seasonal variations in water flow, but certainly Sete Quedas was once one of the most significant waterfalls in the world. The water volume was reported in some sources to be about 30 times that of the more famous Iguaçu Falls further south.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the 12,600 megawatt Itaipú hydroelectric dam, the falls were submerged beneath the vast lake created by the dam.</p>
<p>The entry for this waterfall in the Portuguese language version of Wikipedia lists it under the name Sete Quedas, but it is listed on the English language list of significant waterfalls worldwide under the name Guaíra Falls.</p>

The Promised Messiah and founder of the Jamaat Ahmadiyya Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani's blessed son, Hazrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad (The Khalifatul Masih II and Musleh Mauod) married Hazrat Syeda Maryam Begum on 7th February, 1924. She was the daughter of Hazrat Dr. Abdul Sattar Shah, scion of an eminent Syed family. In his Nikah sermon, Syed Sarwar Shah Sahib, a venerable companion of the Promised Messiah said, "I am now advanced in years and would soon pass away, But those who live would witness the advent of Servants of the faith born in this wedlock with a Syeda as occurred before. This is my resolute conviction."</p>
<p>And so this Servant of the faith was born on 18th December, 1928. He grew up righteousness and virtuous under the guidance of his illustrious father and devout mother and with divine blessings. Once, during his childhood, he was asked by a well-know Ahmadi Savant, Maulana Abdul Rahim Nayyer, "Which reward would you cherish most for doing good work?" "Allah - Only Allah" was the 10 year old's spontaneous answer.</p>
<p>The blessed personage was named Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad. His erudition encompasses wide range of knowledge both spiritual and material. After graduation, he obtained the "Shahid" degree from Jamia Ahmadiyya (Theological Academy) at Rabwah. Then he studied in Europe for two and half years.</p>
<p>After completing his higher education, he dedicated his life to the service of faith. In October 1958, he was given charge of "Waqf-e-Jadid" the department for propagation of the highest grades of virtue and for fostering welfare of Ahmadis. From 1960 to 1969 he was vice-president and then president of Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya in which capacity he displayed remarkable qualities of leadership. From 1979 to 1982, he was president of Majlis Ansarullah. He served as Director of Fazl-e-Omar Foundation in the time of Hazrat Khalifatul Masih III. He was patron of the International Ahmadiyya Association of Architect and Engineers (IAAAE). Allah has bestowed upon him extraordinary talents of speech and writing. The books authored by him gave greatly enriched the repository of Ahmadiyya literature. Some of the well-known titles are: Biography of Hazrat Fazl-e-Omar, Murder in the name of Allah, Maudoodi Islam, What Ahmadiyyat gave to the world, and The Moral Excellence of the Holy Prophet in Wars.</p>
<p>Hazrat Hafiz Mirza Nasir, Khalifatul Masih III passed away on the 9th of June, 1982 and the following day Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad Sahib was elected as Khalifatul Masih IV. Under his able guidance and with divine help, the Jamaat is making great strides. Progress and advancement is evident in every respect - geographically, historically, morally, and spiritually.</p>
<p>Allah says in the Holy Quran, "He indeed prospers who purifies it" 91:10. As such purification of soul is regarded the foremost guiding principle for the followers of Allah's prophets. Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV has exhorted the Jamaat to achieve this end in various ways some of which are mentioned here.</p>
<p>Huzur emphasised on the importance of observing congregational Prayer Service. He dealt with this topic in three phases - in Friday Sermon of 1st April 1983 and in various sermons since 8th November 1985. On 17th June 1988, he once again stressed the need for establishing and strengthening communion with Allah through prayers. With Allah's grace, these dynamic exhortations are producing good results and the general improvement in moral and spiritual standards of the Jamaat in quite evident.</p>
<p>The so-called modern society has shattered the dignity of woman under the illusion of equality. The manner in which Islam has safeguarded the honour and esteem of woman in deprecated and subjected to misplaced criticism. In his question and answer session and Press Conferences, Huzur not only refuted this criticism, he also enunciated the true status of woman in Islam. He exhorted the Ahmadi women to observe "Purdah" strictly and to safeguard the Islamic values. In his sermon at the annual Ahmadiyya conference of 1982, he warned the Ahmadi women against the perils of western culture and conveyed to them the significance and importance of Islamic Purdah.</p>
<p>In consequence of this guidance, most of the Ahmadi ladies in western countries now meticulously observe Purdah.</p>
<p>Islam has propounded very noble teachings about family life and the Holy Prophet was a model of moral excellence in this respect. Some people do not follow this good example and transgress Quranic teachings. In his Friday Sermon of 14th February, 1986, Huzur exhorted the Ahmadis to completely root out this behaviour from their daily lives and foster graciousness between kindred and in-laws. In response many families have forsworn their past attitude.</p>
<p>The Ahmadis as a group stand out from others as comparatively free from the shackles of un-Islamic customs and superstitions. Shortcomings do arise at times and Huzur has particularly laid stress to eradicate them. In his sermons of 8th March, 1985 and 10th May, 1985, Huzur enjoined the Ahmadis to eschew giving dowry beyond means, exchanging gifts on New Year Day or other similar customs.</p>
<p>The Muslims celebrate Eid twice a year. The affluent generally move within the narrow confines of their own circle. In his Eid Sermon of 1983, Huzur asked the wealthy Ahmadis to go to the homes of their poor brethren to wish them happy Eid and offer them gifts. In compliance of this directive, the delectation of Eid in Ahmadi society has escalated significantly and this is the very substance and philosophy of Islamic festival of Eid.</p>
<p>To derive real profit from the teachings of Quran, one must be righteous. Allah says, "It is a guidance for the righteous." 2:3. In a gathering the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pointed his finger towards his chest and said, "The righteousness should be here". Elucidating this Hadith, the Promised Messiah pronounced "Righteousness is a virtue that should be rooted in the heart." The Khalifatul Masih IV reflected elaborately on this topic in various sermons. The righteousness nourished with the awe and love of Allah is supreme and perpetual.</p>
<p>The preaching of Islam is obligatory for every Muslim. In the present age it is only the Ahmadiyya Movement which is actively engaged in this great effort and this fact is conceded by our antagonists also. Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV has vastly expanded this programme of preaching and propagation. The Ahmadis by and large are now perceptive to this call and in addition there is a regular cadre of preachers. On the whole, the implementation of the programme in as many as 152 countries of the world.</p>
<p>In the era of the 4th Caliph, the Jamaat has come to exercise considerable influence winning more and more adherents, among them eminent personalities and tribal kings. In 1987, two such kings from Nigeria made the covenant and joined Jamaat. Thus the Promised Messiah's revelation, "Kings will seek blessings from thy clothes" found fulfilment once again. Huzur bestowed sacred relics of the Promised Messiah on these two kings when they presented themselves during the annual Ahmadiyya Conference in London in 1987.</p>
<p>The Promised Messiah was commissioned by God for rejuvenating Islam and disseminating the Holy Quran. During the time of the 2nd and 3rd Caliphs, translation of the Holy Quran was done in different languages. This work has been considerably accelerated now. Translations in fifty one languages of the world have been completed and published. Translation of 300 selected verses of the Quran in 118 languages of the world have been done. This monumental achievement has no parallel in the last 1400 years.</p>
<p>To achieve the highest grades of excellence and purification, spending in the cause of Allah is proclaimed a virtue of great merit subordinated only to the performance of prayer. It is a measure of the grand spiritual revolution brought about by the Promised Messiah that the Ahmadis are always prepared and eager to spend money in the cause of Allah. Their zeal for such voluntary sacrifices has been ever growing having greatly accelerated in the era of Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV.</p>
<p>The annual budget of Jamaat has reached 1 billion mark. This figure represents the Obligatory Donations only. There are other categories like Tehrik-e-Jadid, Waqf-e-Jadid, Syedna Bilal Fund and Propagation of Quran Fund. Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV journeys many countries each year. This is to oversee, streamline, extend and accelerate the multifarious activities of the Jamaat. The countries graced by him are Africa, East and West, Far East, Europe, America and Canada.</p>
<p>Only one and half month after becoming Khalifa, Huzur travelled to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Holland, UK and Australia. He inaugurated the "Basharat Mosque" the first ever to be built in Spain in 750 years. He addressed 18 press conferences wherein he provided erudite interpretation of Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>For seven weeks in 1983 (Aug. 22 - Oct. 14) he visited Singapore, Fiji, Australia and Sri Lanka. Laying the foundation stone of "Bait-ul-Huda" mosque and Mission House at Sydney was a momentous event of this tour. He also addressed a crowded press conference at the University of Canberra where he expounded the beauty of Islamic values. In December 1984, he undertook a tour of Holland, Germany and France. Plans for establishing big centres were discussed.</p>
<p>In September 1985, Huzur again visited European countries. New Missions in Holland, Belgium, West Germany were declared open. A sprawling and spacious centre, "Nasir Gardens" was inaugurated. Huzur travelled to seven European countries, opened five new missions and examined the prospects of establishing another four. In addition to question and answer sessions, four press conferences were addressed.</p>
<p>From Mid August to 7th October, 1986, Huzur visited Canada, Holland, West Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain where he met eminent personalities and also the press. During the tour, foundation stone of the first Ahmadiyya Mosque in Canada was laid.</p>
<p>The same year he graced the Annual Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya gathering in Frankfurt and also visited Belgium and Holland. In 1987, he travelled twice to European countries, USA and Canada. This was indeed a history making tour as many new Missions were inaugurated. He met a cross section of eminent persons and conveyed to them the Islamic teachings in a most persuasive way. He was hailed in many cities of America where the day was declared "Mirza Tahir Ahmad Day".</p>
<p>In January 1988, he set his foot in West Africa for the first time. This tour of six countries spanning over five weeks was highly successful. Tumultuous welcome greeted him everywhere, Gambia, Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria. Various Presidents, Ministers, Parliamentarians and Paramount Chiefs met him. The President of Sierra Leone was with him for half an hour. He offered him the use of his personal helicopter and also assigned Police Personnel for his security. Throughout the country, the government made arrangements for his stay. Likewise the government of Liberia provided him use of two Chauffeur-driven cars as well as a Police Squad for security duty. There was meeting with the President and Vice President of Ghana. In almost all these countries, Radio and TV gave ample and appreciative coverage to Huzur's activities. Medical and educational institutions provided by the Movement for the benefit of the people were highly praised.</p>
<p>Returning from his tour, Huzur proclaimed:</p>
<p>"I perceive Light not Darkness in this continent. Many outsiders came here and exploited the people. The wealth of Africa was used elsewhere. Allah has inspired a plan in my mind that the Ahmadiyya Movement would procure funds elsewhere in the world but utilise here in Africa." Huzur created an exclusive department and charged it with fostering the renaissance and revival of the African people. He also urged Ahmadi doctors, teachers and specialists in other fields to offer themselves for service in Africa. Same year in March/April, Huzur visited Frankfurt and Glasgow. In August/September, he travelled to East Africa and Mauritius. This was the first time ever that an Ahmadi Khalifa had travelled to this part of the world. He visited Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania besides Mauritius. This was, again a very successful visit. Some mosques were inaugurated. Various Ahmadis got the opportunity of meeting with exalted personage and benefiting from his sublime discourses.</p>
<p>All these tours by the head of the world-wide Ahmadiyya Movement strengthened and uplifted the spirituality and created awakening among the Ahmadi masses. These were instrumental in dispelling the wrong notions about Islam held by a section of the educated classes. On occasions, the critics were confounded when Huzur expounded the correct interpretation of Islamic teachings and were impelled to embrace Islam there and then. In the course of his African tour, hundreds of persons got initiated in Ahmadiyyat.</p>
<p>Whenever any prophet of Allah comes, he and his followers are opposed and derided. It has been the same with Jamaat Ahmadiyya the followers of the Promised Messiah ever since its inception. In 1974 the government of Pakistan embarked on their persecution which reached most cruel dimensions with the promulgation of Zia-ul-Haq's Ordinance XX in 1984. The Ahmadis were tormented and persecuted continuously and life was made unbearable for them. But they displayed amazing steadfastness and spirit of sacrifice. In the face of such horrible oppression they stood firm like a rock. Their fearless resolve stems from their unshakeable faith that they hold fast the rope of Allah in the form of Khilafat. Under the guidance of Khilafat the machinations, intrigues and campaigns of derision are met with fortitude, highest grade of virtues and beneficence, reminiscent of the earliest Muslims.</p>
<p>The tortures perpetuated on peace loving Ahmadis grew ever harsher. Some two dozen Ahmadis are martyred. The Holy Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement is subjected to slander and blasphemous allegations. Profane and foul language is used against other venerable persons of the Jamaat. Such dirty propaganda is spread throughout the world. The Jamaat does not posses enough resources to reply. Yet our Imam, Khalifatul Masih administered cogent refutations to the "White Paper" brought out by the government of Pakistan. This refutation was contained in a series of 18 booklets issued from London, and later published in one volume.</p>
<p>All efforts of their reformation having failed, all precepts fallen on deaf ears, warning of Divine punishments unheeded and having exhausted every other avenue, the Khalifatul Masih IV, on 10th June, 1988, now challenged all their TOP leaders for a "Mubahala". Let the matter be judged by Allah, The Best of Judges.</p>
<p>One month after the challenge of Mubahala, Maulavi Aslam Qureshi who had gone underground capriciously, reappeared. It had been alleged that he was abducted and then murdered, and the name of the Head of Ahmadiyya Community was maliciously implicated. Aslam Qureshi's appearance was an ignominious disgrace for the opponents.</p>
<p>The admonitory destruction of General Zia-ul-Haq on 17th August, 1988 (only nine weeks after the challenge of Mubahala) is the manifestation of another Grand Sign for the Truth of Ahmadiyyat.</p>
<p>Blessed are those who take heed of divine signs, recognise the Reformer of the Age and come together under the banner of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and those who are steadfast in their allegiance to the institution of Khilafat. May Allah shower His Blessings on them. Ameen!</p>

<p>Pete Bennett (born <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">22 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>) is a <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a> singer (with <a href="../../../d/a/d/Daddy_Fantastic_84a3.html" title="Daddy Fantastic">Daddy Fantastic</a>) from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, and the winner of <i>Big Brother 7</i>. He has <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>, although his symptoms are reported to have been aggravated by drug use.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Pete's characteristic phonic <a href="../../../t/i/c/Tic.html" title="Tic">tic</a> is a loud shout of "<a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html" title="Wanker">wankers</a>".</p>
<p>There is ambiguity over Pete's surname. Some claim that it is "Bennett"<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and some that it is Stephenson.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> He uses his father's name Bennett, but his violinist mother is <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Stephenson_af83.html" title="Anne Stephenson">Anne Stephenson</a>, having remarried.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> During a conversation with Aisleyne, he said that he, like her, had a double-barrelled name, which explains the discrepancies. Pete's prized possession is a teddy-bear given to him by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Smith_%28musician%29_e57b.html" title="Robert Smith (musician)">Robert Smith</a>, lead singer of band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cure_83a6.html" title="The Cure">The Cure</a> with whom his mother has played.</p>
<p>Pete had many admirers in the House (Lea, Nikki, Aisleyne, Lisa and Jennie), and it was noted that he had strong feelings toward Nikki. However, psychologists on <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother%27s_Big_Brain_5e3c.html" title="Big Brother's Big Brain">Big Brother's Big Brain</a> have concluded that he fancied Aisleyne the most.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Between Nikki's eviction and her return to the main house on Day 86, Pete attended the Diary Room several times to express his feelings of loss and anger, at times crying in the bathroom, but was aided quickly by his friends. Nikki claimed that she was 'in love with Pete' during her eviction interview with host Davina McCall.</p>
<p>Pete was the centre of many of the show's funniest moments, such as falling into the pool whilst desperately trying to avert it. During a task where the housemates wrote their future autobiographies, Pete stated that after leaving the house "I sat on my arse doing nothing. I filled my face with spam and shaved my right testicle whilst making love to a wellington boot. I changed my name to Deidre and wore a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosthetic.html" title="Prosthetic">prosthetic</a> head. I lived in my own intestines, where I became lord ruler of the turds. Then I was sectioned."</p>
<p>Pete was the bookmaker's favourite since week one to win the series. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Pete won <i>Big Brother 7</i> with 61.2% of the final vote (between him and Glyn).<br clear="left" /></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-20_91e3.html" title="Edit section: Mittelafrika">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mittelafrika</span></h2>
<p>Mittelafrika is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleropa, it articulated Germany's foreign policy aim, prior to World War I, of bringing the region under German domination. The difference being that Mittelafrika would presumably be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states.</p>
<p>German strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania minus the island of Zanzibar), German South West Africa (Namibia minus Walvisbaai), and Kamerun could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Belgian Congo alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The concept dates back to the 1890s, when then Chancellor of Germany, Leo von Caprivi, gained the Caprivi Strip in the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty. This addition to German South West Africa attached the colony to the Zambezi River. British and German imperialists competed to get Portugal to cede the colonies of Angola and Mozambique to them and competed over the region which is now comprised of Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. Cecil Rhodes, on behalf of the British, successfully colonised the latter region (named Rhodesia, after Rhodes), while the Germans and British each preferred that Angola and Mozambique remain Portuguese colonies, rather than risk them falling into the hands of their colonial rival.</p>
<p>Germany's aspirations in Mittelafrika were incorporated into Germany's aims in World War I insofar as Germany expected to be able to gain the Belgian Congo if it were to defeat Belgium in Europe. The full realisation of Mittelafrika depended on a German victory in World War I in the European theatre, where Britain would be forced to negotiate and cede its colonies in Rhodesia to Germany when faced with a German-dominated Europe across the English Channel. In the course of the actual war, German aspirations in Mittelafrika were never matched by events in the African theatre. The German colonies were at very different levels of defence and troop strength when the war began in Europe, and were not in a position to fight a war due to a lack of materiel.</p>

<p>Ratu Ivereimi (also spelt Ifereimi) Ravoka is the oldest son of the late <i>Turaga Na</i> Ratu Mai Verata<i>, Ratu Ilisoni Qionibaravi Ravoka.</i></p>
<p>He succeded his father in ascendency to the Paramountcy of Verata in the province of Tailevu in the small South Pacific Island nation of Fiji. His seat of power is the chiefly village of Ucunivanua, located on the Eastern Coast of the island of Viti Levu, the largest island in the Fiji Group. In pre-colonial periods Verata exercised wide dominion over the island but was suddenly swept aside with the introduction of firearms, mainly into the hands of her chief rivals.</p>
<p>He resides in the township of Nabua, on the outskirts of Fiji's capital city of Suva.</p>

<p>Shoplifter records was an English record company created by producer Gordon Raphael and Paul Harrison as a partnership in 2003. Raphael has acted as producer for many bands, but most notibly for The Strokes' albums "Is this it?" and "Room on fire." Shoplifter signed Regina Spektor to her first contract and released the album "Soviet Kitsch" after teaming up with Sony music for international licensing. The label also signed The Redwalls' album "Universal blues" which went unreleased in the UK because of the imminent release of the bands first major release, "De Nova" via Capitol records. Other artists to pass through shoplifter's doors are The Satellites and Char Johnson.</p>
<p>The following year saw the merger of Sony music and BMG which also coincided with Gordon Raphael relocating to Berlin. These conditions led to the dissipation of the company.</p>
<p>The label's first single "Your honour" by Regina Spektor was NME single of the week, beating Brian Wilson, Robbie Williams and R.E.M. amongst others. The album "Soviet Kitsch" was voted into the top 50 albums in the majority of that year's music press and broadsheet reviews.</p>
<p>Gordon Raphael is currently producing bands in the UK, most recently with Skin. Paul Harrison is currently working with artists including Louise Hull, The Negatives and The Redwalls</p>

<p>BasicXL was a replacement Basic language for the Atari 8-bit computers. It was 16K in size as opposed to the built in and slightly flawed Atari Basic. It had many new commands and was upwardly compatible with any Atari Basic. This was due to Bill Wilkinson, who worked for SAI, which foundered and became a one-person company. Bill continued his work on Atari basic and produced both Basic/a+, Basic XL, and finally BasicXE which were available from his new company, OSS.</p>

<p>[[[Episode Summary]]] While Raven's parents are away, Raven's grandmother Viv, babysits Cory and Raven. Meanwhile, Raven has visions about her friend's futures. She sees Chelsea walking down "Jock Block" (the hallway where thejocks loiter) and the jocks were gawking at her. In reality, as she was walking down the hallway, the jocks were pointing and laughing at Chelsea because she had toilet paper stuck on the back of her skirt. After that, Raven and Chelsea find Eddie faking a leg injury in order to avoid climbing the rock wall because of his fear of hights. Raven has a vision of Eddie climbing the wall and hitting the buzzer at the top. Later that day he attempts to climb the wall, however he gets scared and everyone in the gym laughs at him. Chelsea and Eddie both blame Raven because she told them her visions causing them to do things that they would not ordinarily do. That night Raven seeks solace in her grandmother who tells Raven that she is psychic as well. The next day, Raven tells Chelsea and Eddie that she will no longer tell them her visions. Later that day, Raven has visions of her friends that prevent her friends from humiliations, however, keeping her promise, she does not tell them and her friends become humiliated. Later that night, Eddie climbs the rock wall and hits the buzzer on the top of the wall. However, Raven has a vision that Eddie is in trouble and alerts Chelsea. They both rush to help him and in an attempt to rescue Eddie, Raven and Chelsea become stuck on the wall also. While hanging from the wall, Raven and her friends make up and tell each other that they might still have fights, but it is a part of life.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-20_91e3.html" title="Edit section: DJ Demigod">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">DJ Demigod</span></h2>
<p>Born in the Ukraine, Dj Demigod considered the "godfather" of hardcore by Urb magazine, is one of the o.g. figures in the American techno scene. Originating from the Bay Area rave community circa 1991, Dj Demigod quickly established himself as a true pioneer of the hardcore sound. Domestically, Dj Demigod has performed at legendary events such as the first Cyberfest, the first Armageddon, and the first Underworld to recent performances for mega-promoters such as CPU101, Coolworld, Insomniac, Technostate, Philipsyed, Opium, and Chemically Unbalanced. Internationally, performances include world famous events and clubs such as the "Bunkor" in Berlin, which was the largest Techno club in all of Europe at the time, the world famous "Eurotech 2000" club in London, and the legendary "Number One" club in Italy. Other international performace locations include Switzerland, Italy, Canada, England, Germany, Scotland, Ukraine, and Austria. Dj Demigod's first 12-inch release, "D-Day," dropped in 1997 on America's oldest hardcore techno record label, New York's Industrial Strength. The record was an instant success and was heralded by some of the top dj's and magazines in the world. The legendary Dj Slipmat in Muzik magazine issue ..26, proclaimed that the record was "arranged with total originality." Likewise in issue ..22 of Dream Magazine, Dj Scott Brown wrote that this record is "3 tracks of extreme dance till you drop hardcore...Ruff Beats collectors should not miss out." The following year, Dj Demigod formed System Records which released the first all hardcore record west of the Mississippi. Entitled "Seismic Rumble," the record came out in January of 1998. He followed that up with "Scud Attack" and "Urban Equation" on the System Records label. One of the reasons behind the string of successful 12-inch vinyl releases is the revolutionary technique Dj Demigod implements in constructing his songs. His method of song creating involves placing each beat in by hand in real-time with an absolute minimum of computer sequencing assistance. Unlike with many other electronic music producers, common methods such as quantizing and looping are rarely used. In the last couple of years, Dj Demigod accepted the position of techno editor at Freebass magazine. On video you can catch Dj Demigod on the nationally televised "Freak City T.V." (episodes 1,6,,11) and the Insomniac/Go Ventures "Together As One" documentary, while on print interviews can be found in Thunder and Insider Magazines and websites such as Groovetech and Thump. Ever since 1991, Dj Demigod has continued to release solo and collaboration mix projects with artists such as Ron D. Core, Rob Gee, Omar Santana, and Lenny Dee. Check out www.systemrecords.com for the dozen or so megamixes that are currently available. Although Dj demigod's past is impressive indeed, it is his future that holds the most promise and potential. Projects released include the third volume of the "United States of Hardcore" which debuted at the "Area 51"" massive in S.F.. Also released is a double CD project on N.Y.s The Music Cartel entitled "Ruff Beats One Step Back." Dj Demigod showcases a megamix on the first CD while Lenny Dee presents a compilation on the second CD. Also in release is "Industrial Fucking Strength 4" on Industrial Strength Records. A CD planned for a winter release is a compilation Dj Demigod is putting together for System Records. This 10 year anniversary CD project will feature the very best of System Records circa 1996-2006. Perhaps the most unique project Dj Demigod has released, is the cult classic Hollywood film entitled "From Hell" which debuted at ..1 on Oct 19th. This remake of the "Jack the Ripper" story features original beats written and produced by Dj Demigod. The movie stars two of the world's most renowned superstars, Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Dj Demigod is the first and only Hardcore Dj/Producer to have a music/sound credit in a full length feature film! With the best yet to come from this veteran of the hardcore techno and rave movement, you can rest assured that Dj Demigod will continue to bring the future of electronic music to the people of today, as well as those of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Rockandrollbadboy.com is a site owned by Brett Meisner. Meisner is a self-proclaimed rock critic and journalist who lives in Hollywood and often writes about his daily life and Hollywood adventures.The site also features several pages that are devoted to Jim Morrison and The Doors, including a photograph from the Paris gravesite of Jim Morrison that seems to show a ghostly image in the background.</p>
<p><br />
Whether the site or the persona of Brett Meisner is real or not is often debated. Many think it is a parody, while others feel that it might be a desperate cry for help or attention. Meisner's frequent television appearances and radio intreviews, combined with backstage celebrity photographs help bolster his claim that he is in fact the real deal.</p>
<p><br />
In late 2005 Meisner began a campaign to promote an LA based band name "Orson." Meisner's promotion of the band caught the ears of a UK based A&amp;R representative who in turn promoted the band overseas. Orson were signed to Mercury records a month later and release a number one record in the UK.</p>

As a writer he was integral to BBm (formerly Bassline) and their move south of the border from Northern Ireland to encompass all Ireland. He has also wrote extensively for M8 magazine (Scotland), Eternity magazine (England), The Event Guide (Ireland) and published Hold It Down (Ireland). As a label boss he runs and owns Nice &amp; Nasty records, home of Dave Ingham, Derek Carr, Produse, Source Code, Tomas Jirku, and friend and collaborator with Chymera/I Am An Exit, T-Polar, Matthew Bushwacka, Fabrice Lig, Dan Curtin and Soma records. Nice &amp; Nasty also released the seminal Irish dance floor smash 'Bolivian Angel' by Ubiquity who later became Agnelli &amp; Nelson. As a remixer producer Desy had music out there under various different guises:</p>

<p>Desy is a product of the ear;y rave scene in Northern Ireland. Inspired by David Holmes, Iain McReady, Glen Molloy and some others he like many broke the cultural barriers of division and was part of a generation of young Northern Irish people partying together before the ceasfire and peace accord changed things for the better. Since then he has stayed true to that idea of unity and peace and worked with people from all communities, both sides of the border with one aim in mind cool music and good times.</p>

<p>Cockwrangler or 'coque-rangler', or 'cop-strangler (slang)' refers to a police man who belongs to a section of the Police Force who believe in handcuffing penises.. or cock-cuffing, rather than using the wrist as a stable hold on the criminal. This has proved to be an effective way of restraining the arrested with 37% less breakaways. This method is currently being reviewed but will hopefully be on the streets by the end of 2007.</p>

<p>Massive-mafia is a online text based game where your ultimate is to reach the highest rank, be the strongest player with a large crew and run the game by using your hard earned powers. In order to be respected you have to socialize with your fellow players, gain respect amongst the community and have other powerful players help you. When you step into this new world as a Empty Suit you will have to walk your way up into the ranks by doing crimes, sell drugs on the local streets of the cities and invest your hard earned cash smart in the drugs to deal them. You will have to work hard in order to gain ranks but just think of the satisfaction you will have when you reach a new rank and then finally you are able to start a crew. Of course you need to have enough respect for this amongst the other players else you will not last long. You will always have to watch your back in this world because there will always be players who will dislike you for your skills, powers and of course your actions.</p>
