<p>This unreferenced stub about fails to show that it is notable. It is a 2.4 mile (4km) road connecting Interstate 94 with a small street in a small town.

Hiway fans keep claiming there is precedent that a numbered state hiway is inherently notable, but the precedent is lack of consensus and strong dispute that anything, least of all this 2.4 miles of pavement, is automatically notable. The only references anyone has found during this debate are a map and a printout of a bid list, both exceedingly trivial covreage. Lots of improvements costing $600,000 like the bid shown are also not notable, even if the government paid for them and they bear a number. Firetrucks and airplanes cost that much and also have numbers, but we do not have an article for every individual one. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> Don't mischaracterize the precedents given, please. While the first one is, yes, no concensus, the other two were <b>keeps</b>, including <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Minnesota_State_Highway_91_3f4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Minnesota State Highway 91">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Minnesota_State_Highway_91</a>, which is very similar to this case, which the result was <b>keep</b>. Moreover, more precedents can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_New_York_State_Route_365_f87a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/New York State Route 365">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Georgia_State_Route_160_3954.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Georgia State Route 160">here</a>. Note that the latter is route that no longer actively exists. If a state finds a route notable enough to number the route, then it should be considered notable. Using this test is much less arbitary and more consistent; it's either numbered by the state or isn't, as opposed to the myriad reasons given for deleting state route articles in the past. And numbering by the state doesn't change because different people contribute to a AfD. In addition, state highways are found in government reports, atlases, travel guides, etc. Hardly unencyclopedic by any means, and even if it's only borderline encyclopedic, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wikipedia_is_not_paper">m:Wikipedia is not paper</a>—articles can be created that would not appear in a paper encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. State highways are part of the main skeleton in a state's road infrastructure and valid enough topics in covering the transport system. Trying to establish a minimum length for notability will be an arbitrary condition, so we are better off just keeping all of the numbered highways.

<dd>The state highway series of articles is a good example of the tyranny of the majority, even in a setting that strives for consensus.

<li><b>Comment</b> The arguments for keeping articles on highways, (some articles are about "highways" as short as 0.3 miles} could be applied as well to mailboxes. Should we have articles on each of them? <i>"The mailbox was installed and marked by the U.S. Postal System, for the use of persons wishing to send mail. It is part of the U.S. Postal system, established in the 18th century. It is a part of the main skeleton system of the U.S. Postal Service and a valid enough topic in covering the mail system."</i> The same arguments could be applied to city streets, power pylons, bridges, drainage ditches, salt trucks, school buses, locomotives, railroad tracks, airport runways, undergound pipelines, television masts, fire engines, schools, libraries, dormitories, municipal wells, sewage plants, and all other infrastructure. They were installed by authorities to benefit the puiblic and given identifying names or numbers.

<li><b>Comment.</b> If there were hundreds of millions of these state routes that were very short like this one, then yes, your mailbox or drainage ditch analogy would prove apt. If Minnesota labeled every stretch of pavement as a state highway, then your comparison would prove apt. But there aren't, and Minnesota doesn't. We're talking about a part of limited, specific system, not every single foot of pavement. Here's a more valid comparison, look at the thousands of little podunk towns that have just one source, census data. Those have the same amount of outside coverage and locality as this route. Yet we have thousands of those articles! However, note that those incorporated towns that have articles are all a part of a subset of a much, much larger group of locales--they're incorporated towns, recognized by the state government. We don't have articles on every single crossroads, every single subdivision, every single spot in the state. In both cases, we're talking about a specific group of geographic entities (state highways and incorporated towns) that the state has recognized to be significant enough to place into a specific subset (by numbering or incorporation) out of a larger group (of all of the roads or all of the named locales, subdivisions, etc). --<b><font color="green">HowardSF</font></b>-<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardSF_69a4.html" title="User:HowardSF">U</a>­-<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowardSF_40bc.html" title="User talk:HowardSF">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HowardSF_aa28.html" title="Special:Contributions/HowardSF">C</a>- 16:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
