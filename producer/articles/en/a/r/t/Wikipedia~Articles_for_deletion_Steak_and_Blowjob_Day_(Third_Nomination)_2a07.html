<li><b>Keep</b>: The holiday is 4 years old now, I personally celebrated it this year with a friend despite not living in Boston and having never heard of this DJ, and the article is currently the #1 result on Google for "steak and a bj day". I just looked it up randomly tonight when a friend questioned the date, leading me to this discussion. In short, the subject of this article is considerably more notable now than when it was deleted last year. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaindog469_eeb1.html" title="User:Raindog469">Raindog469</a> 04:02, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - having the article being #1 Google result for a search of the actual term is not much of an argument for keeping the article - if I made up a hoax article on "Give Confusing Manifestation Money Day" it would be number 1 in its search. More important would be things like - is it being covered in major media? Is there a chance of it getting included in some kind of official calendar? Does anyone notable publicly endorse it? If you can give strong positive answers to those, then you can put them in the article, and maybe make it saveable. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 13:27, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>According to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Precedence</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Entertainment" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Radio Stations with a license are noteable</a>, and can then also (in a weak fashion) be a major media outlet. Its not solid, of course, but it helps the articles case.

The chance of it showing on a calander is completely objective too, and shouldnt really be considered as an against point. Many day-to-day calanders have many random, interesting or inane facts on them, all produced by major print companies, and a day like this would fit right into one of those forms. The calander I use is made by a major publisher, and it doesnt have Hanaka listed, or many other major holidays, nor does it have many minor holidays. <a href="../../../t/r/j/User%7ETrjn_9e48.html" title="User:Trjn">Trjn</a> 15:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Trjn, while I'm a pretty strong supporter of this new holiday, the pirate one is called <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_like_a_pirate_day.html" title="Talk like a pirate day">Talk like a pirate day</a> and not "speak like a pirate day". The former dwarfs the various permutations of Steak and Blowjob Day on Google Trends, likely due to the necessity among those promoting Steak and Blowjob Day in the mainstream media of referring to it as "Steak and _______ Day" where "_______" is some euphemism. To Confusing Manifestation, however, I would point out that this article is not a hoax; the holiday does exist and the Google search I previously mentioned <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=steak+and+a+bj+day&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=steak+and+a+bj+day&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> shows many other hits including the 4-year-old "steakandbjday.com" domain, which comes in at #3. Given the subject matter it's not that surprising that people might feel it was an offhanded radio joke, but as also previously mentioned, some of us who don't live in New England or listen to that sort of radio show do celebrate it. Novelty does not equal lack of notability, nor does an uncomfortable concept. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaindog469_eeb1.html" title="User:Raindog469">Raindog469</a> 16:42, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Would anyone who has no new argument to this please refrain from just voting 'per nom' or via a previous complaint, especially considering the nomination only mentioned noteability and it was shown that Precedence gave this holiday noteability. AfD is <b>NOT</b> a voting system, it is <b>NOT</b> a democracy, it doesnt really matter if you agree with someone but cant bring anything new to the table. <a href="../../../t/r/j/User%7ETrjn_9e48.html" title="User:Trjn">Trjn</a> 07:34, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree strongly with the above. While you are correct that this is not a vote, the whole point is to reach a consensus. Consensus means <i>general agreement or unanimity</i>. What better way to form consensus than to have people say they agree with the original proposition? Are you suggesting that if people agree completely with the nomination that they just don't add their voice at all? -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 12:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it is not a vote, then why would you want people to come into the talk and then vote and add nothing new? The decision should be heavily influenced by the argument within the topic itself, if someone wishes to counterargue any point then that is fantastic and is heavily encouraged. Voting, and 'reaching a consensus' is foolish, you cannot reach a consensus with only the parties who are interested to vote, or the odd person who stumbles across the VfD to vote. The only way to reach one would be to poll a large group outside the influence of Wikipedia after they read the article. The point of this is to see if the article is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, if it meets the standards or notability, not if people think it should be in or not. -<a href="../../../t/r/j/User%7ETrjn_9e48.html" title="User:Trjn">Trjn</a> 15:51, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Per nom" means that they agree with the nom, so it is expressing their opinion, not just voting. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 20:27, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's worth clarifying what <i>not voting</i> means. In a vote, there are strict rules about who is eligible to vote, and if you meet those eligibility requirements, your vote gets counted. Add up all the votes, and whichever side comes out with a bigger sum wins. With the system we have here, whoever closes the discussion has a lot of flexibility to decide which votes count and which don't (i.e. sockpuppets), and then apply some judgement as to whether consensus has been reached without being bound by some strict and exact numerical threshold. If twenty people write nothing more than <i>Delete per nom</i> and two people write long cogent essays on why the article should be keep, that's still a consensus to delete (assuming no sockpuppetry or the like). -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 21:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is, everyone is agreeing to a nomination that has been shown to be in-large false.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just noticed that the nom itself contains what I consider to be an inaccurate statement, to wit, "A day made up by one radio guy is not notable." Well, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Professionals%27_Day_63aa.html" title="Administrative Professionals' Day">Administrative Professionals' Day</a> was made up by one advertising guy, and rather than try to get it deleted, people who disagree the holiday exists have put in a reference to it being a <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallmark_holiday.html" title="Hallmark holiday">Hallmark holiday</a>. Since a holiday that discourages the use of greeting cards can't be a Hallmark holiday, maybe the deleters would be better served by adding a section like "Some feel this holiday doesn't actually exist and was only meant as a joke." So far the arguments against notability are: (a) coined by one guy for self-promotion (countered by Sadie Hawkins Day and Administrative Professionals Day, each of which was coined by one guy), (b) not actually celebrated by anyone (a trap, really, because celebrating it apparently makes me ineligible to oppose its deletion according to one deleter), (c) intended as a joke (again, Sadie Hawkins Day was plainly meant as a joke originally, as is Talk like a Pirate Day.)

<li><b>Comment</b>. As for saying that the event is notable because it was a major event created by a radio station and radio stations are notable, that could easily become the beginning of a slippery slope of similar arguments - association with notability is not enough to create notability in itself, and even then doesn't necessarily imply enough notability to have its own article. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 15:16, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
