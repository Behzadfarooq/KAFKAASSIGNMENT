<ul>
<li>Possibly, especially since this is just a rant that is more POV than helping the encyclopaedia. Wikipedia is not paper. There's also crystalballery in there. Pok√©mon is surviving very well in post-fad status, (a Pok√©mon theme park has recently opened in Japan. Would they have risked all that money on a fad?) So the generation of tomorrow may still find Pok√©mon articles interesting. And even if it did die away, it has still become a part of recent history which, once the article is expanded, will remain interesting. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 20:48, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But there tends to be more variety to Pok√©mon than yo-yos or frisbees. Besides, it has remained strongly popular in non-fad status. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 15:16, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because there is more variety does not mean that it ALL has to be covered in large length (ie individual pokemon pages). Has it really stayed popular enough that a page on each pokemon and his playing card stats are neccesary? I would say that a page explaining each series or new group of pokemon and listing the pokemon therein would be enough. There arent individual yo-yo pages because despite all the variation it has, only a yo-yo geek would care about it, and to an extent such pages would be Advertisement since they would highlight a particular type of yo-yo.
<ul>
<li>Yes, it has stayed popular enough. It is POV to say it hasn't. More people will care about Pok√©mon than the 'geeks'. Maybe there will be a kid who just plays the games and watches the anim√©. On Saturday's episode, a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimecho.html" title="Chimecho">Chimecho</a> will debue as a main character. Wanting to know more, they can look in the Chimecho article. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 10:15, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Highly speculative. You've mentioned several times that <i>more people</i> care about pokemon, I take that to mean, more people will begin to care about pokemon, which is contrary to what is/has happened. I won't even touch the laughable POV statement. -<a href="../../../a/f/c/User%7EAfC_d9ad.html" title="User:AfC">√Öf√á++</a> 18:04, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> Geeks and kids and genuinely curious people (myself being all three categories) plus many others will want to look at this. Yes, Pok√®mon was a fad. So was rollerskating. Do you still see rollerskates in stores? Yes. As long as it makes money, Pok√®mon will exist. As long as Pok√®mon exists, as long as anything exists, there will be a Wikipedia article for it as long as more than one person is interested in it (I've never seen a Stantler fan club but I'm sure there is one). By the way, Pok√®mon is NOT just a trading card game. It's also a video game, a cartoon, and a whole bunch of other stuff. The only reason it hasn't been around very long is that it was created very recently. You said chess was better? Wait 600 years and then we'll talk.

With the trading card game, video games, anim√©, various manga, etc, the only way Stantler could fit into a merged article is being discussed in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokeprosal_9c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokeprosal">Wikipedia:Pokeprosal</a>. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 10:27, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)

Sherlock Holmes references have appeared in everything from CSI episodes to <i>The Great Mouse Detective</i> and he was inducted into the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2002. WP:FICT is saying that characters need to take on a existence of their own <i>outside their original setting</i> , like Sherlock, Batman, Cruella De Vil, Winnie the Pooh to merit their own articles. Sorry, but outside the Pokemon universe (which <b>includes</b> the cards, comics, movies, cartoons, whatever), I cannot think of anywhere Stantler has popped up or is likely to.

<li>Quite often, they <i>do not</i> see their mistake, and they instead believe that Wikipedia is missing an article, follow the instructions at <a href="../../../n/o/a/MediaWiki%7ENoarticletext_56e7.html" title="MediaWiki:Noarticletext">Mediawiki:noarticletext</a>, and create duplicate articles. The argument for redirecting such articles is that deleting them would not prevent the same process from (wastefully) happening all over again, repeatedly. That is not the situation here, as this is a deliberate neologism. However, one editor has already stated that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vila_S%E9samo&amp;diff=15405240&amp;oldid=13456216" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vila_S%E9samo&amp;diff=15405240&amp;oldid=13456216" rel="nofollow">xe actually made this particular spelling mistake</a>, so the semi-policy of redirecting a spelling mistake that has occurred and that someone has created an article at can be applied. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:14, 2005 Jun 20 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I guess the standard human behavior in this situation would just consist of looking at what they typed (after getting an error screen) and going "Oh, I typed it wrong". I find it real hard that a person would just give up because of a small typo like that. Harder even would see someone creating a new article, thinking an article about the United States doesn't exist here. I think they'd just check their mistakes first before doing something like that.

<li><b>Redirect to United States</b>. I don't quite want to suggest "redirect all typos" as a policy, because I agree with Redirects for deletion/Precedents about extremely rare typos. This one isn't extremely rare. Moreover, the majority of words listed on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_words_for_American_4bc3.html" title="Alternative words for American">Alternative words for American</a> do not have their own entries, and the three words that do have attained notability justifying articles. Interestingly, "United Stated" isn't on that page, and even if it is a legitimate "alternative word for American", I don't think the phrase deserves its own entry, as compared to the rest of the terms at that article. I'd say this is non-notable dicdef, but due to the typo consideration, it needs to become a redirect rather than get deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 00:18, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>But all other webcomics have some sort of page. You may delete Kris Montello, but keep Doghouse Comics up. The only reason I see for it to be deleted is that it gives information on something that isn't yet popular.

<li><b>Keep</b> Doghouse Comics, but get rid of the rest. They aren't necessary and contain little information. However, like previously stated, many other comics have a page such as this, and the information provided could be useful, if not now, at least in future times.

<li>Ah, but, the Doghouse Comics article is much more in-depth and has more information than many other webcomic pages. And you must also take into consdieration that it is actually a collection of many webcomics, and contains cartoons and games, one of which won an award on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If popularity and the overall need of the article, and not the information that is presented itself, is what matters, what happens if DHC becomes very popular? It's entirely possible for it to happen in the very near future.</p>
<p>If you <i>must</i> delete it, allow me to recreate it in the future when and if it meets your criteria. But, for now, I think <b>keeping</b> benefits me, as I won't have to recreate it in the future, and I can explain what DHC is simply by linking them to the article (I've had trouble with this in the past, as it is an unusual webcomic) and it's just easier in general.</p>
<p>You really have me beat with those Guidelines, I had no idea they existed. But I really hope you consider the work that was put in. You can't deny that Doghouse Comics has more information than some other webcomic pages, and that the site itself has potential.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while I don't think there is need to delete it, if you HAVE TO, allow me to create it again in the future when it meets your criteria. Keep in mind, if that's the case, why delete it in the first place? If the whole thing fails, I'll ask you to delete it now. For now, <b>keep it</b>.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to vote on whether to keep it or not because I am the one who created the article. However, the article just explains what the character is with a description. It isn't meant to advertise as the comic has enough readers from being linked on fark.com twice. I draw two other comic strips that I don't have on wikipedia because I don't think they are worth it. Furthermore this is a valid webcomic of which there are many listed on wikipedia so if you delete this one you might as well delete all the rest like <a href="../../../g/o/d/Gods_of_Arr-Kelaan_6172.html" title="Gods of Arr-Kelaan">Gods_of_Arr-Kelaan</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Your_Sheep_b5c8.html" title="Count Your Sheep">Count_Your_Sheep</a> BOTH of which know me. If you want to kill the article because it is vanity, then you need to reread the policy on vanity. Also the comic was has won Featured Comic on drunkduck.com and best weird humor from. buzzcomix.net. Vindibudd is also listed in the <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Comics_and_Animation/Comic_Strips/Titles/?o=a" class="external text" title="http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Comics_and_Animation/Comic_Strips/Titles/?o=a" rel="nofollow">yahoo.com</a> comic strip directory. <a href="../../../a/s/w/User%7EAswilliams_adcd.html" title="User:Aswilliams">Aswilliams</a>
<ul>
<li>It's not about the votes. This is a discussion to form a consensus, not a democracy. If you can explain how your web comic currently satisfies the criteria at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines</a>, you can make a good argument for keeping an article on it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:50, 2005 Jun 20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm aware that this is not a democracy, nor is it a theocracy, dictatorship, or oligarchy. And if it is about forming a consensus then there is no need to point out that X user has only posted X number of times, thereby implying that his or her voice should be discounted. According<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines</a> I get 2 of three on the second criteria the only problem is that I wrote it myself. I think I am much more qualified to write the article than someone else and truth be told people have asked me to write it because they didn't see it here. <a href="../../../a/s/w/User%7EAswilliams_adcd.html" title="User:Aswilliams">A.S.

<ul>
<li>There is a need, because we get people rigging votes, ie. due to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a>, and that new users are often discouraged to participate in vfd until they learn the mechanics better through substantial contributions. Furthermore, if it is indeed notable, and from a NPOV, someone else will write it...ie. see <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> - the idea is that if the author creates the article him or herself concerning his or her own works, the article will tend to be biased. I'm not very sure of its notability myself, given a google test, and impact on say, the international scene, the world, and as such. Its only borderline notable, but it seems like a valid encyclopedic article, and therefore I called a vfd to resolve it. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 15:57, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I hope you won't be discouraged to contribute by this, I just wanted to see what the community thought of it, because it would be likely there would be a vfd a few days or weeks down the road, and having me spotted it now would be faster. I'm voting weak keep myself. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 14:09, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually I am very discouraged by this. I thought the point of Wikipedia was to publish articles that were informative for people that were seeking to learn about things. If people want to learn about webcomics then Vindibudd is by all accounts a valid example of one. The strip has close to 300 episodes in its archive and has been online since 2002. There are plenty of webcomics on wikipedia that do not meet superstar Penny Arcade level. But if people are really so consumed with making sure that OMG Vindibudd doesn't make it on wikipedia then what can I say. I don't need this article, I want the article but if you all just absolutely can't tolerate the article then I have nothing to say to that. Maybe you all just don't read webcomics. This is not self promotion. I can advertise on a ton of other sites. Burying an article that only people searching for webcomics and Vindibudd would find is not exactly what I would call a killer marketing strategy. <a href="../../../a/s/w/User%7EAswilliams_adcd.html" title="User:Aswilliams">A.S.

<li>Wikipedia is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, if it is indeed a valid example of one, one generally shouldn't create an example based on his or her own work, because questions of bias, hoaxes and deception come into play. If it is indeed that valid, then someone else besides the creator of the work should create the article. Of course there are exceptions, but given the small amount of notability of the comic and the author so far...we already have the quite respected <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_modeller.html" title="Climate modeller">climate modeller</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Connolley_fbe1.html" title="William Connolley">William Connolley</a> (who is a Wikipedian at <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">User:William M. Connolley</a>, who being a scientist that has published numerous scientific papers (far more notable than a comic strip, for example) already met with a lot of controversy himself. The point is, this is just a discussion. I am glad to see you prove its notability, then that's what this vfd is for. Consider it nothing more than a court trial. Its not that we can't tolerate it, this is merely a discussion to reach a consensus on whether to delete it or not. Just because a vfd appears doesn't mean the community wants to delete it, that only happens after the vfd ends, and heck, appeals to the decision happen as well. And the problem is, Wikipedia is advoated as a neutral medium. It would be very good for advertisers to get their marketing schemes labelled as "not biased". To avoid controversy next time, a lot should be clarified in the article. Anyhow, you might win this. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 15:57, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I see nothing wrong with this article. It is not espousing the comic as anything spectacular, it is not teling everyone that they should go to the website. It is simply an entry that gives the facts and also lets you link to more information. What else is an encyclopedic entry for? If someone else had put this article up, I'll bet it wouldn't even be challenged. So if it's the same article, but a different user, it'd be okay?

<li><b>Keep</b> I personally see no problem with it, it does keep within the guidelines. The article is in encyclopedia form and doesn't advertise itself all over the place. It just gives a detailed description of who he is, and what he does. I suppose the fact that it was written by the Author of the comic would draw a bit of speculation and criticism, it really doesn't stand out as vanity in my opinion. Kainchaos

<li>Delete: The problem for me is not "vanity" or that the author wrote of his own work. In some cases, that's not a bad thing, as the article is generally NPOV. The problem for me is that artworks should be encyclopedic if they are first of their kind, leading examples of their genres, or substantially influential. If they are breakthroughs of style or subject, they're encyclopedic. If an understanding of them is vital for a historical moment (not "nice to have" but vital), they should be included. In the case of web comics, that excludes all but the incredibly famous ones. No ill-will involved, just a judgment on what is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:18, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Like Geogre said, it's not necessarily a problem a vanity, but a problem of relevance. Wikipedia is a more liberal and open version of World Book or Britannica. Neither of those encyclopedias would carry this article because the cartoon and cartoonist haven't had wide-reaching effects on the world. Wikipedia shouldn't publish the articles, because the work isn't notable enough to call for an article, not even on the Internet. I say wait a few years. If the man or the work gets a spot on television or it garners major critics' (not at some niche website) praise; then it would deserve a place on Wiki. However, the article IS well-written and informative. If the subject ever becomes popular, notable, or influential, then by all means publish it here. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVolatile_6023.html" title="User:Volatile">Volatile</a> 17:58, 20 June 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No vote, just a comment to Mr. Williams: it's no major loss to us if your comic doesn't have an article. Wikipedia might be on the internet, but that doesn't mean the people here care about your part of the internet. There are 1000's of webcomics. What makes an encyclopedia care is this: what did you do differently? <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">¬Æ</a> 23:02, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Obviously</i> it's not a loss that my comic is not on wikipedia. It also wouldn't be a loss if 90% all the other webcomics listed here were not. I am positive that wikipedia will not come crashing down tomorrow because it has no contribution from me. Imagine that. I bet it also won't come crashing down if you suddenly stop contributing either. But just because you don't like something or are not interested in something does not automatically make it uninteresting. Which seems to be the major theme here. "I've never heard of it and it doesn't get 200000000 hits a day. That must mean that it isn't worth an article." Shockingly, I didn't see that listed as a requirement. In fact, the vfd policy explicitly states that "lack of fame" is not a valid reason for deletion. Additionally, I wrote an informative article that was not a vanity piece. Here is an example of a vanity piece so you can tell the difference in the future: "X comic is the best comic ever made. Go there now because it is really awesome and you have to see it." The charge that I am promoting myself is rather ludicrous as the I can pay less than $10 and get a few thousand uniques on my site in a single day whereas it would probably take years to accumulate that many from a wikipedia article. So faced with the prevailing attitude of negativity, I'm just not fighting it. You have won whatever argument we were having.<b><a href="../../../a/s/w/User%7EAswilliams_adcd.html" title="User:Aswilliams">A.S. Williams</a></b>
<ul>
<li>Actually if it becomes that notable, and if it is listed, you will probably have little power to influence it. This rather seems like sour grapes, but I honestly hope you will change your mind about contributing. The point isn't about "lack of fame", but about notability. In case you didn't know, Wikipedian contributors have many attitudes, one has a "no harm in keeping it" and "no use in keeping it", attitude, in terms of half-full and half-empty. I tend to prefer keeping it, but I put it up for vfd to speed the process. Furthermore, it hasn't decided whether its an "honest article" yet, considering that Encyclopedia Britannica will probably not even put your article up. There's a difference between adveritising and vanity, by the way. The article was perfectly neutral, that was one of its best points, <b>however</b>, it gains <b>attention</b> towards itself, and becomes part of Wikipedia canon, and therefore self-centred when it is being contested whether or not it deserves it such in an encylopedia. Its a complex issue: and please, don't try to oversimplify the Wikipedia community as it holds complex views as it is. Its not just because SOMEONE doesn't like it, or finds it uninteresting, I hope you know, but this is a community effort in general. Furthermore, we are using notability guidelines here, we're not judging in on finding it "uninteresting", but whether it merits the reader. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 00:52, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, they won't find anything, and you didn't get the point. The only thing that this article tells us about the real person is that he was someone else's manager.

<li>The Nebraska Music Hall of Fame isn't the Kennedy Center Honors. But it is real and verifiable. And it establishes notability sufficient for Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>Not the Kennedy Center is right. From their website: "Long term goals include the establishment of a permanent home for the Hall of Fame to display memorabilia, instruments, photos, sound recordings, etc. of all Nebraska Artists". I take it that means they don't have physical presence anywhere of yet, which means the Nebraska Music Hall of Fame is a basically just a website. And while Linux developers and porn stars are overly represented in google searches, a mere 2 google hits is miniscule for anyone and anything. <i>I</i> get more than that. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:00, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've been generally opposed to all of these forked articles on anarchism, many of which have titles that make no sense -- ("Anarchism (anti-state)"? As opposed to "Anarchism (pro-state)"?) -- but, for a change, this one actually serves a logical purpose. It discusses anarchism as a specific social/political movement, which is the meaning of anarchism that is intended by the various leftist anarchists around here. This is distinct from anarchism as a generic term for a variety of anti-state philosophies, which may or may not be part of this movement. If this article is kept, then both this and the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Anarchism (philosophy)">Anarchism (philosophy)</a> article should be edited in accordance with this distinction so that they don't remain near-clones of one another; stick to description and history of the <i>movement</i> here, without so much philosophy, while removing movement-specific info from the other article and including more on non-movement anarchist philosophies. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 11:06, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. On the 3rd link if you google for the term, it is said that "Dragon ŒîœÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ Dhrakos". So the article may be factually wrong.

<li>Œî is the greek capital d, which would make it Drakos rather than Dhrakos.

<li><b>Comment</b>.
<ul>
<li>He's not even remotely notable; he's a college drop-out who worked a couple of jobs and attended a few conferences. He happened to manage an ISP that failed, which in and of itself would have never been heard of had it not been for his involvement in the whole disaster known as Sealand, which itself would have been unheard of had it not been mentioned in Wired, also nothing more than hype.</li>
<li>Sorry about the confusion on the anonymous edit bits, you're right. Side note- although we can't see history prior to 2002, I strongly suspect he was the author, and he's quite aware of its existence, having edited the page himself, and linked to it from his Wikipedia user page (which is where all this belongs)</li>
<li>The age of the page has no relevancy; <i>it is still a vanity page</i>.</li>
<li>The article makes claims which are unsupported (such as establishing Iraq's post-war internet infrastructure, highly dubious). Numerous mentions of OpenDBS, which has not been implemented(google for OpenDBS returns a 'coming soon' page).
<ul>

<dd>For the record, my vote is <b>delete</b> (yes, I know I created one of the lists). However, let's review the situation we have here: we now have one of the articles on VFD <i>and</i> VFU. At one point the list article was recreated with an angry blast at the administrator who deleted it, but I notice that Tony has undeleted it. So the VFU is now no longer valid, yet is still listed. I created a new article, which is now being voted on VFD. There is also a category for exploding animals, along with a <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExploding_animals_580a.html" title="Template:Exploding animals">template</a>, which has an incorrect redirect template <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExploding_mammals_af57.html" title="Template:Exploding mammals">Template:Exploding mammals</a> (my fault). The normal template is on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>. Accordingly, I have also been accused of posturing by <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">User:Pcb21</a>, who says I haven't helped make whales a serious topic of conversation, my article about <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_whales.html" title="Exploding whales">Exploding whales</a> (possibly) having eclipsed <a href="../../../s/p/e/Sperm_whale.html" title="Sperm whale">Sperm whale</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_whale.html" title="Gray whale">Gray whale</a>. I plead innocence!</dd>
<dd>It appears that whales and animals aren't the only things that have exploded here. It appears that the entirety of Wikipedia has gone, quite literally, mad. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:05, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I <b>note</b> that this page has just undergone a lengthy and detailed <i>undelete</i> process. It therefore seems odd to find it re-listed for deletion.

<ul>
<li>No, it is procedural to list an article on VFD if it passes VFU. This is because VFU is about <i>process</i> (this was undeleted because the process was deemed invalid) and VFD is about <i>content</i> (this may still be considered lack of content by <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">some people</a>).

<ul>
<li>In practice, VfUs are not just about process, they are heavily influenced by VFD considerations. 10:08, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC) <small>this remark was made by <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">User:Kappa</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:38, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless there are unusual circumstances, the last step of the undeletion process is to list the undeleted article on VFD. The reason this one was undeleted is a common one: It was argued that this was an improper <i>speedy</i> deletion, and that it should be subject to the full VFD treatment. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:57, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually I restored the thing as an invalid speedy. I ignored the VfU as it was superfluous--the article having been deleted without a proper VfD. This VfD is procedurally correct and should have been tried <i>first</i>. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:15, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>With apologies to the anonymous author, I have doubts about the veracity of this article, as the statement that the barony was created in 1927 conflicts with the date given at <a href="http://hereditarytitles.com/Page67.htm" class="external free" title="http://hereditarytitles.com/Page67.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hereditarytitles.com/Page67.htm</a>.<br />
It is also unclear to me what encyclopaedic value the names of 4 (3 presumably deceased) Englishmen who happened at different times to hold an hereditary title have, especially as the present policy of the British New Labour (Socialist) government is to abolish all such titles. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 09:38, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> We still have articles on Kings of France I believe even though the French monarchy has been abolished. Maintaining a historical record is part of the business of an encyclopedia. PS New Labour isn't socialist, that's what's "new" about it, and it isn't abolishing the titles, just the hereditary seats in the House of Lords. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 19:09, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Until recently, the holders of the title would have been eligible as members of the House of Lords so they would have been notable under this category. Apart from this, the first Baron presumably did something notable to earn the titles. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:55, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The Government's not abolishing the titles at all, they just can't sit or vote in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> anymore. The titles will still be passed down generations.

</ul>
<p>Given the above, I am content to <b>withdraw</b> the nomination. On two points of philosophical contention, that a man's ancestor has done something notable does not, IMHO, render his descendants till the end of time notable. Indeed, I can see an argument that, <i>unless</i> they do something notable, they devalue their ancestor to the point where his/her notability may be smirched. The instance of the 7th earl of Lucan springs to mind. Secondly, anent Splash's point, I would recommend that he wait and see before being so certain that the titles will still be passed down. Once the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> has been "reformed" (read abolished and replaced by a Senate), the hereditary titles will cease to have any function. Moreover it is a moot point as to whether English titles will be recognised in teh new United States of Europe (once Sr.Blair has had it explained to him that Prime Minister is elective not hereditary). --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 06:25, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. He's rather well known, especially in Southern California and New York. He has toured internationally to support a platinum album with Jewel Kilcher, has co-written hit songs, has a fan club, and his musical style is unique. He's also appeared in at least one Music Video on MTV. If he doesn't match your criteria, I'd suggest you change it. It would be good to focus more on musical contribution rather than # of google hits (which are arbitrary and trend based I think.)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Just now I trawled the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolitical_books_513b.html" title="Category:Political books">Category: Political books</a> and listed all those that dealt wholly or mainly with Bush or his Presidency. As most of the conservative writers these days tend to be writing about the twin evils of liberalism and Islam, this may give the list a somewhat lopsided appearance. There aren't a lot of articles about hagiographies of Bush around, that I can see. I suggest that this could be remedied by writing such articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:43, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - just an afterthought - shouldn't this be a "List of..."; or if not, shouldn't the article delve a bit into the fairly recent phenomena of dozens of critical (and some laudatory) books being written about sitting presidents? I may be too young to speak wisely on this, but it seems to me the phenomenon only began when Reagan was in office. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:57, 2005 Jun 20 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Worthwhile spin-off of the main article. In some cases there are simply too many works to comfortably accommodate in an article's references list.

<li>Merge contents into appropriate articles and <b>delete</b>. Separating the references from the article is a bad precedent.

<li>Exactly...I was just imagining having hundreds of "Books about" pages. Messy, messy, messy. There are many topics that have a more extensive literature than Mr. Bush (French Revolution, World War II, Chess?). It is indeed a very bad precedent, and I don't see why a long references section is necessarily a bad thing. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 01:00, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It seems unlikely that all these books are actually being used as "references" in the GWB article. Books that are actually used to verify facts in that article should also be mentioned there, but as I understand it this is a general list of books about George W.

<li>Amazon strives to achieve <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> by balancing - which is an acceptable way to do things on the Wikipedia too. It does a more thorough job of it, and maintains its <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> better by adding everything within a narrow remit (books only) with nothing taken away, reverted, blanked, scrambled or vandalized.

<li>Ummm....? Ok, it's not Amazon's stated policy, but they must surely try to get as many books to sell as they can and they don't seem to have a POV to push in the meantime.

As previously noted, "Books About George W. Bush" would make a great category, but as a list, it doesn't work because it doesn't type the book: are they purposefully pro- or anti-Bush, are they about one term or both, do they even address his Presidency at all or just his Governorship of Texas, do they address one specific policy/event only, etc? To even be a useful list, the list would have to get broken up, and I don't feel right voting to keep an article that'd have to become nothing but a categorized list of books under such an "umbrella" topic, especially not when that list's better placed in the George W.

<li><b>Keep</b> but annotate the list with a short comment for each book, and remove all the redlinks. I think the Literate Engineer is wrong in saying this would make a great Category. The big trouble with Categories is that they can only list books that have Wikipedia articles about them. It couldn't include books of borderline notability: important enough to be listed, but not important enough to be the subject of a whole article. And, or course, it's even harder to anotate a category than a list. Face it, categories are totally useless for this sort of thing.

It is nice to see that young adults or teenagers are trying to eliminate the "yobbish" image which a majority of the public hold today thanks to the media. Well done Rowan for a smashing scheme. I would also like to remind you that Rowan had won a "High Sheriff Of Surrey Award" For his contribution. The "High Sheriff Of Surrey Award" is one of the most prestigous awards to be one. I leave you with this one question. How many other people do you know that hold an award like that? We must remember that Rowan's contribution to the public is nationally recognised. Therefore because of it must be recognised on Wikipedia. <small>unsigned vote from <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.202.180.114.html" title="User:172.202.180.114">172.202.180.114</a> (talk <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.202.180.114_9ab4.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.202.180.114">contribs</a>) <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> ‚Äî <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 20:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Honestly, some of the above votes are a bit hyperbolic. "The ability of modern democracy to prevail?" If the new cadet model is so great and emulatable, why don't you write about it in a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Police_Cadets_c0ea.html" title="British Police Cadets">British Police Cadets</a> article? You can tell us all about the differences between the different cadet programs, and communities *around the world* would benefit from your service to humanity. Maybe if you set a sufficient context regarding the cadet system, voters will realize how truly important and notable Mr. Rowan's actions were. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 20:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah... no offense to MPS but that was a tad demeaning. But as to 80.3.32.9, please note <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">WP:Importance</a> item 5. I don't think that person has enough reach as of yet to qualify for his own article. Frankly, most 17 year-olds, never mind everyone else, haven't really had enough time to establish notability worthy of an Encyclopedia article. The awards listed also seem kind of generic in the sense that a lot of people have similar awards and there is nothing really to distinguish this person from the rest of society in general. There are a lot of unsung heroes out there that save cats from trees or volunteer their time to the community but that doesn't qualify an article for them. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">‚Ä≤</span></a><span class="Unicode">‚Üî</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">‚Üî</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 03:06, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A quick skim through the history file shows that there are a set of IPs (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">172.202.180.114</a>, <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.3.32.9.html" title="User:80.3.32.9">User:80.3.32.9</a>, <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.171.198.5.html" title="User:62.171.198.5">User:62.171.198.5</a>) and one registered user (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trust2005_a0a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trust2005">Trust2005</a>) which are providing 'all' the keep votes. Their contribution history shows that other than the first, all have been involved in editing the Rowan_Cole article, and the first itself has only made contributions to this votes page as of time of posting. While the "High Sheriff of Surrey Award" sounds impressive, and does justify the question as above "how many other people do you know that hold an award like that?" it still begs the question of what the award actually means? I can happily claim that I have Sterling Achievement Awards in the Field of Excellence, but by not providing any further information on any such award it becomes a shell. I would be happy to see a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Police_Cadets_c0ea.html" title="British Police Cadets">British Police Cadets</a> article, especially if it contained information on how to set up something similar, or gave something more informative about the <i>Cadets</i> rather than what we see at the moment; if the item is notable or significantly informative, then that provides a base for relevant information about Rowan Cole. However before that article has substance the Rowan Cole article remains a vanity page.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - You cannot delete this page. This page has only been on Wikipedia for a few months, and it would stupid to delete it already. The whole point of Wikipedia should be to have as much infomation as possible. In addition, Rowan Cole has done great deals for the community in Surrey and his Cadet Force has set an example for others across the UK. He has also recieved far more awards than most people do in their lifetime, and he deserves to be recognised. Wikipedia is not 'Who's Who', it is not meant to list only the rich, famous and those with MBEs after their names!! Deleting Rowan Cole's article would be like deleting the work of the little man!! acswanman</li>

Guys, there are some things you can safely insert as place holder. It helps build the community of information on wikipedia. If there was no page, then people who may have useful information will be turned away. That's the last thing a small growing project like Wikipedia needs. There's a reason the {future} tag was invented. If Wiki didn't want speculation, the {future} tag would be a deletion device. It is not. However, I can see there are those who like to follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" rel="nofollow">the rules</a> to the letter.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- The Olympic Games are a recognized event, and even though 2020 is still 15 years away (as I'm writing this), there is a reason why people are talking about and/or planning for an event of this magnatude.

<p>This is Halifax. I have taken back my previous assertion. We do not wish to advertise, but understand that Wikipedia is place to come for answers. If one hears talk of Sanjan on the street, this is a wonderful place to come for answers. More defense is on its way. Give us a chance, we are not looking for money, or even followers.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: True, Judaism, Christianity and Islam all started small and grew <u>over thousands of years</u> into major forces in world events. <s>You should probably check back with Wikipedia in 3900 years, 2010 years, and 1490 years (respectively) and resubmit your article.</s> {struck with apologies for the snide tone.} At this point, it is still non-encyclopedic, POV and advertorial. Also, as to the "freedom of religion", Wikipedia is NOT a US government institution, it is an international collective enterprise; it has specific rules which detail what kinds of material are appropriate.

<p>I find the comment about "check[ing] back with Wikipedia in 3900 years, 2010 years, and 1490 years" to be offensive and an insult to my intelligence, considering that, as far as I know, no human could possibly live this long. Perhaps you should save your jokes and sarcasm for amateur night at your local comedy club, or maybe even to impress some ladies at the pub. Otherwise, your apparently witty comments have no place in this serious discussion. In addition to this, I fail to see how the articles are non-encyclopedic, POV or advertorial. However, the articles are <i>informational</i>, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Wiki has any policy prohibiting information. <small><i>unsigned edit by 69.231.58.181 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.231.58.181.html" title="User talk:69.231.58.181">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.231.58.181_5272.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.231.58.181">contribs</a>)</i></small></p>

<li>Okay, let's back up a bit. Most Wikipedians (including Jimbo in his <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance</a> post) feel there are two essential elements for any encyclopedic article: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. Is it <b>possible</b> to create a Sanjan article that passes both tests? IMHO, you cannot write one that passes either. The religion is "secret" and "exclusive", so verification is only possible by referring to Sacred Texts (a tautology), or by deferring to adherents (which violates objectivity). Since only adherents will be able to effectively edit Wikipedia articles, POV is inescapable. Until such time as Sanjan becomes a discernable, well-known influence in society or a topic of wide public discourse, I do not think encyclopedic articles can be created. PS: The list of things Wikipedia is not is found <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">here</a>. Also, I am not anti-Sanjan.

<li><b>Comment</b> - A Google search for "Sanjan religion" (no quotes) returns 827 sites. As far as I can tell, they seem to refer to a kingdom of Sanjan, which is a part of the Zoroastrian religion. That said, I believe that your religion exists, and I believe that you follow it closely, and I believe that to you, it is your religion. I also believe that those who are mocking you are wrong in doing so. However, it cannot be argued that your religion, due to secrecy, cannot be verified in regards to any information that we put down. Its notability to the general world is not significant (again, I quote the Google search). I (and I hope we) are not anti-Sanjan, merely anti-unnotable articles. When your religion has grown and is more notable for an encyclopedia, I have no doubt that an article will be allowed. -- <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECabhan_df88.html" title="User:Cabhan">Cabhan</a> 17:45, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, fails the professor test. Got her PhD in 2003, so is certainly less widely known and less well-published than the average college professor since she's not been around as long as the average. Lecturing at a Uni isn't notable, and even at an elite Uni, it is no statement of anything in particular since grad. students can be asked to lecture. Being a "Wellcome Trust Post-doctoral Fellow" indicates that this is probably her first (maybe second, but unlikely in just 2 years) contract after her PhD (DPhil, technically). She's also not listed on the College's <a href="http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/tutors/fellows.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/tutors/fellows.htm" rel="nofollow">staff</a> page so appears not to have been awarded a College fellowship to go with her Wellcome Trust one. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:03, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm inclined to dismiss this as patent nonsense. At best, it's original research and original speculation tacked on to the name of a paper by Libb Thims (name of the journal in which the article appeared would help with verifying that) and a misapplication of thermodynamics (closed system, people, closed system). No, I take it back, that's not at best. At best, this isn't original research and speculation, just a really sloppy presentation of non-notable pseudoscience. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 01:31, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. I read the text, and I understand the material. It is well-disguised nonsense. It is, for the most part, basic thermodynamics (badly presented, should be in LaTeX) that is dealt with just fine by other, dedicated articles. See, e.g. <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_energy.html" title="Free energy">free energy</a>. Note that these terms are standard thermo terms. Then, the article goes off the rails and says things like <i>"wherein a man M meets or collides in time with a woman W over the substrate surface called ‚Äòearth‚Äô to form a bonded relationship"</i> which is nearly patent nonsense and it goes down hill from there. The website looks professional, to a point, and claims they have a PhD - I reckon it's an elaborate hoax. Further the Google hits deal with the perfectly good topic of human thermo in terms of "how do you keep people cool" and "what sort of ways do humans lose heat/warm up" etc. It's subtle, but I reckon it's nonsense.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 01:43, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I am the author. I understand everyone‚Äôs inherent frustration with its content, i.e. the application of reaction mechanics to one‚Äôs own life. It's emotionally-confusing to point the microscope at oneself. However, let me ask this: in human life, do we all agree that bonds are broken and bonds are formed? If so, why is it that we cannot find one semblance of an article related to human bonding in Wikipedia written in the format of chemistry, in spite of the fact that numerous Laureates have spent decades working on such a premise (as shown by all the quotes)? Maybe I should search under ‚Äòwitchcraft‚Äô, ‚Äòmystery‚Äô, ‚Äòglue-all‚Äô, or maybe ‚ÄòRomance Novels‚Äô? According to Merriam-Webster, an ‚Äòencyclopedia‚Äô is defined as: a work that contains information on <i>all</i> branches of knowledge. Is this or is this not an encyclopedia? By definition, thermodynamics is the science of energy transformations. By definition, human thermodynamics is a <i>branch</i> of thermodynamics. If I was a random person curious as to whether or not thermodynamics is applicable to human life, I would be extremely content to find such a straight forward article. As Wikipedia is such renowned worldly encyclopedia, I would certainly expect it to have some content in this direction. P.S. human systems are ‚Äòopen‚Äô. Check your facts. --Wavesmikey 03:56, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm aware human systems are open systems. My understanding is, though, that the second law of thermodynamics, referenced in this article, from which Gibbs free energy, also referenced, is derived applies primarily to <i>closed</i> systems. I admit, open systems do exist and can be described with thermodynamics; nonetheless, their application to group dynamics is a major stretch, and modeling human relationships on them involves all sorts of unstated assumptions, for instance that a state function (like Gibbs free energy) even applies. Or that they're spontaneous. My skepticism of this article is heightened by having looked at the site linked to from the Thims reference and noticed it firmly on the pseudo- side of fringe science. And, since Thims seems to be the only actual researcher in the field of "human thermodynamics", the article now strikes me as unverifiable. I stand by my vote, thus ends my <b>comment</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 04:55, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Creative and original, but not scientific or encyclopedic.

<li><b>Thank-you</b> for your rebuttal; let me clarify the situation. Yes, the second law applies to ‚Äòclosed‚Äô systems. However, Gibbs free energy change <i>‚àÜG</i> does <i>not</i> apply to ‚Äòclosed‚Äô systems. The Gibbs free energy change <i>‚àÜG</i> represents the minimum ‚Äòwork‚Äô exchanged by the system with the surroundings ‚Äì hence we are discussing ‚Äòopen‚Äô systems. On a positive note, I do sense there to be a consensus forming to ‚Äòclose‚Äô this article. Thus, let me ask our wise panel the following: What is the scientific name of the ‚Äòforce‚Äô that holds a married couple together in ‚Äòbonded‚Äô matrimony? I‚Äôll give you a hint: there are only four choices: 1. the strong nuclear force, 2. the electromagnetic force, 3. the weak nuclear force, 4. the gravitational force.

<li>If you could give us links to the journal papers you have published, or that have been published, on human thermodynamics <i><b>in the sense in which your article uses it</b></i>, you could probably close the discussion in your favour.

<hr />
<ul>
<li>The paper in question, which as we see is very controversial, has been encompassed into four soon to be published textbooks on human thermodynamics; see: <a href="http://www.humanthermodynamics.com/HT-books.html" class="external text" title="http://www.humanthermodynamics.com/HT-books.html" rel="nofollow">HT Books</a>. However, I am not the only one working in this direction ‚Äì check the links. For the moment, possibly to help clear up the air, let me give a tutorial:</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>First, generally speaking, the science of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamics.html" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> began in 1824 when <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadi_Carnot_5d96.html" title="Sadi Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> published his analysis on heat engines. The heat engines of his time were <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_engines.html" title="Steam engines">steam engines</a>, where wood or coal was burned to create <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat.html" title="Heat">heat</a>. The heat was used to boil water to make pressurized steam. The controlled release of this steam was used to drive a <a href="../../../p/i/s/Piston.html" title="Piston">piston</a>. The cyclical movement of the piston was used to turn <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulleys.html" title="Pulleys">pulleys</a> to lift water out of salt mines in Europe. Hence, Carnot defined <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work.html" title="Work">work</a> as ‚Äòa weight lifted through a height‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The ‚Äòsystem‚Äô in question here is the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_reaction.html" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reaction</a>: coal + oxygen --&gt; carbon dioxide + water. Through this <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exothermic.html" title="Exothermic">exothermic</a> reaction, <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">energy</a> goes off in two parts: (1) work and (2) waste. <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">Coal</a> is predominately comprised of <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrocarbons.html" title="Hydrocarbons">hydrocarbons</a>. The simplest of hydrocarbons is <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methane.html" title="Methane">methane</a> [CH4]. When methane burns with <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> we have the following reaction: CH4 + 2O2 --&gt; CO2 + 2H2O. In simple language, first someone ‚Äòsparks‚Äô reaction. Second, because of this ‚Äòspark‚Äô the methane and oxygen molecules develop an intense desire to ‚Äòreact‚Äô with each other. Third, through the process of this reaction these two <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecules.html" title="Molecules">molecules</a> are ‚Äòtransformed‚Äô into new molecules. Forth, heat is given off, owing to the fact that these new molecules have reached a more stable configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, unless this is the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_ages.html" title="Dark ages">dark ages</a>, which I‚Äôm assuming it isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm going to presume that we all agree that humans are made of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protons.html" title="Protons">protons</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrons.html" title="Neutrons">neutrons</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrons.html" title="Electrons">electrons</a> bonded via <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">photon</a> exchange ‚Äì just as our simple water molecule is made of 10 protons, 8 neutrons, and 10 electrons bonded via photon exchange. Thus, as we see, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_engines.html" title="Heat engines">heat engines</a> are nothing more than systems containing ‚Äòchemical reactions‚Äô. Next, given a mass composition table of a human, such as is found in John Emsley‚Äôs <i>Nature‚Äôs Building Blocks</i>, we can calculate the empirical molecular formula for one human and from this a <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecular_formula.html" title="Molecular formula">molecular formula</a>. If you do the calculation, you see that the entity called ‚Äòhuman‚Äô is actually a twenty-six <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_element.html" title="Chemical element">element</a> <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecule.html" title="Molecule">molecule</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>So, the elaborate superficial phenomenon of two humans bonding in an intimate relationship is simply put: ‚Äòa Chemical Reaction‚Äô. Here, two molecules bond, energy is given off; some energy goes to waste, some to purpose. If anyone finds this to be <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> than perhaps ignorance is bliss. To ask again: is human life a chemical reaction or not? If it is, then what we have here is straight textbook science. If human life is not a chemical reaction, than yes this presentation is incorrect. My reason for posting this article, is with intentions for that 15-year-old person out there who may possibly search Wikipedia with aims to find some semblance of a scientific article as to why human life <a href="../../../w/o/r/Works.html" title="Works">works</a> the way it does. Thanks again. --Wavesmikey 17:08, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>: as stated, the books by Libb Thims are ‚Äòsoon‚Äô to be published ‚Äì hence, the ISBN numbers are ‚Äòmock‚Äô numbers for (temporary) display purposes only.

<li><b>Delete</b>, although this does refer to the very notable song "Elvis is Everywhere" so to call the song source non-notable is incorrect.

<li>Quantum teleportation is a bad analogy as that is a term used to describe a widely accepted and experimentally demonstrated process in quantum mechanics whereby the quantum state of one atom can be transferred to another over small but macroscopically significant distances. In that context, it is not at all radical.

<li>I am going to hate myself for saying this, but <b>rewrite</b>. This is psuedoscience, quackery, and great number of other unflattering things, but unfortunately, I believe it is notable quackery. The Correas and followers have, through determined effort, managed to insinuated their ideas into thousands of websites <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=Aetherometry" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=Aetherometry" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=massfree" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=massfree" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, and written multiple books, "research papers", and essays. They really do have PhDs supporting their work (though a list of the fields of study of those PhDs might be entertaining). Perhaps most importantly, this is not the first time I have encountered aetherometry. If it is something I have heard of before by chance, then odds are it is sufficiently widespread to be notable (lord help us all). That said, the version of the article that is ultimately kept needs serious NPOVing, in addition to stating the opinions of these believers, it needs to state the mainstream objections, and comments from critics such as <a href="http://www.orgonelab.org/correas.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.orgonelab.org/correas.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Honestly, I rather hope this is deleted, but I can't really support that. Okay, now that I feel icky, I'm going away. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:24, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>by asserting claims or theories without first verifying them in experiments</li>
<li>by asserting claims which cannot be verified or falsified (claims that violate falsifiability);</li>
<li>by asserting claims without supporting experimental evidence;</li>
<li>by asserting claims which contradict experimentally established results;</li>
<li>by failing to provide an experimental possibility of reproducible results;</li>
<li>by failing to submit results to peer review prior to publicizing them (called "science by press conference")</li>
<li>by claiming a theory predicts something that it does not;</li>
<li>by claiming a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict;</li>
<li>by violating Occam's Razor, the heuristic principle of choosing the explanation that requires the fewest additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (and the more egregious the violation, the more likely); or</li>
<li>by a lack of progress toward additional evidence of its claims.</li>

<dd>Now, I've read everything that the Coreeas have published, and I have to confess that I cannot figure out which of these characteristics Aetherometry is claimed to possess. What exactly is the basis for you calling it pseudoscience? I mean, you can call it anything you want, I am sure, but if you are trying to be truthful to boot, then what are your criteria? 66.217.179.112 17:54, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC) That was me too.

<dd>And we're supposed to take you on your word? Just because they asserted a theory in a book doesn't make it correct.

<dd>Look, if Wikipedia simply does not want articles about scientific efforts that have not been published in mainstream journals, why not say so to begin with? As far as I can see, nobody ever defended Aetherometry by claiming it was accepted by the mainstream. Why all this broohaha? I suspect that if the original author had just been told to begin with, "Look, this has not been accepted by the mainstream, so Wikipedia is not a place for it", he or she would have withdrawn and nobody's time would have been wasted. And no, you have no idea whether or not Aetherometry violates Occam's razor, because you have no idea what experimental data it is trying to explain. And the results have been available for peer review for at least 4 years now, so the statement "it has failed to submit results to rigorous peer review" is not accurate either.

<dd>That isn't the point. We're not even sure of these "scientific efforts" are notable. Wikipedia does not have to include articles about every single attempt to try to find some "free energy" source in the world. For example, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> has his entry on <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawking_radiation.html" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a> existing because 1) it was notable 2) it is sent through peer review, even though its very controversial, and only 70% accepted by the mainstream (as a figure of speech). It may submit results for "peer review", but unless it suddenly accumulated enough review to verify it as evidence (like results reproduced over and over again, documented, and resubmitted), then its not "rigorous". "I have no idea what experimental data it is trying to explain"? If you mean the original information here, yes I do, unless you want to be Helicoid and allege that "I haven't read the material". - but if you mean because the results haven't been published, then duly right, it shouldn't be here if its not going to be verified anyway.

<li><s>I don't know where you deletion-mavens are coming from, but it sure ain't from actually studying the stuff. I have been reading the Correas' research papers ever since they first started publishing them in 2001. As is clear to anybody who actually takes the trouble of reading them, it is most certainly solid scientific work, is absolutely fascinating, and most likely a lot of it is correct (and, like with any new science, a lot of it may also be in error). I think the number of Google hits is a pretty poor criterion for judging the merit of a science, no? One would imagine that a "community encyclopedia" would be precisely the place where new scientific ideas coming from outside institutional science would find a hospitable home, and where people could come to learn about them.

<li>Same old Patrick here (with his second edit). I am not sure what you mean by "has no home outside wiki". Aetherometry has a huge webpage, with something like 50 monographs publicly available on it. It certainly is not a homeless stray in need of a home, you know. What I meant was that one (or at least old Patrick here) would expect a "community encyclopedia" to be hospitable to non-institutional science.

<dd>You misunderstand. "Community encyclopedia" does not mean "lower standards". In this case, Aetherometry doesn't even fit the bar. It has to be a notable theory, first, and even more if its pseudoscientific and Wikipedians have already pointed out great gaping holes in its logic. It is hospitable to <b>knowledge that benefits the community and the international reader</b>. Generally, something informative. Something counter-productive like Aetherometry doesn't fit the goal, because its sheer lack of notability doesn't even seem to justify its existence. And if it were notable, the encyclopedia's job is to give an NPOV look at it. Even if survived, the page has to go under tremendous cleanup, and to represent the theory as probably very unlikely. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 22:59, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgive old Patrick here, but I am beginning to suspect that you are confusing Aetherometry with something else. Either this, or I seriously missed something. What are the great gaping holes that the Wikipedians have pointed out in the logic of Aetherometry? Could you list them for me? Also, I have to confess that I thought the original article was a lot more informative than the one that's there now. And I would think that a theory that results in a number of actual, working, new energy technologies would be a good candidate for something that benefits the community, rather than for something that should be called counter-productive. And I am curious about this statement that "its sheer lack of notability doesn't even seem to justify its existence". You mean only notable things have a right to exist?

<dd>No, you're missing the entire point. Better to say nothing, than to say something which might lead people down the wrong path. As for the "great gaping holes", it conflicts with quantum mechanics because it doesn't attribute some of the phenomena described in aetherometry to a "massfree/massbound" model, but something entirely different. I also note there isn't any clear correlation and compatability with the <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncertainty_principle.html" title="Uncertainty principle">uncertainty principle</a> either, and also a failure to cite, <b>proper, verified evidence</b> (ie. not a web page on an advocacy website, but an actual scientific paper, page by page, line by line)....emphasis - SPECIFIC paper, SPECIFIC page, SPECIFIC line. As for the "original article being more informative", its disputed: that information is horrendously wrong, or at least allegedly wrong, so I don't see how it benefits the community. It has to be NPOV'ed first, making wild claims just because it fills up the page doesn't make it "more informative". If I made a page about some snake oil product and proceeded to insert 200 kilobytes of information how it could benefit mankind, does it really benfit mankind? Oh, you're totally wrong on one count - "existence" - existence of having article. You're right, you better go get yourself some notability, or you can't justify your existence of having an OldPatrick article.

<dd>Dpbsmith: As I read, and try to edit, I do not see a clear assertion that aetherometry is held as "perpetual motion/free energy/overunity". If it was, I would agree that it is vastly marginal to science, and even pseudoscientific. What I would then suggest, is that the subject may be a worthy field of study for <b>not</b> claiming "free energy".

<dd>Compare and contrast <a href="../../../a/e/t/Aether.html" title="Aether">aether</a> with <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_energy.html" title="Vacuum energy">vacuum energy</a>. Unlike aetherometry, quantum mechanics asserts that vacuum energy on the whole is a closed system - if it contributes "matter" to the physical universe through virtual particles, stuff like black holes for example, require expenditure of energy in order to separate the virtual particle pairs. This ends up not producing any energy. It seems that aetherometry, while not explicitly being a "free energy" science, asserts that there is a source of energy easily tapped into, or far more available than it really is. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 01:00, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, pseudoscience, yes; but it's a decades old accumulation of stuff, mostly connected with other pseudoscientific trends that are ongoing and have been for decades, that is, Reich, Free energy, aether theories, etc. and there are articles on these if only to warn/inform the readers of what they are, and place it in the historical scheme of such things. "Aetherometry" may be an obscure name, but the effort behind it is massive, (if only 2 people) and I suspect it will keep popping up in various places (in the wider culture of the net), so better to have something about it that is balanced (ie, after the rewrite).

Tried to understand it? There is nothing to understand - this work contradicts itself so much I highly doubt it, especially with its definition of "energy without inertia". I cite logical arguments discounting YOUR evidence, and as such that counts as evidence as in such. Perhaps you should also think about the fact that many Wikipedians work in similar fields, and have as much authority to discount the theory as the Correas do to support it? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 17:51, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry to say that what you wrote above seems totally confused. If you want evidence for the claims of Aetherometry, then you <b>have</b> to start by reading through, and understanding, the experimental and methodological work that lays down this evidence - in exactly the same way as people wanting to understand Faraday's claims had to start by reading, or seeing demonstrations of, Faradays experiments. How else would you know, about any scientific endeavour, what it is that is being claimed and why? And no, people who know nothing about Aetherometry do not have any authority to discount it. Aetherometry represents the result of over 20 years of painstaking experimental and theoretical work. One does not gain "authority" to make any judgement about it simply by virtue of "working in a similar field". The only authority comes from studying the work, reproducing the experiments, thinking through the theoretical claims, etc. It is no different with Aetherometry than with any science.

<dd>All that you have a factual basis for is saying that Aetherometry is not recognized by the scientific community at large. This is absolutely <b>not</b> a basis for concluding that it is a hoax, a scam, or a cheat. First of all, aetherometry could be largely correct, but has not yet been recognized as such. Secondly, aetherometry could be largely or totally wrong without being a hoax - there are a lot of erroneous scientific claims being worked on inside and outside of scientific institutions all over the world, every day of every week. Science progresses through error, you know. You have absolutely no basis for the claims you make, and you are defaming the reputation of people you know nothing about, simply because somebody put up an entry about their work in the Wikipedia. this just doesn't compute.</dd>

<dd>More interestingly, you seem to have an ignorant and naive view of the "scientific community" and of "peer review". Do you really think that the process whereby official science pemits something to "pass" is not permeated by politics and entrenched interests? You should read some case histories of how the so-called "peers" in scientific institutions treat those who try to think "outside the box". Do you know that Halton Arp has been banned from being able to do work - or even enter an observatory - in the US? Do you know that Eric Laithwaite was ostracised by his "scientific peers" when he made experimental discoveries that did not jive with the official theories of rotary motion? Examples abound, but of course they don't get much talked about. Even the Wikipedia entry for Halton Arp has been cleansed of all "controversial" material. I would recommend, however, that you educate yourself about the realities of the "scientific review" process before you put it on such a pedestal. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankZappo_ec43.html" title="User:FrankZappo">FrankZappo</a> 20:11, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Simply unbelievable how mr. connolley also is irresponsible. An administrator who censors a user's text and freely alters it because of an emotional reaction to the term wikipediafascism in the title? Wow, that's naked power! Where is the rule of law of this democracy that protects that user, the sameness in treatment, the no abuse of power?? Let's hear it! loud and clear, mr. connolley. Fascism, people, is how this kind of behavior was called in my young days. It is not Wikipedia that will change its meaning. Nor laws which will correct it. Only courage will. I propose that connolley do the right thing: muzzle himself and step down. Assume responsibility. i guess that he will not do that until someone will report him to the higher authorities. could one ask the anarchist to do this too, report connolley to the higher authorities? No factotum sharing? Just repugnant abuses of power!209.29.93.65 04:46, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Then you vote delete. Ironically, although you termed it fascism, you realise it seems the other way round. It has become a belief system, <b>unless you back it up with unverifiable sources</b>. You take things for granted, you realise that even Encylopedia Britannica would not accept your article, so who are you to condemn us? Idiocy? Is that a personal attack? Just because the original author wanted the article to be that way, doesn't mean the article is going to stay that way. The original article was so full of POV and unsupported statements, the text had to go - we may put it back when you help us NPOV it. Furthermore, <b>no one "owns" an article"</b>, and how an article is shaped is decided by the community, not one person. Ironically, "accurate and cogent" information is not what your article is, considering how it conflicts with a whole host of accepted scientific theories, which I am sure most Wikipedians and scientists (such as WMC) will agree with me on this point. I'd advise you not to credit Wikipedia for that article you have on your own server - that's Helicoid's "<s>brilliant</s> prose", which has been rejected by the community unless its NPOV'ed. Not what any "Tom Dick and Harry" thinks it is? Well, we're a <b>wiki</b>, and by standard deviation we thus shape it into a good article, and not the word by ONE user, but by a community. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 22:05, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A final suppression of Aetherometry by five administrators at least, all admittedly ignorant of Aetherometry, all highly biased (the bias of power??). Interesting how they deconstructed Helicoid's text. There was nothing left of it in a click. Same with Helicoid who has been muzzled until the vote is over. Nothing left. What is the vote for? To <b>give the appearance of democracy</b>? What you call a vote on a submission that half-way through the vote is trashed and replaced? The triumph of the barbarians. Vote to <b>Delete</b>. And vote to <b>Delete the 5 administrators for sheer POVness</b> (or is it POVerty?). Where's the page for that? 209.29.93.57 23:12, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Below is asked suppression of what? Suppression of the right to free speech of Helicoid on the last day of a rigged vote by supposedly unbiased admins. Suppression of the original contribution by Helicoid so that the vote had no bearing on anything even mildly intelligent and informative. Suppression of the original text without foundation, knowledge of cause, legitimate reasons, because of an overt refusal to consult the many links that were given. Suppression of any effort to be constructive. Suppression of knowledge on the basis of inadmissible bias - intellectual bias, scientifism (false interpretations of institutional science passed off as real ones), scientificity (false and grave misrepresentations of a theory, a model, etc, with total disregard for facts and the contents of the material), discrimination of minoritarian thought, outright put down of minorities, admitted and verified ignorance. Suppression of facts. Suppression of records. Alteration of records by admins and minors. Suppression with extreme prejudice.209.29.93.65 05:05, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Suppression of what? I recognise the danger of Orwellianism, et al, but you're pretty ironic as this is a free encylopedia mandated by the community. Furthermore, Aetherometry has very little notability, and you're lucky we even tolerate this article in the first place. If this article is to exist, it needs to be NPOV'ed as that is the spirit agreed on by the community. Its not "Helicoid's text", its an encylopedia. <b>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</b>. Its a place to publish facts. <b>No one owns an article</b>. Have you read the disclaimer? <b>"If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it."</b> Its a community encylopedia, to be improved by anyone, according to the NPOV policy. Helicoid? Muzzled? He was blocked for 24 hours, not until the vote was over, and only because he violated the 3 revert rule, stampeding over other people's editing rights. The vote? Its to decide the consensus. It can be appealed, or brought up later, and it isn't absolute. Oh, I'd advise you not to make a personal attack, either. What "bias of power"? Each Wikipedian is supposed to act like an administrator - just that the power is granted to those who have proven themselves not to be sockpuppets, vandals, etc. Do you get the idea of what a wiki is? Its supposed to be IMPROVED, so it could be kept. Do see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplies_to_common_objections_644f.html" title="Wikipedia:Replies to common objections">Wikipedia:Replies to common objections</a>. It is not "suppression", in the meanwhile, because it is DISPUTED whether it deserves to have its own article or not. If you don't want it to be suppressed, work within the framework. We can't acknowledge it as truth - that is not "suppression", that is going over the top with some theory that even Encylopedia Britannica wouldn't accept. If you really want to base all your conclusions on one vfd, well, who am I to force you not to? Perhaps you should actually take a look around, and realise how Wikipedia works - the idea is to judge by consensus of the community, and I hardly call that "suppression". -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 23:22, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A lynch mob? We're simply following the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a>, so I do not think this is a "lynch mob". Perhaps you're unhappy your view isn't represented, but in order to do so, since your view is a minority view, it has to be represented as such, whic seems fair. We have to remove the prose concerning extensive theories of aetherometry because they haven't been verified and they assert themselves as truth. What you can do, is help represent claims as claims, and fact as fact, and then perhaps it seems less like suppression. Can we agree that most of what the Correas are advocating are claims that have not been fully replicated to warrant a recognition of it as fact? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 23:52, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was not aware that the Britannica was the Wikipedia standard. But is the standard of Britannica to declare something into a belief system "<b>unless you back it up with unverifiable sources</b>", as you wrote above? Kinda doubt it. Fishy, no? How much of a community encyclopedia is Wikipedia when 5 admins and a Chihuahua become judges of what is or not (1) factual (is the original submission factual? which is different from:is its content factual?), (2) peer-reviewed or peer-tested or not, (3) worthy of mention, (4) worthy of study, (5) a science, a quasi-science, or a falsification, intentional or not? A little humility on the part of admins in dealing with the situation would have been the smart move. Suppression, falsification of records (as in Talk), addition of scurrilous pages, muzzling ("each Wikipedian is supposed to act like an Administrator..." - a good joke when power is stacked by a very visible policy of suppression), destruction of texts, rush to judgement: not very smart. Not to mention the Wikipedia policy of removing gratuitous slander of third parties.209.29.93.57 23:51, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not the proper place for a serious article about anything. The overall quality of "information" in the Wikipedia is appalling - as is inevitable with a publication whose editorial process encourages incompetent people to "boldly edit" and muck with the work of people who are more knowledgeable. Who in the world would buy a print encyclopedia whose editors did not recognize that every subject has its experts, and that those experts are more qualified to convey knowledge about their subject than others are? But if its "Wiki", then suddenly a free-for-all can have the pretensions to being a "professional" and "reliable" source of knowledge. <b>Delete</b>, <b>delete</b>.

<li>And there you have it. Mr. Natalinasmpf once again, displaying his irrepressible, obnoxious POV. Why don't you try to be honest, just once in these pages. You've been on a campaign to slander the correas from the get go, and here you come again with your snake oil stupidities. Just vote for deletion. It's obvious that you'll never be able to treat the material in an impartial manner - your POV screams from one end of this discussion to the other. Has it occurred to you that it's more than mildly fanatic to consider yourself on a noble mission to save mankind from the clutches of aetherometry without having the slightest idea of what Aetherometry might be?

</ul>
<p><b>Of course its POV. Its a talk page comment</b>. As to be on a "campaign to slander the Correas from the get go", I never heard of them until five days ago, and I simply question their credentials because of my OPINION that this theory is bunk. Oh, I'm afraid that by addressing me, you severely jumped to conclusions. Its not that I "don't have the slightest idea of what aetherometry is", because aetherometry is <b>nonsense</b>, as much nonsense as <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a> is. That is my opinion. I'm not producing it in the article, but I deserve the right to make such an opinion known on this talk page. Fanatic to be on a noble mission, I consider that a good thing. A religious devotion to an unsubstantiated theory, no.

<p>What did you think Wikipedia was for? Profit? No. Its to provide an encylopedia to the world. A noble mission. Zealotry? Ironic, considering <b>your lack of verifiable sources</b>. To this date none of you (Helicoid, Patrick, you and all the people who registered and "arrived" days ago not to contribute to Wikipedia, but to push POV) - has provided a verifiable source. Unless you provide a verifiable source, all my statements are valid. Do you brand me with those who type in AOLer? Is that it?

But you could at least have the courage of your obnoxious convictions and vote to delete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, just because I have a POV on the issue doesn't mean I can't contribute. Nearly all Wikipedians have POV's with similar zealotry, probably even you, on any case, concerning any subject. I am not making a personal attack against any other Wikipedian: I reserve the right to criticise the theory if I wish, its perfectly legitimate. Its a point of view. That's the whole point. Everyone has a POV - but that's on the talk page. I did not bring this into the article space. As for "unwilligness to inform oneself" - I have duly informed myself, and I have viewed the advocacy websites. You can't assume "I haven't read the material" just because I disagree with you. It appears this is out of spite. Funny, "I have no place", but you want me to vote delete?

<li>Delete. My favorite quote from the one who appears to be the major wikibureaucrat (Natalinasmpf) is: "It has become a belief system, unless you back it up with unverifiable sources." I'm perplexed: was that a Freudian slip, or did he really mean that? If you want verifiable, go read Experimental Aetherometry Volume 1 - lots of detailed experimental data there (and you can easily verify it by relpicating the experiments). However, if you'd rather continue to believe that laboratory electroscopes can produce energy from nothing, you won't be interested in the results. 199.232.231.114 03:28, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)"</li>

<p>Freudian slip? Do tell me - <b>a book written by the Correas is not a third party source</b>. Its a reference no doubt, but its part of the aetherometry advocates in itself, not checked by third party scientists. As for "producing energy from nothing" that's ironic, although it doesn't explicitly say so, by claiming your "philosophy from Tesla", you are indeed looking for some alternative new free energy source, that is dubious at best. A book isn't a scientific paper, either. Unless other scientists took it upon themselves to peer review it. And for the umpteenth time, you address me wrongly, but I guess lack of common sense and a sense of what science is leaves you perplexed. Experimental Aetherometry Volume 1, unless you can cite me <b>page number</b>, <b>line number</b>, and <b>reviews by other scientific journals, page number and line number included</b> - <b>its not verifiable</b>. You can't say, "oh, I have a source at so and so, so I don't need to cite" - ISDN number, page number, line number - and oh, a bookw written by the Correas does not count, because they do not cite third party sources. Do provide me with an experiment of something reproducible. In fact, instead of filling the article with nonsense on how you think the universe works, give us the outline of detailed, reproducible experiments, and then tell us how that is evidence. It would be most appreciated. The best thing about you aetherometry proponents is that you claim, "I have sources, do you really want me to cite them to you"? And then we request, yes, <b>we want those sources cited, page number/line number</b> - and you don't provide. You evade the question, and rather continue attacking us. <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">Logical fallacy</a> - maybe you don't have anything to provide. Of course, I want to say its nonsense. I'm not saying its nonsense on the article, so I am not violating anything.

I don't see how this is relevant to aetherometry though. As for being an aetherometrist, at the moment, I just have a piqued curiosity for something I very much doubt the credibility of.

As for apologies and retraction, I will not budge. I will remain steadfast in my opinion. The decision to vote keep or delete is based on whether the article can be salvaged or not.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Before any industrious admins engaged in "tedious housekeeping activities" descend upon me to delete my comments, I would like to claim the same courtesy from them to express my unabashed POV for deletion, as has been extended to their most dubious 'editors' to express theirs. I would also like to say to TTLightningRod, as I cast my vote for STRONG DELETION that it looks to me like you're definitely in the wrong forum here, mate... As far as I'm concerned it can't come down fast enough. I did, however want to tell you, GangofOne and 209.29.93.65 that I was following all your careful and painstaking work last night with some interest and enjoyment - only to see the demolition derby move back in - led by the Katefan0 of beer girl fame and little Radioactive boyscout from you-know-where. Ah yes, and then came the fastidious victorian ladies tea party suffragettes on their way to clear the good names of Tesla and Einstein of what, remains, I'm afraid, entirely opaque. This purifying activity is pure burlesque It would seem to me that a person with your intelligence definitely needs to find another home for his activities.

<li>The "Improvement" by Natalinas, Mel Etitis, Knott, etc (the admin gang) is rather apparent. Natalinas, you make me cry of laughter. But the improvement will not stand for long as the vote is to delete (every abortion should be deleted). What good reasons can you make to keep? Only fools would bother with your kind. But let's say that I'm a fool 'coz I needed a taste of your kind of democracy, power, intelligence, goodwill, sharp wit, independence from authorities, knowledge, accuity, just to remind me of how lousy mao-maos (that's stalinist-maoist fanatics) are. Ah, and how <b>fascism is indeed, even today, the dearest secretion of leftism</b>. Wikipedia: the fascism of leftist majorities of administrators desperately trying to control the content of culture and knowledge, and monopolize meaning. NPOV certificates available! Apply to Karada, Jacobi, Connolley, etc! Factotums wanted! Preferably self-styled anarchists and underage! Apply to Wikipedia (Google too?). Helicoid</li>
</ul>
<p>Good reasons to keep? Well, since you all voted keep at the start, and have proven me how notably dangerous and how false, this kind of "science" is, I vote to keep to inform readers of the truth about aetherometry, and include scientific critique of it when I have time. Unless of course, you want to cooperate, make aetherometry look better, and generally treat other editors with respect, I could change all of that. I bet the millions of others that hit this site each day are "fools" as well, I guess. Fascism is the secretion of leftism? Pardon me, but it's rather the opposite, Bolsheivks and Mao - and all of them - they were "right-wingers" who purposely hijacked the communist ideology for their state capitalist gain. Mao Maos? That's your kind, not mine. Its the kind aetherometrists seem to be made out of, to denounce constructive edits as "suppression", while masking their own suppression of their opposition as "vandalism and ignorance". Truly platonic, I can see. Majories of administrators? Are you insinuating that the hundreds of thousands of contributors, millions if you count legitimate anonymous contributors are all part of a grand conspiracy? Unfortunately, it seems that's what aetherometry is in fact, how ironic. A plot and a scam to try to suck the unwitting reader into its plutocratic grasp. "Underage"? Unfortunately, age does not define validity of contribution. As for asserting your authority over the article, how fascist as well, you want it to be deleted, simply because YOU, as an individual, can't stand it, and you want to assert your pro-fascist ideology over everyone else, and condemn constructive editing, and project that would undermine <b>your power based on ignorance</b>. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 23:58, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Natalinas, you as qualified to "inform readers of the truth about aetherometry" as I am to write a treatise about sea cucumbers. And are you threatening Helicoid that unless she cooperates, you are going to "make aetherometry look bad"? That's what it sounds like: "Unless of course, you want to cooperate, make aetherometry look better, and generally treat other editors with respect, I could change all of that.". In other words, you're threatening that if Helicoid doesn't "cooperate", you will spread lies about Aetherometry. Nice goings on - all brought to us by the Spotless Wikipedia Team. And isn't it rather ignoble to vote to keep an article out of hatred for its subject matter? Man, you are one demented, pathetic mush-brain. 165.154.24.56 00:58, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nothing is stopping you from writing a treatise about sea cucumbers. You can go ahead, and you won't be stopped. Other editors will correspond with you to check your facts, if you are civil. I'm not threatening Helicoid: because since I do not advocate aetherometry, without his correspondence, the article will be more critical of aetherometry then it should be. If he wants to avoid that, then he should contribute constructively. In order words, I'm not going to spread "lies" about aetherometry, because aetherometry isn't verified in the first place. If I say it isn't "rigorously peer reviewed", and Helicoid isn't there to try to provide sources to prove otherwise, then Helicoid's possible correction will of course, not be present. Ignoble to keep an article out of hatred for its subject matter? Hardly. It's my view, and there's nothing wrong with my vote. It's an opinion. Its hardly being a mush-brain for doing so, perhaps out of spite, but then again, that's eye for an eye, isn't it?</dd>

<p>I'd also advise you to know what "fascism" is. Fascism is when the corporations control the state, and wealth rules everything - a plutocracy - and seeing how your scamming of a corporation of aetherometry runs, and your attempts to silence valid opposition on a free encylopedia to your claims, you aetherometrists are hypocrites. State-capitalism like Bolshevism and Maoism which appears aetherometrists love so much, and tute as their "philosophy", and tries to poison the meaning of what anarchism and libertarian socialism is, is a form of fascism. Libertarian socialism is the antithesis of fascism.

Ironically, YOU - who can edit anything, and could edit that article to be improved right now, are talking right here, and wouldn't be given a voice otherwise. You wouldn't be able to say that this was an "actual science". Britannica and CNN and everywhere else would not listen to your comments. Oh, Wikipedia receives about 40,000 edits each day, so it isn' tabou tan "edit every five minutes or so". Whether or not they can form a grammatical sentence is irrelevant - it can be corrected. Unfortunately, ironically, Helicoid can't even do this properly. So how are you to criticise? If anything, they are at most typos from replies being typed out in haste. I love how Helicoid includes parantheses everywhere, that acutally muck up the paragraph flow. You obviously don't get the concept of what a wiki is.

<dd>No. What is shameful and disgraceful is the way it was done. You-all could have courteously approached the original author. You could have thanked her for her contribution and explained to her that scientific projects not described in mainstream literature were subject to a special procedure for establishing credibility. You could have informed her, upfront, exactly what kinds of proofs of credibility were required and in what form. If the original author could not, or did not care to, furnish the requisite proofs, the matter would end right there, the article would be deleted, and everybody would have parted on good terms. If the original author could furnish enough acceptable proof, the next step should have been to give her general guidelines about how to make the article itself accepatble - and then let her, and/or anybody else knowledgeable about the subject and cooperating with the original author, make the changes. And after that you-all, and everybody who cared about knowledge and information, should have participated in protecting the intergity of the information in the article from subsequent distortion and falsification.</dd>

<dd><b>That</b> is the way anybody worthy of the name "encyclopedia editor" should have acted. But none of that was done. Instead, the article was immediately, and without any basis, treated as if it had been submitted in bad faith; the author was treated with derision, contempt and condescension; both the author and the scientists whose work was described in the article were subjected to slander and defamation of character; and a kangaroo-court proceeded to ride haywire on the subject without knowing anything about it, and to replace the article with ignorant derisive crap. <b>That's</b> what is shameful and disgraceful. And even more shameful and disgraceful is that none of you people - you PJacobis, you William Conneleys, you Natalinas', you Mel Etitis' (sounds like a disease), you Karadas', you Guettardas - don't feel any sense of shame about it - no, to the contrary, you feel a sense of holy righteousness.

I am in the process of typing up a lengthy, semi-apolegetic discourse, which of course my stance of it as a fringe science will not change, nor my stance that it needs more peer review and is probably wrong in many areas, although probably insightful - that will not change. But I really hope we can be civil, and to cooperate and rule out the kinks. Now for one thing, I am going to retract some of my previous statements about aetherometry.

The concept of slander and libel is something invented by authoritarian leaders who can't stand a tarnished reputation and can't stand criticism, and business leaders who are afraid to lose their precious, precious monetary gains. That's fascist. The political opposition in my country are all silenced because the government prosecutes them for slander and libel, and silences the students too, if they try to make any public critique of the government. That's the thing I can't stand. The moment you say its "slanderous and libelous" - I immediately think you are as politically decadent as my government. A good scientist merely shrugs off these claims, or rebuts them with cool. Now, I have agreed to apologise for some things, but I will not do it because you demanded it so, or you asked me to. I do it because this is a comment of my own accord. I'm not doing it because "its the least I should do" - but rather, because I want to reconcile this ugly battle that never should have happened in the first place.
