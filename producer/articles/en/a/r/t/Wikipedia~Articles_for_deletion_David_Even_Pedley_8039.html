<li><b>Keep</b> as notable: If you drop the middle name, you get 139,000 hits, and most people that have middle names, rarely use those. The Wikipedia rules for keeping an article about an individual are only that they have been written about in two major publications, if I remember, and in this case this man has been not only in countless news articles around the world for many decades, even this year, almost two decades after his death, he has been talked and picture shown on national and international TV programmes, such as CBS 60 Minutes II. However, I admit that the article needs more work, and just pieced that together to get the article started in earnest. I don't know how an article about Pedley in any way pushes the DOM. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnski_87b6.html" title="User:Johnski">Johnski</a> 03:22, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Johnski. "used to push DOM"? POV error exists <i>only</i> if permitted by editors. Put an NPOV tag on the articles or sections you dispute, or edit them to fix them. POV errors don't make a subject a less valid topic for an encyclopedia, although they clearly reduce the quality of the articles they exist in. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:49, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I rewrote the article, though I will say that in my opinion it is pretty bad form to post such an obviously POV cut and paste job in lieu of writing an NPOV article. I removed all the information about Ben David... this isn't his article... as well as some of the unimportant biographical details about marriages, etc. I'm going to tag this with "disputed facts" as soon as I can find the tags, because some of the information I have not been able to independantly verify yet.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:05, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The previous comment about POV error exsisting only if it is permitted by editors is true. However, when you have one person chronically adding this stuff to over 10 diffrent pages, it becomes a bigger problem then just POV on one page. The editor in question has began a campign to add as many articles as he can as well as add DOM to countless pages to POV push and to try to justify DOM. It has gotten to the point of vandalism through adding and editing pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The editor in question also has claimed that there are numerous other people that support his version of the Dominion of Melchazidek article and continues to revert the article up to three times a day. If this isn't POV, then what the heck is? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 04:24, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gene, the reason that I started this page about Pedley was to make the page less cluttered that you want to merge it to. Why do you try to insult me by claiming that you suspect me of being connected to a reputed crime family or the ecclesiastical government they are newsworthy of founding? I don't think this is the first time you got facts wrong, and here again, not that it is pertinent to deletion, I can not find any evidence to support your statement that "this individual has notoriety solely due to his criminal association with Melchizedek". Although Context Magazine says that Pedley founded Melchizedek in the 1950s, in fact, it appears that he died in the 1980's years before Melchizedek became newsworthy because of the allegations against the banks it licensed in the 1990s. Pedley was in the news years before the media began writing about DOM, and apparently the subject of a book called the "Fountain Pen Conspiracy". Just before Melchizedek hit the news, around 1990, the Sacramento, California U.S. Marshall was quoted by the Sacramento Bee as saying that the Pedley case was politically motivated. This to me is pretty interesting stuff. Are you saying that Pedley's translation of the Melchizedek Bible was Pedley's criminal association to DOM, because that is the only association I can find to DOM other than his son following in his footsteps?<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnski_87b6.html" title="User:Johnski">Johnski</a> 05:56, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow another bs move by Johnski and unsigned at that. This is from the person who tried to convience me that blogs could be used as a creditable source. Speaking of creditablity, you are shooting yourself in the foot in terms of your creditablity by the statements you make. You purposly lie and misrepresent the rules of Wikipedia to push DOM. In fact, here is the true interpretation of the rule you misquoted:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"An AFD decision is either to "keep" or "delete" the article. AFD discussions which fail to reach rough consensus default to "keep". The AFD decision may also include a strong recommendation for an additional action such as a "merger" or "redirect". In many cases, the decision to "keep" or "delete" may be conditional on the community's acceptance of the additional action. These recommendations do represent the community consensus and also should not be overturned lightly. However, these are actions which can be taken by any editor and do not require "admin powers". If they are challenged, the decision should be discussed and decided on the respective article Talk pages. A second AFD discussion is unnecessary."</p>

<dd>Davidpdx, I'm not asking anyone to trust me, only to write balanced, fair and factual articles. I don't believe that I said that a blog is a credible source only that one can be used in certain circumstances, and I finally admitted that you were correct in regard to the way I used it, which was only in a single case. Look at 131.211.51.34 activity and think about whether that is really me.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnski_87b6.html" title="User:Johnski">Johnski</a> 19:18, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite</b>. A glance at <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_Melchizedek_2038.html" title="Dominion of Melchizedek">Dominion of Melchizedek</a> proves that Pedley is notable. However, as this article currently reads, he appears to be Yet Another Forgettable Translator of the Bible (tm); only when you get several tedious paragraphs into the quoted text does one find that he is involved in several felony financial crimes. Unless it can be shown that this is a hoax, I think a career felon is notable. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:43, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll tell you what, I'll do a rewrite when I get a chance today. The more I look at this, I'm on the fence a bit on notability because while <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_Melchizedek_2038.html" title="Dominion of Melchizedek">Dominion of Melchizedek</a> has slight notability, I'm not so sure that this notability is necessarily confered on the creator. Still, I will rewrite it NPOV (which is sorely lacking right now) and condense it because I don't believe there is much value in hearing about his marriages, etc. The arrests and convictions are all verifiable, though Pedley claims they were cooked up. Even if this article gets deleted, at the end of the day it's still good practice for NPOVing an article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 11:35, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
