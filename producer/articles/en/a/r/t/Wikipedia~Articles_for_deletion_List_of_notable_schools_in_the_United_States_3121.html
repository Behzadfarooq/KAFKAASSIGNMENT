<li><b>Keep</b> This, I changed my mind. It will only confused the viewers. 69.212.70.25 04:00, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>P.S.</b> We still haven't figured out whether the <i>District of Columbia</i> or <i>Washington, D.C.</i> is the correct term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm in favor of <b>deleting</b> the entire list, as it is inherently un-encyclopedic (qv the List of Shopping Malls in VfD/Feb 18th). It's far too tempting for people to simply list all the schools they know in here, and most schools aren't notable to begin with. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:48, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See, for example, the entries for Tacoma, Washington—<i>every last</i> elementary, middle, and high school is listed there as "notable". —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 20:26, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Wouldn't a category be much more appropriate? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 14:47, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The category would be just as unencyclopedic as the list. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 20:51, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Move</b></strike> to List of schools in the United States. Then the schools don't have to be notable. 68.23.97.209 23:59, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why don't you delete other lists (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Japan_76fe.html" title="List of schools in Japan">List of schools in Japan</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_New_Zealand_e351.html" title="List of schools in New Zealand">List of schools in New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Singapore_4e88.html" title="List of schools in Singapore">List of schools in Singapore</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom_3d80.html" title="List of schools in the United Kingdom">List of schools in the United Kingdom</a>, etc.) too then, huh? 68.23.97.209 00:05, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Don't bother with it anymore. 68.23.97.209 02:38, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Good point, I've nominated those for deletion as well. Any others you want to mention? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 08:50, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. POV title. The above question by the anon is a good one. Why <i>don't</i> we? The List of schools in Connecticut article is still here, isn't it? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:44, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, actually, List of schools in Connecticut <i>isn't</i> there. 68.23.97.209 02:58, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good. Neither is List of schools in Albuquerque, and let's keep it that way. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 08:50, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Inherently POV as Korath says. VfD isn't a forum to discuss splitting an article into different pages. And, to the anon who started all this, please note that I probably wouldn't have paid enough attention to vote for deleting the list if you hadn't spammed my user page. It backfired. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:04, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> to List of secondary schools in the United States. Delete the primary schools. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 04:06, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this is inherently POV. While selection of articles based on their notability or lack therof is a POV decision of sorts reached by community consensus, actually <b>asserting within</b> an article that x is notable (implying that y is not notable) is a de-facto promotion of a viewpoint. I oppose a blanket merger &amp; creation of a "list of notable schools" on the same grounds - if something is notable, it should have its own article, or be discussed in an article -- When a topic is already wikiworthy, it may then be included in list of notable ____ (IMO, of course) <a href="../../../e/g/g/User%7EEggplantWizard_fc4d.html" title="User:EggplantWizard">Eggplant Wizard</a><sup><a href="../../../e/g/g/User_talk%7EEggplantWizard_74c0.html" title="User talk:EggplantWizard">Talk</a></sup><small>See notes in my user page about login problem</small> 06:09, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 06:32, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability is inherently subjective. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:44, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I vote for <b>breaking up the article</b> into the aforementioned smaller sections named "List of schools in the United States (Alabama-Florida", etc. Then we can get rid of this monster. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockingharder_5ba8.html" title="User:Rockingharder">Rockingharder</a> 06:54, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, move to List of schools in the United States, split into List of schools in Alabama <i>et al.</i>. And this isn't VfD-worthy, really. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 10:58, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 68.72.134.124 22:10, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If a school is notable, and you have information establishing this, put that information into an article about the school. If you don't have information that establishes the notability of the school, you have no business listing it in this so-called "article". Moreover, whether a school is notable is an opinion. A list is not the place to express opinions, since the format is not consistent with presenting arguments and facts in support of the competing views. Since lists are binary and cannot both include the school and not include it at the same time, one point of view inevitably wins and the others lose. People with intermediate views cannot have their opinion represented at all. Such a list therefore is inconsistent with NPOV by its very nature. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:12, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and move to List of schools in the United States. This VfD nomination is really a mess. People vote keep for something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Singapore_4e88.html" title="List of schools in Singapore">List of schools in Singapore</a> and yet this article gets a lot of delete votes. I fail to understand why. Splitting article in parts is not a VfD matter and the article being too big is no reason to delete it entirely. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 13:26, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 68.72.139.143 04:14, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 68.23.104.148 01:39, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remark</b>. Several anon votes for retaining the article were ignored as per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">deletion policy</a>.</p>
<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
