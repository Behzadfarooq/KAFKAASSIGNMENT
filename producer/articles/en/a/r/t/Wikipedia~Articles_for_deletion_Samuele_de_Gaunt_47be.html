<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm am a left-wing activist in Portugal and I've never heard about such things ... The photo doesn's seem to had been taken in the 1940's. Google reports only 3 results for "Samuele de Gaunt" and are all related to this article. This seems like a vanity page with a big background story. Samuele de Gaunt is not an hero to the portuguese left-wing, no one has heard about Samuele de Gaunt! Actually that is not a Portuguese name. If you try to read the story you will find it way too silly.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there's not a single reference to him on the Portuguese site, so he can't be all that famous if he existed at all. I also found absolutely about him on a few different Portuguese language search engines. If this is a joke, it's a bad one and a strange way to waste time. Kyle543 01:17, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Note- Living in Sale, I have viewed a commemorative plaque to de Gaunt in the town hall, which I am sure the above posters have not witnessed. Samuele de Gaunt was not as famous as mentioned in the article, which accounts for his relatively low to zero documentation on the internet. However, he did exist nonethelss and was both a folk guitarist and left-wing political activist.</li>

<p>My fellow posters. As a U.S student of Archaeology at Coimbra University I have recently come across this article and assumed that it was utterly fictional. However on a visit to the Municipal Graveyard or the túmulo do país on Ladeira das Alpenduradas I found the graves mentioned in the article. They seem in first class condition and I suspect they are well cared for. Whether this means the entire story is authentic is another matter.</p>

<p>Most of the votes of deletion are from liars- they say they are themselves political activists. That is quite frankly laughable, and although some parts may have been tampered with the person that is Samuele de Gaunt indeed visited our town of Sale.

<li>My point is, if this dude is so bleeping famous in Portugal as our anonymous poster claims, there should be a Portuguese page for him. I just checked for one, and it's not there. That implies this fellow is not as important as our anonymous poster asserts. "Taking away this page is like taking away our history" is a bit much; why are you concentrating on an English page if the fellow is so important to Portugal? <b>Delete</b> if no resolution of these issues. <a href="../../../a/2/k/User%7EA2Kafir_5330.html" title="User:A2Kafir">A<sup>2</sup>Kafir</a> 13:53, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Do not delete.</b> A Sale resident myself (check the IP!) I was fortunate enough to encounter Mr. de Gaunt during his brief sojourn into our fair town. I am duty-bound to confirm that the countenance gracing the page to which this Vote refers (and may I add that the persons posting for deletions are evincing a lamentable ignorance about Sale and Mr. de Gaunt) is indeed that of Mr. de Gaunt, and that, with some possible inaccuracies, the information contained therein is without doubt representative of actual events, persons and places. To attempt to delete this resource is not merely to deprive people everywhere of this small morsel of Sale's history, but to slur (though admittedly without intent to do so) Mr. de Gaunt's name. - J.

<p>Having been informed of this page by several surprised Wikipedia users, I have to confirm that Samuele de Gaunt was indeed a Portuguese folk singer; I was unaware of many (if any) left-wing acitivities on his part, but his talents as a bard were formidable and not to be trifled with. To delete this page (despite any posible inaccuracies therein) is a travesty and one which I consider an unforgivable breach of Wikipedia's mission. My own experiences of de Gaunt during his all-too-brief period in Sale were quite a revelation, and it will be a sad loss if others are deprived of the chance to grasp at some small sample of his beauteous musical talents.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I live in Manchester, and Sale is but a short distance away on the Metrolink; I checked in the library and there are a couple of small displays of de Gaunt, but some of the information here may be embellished - requires alot of revision. <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpeggio_32e3.html" title="User:Arpeggio">Arpeggio</a> 18:45, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why on earth would anyone want to write a 'vanity' article, as Dr. White so rightly says, about a dead, little known Portuguese left wing political activist? Surely we should be encouraging this article? It recognises the integrity and bravery of someone who was, undoubtedly, a very fine man. Do we want to lose this small piece of Samuele de Gaunt? It is our only link to him now, apart from his remaining poetry. He is clearly a hero, and one who deserves to be remembered in any way that we can. Also, as a Sale resident, I can confirm the existence of the plaque to de Gaunt's memory. I suggest that anyone who doubts the truth of this statement comes to Sale. Or do they not wish to be proven wrong? Especially as phots seem to copy so badly onto this page "<b>The photo doesn's seem to had been taken in the 1940's</b>" (again, the first poster). As to his name not being portuguese, could not his parents have been immigrants, or maybe even only one parent? We are not considering all of the possibilities here. Thank you. User:81.155.199.53</p>

<dd>This is where, once again, we want you to do this: <b>PROVE IT.</b> Show us articles, show us books, show us poetry, show us stuff that will try to convince us. It is not our job to do YOUR research. You claim to know all of these facts, but nothing to show proof to back those claims up. Plus, as mentioned earlier, if he was a great man that was valued by the Portugese people, he will be on the Portugese version of Wikipedia, but he is not. That, to me, brings me a clear sign that he is probably not notable. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 21:50, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Lucky,</b> how can we have any idea whether or not the "genuine portuguese leftist" is, in fact, a genuine portuguese leftist? You seem to take their word for it with less evidence than you do for the supporters of Samuele de Gaunt. This, to me, suggests that you are not impartial. Perhaps you have conceived a dislike for Mr. de Gaunt? <b>STRONG KEEP.</b> User:81.155.199.53(FL)</p>

<dd>I see a long page, a photo, and a bunch of stuff, but no sources, no links, nothing to support any statement. Anything that has been found online, it is from Wikipedia mirrors. The "UK Guide" <a href="http://www.explore-places.com/united_kingdom/S/Sale,_Greater_Manchester.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.explore-places.com/united_kingdom/S/Sale,_Greater_Manchester.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and Realestate.ca <a href="http://www.realestate.ca/Sale-Greater-Manchester/reference/fullview/wikipedia/367154" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realestate.ca/Sale-Greater-Manchester/reference/fullview/wikipedia/367154" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> are just Wikipedia mirrors of that one page, which the hoax was removed before. Wikipedia wants proof on their articles, and until you get some, we will keep on saying delete. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 22:02, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
