<li><b>Comment</b> -- The content, however, seems problematic; a lot of it being to the effect of "such-and-such on Samurai Jack resembles something else on some other show." And a lot of the such-and-suches seem to be pretty stock characters for action cartoons. To count as an encyclopedia-worthy reference, it should have to take more than a mere suggestion of plausibility. As it stands now, the article is more like "Things I've Been Reminded of While Watching Samurai Jack," hardly suitable for inclusion. <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPop_Secret_7c4e.html" title="User:Pop Secret">Pop Secret</a> 06:14, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I certainly understand your concern, but I have to go back to my earlier question. If it is accepted to list porn sites in WP, how do you determine which ones are worthy of listing?

<li>I've withdrawn my keep vote. I certainly have no stake in keeping a lesporn site listed. Maybe I was playing devil's advocate a bit. One might be able to argue that this site is more notable than some of the sfcruft or gamecruft sites that are well represented on WP, but that's another story. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 15:18, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With not even a sniff of a credible third party refence, this is currently <i>not</i> satisfying the website notability guidelines.

<li>WP:WEB specificly excludes <i>"a brief summary of the nature of the content"</i>. Most "reviews" would fall into this category.</li>
<li>Porn review sites are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Even if they <i>were</i> reliable sources, they list more sites than you can shake your stick at, and we're clearly not going to have them all. Hence the exclusion above.</li>
<li>Attempting to set some hurdle that only "good" sites based upon these reviews is certainly a novel concept, but a flawed one. Leaving aside the question of if we set the bar above or below Ass Traffic, the possability exists that only those sites that have click-though kickbacks are given high ratings. Reputable and unbiased are what we look for in sources, after all.</li>

<dd>If this is actually a notable lesbian porn website, it will have gotten a <i>real</i> write up, probably more than a few.

<p><b>Comment</b>, It is a little fuzzy as to what is creative thought and non-notable on the part of a ametuer and what is accepted fiction on the part of a professional. I have seen countless articles on fictional characters that are not deleted, while this character, being invented (presumably) by the author or a close friend, is not accepted due to its lack of fame. Of course, I am not sure of all of Wikipedia's guidlines on the subject, although it appears as though they are just made up by the users anyway.

<p>That last comment was correct. It would be kind of hypocritical for this article to be deleted merely on the basis that the subject matter is not well known. It's not as though Wikipedia has a lack of memory to keep this article as one of it's over 1,000,000. I think it is pretty interesting myself.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>I apologize profusely. Some B**tard was using my "Fourdotelipsis" name. I've changed my password now, but anyway: OneCone is actually a small community that has grown since it's inception in 2001, and has ranged from the production of e-books (which were scrapped), Internet communities, and now, film production and release. The "OneCone International" name is just a doppleganger created by some idiots who though it would be a good name for a company. In truth, it's more like a creative forum that has no real home. May I suggest that I recreate the more accurate content under the name of "OneCone" or no? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefourdotelipsis_84ca.html" title="User:Thefourdotelipsis">Thefourdotelipsis</a> 05:11, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, it may well be. The most notable part would have to be the involvemnent with film production, as well as the major internet societies made in early 2005 (until May). There are plans to begin script writing for feature length films, time will only tell. Fact of the matter is, I do hear "What the hell is OneCone" so often, that an article may well be useful. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefourdotelipsis_84ca.html" title="User:Thefourdotelipsis">Thefourdotelipsis</a> 05:45, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I agree that the first version of "Randy Caparoso" was a vanity piece. Please chalk this up to inexperience. The piece has been totally revised to focus on its primary purpose: to pose the subject as a virtually the only wine writer today known for knowledge of Asian and fusion food and wine matching. This is of great value because this is what people eat today, and wine is often their chosen beverage. Please reconsider deleting the revision.</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_submarine.html" title="Nuclear submarine">nuclear submarine</a>. Sure, it takes no maintenance - because it is a very small list which does not change much. In other words, it can be covered encyclopaedically in the main article. When there are a dozen or more it might be a bit too much, but the current content, when converted to prose, makes up one or at most two short paragraphs. Alternatively, make it a list of all nucmear submarines with current status (decommissioned, sunk, still in service, sold to a South American dictator etc). A list of eight items which is unlikely to change much does not seem to me to be a significant topic. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:54, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as this it useful as a list. I would not say that it is redundant because of the other lists, as it includes subs from both countries and nuclear is not a trivial distinction. Also, keeping it as a list allows for notes and an extended introduction.

<p>This was put up for prod by <a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a>, but I thought that it deserved more discussion/attention than it was likely to receive through that process, so I'm listing it here instead. I think that Ms. Baggs is sufficiently notable to merit a biography (though it's not entirely clear-cut), and I'm not sure exactly how heavily to weight her stated preference not to have an article (cited on the article's talk page). For tallying purposes, treat this as a <b>No Vote</b>, with the hope that some constructive discussion can work things out. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 15:30, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Possible delete</b> unless more significance is established. Many many people write for magazines, few of them should have articles. This magazine doesn't even have an article, so maybe it's not a major one. At any rate, it makes no sense to go creating articles on individual contributors before having one on thge magazine itself. However, if she's sufficiently verifiable as an activist, this could be a reason to keep. Google does turn her up here and there on the internet, but that's not really enough. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:41, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I added the magazine because it was the only print media citation turned up by a casual search. She's supposedly much more notable for her online work (on blogs and autism sites), but I didn't add that because it's not something I'm really familiar with and I didn't want to accidentally add more errors to the article when she's already unhappy about it. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 15:53, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm.

<li><b>Comment</b>: One possible solution is to create an article like Autism rights movement activists for respective activists who might not be noteworthy enough to have articles in Wikipedia, but still play an important role in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_rights_movement.html" title="Autism rights movement">autism rights movement</a>. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 00:58, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just read the blog entry by Amanda Baggs. Since she doesn't talk about her life in public, there will be no way to find references for an article, which means that the only way to have something more developed than a stub is to do original research, which is not allowed on Wikipedia. <b>Delete</b> either as original research or something that has no potential to be more than a stub. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 01:05, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just my 2-cents here: though I coined the term, it has had some significant usage outside of my direct sphere of influence. Most people have found the word very useful in describing something that has hitherto not been described - namely the experience of "shared flow" - flow being a term Csikszentmihalyi made up, in a similar manner. He is familar with my terh and has endorsed it. Please let me know what I need to do to correct any "neologistic" concerns.

<p>My first reaction when I saw this thing on Newpages was - this is very, very non-notable, possibly a speedy, but then I looked around in the stub categories which were all in the same boat, so this may be a litmus-test for similar AFL related teams - <a href="../../../a/f/l/WP%7EAFL_72f6.html" title="WP:AFL">WP:AFL</a>.<br />
<br />
Australian Rules Football (Australian Football League) is a sport which basically exclusive to Australia. To the best of my knowledge, there is no "world cup" for this sport - but if there is, perhaps Australia does not participate due to an exemption (because it would turn into a monumental mismatch). There is no International Competition in this sport that Australia takes part in. Australia is the only country with a professional league, and even though there are roughly (16 teams * 40 players in a squad = 640 players). In the whole history of AFL competition, there have only been 5-10 non-Australians (all from Ireland) who have reached the AFL - "top 600" (in the 100+ years of the sport existing) so to speak. Thus I feel that an amateur club in the United States domestic competition, a country which has NOT produced ANY players who have reached a professional level is not notable. Similar articles for many domestic AMATEUR teams in the Canadian league have also been created. Generally speaking, AFL is only known in Canada and the United States due to Australian expatriates who play recreationally on weekends.<br />
<br />
This is similar to<a href="../../../c/r/i/Portal%7ECricket_1b4e.html" title="Portal:Cricket">Portal:Cricket</a> where the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_cricket_team.html" title="Canadian cricket team">Canadian cricket team</a> competed in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Cricket_World_Cup_0bad.html" title="2003 Cricket World Cup">2003 Cricket World Cup</a> with a team of mostly dual citizens from Australia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, who did not even live in Canada, was lead by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Davison_029e.html" title="John Davison">John Davison</a> who spent most of his time sitting on the bench in Australia for the domestic team, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Redbacks_c2da.html" title="Southern Redbacks">Southern Redbacks</a>. As domestic Canadian cricket teams basically consist of a few expats having a social game on Sundays followed by a beer, thereby not warranting an article, I feel that Canadian and American based AFL teams should also not warrant an article, as the lack of international competition (no world cup) indicates that the level of AFL is very, very, very non-notable outside of Australia (much more so than cricket). I think the necessary information should be in "AFL in Canada" and "AFL in USA".<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 03:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The existence of AFL in America is noteworthy, and has an article, but this is about a club in a country where NOBODY has reached the professional level, in a sport which does not have a "WORLD CUP/CHAMPIONSHIPS" because only one country plays it to any meaningful standard.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 04:11, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm inclined to not think much of it if Australia is excluded - probably as a "mercy rule" on the other national teams. I remember a sport report on it last year, and the sports anchor on Ten's Sports Tonight made a lot of editorializing which lampooned the visiting international teams - judging by the bits that they showed in the report, the standard of play looked even clumsier than my old high school team.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 23:14, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not sure about this one. The article claims that this guy is an Israeli militant of some note, leadership of Jewish lobby groups, and claims activity in the 1980s, which is suspicious because it only gives 44 google hits, apparently unrelated to Jewish affairs. It is also written with a rather subtle attack-POV tone, which also heightens my suspicion as to whether this is a hoax, or even then, perhaps nn.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 03:12, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Judging by DarrenRay's sentiments expressed on his userpage and the controversy on his talk page (and his large quantity of engaging other editors) - I feel that he has a conflict of interest as he appears to have had political dealings with Mr Stephen Luntz, and also that Mr Darren Ray has been stridently involved in edit conflicts over the UniMelb union issues, while he is the subject of some of the activities described in the article, and is currently involved in legal battles over the matter.</p>

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
There were nearly fifty participants in this deletion debate, and opinion was widely divided between the various options presented. As such, no single option gained a sufficient consensus to be implemented. However, the following trends were evident:</p>
<ul>
<li>About half of the participants supported <b>deletion</b>, most on the grounds of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.</li>
<li>A further ten percent supported keeping the articles on China and the EU, and <b>deleting the rest</b>.</li>
<li>About thirteen percent supported <b>merging</b> any verifiable, sourced content into other articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus although no single option recieved consensus, there is a consensus that the content should not remain in its present form. I suggest that any relevant content be added to the relevant country articles, and <i>only once that is done</i> should the articles be re-nominated for deletion. Re-nominators may cite the result of this debate as:</p>

<b>Comment</b> - I would just like to say this to the users of wikipedia. The main reason for deleting these articles are that they do not provide references. Well, now the Indian article has got 5 references and I have created a section on it's Talk Page outlining the sections we need to find references to. Hopefully, this article will no longer have any issues by the end of this week.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:25, 9 March 2006 (UTC)<br />
<big><b>UPDATE</b></big> - Fellow Wikipedians, I believe that this deletion vote could be either the best or worst thing that has happened to these articles in a long time. If they are deleted, that's the worst thing that has happened. But if you were to check the Potential Superpowers - India article now, you would realize that there are over 120 references, that's a heap of work, that's the best thing that could happen to this article. So please consider the work done before voting. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 08:57, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I don't think this is working. First of all, the people that have edited Superpower and Major powers agree that Russia, Japan and Brazil are NOT Potential Superpowers. They are not listed as potential superpowers and should not even have such a page. But seeing as they do have such a page, we need to create a seperate Articles for Deletion section when it comes to Russia, Brazil and Japan, as most people with a knowledge of the subject would agree that they are not potential superpowers anyway.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 08:54, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I support the addition of the others, as they are equivalent from a policy point of view. It seems at <a href="../../../s/u/p/Talk%7ESuperpower_492f.html" title="Talk:Superpower">Talk:Superpower</a> that it was realized in January that none of these articles had any verification. Instead of improving the articles, half of them were chosen to be orphaned and forgotten; and even <i>that</i> decision drew on no outside sources. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 09:14, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that their articles for deletion section should be seperate from India, China and the E.U., because this changes my opinion and I'm sure many users will now have to go and change their views so that they say <b>Keep</b> this and <b>Delete</b> that...<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It has long been agreed on the Superpower discussion that Brazil, Russia and Japan are not Potential Superpowers. Therefore, there is an extra reason to delete those three, because they shouldn't be there, they are Major Powers (and in Brazil's case, are barely Major Powers). But everyone must agree that India, China and the E.U. are Potential Superpowers, so therefore, atleast these articles are not misleading in their facts.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:37, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid you fail to understand my point of view. There was much debate on this matter and eventually the long-term editors of Superpower decided that Russia/Japan and Especially Brazil were definitely not Potential Superpowers. Wikipedia is here to present as much fact as it can to its readers and it is fact that India, China and the E.U. presently look like they will quickly rise to heights that Russia, Japan and Brazil will not rise to. Which (trying to draw it back to the topic) means that 3 should be deleted and 3 should be kept. But we're going off-topic, so I'll just stop this discussion in saying that we should have seperate deletion pages and since no-one has voted on Russia, Brazil and Japan yet, it is still not too late.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:59, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think this suggestion is indicative of the overal problem of these sets of articles. The solution to original research has become more original research which points in the other direction. This is an exceptional poor analysis anyway. It takes a lot of basic facts and from them extrapolates this geopolitical conclusion which is increasingly meaningless. Wikipedia should be a place that contains those facts, but it doesn't need to present them in a way that suggests a country will or will not become a superpower. Thus, no title change can solve this problem. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 06:30, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> India, <b>Improve</b> E.U., <b>Keep</b> China - I've been reading this article for a while, and I notice more and more that the data that is given in this article (to support the notion of India's rise) is more like a predicted extension of current events. That's right, prediction. Therefore, since it's more like crystal-balling, it is POV, and not reference is mentioned. And even worse, in my opinion, what they call "power points" to support India's rise is not even a power point at all.

<li>Responding to Jombo and DaGizza: Unreferenced articles should be referenced, and original research articles should be deleted. These articles do not display any evidence, <i>in the form of references</i>, that they are anything other than <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">novel narrative or historical interpretations</a>. As such, even if every bullet point were verified, the articles would still constitute original research. The China article is just barely an exception, because it links to a story that has both the words "China" and "superpower" in the title. Even there, the source does not support the article, and its mere presence doesn't vindicate the original research going on. If any of these articles is deleted, your work will not have been in vain; it will have served as an example of the kinds of research we don't do. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 21:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I honestly, really, appreciate that you have worked hard. But if you read through the "delete" comments above, you'll find that 130 one-sentence verifications do not address many of those contributors' concerns. At <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> you'll find the policy that bans "any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments that... would amount to a 'novel narrative or historical interpretation'". These articles seem like a textbook case of that problem. I'm satisfied that all 130 points are true and, in themselves, verifiable. But who decides which facts concerning India are relevant to its potential to be a superpower, or even which facts work towards or against becoming a superpower? The article does not name any scholars, authors, politicians, thinktanks, advocacy groups, governments, or <i>any</i> entity as having made those decisions; it is only fair to assume that they have been made by you. It is that kind of analysis -- that kind of synthesis -- that we must avoid if we are to build a meaningful and trustworthy <i>encyclopedic</i> article. Instead we have a potentially unlimited list of facts heaped into a "good" pile and a "bad" pile. If you find such a list helpful, you may want to preserve it somewhere else, but it does not belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 09:47, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Given the number of books and articles on the subject there is no OR. We did not invent the idea that these countries are being named as potential future superpowers. If we were doing articles like Potential Superpower: Belgium, or Potential Superpower: Monaco then your points might be valid.

I do believe, unlike many of the delete voters, that would be possible and beneficial to write an article on this topic that adheres to policy. Nonetheless, this article is not it. If it really offers a synthesis of <i>ideas</i> found elsewhere, and not just a list of facts, why doesn't it identify where those ideas come from? "X group emphasizes the importance of Y to India's potential superpower status"; it's not that hard. Instead I see atlases, news items, and maps. The article jumps from primary sources to conclusions, and that's way too OR for me. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 11:08, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> and this vote should be sufficient to allow future ariticles like Potential Superpowers—Papau New Guinea to be deleted on sight - Melchoir and others are just on point on this issue. Adding sources for the individual facts (e.g. India' military budget is XXX, India is a democracy) does not change the fact that the overall point of the article, that the synethesis of all of this information into the conclusion that India may or may not be a rising superpower is original research. All of the facts in these articles could be merged into the respective articles or subarticles for those countries, but I am hesitant to vote merge becuase (1) it appears that these references have been added after the fact with the intent of camoflaguing the OR (2) all of the <i>facts</i> in this article are probably covered already, in those respective articles. (3) There is no one volunteering to perform such a merge and new "references" would likely be added to these articles faster than they could be merged.

<li>References have not even been added after the fact. I still see no indication of where these arguments come from; all we have is a list of facts and a huge "further reading" section that hasn't been used. This could be a worthy topic, but it needs to be done correctly. In particular, an article that focuses on speculation must meet higher standards than our average article that focuses on a well-understand, factual topic. OR is the most important policy here, and it has not been satisfied. Nor, in fact, does anyone seem to have a plan to satisfy it, except to verify all the individual minutae and point the reader to a slew of books we haven't read, which may or may not agree with the article.

Re-read the articles, if you see anything un-mathematical or un-sourced that deals with the future then delete that bit. But what most of the article is, is an acknowledgement and list of the plus and minus points of a nation which will undoubtedly be helpful to the reader.

So long as the requisite sources/citations are provided, I think we should keep the article on Russia's potential to become a superpower in the future. The article is well written and summarizes the key issues very well. Besides, I think that Russia indeed has a potential to become one of the superpowers IN THE LONG RUN. Russia arguably has more natural resources and raw materials than any other country in the world and if wise policies are pursued, its prospects for economic recovery may be very strong. If nothing else, it can already be called an 'energy superpower'. As far as its military and space technology is concerned, it currently is far more advanced than China or India. It still has the capacity to make first class weapons that can rival those manufactured in the West. Russia has territories spreading through 11 time zones. Its geography can allow it to become a major player in European, Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern Asian affairs simultaneously. Given these, it should be considered in a category separate from Japan who -in MILITARY terms is nothing more than a protectorate of the US- and Brazil which can only be considered a major REGIONAL power. There are major challenges lying ahead of Russia. Economy, demographics, territorial integrity and a demoralized army are just a few. However, so long as the country can have a strong and competent leadership,many of these challenges may be overcome, returning to Russia a status in international politics that it deserves. My suggestion is: DON'T REMOVE the article.</p>
<p>I suggest that you guys also consult these articles before reaching the final decision:</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> editor now claims that while he did write this information in his book, it is not a copyvio because he believes that the text falls under Canada's definition of "Fair Dealing."

<dd><b>Comment</b>. If the author of the article owns the copyright on the book, he is free to license any or all of it it under the GFDL. One cannot violate a copyright one owns. So assuming that <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMishkax28_4d22.html" title="User:Mishkax28">User:Mishkax28</a> is actually Michael McLoughlin, there is no copyright violation, and it's not even a case of fair dealing. Anyone can provide their own writing to Wikipedia as long as they agree to license it under the GFDL. However, this needs to be documented with the Wikimedia foundation. See: <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a> for instructions on how to do this. On the other hand, the detailed narrative on the assassination does not really belong here. The author could submit it to <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikisource</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 06:30, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and prune</b>. Not a copyvio if the author can show he is the copyright owner. The first part is fine and a bit of the speculation could be added to it. the detailed narrative should go. Also, this is not original research. The original research was done when the book was published. However, Wikipedia is not the place for "... a forum for those who wish further clarification of the Bachand murder...". <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 06:34, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../f/l/q/FLQ_45dc.html" title="FLQ">FLQ</a> and delete. Forget copyvio, this is a vanity effort by the principal editor to disseminate his work and as a result he has hijacked and mangled the article which is now ridiculously long and essentially unreadable (which at least obviates the attempted vanity in the first place, ha). I think the first part of it is good, and would be happy simply to see the rest excised, but one assumes this may spark an edit war. Hence, I suggest merge the content to the article on the FLQ and leave it at that. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 12:01, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> notable person. If copyvio is beleived, tag it as such, and let that process run its course (but it sounds like the contributor is the copyright owner). This AFD is only to decide if we want an article on this topic. Also, I point out, that GFDL,prevents us from deleting if a merge is done.

<p>What is the definition of non-notable? Ronald Dworkin, an extremely notable philosopher was involved and the journal gives a representation of what the LSE philosophy department is about, a department with past names like Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos and current ones such as Nancy Cartwright and John Worrall. The reason for no google hits is because the first edition is still at the printers. The journal will be distributed around the world and also published online. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Carlcullinane (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Carlcullinane_0ed5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Carlcullinane">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This isn't an "attack" of anything. It's simply saying that the journal doesn't even exist yet so how could it possibly be notable? Sounds like something that definitely could be notable in the future - apparently even in the near future. But it's not now.

<p>Blatant POV-pushing bordering on vandalism, a spillover from a long-standing past edit conflict over <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>. This Albanian nationalist POV-pusher tries to present the Albanian flag as a flag used by Arvanites, the Albanophone but hellenized minority group in Greece. This is a blatant falsehood; Arvanites don't use this flag.

<p>I've been to the Woodstock pub while I was in the US Navy, and while it is a wonderful place, it's not <b>notable</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have been living in Bangkok for over 7 years. Woodstock is definately a notable place in the Bangkok expatriate scene. It appears in books. A song has been made about the pub. It is famous amongst the expats for its hamburgers. Wikitravel is <b>not</b> a wikimedia project. We cannot transwiki things over there. It is also notable that as opposed to most bars who disappear after a year or two. It has stayed on for over 20 years and is still continuing now, which is very very rare in Bangkok. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 01:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The article fails to describe the language properly and I do not see any evidence of major use.

<li><b>Keep</b> OK, I am open to correction and have changed my opinion as a result of the following comments. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a> 21:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I added a link to a map and another detail. As far as I recall, the precedent is that any real geographic places are kept (from memory, American communities with populations of zero or one have been kept...). Anyway, Lodsworth's got a village hall, a pub <i>and</i> a church! <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 18:04, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Undecided</b> Like aeropagitica, I'm swayed by he discussion, but not entirely towards a "keep". As it stands, it's still functioning primarily as a plug for the pub, and I can't see any way out of that save adding more detail. But this is a more general issue, and I feel I'm too new to Wikipedia to cast a vote on how to handle such a situation, to which I'm sure there are precedents. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 22:35, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Arthur Herzog</b> an award winning author publishes with the same company. Are we in the business to attack book publishing companies here? --65.94.195.206 22:08, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No! Never attack. However, publishing with a reputable publishing house can be a criterion for notability; publishing houses such as Little, Brown; Random House; Penguin Putnam; etc., excercise editorial discretion, which approbation is taken as a surrogate marker of encyclopedic notability. As clearly shewn vis-a-vis their website, publication with iUniverse is a surrogate marker of no more than a pocket ready to part with its heavy ladings of gold. Other evidence of notability, then, must be put forth; the books <i>prima facie</i> are rubbish until reputably sourced otherwise. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 23:57, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>They would have to be denied if they didn't meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines.

An author selling smut out of the trunk of their car might conceivably manage to sell a not-entirely-unrespectable number of copies of their book, but how could Wikipedia <i>verify</i> their sales or their importance?

When this material was listed on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America_fc82.html" title="Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America">Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America</a>, it was blasted from all sides as being "inappropriate" for the text of that article. Therefore, the material was moved to its own article. Reading the nomination, the user states that the material does not "deserve to be on Wikipedia". This is against everything Wikipedia stands for. The nomination, itself, appears to be over content dispute and lack of references, both of which are highly invalid reasons to delete an article. As far as the size of the article, there is no stipulation that articles have to start big. Plenty of articles start as stubs with little or no information. POV is also not an issue...since the article states several occurences and doesn't give private opinions like "the Boy Scouts encourages violence". Last but not least, this article should be given a chance instead of atatcked and voted for deletion by those who don't like what it has to say. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 16:48, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't say it didn't deserve to be on Wiki, but rather that it didn't warrant its own article. Your assumptions about my motivations are SORELY WRONG, but discussing it with you would likely be pointless. Your scope on this article is too focused and narrow (one main incident and an allusion to the HJ and German Scouts)...<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 16:59, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>My allusion to that opinion was the statement: "It does not deserve its own article" As far as the article being narrow with two incidents, those are the only one's I know about. As stated on the article talk page, I did not intend to write a lengthy article off the bat, but rather start one and let others contribute. My entire annoyance with this nomination, was that the article was not even given a <i>chance</i>, but nominated for deletion less than 24 hours after creation. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 17:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Forks from main article that don't have enough material to be other than a stub are highly frowned upon. There is far more violence in the military and yet is there an article on that? Also, how are ghost stories violence? THis is what prompted my proposal for a name change, but I haven't thought of a good one yet. You do really need references for all this. You may want to save the text, work it offline, come up with a better title, reference it, and then start an article in this area. It that is doable, but I don't see this one going far. If you want to go that route, I'll even help you.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 17:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It looks like that the mass of people will win here, and this promising article will get deleted. In any event, to answer those three points above, the article verifibility is already being discussed on the talk page. A police report or other offical document would be all that would be needed. Original research is very questionable, since at least two users have claimed knowledge of one of the events in the article and, again, talk page discussions have been made ot get offical sources. POV Fork is the most questionable of all, since the definition is an article created about the same subject as another due to content dispute. There is no other article about violence in the Boy Scouts and the material was removed over and over again from controversies about the Boy Scout with users claiming it didn't belong there. Deleted the article may be, but deleted it should not. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 18:08, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

Nobody's saying that this is undoubtedly false or doesn't belong in Wikipedia's articles about the Boy Scouts of America. With controversial topics, though, things must be sourced. Information on Wikipedia, no matter how controversial, is kept — given that it is notable and verifiable. It is up to the writer of the information to provide legitimate sources. "Two users have claimed knowledge of one of the events in the article." That is not a verifable, legitimate source for our purposes here. If you can provide a police report, that's great; a police report will certainly back up the fact that it happened and no one will have any right to delete it. However, you must find more sources to verify that events like these are what led to Youth Protection, back up the quotes from adult leaders, prove the explusions, and the like. We can't have Wikipedia editors drawing their own conclusions from the facts or personal research and experience, however ugly it may be. If the material was deleted in the past, it is likely that it was written without any way to back it up. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 18:38, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

I firmly believe in maintaining third parties in America and, while this one is clearly small, I see no reason to attempt to eliminate what may be its greatest current chance to grow into a greater aspect of the American democratic system; that is, existence in a recognized source of nonpartisan information. At the very least, the search should be continued for the party's website, if it exists. Even if there isn't one, I don't see that as a reason to remove it.

<li>"Fancruft", "gamecruft", or other "cruft" is a poor reason for deleting something, when it actually does have notability to a rather large amount of people. Now ask yourselves, do people find this article useful and informational? I'd say so. Is this article hurting the legitimacy of Wikipedia as a factual source of information? Absolutely not! It's well written, doesn't go overboard in the so-called "cruftiness" in any way. This is for all you deletionists out there: Please consider looking into the notability of a subject, looking into its value as an article, rather than simply pasting "<i>*<b>Delete</b> per nom. -- ~~~~</i>" into its AfD. — <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 15:16, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> You can clearly see that there is a lot of information about the subject. Its a notable island within <i>RuneScape</i>, and is a useful article. The Warcraft Portal has articles as specific as Bind on Equip with about 3 lines if info. I dont see that up for deletion. This is one of maybe 3 or 4 location articles that do/will exist within the RS Portal. Not every location will have its own page. The only reason this one does is because it is notable, has plenty of information, and is useful. It is also, as mentioned above, well written, structured and wikified. May I also remind you that this is a discussion, not a vote, so putting "Delete per nom" probably wont be counted when it comes to closing the article. Otherwise, we could just make a list of "Keep"s and "Delete"s. - <b><font color="orange">• The Giant Puffin •</font></b> 16:44, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It does not belong in a game guide. You cant give a guide about a location. Plus there are several video game-related pages that are more like game guides, and they are not up for deletion. <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> is also being broken up into sub-pages because of its long length (hence the clean up notice on the page) - <b><font color="orange">• The Giant Puffin •</font></b> 12:19, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Check out his IMDB page, which you said didn't exist. Compare the films with our article. Compare the nickname. However, you haven't explained why you felt entitled to call Butch Bautista a "minor actor" when you can't even verify he exists. The Filipino film industry is tricky and requires research before making these types of noms. We should be talking about how to improve our coverage of film industries and production in non-English speaking countries, not how to destroy it. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:36, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. And a <b>comment</b> regarding notability: the publisher's blurb on the author (William R.

I then came to Wikipedia to read about <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrodollar.html" title="Petrodollar">petrodollars</a> and Iraq's move to Euros in 2000. Then I ran into this article. The theory can be found in many journal articles as can be seen in the "External Links" section.

<dd>SCloat You seem to be unaware of wikipedia guidelines. Peer-review has NOTHING to do with whether the article should be kept. The wikipedia guideline for notability even mentions conpiracy theories and having only 1-2 proponents of the idea as valid. As long as journalist and bloggers, etc. picks up the idea it is noteworthy. Go read the guidelines and change your vote. Stop mentioning peerreviewing as it is irrelevant, to reseach if the idea has any real merit is to do original research. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngwar_628f.html" title="User:Engwar">A human</a> 15:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No; original research occurs when you use wikipedia to showcase theories that are otherwise not notable. Quoting Ron Paul and claiming that the quote has something to do with "petrodollar warfare" is original research. That is what is happening here. I don't mind this idea being mentioned in an article about ludicrous conspiracy theories believed by only one person or something, but there is no way this "theory" deserves its own page. Peer review, as well as mention in newspapers or other print media, is a much better way to measure notability than google hits. Again, if this theory has another name that is more easily found in such sources, let's hear about it. The fact that those defending the theory can't suggest such a name indicates that it probably doesn't have one. I agree with the MLA comment below that <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_imperialism_theories.html" title="Oil imperialism theories">Oil imperialism theories</a> would be a good place to mention this if it must be mentioned.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 18:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>R.Paul talks about <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dollar_hegemony.html" title="Dollar hegemony">Dollar hegemony</a> and how that leads and already has lead or been part of a rationale for warfare. Now he may not have called it <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrodollar_warfare.html" title="Petrodollar warfare">Petrodollar warfare</a> but that is the same as this Clack is saying. They both argue that oil producers switching to selling in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroeuro.html" title="Petroeuro">Petroeuro</a> will hurt USD and therefore US might force them to return to USD. Clark just 'invented' a word to go with it. That how I see it. Listening to Rons speech it become obvious they are saying the same thing. It is not a scientific theory, in fact it implies that the US government is lying about rationales for wars, by definition it is a conspiracy theory. So why all that fuss about peer-reviews? It is a fringe theory, but wikipedia says that <b>"The following are not original research: 6. The ideas have become newsworthy: they have been repeatedly and independently reported in newspapers or news stories"</b> and google hits and the various external links confirms that. Wikipedias <a href="../../../f/r/i/Wikipedia%7EFringe_theories_37ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Fringe theories">guideline for fringe theories</a> states: <b>"Any non-mainstream theories should be referenced in at least one major mainstream publication or by another mainstream group or individual."</b>, and if a rep. congressman from texas is not a mainstream individual, what is? Is this a discussion about the term or the content, I do not care about the term, but the theory does deserve its own article. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngwar_628f.html" title="User:Engwar">A human</a> 01:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't see "petrodollar warfare" on a single one of those pages you linked. You are referring to a number of different ideas and theories here and none of them refer back to the William R. Clark theory this page is about (save the link to Clark himself that you included). The conflation of these various ideas constitutes a bizarre form of original research -- come on; Zbigniew Brzezinski and Michael Klare support the same theory? That's ludicrous. We already have pages on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrodollar.html" title="Petrodollar">petrodollar</a> and <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_imperialism_theories.html" title="Oil imperialism theories">oil imperialism theories</a> where Clark's nonsense can go, but to conflate the conspiracy theories with the legitimate theories of everyone who has ever mentioned the role of resources in warfare is not an encyclopedia's job.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:05, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more thing. This is a term that is spreading very quickly at the moment because of all the press its getting. Especially if Iran is attacked as predicted, Petrodollar warfare will be as common as "neoconservative." So at most, the deletionists will succeed for a few months and then the term will become common enough that all the arguments against it will be no longer debatable. You can't make it fall out of favor like the term <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_IV_b2af.html" title="World War IV">World War IV</a> just by avoiding a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarltonh_e6a2.html" title="User:Carltonh">Carltonh</a> 23:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>LOL... Thanks, but if I need psychoanalysis I'll consult a professional. If you think Brzezinski and Klare and Chomsky and Ron Paul and William Clark (whoever the latter is) are all articulating the same theory, please point to some specific claims. Everyone who talks about "resource wars" (Klare's term) is not saying the same thing. But that's neither here nor there; my point is, we already have <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_imperialism_theories.html" title="Oil imperialism theories">oil imperialism theories</a> (poorly titled, but better than "petrodollar warfare") for this kind of stuff, and we don't need a name that makes it sound like a science fiction movie. It would be interesting to email any of these people (besides Clark) and ask them how they felt about being named as a proponent of a theory of "petrodollar warfare." As I said when I suggested deleting this page to begin with, I think this is a vanity site showcasing an otherwise unknown scholar's work.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 11:14, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>*<i>Colin Nuan</i>: "The first country to actually make the switch was a very important oil exporter indeed: Iraq, in November 2000. Before the war in Iraq began, some observers, myself included, argued that this might well be a major reason for the US desire to invade and the strong Franco-German opposition to the invasion. Corroborating evidence included the apparent influence which loyalty (or lack thereof) to the dollar seemed to have on the US attitude towards other OPEC members.

<dd>(1) Perhaps it is does really only reference one book, but many books have their own page on Wikipedia - since it is a collaborative article and not written BY the author, it cannot be considered a "vanity page". An argument could be made, however, for the article to specifically be renamed to refer to the book in question.</dd>

Though, I don't want to meddle into this discussion too much, I wish to add that there is some academic research about the connection of Iraq's petroeuro choice in 2000 and the war in Iraq since 2003. See: R. LOONEY, “Petroeuros: A Threat to U.S. Interests in the Gulf?” in <i>Middle East Policy</i>, 11, (2004), 1, pp. 26-37.

<li><b>Keep</b>. An important entry. It could do with a rewrite and expansion, but well researched. It may be a fringe analysis (ie. one not commonly understood), but don't see any reason why it should be considered a 'conspiracy theory'. There is no conspiracy alleged. It takes the perspective of the US as an empire, but in the last couple of years that has become the accepted terminology by both US leaders and their critics. The referenced articles are good -- they include articles pro- and con- the core theory. However, I think the <b>M3 data reporting discontinued</b> section should be removed, as it is not sufficiently central to the argument. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamfenderson_b167.html" title="User:Adamfenderson">Adamfenderson</a> 02:55, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dfleck: yes I probably stretched a point there - but several US conservative opinion leaders have begun embracing the term in this time, which seems like a pretty significant intellectual turn, given that it has been such a negatively loaded concept and one vehemently denied by many: eg. <a href="http://www.hooverdigest.org/034/johnson.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hooverdigest.org/034/johnson.html" rel="nofollow">"America's New Empire for Liberty"</a>, article from conservative writer and historian <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Johnson_%28journalist%29_db19.html" title="Paul Johnson (journalist)">Paul Johnson</a>, in which he argues that the U.S. has always been an empire—and a good one at that. See also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Empire#The_benevolent_empire" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Empire#The_benevolent_empire" rel="nofollow">"Benevolent Empire secion of the American Empire wikepedia entry"</a>, the most significant name there being Zbigniew Brzezinski.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Either way it's a matter of semantics. The US is big and powerful, dominates the world economy, has military bases all around the world and uses financial and military pressures to apply political influence. I don't think anyone credible would deny this, they'd just characterise it differently, and whether you're for or against it, you can choose to call it an empire or not. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamfenderson_b167.html" title="User:Adamfenderson">Adamfenderson</a> 02:02, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous. First, I don't know why a good faith nomination received so many "speedy keep" votes early on. Alright, there is not any majority, let alone a consensus for deletion. I have reviewed this article and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Iran_9eef.html" title="Greater Iran">Greater Iran</a> and have observed that this article is more about the current situation while the Greater Iran article is more historical. Yet all the references/links in the article relate to history, not to the current situation. I am closing this as a tentative <b>keep</b>, and recommend that someone more knowledgable than me look into this and decide whether or not to merge it. I defer that discussion to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreater_Iran_2c0b.html" title="Talk:Greater Iran">Talk:Greater Iran</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:39, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I, as an established critic of Literature, verify that Melchior is in fact, a figurehead of our literary generation. Did Shakespeare need publishers to get recognition?

<li><b>Do not delete</b> The very fact that this page was put up for deletion so soon after appearing on Wikipedia, demonstrates very clearly to me that someone has got something personal against Mr. Melchior, and is not using their power of deletion in the interest of people who simply wish to broaden their education. This artical is not hurting anyone, so why is it so important that it is removed? Clearly, gentlemen, there are ulterior motives here... Saxgod 18:30, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> I refer you to section 2 of "what about vanity?" - Wikipedia deletion policy guidlines: "An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity." BRM is famous, although not on the same level as a football player or "Britney Spears". Does that make him less worthy of our recognition? ROD 15:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Mostly concur with Tgies, a notable enough term for a dictionary but not quite warranting an encyclopedia entry, especially not one of this lack of quality. While a somewhat-known social phenomenon on the Internet, I just don't think it's enough to warrant an article at this point in time. Also reeks of original research in, quite obviously, the form of personal experiences on the Internet, and doesn't seem to be highly verifiable, although it is probably largely accurate for the most part. <a href="../../../g/-/f/User%7EG-Flex_a109.html" title="User:G-Flex">G-Flex</a> 23:21, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The existence of the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_intimacy.html" title="Physical intimacy">Physical intimacy</a> article already "covers" the entire area this article is in.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Given the importance of these designers in fashion history- to the point that the Times wrote last year in a feature on Stewart that the "<i>Bodymap label had a defining influence on the aesthetic of the 1980s</i>"- and the fact that their designs are featured on the V&amp;A site, the articles look like obvious keepers to me. At the very least, I would have expected some intelligently argued reasons for deletion, something beyond NN or "needs to be deleted", something that demonstrates that the participants here have a basis for their "votes" beyond the knee jerk thrill of removing material from the site. Of course, the articles also would appear to have been copied from the V&amp;A site and thus should be tagged as copyvios. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well I missed your comment on the article, but I would point out that BLP is barely applicable to the discussion and NN is an essay that has no meaning at all. They are both patently insufficient for participation here. If "notability" is what interests you, you should see the start of the 8-line Bodymap article where it says <i>one of the brightest design teams to emerge in the 1980's</i>. As for why I do not "expand the articles and ask people to reconsider", besides the fact that I tend to doubt that anyone gave any serious consideration the first time around, see above where I mention that the articles are copyvios from the V&amp;A site. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:51, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> because this seems to be Vanity and a non-notable biography. There are no references to other Wikipedia pages from the article, only to external sites.
