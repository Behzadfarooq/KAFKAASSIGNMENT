<li>I'm sure that this portion of the crystal ball policy will be cited by all individuals presenting a 'keep' vote. However, the fact is that this article has almost no content in it, and thus, "only generic information is known" about this "individual item from a predetermined list." Existing referenced and supported information about season three is adequately being cited in <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i>, and once more specific, non-speculative information is known about the specific episodes of season three — which, given that the next season doesn't premiere until October, could be a number of months from now — the article can be recreated. To paraphase the policy I reference in my cite: "'Lists of episodes of 'Lost' is encyclopedic; 'Episodes of Lost (season 3)' is not, even though it is virtually certain that a third season of 'Lost' will occur in ABC and will have episodes." —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;•&#160; 16:08, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>While the article currently has little info in it, who's to dictate that it isn't a candidate for improvement when the information arrives? A huge percentage of articles start out as a stub, of which you could classifiy the list as a stub. Thus if anything this should be kept and allowed time to improve. Don't forget, although Season 3 doesn't start until October, information will probibally become avalable in the next few months as of to the nature of the first episode, and there might be pre-Season 3 episodes like there was for Season 2. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 21:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. An event about which little or no information is currently known should not be included, even if it's "notable and almost certain to take place." Should we have an article on the death of each and every current living celebrity? Without some amazing advanced in medicine, they're all almost certain to take place, and will be seen as notable by plenty of people. The fact that we know nothing about when and how all of these people will die makes such articles unencyclopedic regardless of notability.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a> 16:13, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Jtrost. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">"Not a crystal ball"</a> prohibition notes, "<i>All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred."</i> The third season of <i>Lost</i> is a verifiable and confirmed event, and is certainly of interest to have an article. Deletion would be a pointless venture in time-wasting. As stated at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, <i>"Before nominating a recently-created article, please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape."</i>--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:49, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notice that the example used in support of deletion is 'Tropical Storm Alex (2010)', I find this to be a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguement. There is only a weak analogy between a Tropical Storm in 2010 and a season of <i>Lost</i> that is (1) a few months away and (2) which information may become public before then (e.g. a list of episode names). Lastly, I visited the 3rd season episode list to find out what character backgrounds would be explored in the 3rd season, and so seeing that there is little info about the episodes has been informative to my purposes. Lastly, and here is my analogy, many movies have entries long before their release and sometimes before they begin production (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_11_2164.html" title="Star Trek 11">Star Trek 11</a>).

<li>It's not season three <i>itself</i> that's in question, it's the episodes within it. All we know about season three is that there will be one — just like all we know is that there will be a Tropical Storm in 2010. Once we know verifiable info about it, fine, recreate it. But until then, it's all just speculation and crystal ball. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 23:23, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see anything that's speculation or crystal ball at all. It's been confirmed that the first episode will air on October 4th. We could even create an entry for this episode if we wanted, but since we don't know anything about it, it would just look messy. We also know that the episodes will air in two blocks, a six episode block and a seventeen episode block, according to the official podcast. Also according to the official podcast, there will be a "mini-cliffhanger" at the end of the six episode block. This is all verifiable information with citable sources. None of it is speculation, and it all concerns the episodes within Season 3. --<a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlfin_e857.html" title="User:Kahlfin">Kahlfin</a> 03:43, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think it is unfair of you to keep repeating that this article is all "speculation" when the author of the article has repeatedly defended the information of the entry. You may complain that it is not enough info to justify an article on a future event, but just because something is in the future does not make all information about it speculation. Secondly, an editor with their own interests and time ought to concentrate on whatever they want. If the article violates wikipedia policy (which it argueably does) then it ought to be deleted, but if you think it is just a person's waste of time then that is no arguement against it. People edit wikipedia not for money, but because of a passion they hold for some specific set of topics; to belittle what topic a person decides to edit is to lose sight of how wikipedia itself functions. All that being said, your last point of the info being useless until October is a valid objection to make but ultimately one I think is incorrect (as I argue in my vote to keep, above).
