His attempt to "merge" material into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_induction.html" title="Mathematical induction">mathematical induction</a> amounted to (1) paraphrasing a fragment of this article in a way that made clear that he understood none of it and didn't care to; and (2) putting it into a randomly chosen place in that article. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I would say that the focus of the article is to present a trichotomy of techniques, and give examples to illustrate the distinctions among them. However, I am not convinced that either the trichotomy, at least as it is presented here, really exists, and I do not think that the examples illustrate anything substantial. Furthermore, as it's been noted, the factual material that's contained here is present in the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_induction.html" title="Mathematical induction">mathematical induction</a> article, so that the sole original content of the article becomes the uninformative examples. Let me elaborate: <small>sent to talk page by <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a></small> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 04:19, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Restructure</b> - the point is actually about a common difficulty in using induction (2). So it could be rewritten into an article about Polya's example (which is quite famous), introducing the stuff on 2nd form to explain the apparent paradox. The discussion of 1 and 3 could be probably merged into the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_induction.html" title="Mathematical induction">Mathematical induction</a> article. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamSmithee_ba88.html" title="User:AdamSmithee">AdamSmithee</a> 08:10, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><s><b>merge</b></s>. Form 2 can be easily be rendered as form 1, by a simple renumbering. Define two sequences of cases: let <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub></span> the original cases and let <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>B</i></sub>(<i>n</i>) = <i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>(<i>n</i> + 1)</span>, be a renumbered sequence. So the form 2 induction for <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub></span> just becomes a form 1 induction for <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span>, with an extra vaciously true case <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>B</i></sub>(0)</span>. In general induction arguments don't have to start at 1, if you can prove all cases up to <i>m</i> by other means and then prove &gt;<i>m</i> using induction then its just as good an argument. Its a shame we've had to go here, instead of reverting the merge notice, which imediatly led to and afd in retaliation, a discussion on the merge would have been more civil.--<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 13:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>rename</b> I now think that this article is missnamed. The key points seem to be more about inductive or recirsive arguments relating to (binary) operations.

My suggestion would be to find a good name for the 2nd form, and keep that as a separate article, merging all the rest into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_induction.html" title="Mathematical induction">Mathematical induction</a>. Specifically -- forms 1 and 2 are the same <b>type</b> of induction, with the difficulties in different steps, while form 3 is <b>different</b>. They should not all be in the same article without including a number of of still different forms. Furthermore, the triangle inquality miscounts "n". The step that is impossible is <b>2</b> to <b>3</b>, rather than <b>1</b> to <b>2</b>, as the trivial equation is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/d/f/3df2f19afe7d76f01d16116dbb73fd81.png" alt="d \left( x_1,x_1 \right) \leq 0" />. (In other words, I agree with <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamSmithee_ba88.html" title="User:AdamSmithee">AdamSmithee</a>, but feel, in addition, that the selection of items in the article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.) â€” <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:03, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, possibly <b>merge</b> existing text into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_induction.html" title="Mathematical induction">mathematical induction</a> (if it is placed after the explanation of mathematical induction, the necessary level of marthematical competence may be assumed). But this is a question of ordinary editing. No claim made here justifies deletion. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:18, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Polya's example and perhaps the product rule example into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_induction.html" title="Mathematical induction">mathematical induction</a> or some article on logical <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacy.html" title="Fallacy">fallacy</a> or erroneous <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof.html" title="Proof">proof</a>. Delete the rest, as it is redundant or too detailed (maybe put into a Wikibook on proof techniques?). This article is too basic to appeal to readers who fully understand induction already. I also agree about the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem; I have never seen this classification before, there are no sources, and there is no reason given to single out these three forms of induction from others possible. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuardavis_82ee.html" title="User:Joshuardavis">Joshuardavis</a> 17:48, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The essence of Polya's example is <b>not erroneous proof</b>; the essense is the <b>form</b> of the argument. What is erroneous is there only because Polya wanted to divorce the form from specific cases, and also to set an exercise for students. But Polya's example illustrates the form perfectly. Those who think it's erroneous to say all horses are of the same color are being too literal-minded; sometimes all horses are of the same color. Don't construe that literally. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 21:23, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Partial merge, userfy and potentially move to wikibooks</b>. Article presents an interesting and to me somewhat new perspective on mathematical induction (bear in mind, I have not been an active mathematician for 5 years). This perspective should be integrated into the article on the topic at hand, namely mathematical induction, to the extent appropriate. This will of course involve discussion and debate with the denizens of that article. Beyond this, could become part of a mathematical wikibook of some sort; pending that, should be userfied. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 04:23, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Would be interesting to hear the perspective of active participants in Wikiproject Mathematics, not as much on content or to give them any sort of veto power, but to understand what has worked in the past regarding interesting perspectives on one aspect of an encyclopedic mathematical topic. Heck, I have all sorts of material from old lectures I gave where I presented something mathematical from a slightly iconoclastic angle, but which is not new research. What is the right approach to judge what belongs on Wikipedia? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 04:23, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikibooks. Wikipedia is not a how-to, and articles need to be comprehensible to people outside a narrow field of competence. Not making any assesment about the article here. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 09:48, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This has certainly never been a how-to article in any of its versions. And I think it is comprehensible to all mathematicians, not just to those in any narrow field of competence. Should all Wikipedia articles that are incomprehensible to non-mathematicians get deleted? What is that -- maybe 10% of all Wikipedia articles, and 90% of the ones on mathematics? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 22:31, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> The point of this article is completely lost to me, if it even has a point. I don't see anything significant in the distinctions made. If Polya's example is famous it should be merged to the main induction article. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 13:25, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>delete</b> (or maybe <b>merge</b>) Perhaps something in this article belong in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complete_induction.html" title="Complete induction">Complete induction</a>, but other than that it seems to be a bunch of howto and examples, and gets hung up on the point of whether the base case of an induction is vacuous (which might deserve one sentence in the induction article). <a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdore_ac92.html" title="User:Rdore">Rdore</a> 00:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How in the world does anyone manage to see this as a "how to"?? It skips details precisely because it is NOT a how-to. There is NO mention of whether the base case is vacuous in the examples, but rather only in the case of complete induction, where it explains why the base case is always vacuous. In all three examples, the base case is asserted to be the substantial part--as far from vacuous as you can get. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 03:17, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
