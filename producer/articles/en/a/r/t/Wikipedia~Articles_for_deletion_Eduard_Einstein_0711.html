<dd><b>Comment</b>: I didn't say to delete because it's short, I said to delete because he's not noteworthy. He's just a guy who had schizophrenia that happened to be Einstein's son. Being the relative of someone noteworthy isn't noteworthy itself. We don't have articles for Einstein's siblings or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adams_7525.html" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>' father, etc., etc. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:21, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response to Comment</b>: You say he is not noteworthy; that is your point of view. Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral point of view. His parentage, medical conditions, etc. are documented fact, of interest to many (but not, apparently, to everyone).

<dd>Wow, I would certainly vote to delete that if it came up on Afd.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Your wish is my <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tinkerbell_%28dog%29_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tinkerbell (dog)">command</a>. It is relevant - we are arguing degree of notability. As noted elsewhere in this page, Eduard Einstein is notable enough to merit coverage on several web pages, and to be the subject of a book. I submit that if this makes him more notable than a subject that is currently accepted on Wikipedia, the article should stand. Since his life, medical condition and actions no doubt had a significant impact on one of the greatest scientists of all time, I think he is notable, certainly more so than some socialite's dog. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 17:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's too late to try to keep this brief but Anon, you're making my case for me. The schizophrenia.com website says "Albert Einstein's son - Eduard Einstein" and the other one is a site devoted to Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein is famous, his son isn't. Other examples in the former web site are Dr. James Watson's son - who apparently didn't even have a name and has <i>no</i> mention on Wikipedia, let alone his own article - and Alan Alda's Mother who has a one-line article that I'll be Afd'ing next. Mrs. Alda was at least a beauty pageant winner and a model. You're saying that the Einstein article can be fleshed out - but it can't. There's nothing left to say. Because he wasn't noteworthy. He has a few lines in articles for Albert Einstein and Eduard's mother and that's all that's necessary. Oh, and Paris Hilton is a kazillionaire and an actress. That's noteworthiness. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The burden of proof rests with the article creator and editors to demonstrate notability. There's no move to lock this page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I haven't heard one example of his name being notable outside of being the son of Albert Einstein. Has anyone read this book? I don't see what else you would write about him. He started showing signs of schizophrenia in 1930 - the year he turned 20. I can't imagine he accomplished much before age 20 and, from the little I know about schizophrenia, people rarely do much after the onset of schizophrenia either. I know - John Nash from the movie A Beautiful Mind - but his most noteworthy accomplishments were still before the onset of the illness, weren't they? Regardless, show me one example of John Nash-type notoriety in Eduard Einstein - besides his being Albert's son - and I'd agree with you. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
