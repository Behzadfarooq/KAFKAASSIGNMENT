<dd><b>Comment</b> Hadn't realised there's a history to this one! I've used the site in the article before and found it OK, also did a fairly cursory Google and found it on <a href="http://www.tutiempo.net/Tierra/Nigeria/Gnaa-NI015326.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tutiempo.net/Tierra/Nigeria/Gnaa-NI015326.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd><b>Weak keep</b> The tutiempo site doesn't count as independent confirmation - it just mirrors fallingrain in some way as far as I can see. Still NGA does have it also so, while that's not infallible, the balance of probablility is that the place does exist (in some fashion). <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></dd>

<li><b>Cheerfully speedy delete</b> <s><b>Weary, very weak keep</b> with a strong desire to revisit in 2 months -- and then drive a stake through its heart. If you look at the last AfD, nobody fought harder to get this non-notable hoax deleted. I'm just not comfortable re-AfD'ing right away. Somehow it seems like maybe it's against the rules. Talk me out of this notion and I'll be at the head of the "speedy delete" line. In the meantime, feel free to look at all the links I produced on the last AfD.</s> See the links I've added later in this RfA. Whatever the concerns about fallingrain.com, the NGA link convinced me that there really is a clearing or rock in Nigeria with that name. But then again, see what else I dug up about NGA names -- they list every possible name there's ever been including mountains, 829 undersea features and 8 different "places" in the Vatican. I may be in Makurdi in 2-3 weeks; I wish I had time to drive by those coordinates and take a picture of the squash field or whatever's there -- it won't be a town!

<dd><b>Comment/Response</b> I realize that this has been up twice before and only very recently reached no consensus. I was not aware of the article until just recently. And no, I wasn't brought in by someone wishing for it to be deleted. I hate that sometimes the most aggressive side in an argument wins based on tenacity rather than true consensus. I hate seeing AfD abused this way as much as I hate seeing wheel warring. That said, the first AfD resulted in keep because there were places online that mentioned it. The validity of those sources wasn't really brought into question. I read a bunch of stuff on teh interwebs, but I'm not sure where they got their data from. In the second AfD, only one keep was added after the verifiability of the online sources was questioned. The validity was questioned at the end of the discussion. This second discussion seems to have been focussed on a content dispute over whether the GNAA should be mentioned in the article and whether the town was notable apart from that. Obviously a real town in Nigeria is just as notable as the gazillions of U.S. census data articles. This resulted in no consensus. Given that something new was raised at the end and didn't seem to have been addressed, I thought that it was worth talking about. I looked at Google Earth well before this nomination occurred and saw that indeed that area of Nigeria is used for agriculture. There are fields and forest there, but I don't see anything that would have a population of 6000+. Given how close by all the "towns" listed on the nona site are, the population density would have to be pretty high to get that many people before crossing the municipality boundary. Index Mundi&#160;!= Google Earth. It is a data overlay over satellite images. If you had actually searched using Google Earth, as you incivilly implied I hadn't, you would find that it points to the <i><b>Free Software Foundation</b></i> in Boston. You can use Google Maps to search for <i>Gnaa, Nigeria</i> and return <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Gnaa%2C%20Nigeria" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Gnaa%2C%20Nigeria" rel="nofollow">the same result</a>. I don't feel this is disruptive any more than deletion review is. I have no intention of nomming this again. The only thing that seems obvious to me about this whole episode is that the GNAA is having fun with it, people are upset that we might be furthering systemic bias, and we really don't seem to have a good way of determining what's actually out there other than personal interpretation of low resolution satellite images from Google. My last comment goes back to Nicodemus75's assumptions. Neither the nominator nor I, the first commenter, were involved in either of the first two AfDs. Please don't imply that we are repeatedly abusing process to get our way. —<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 17:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's likely that all these sites are working from a common source - which might be wrong. Still, as I said above the balance of probablility is that the place does exist. Certainly, one shouldn't delete because of a <i>possible</i> database error. There is also the notability question - but wiki has a strong tradition that settlements are intriniscally notable and NGA lists it as a populated place. Again NGA might be wrong but one shouldn't delete because of a <i>possible</i> database error. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 02:56, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Comment: It's <i>not</i> "obviously a real place". It's a place for the existence of which we have no non-Internet evidence. What's needed is a <i>real</i> reference, something printed on a dead tree, in a nice binding, not a website.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm sorry that people are offended by the GNAA's misuse of this placename, but Fallingrain's mention is a sufficiently reliable source for me; I've often used Falling Rain Genomic's webpage to research &amp; confirm information about Ethiopian villages &amp; cities, &amp; I believe that we can trust it as a reliable source. If we are to start deleting placenames in Africa because they are "non-notable", shall we also be fair &amp; start deleting placenames in the US &amp; Europe for the same reason? If you haven't figured it out, the trolls <i>want</i> us to delete this article for their amusement.

<dd>(Responding to A.B.'s research)
<ol>
<li>A shocking number of African towns (or large villages, if you will) lack road connections. Or what we outside Africa would call a road.</li>
<li>Maps of African countries are often incorrect. (As an example, one I am using at the moment not only omits a number of villages or towns that the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Statistical_Agency_%28Ethiopia%29_d618.html" title="Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)">Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)</a> mentions, but amazingly divides the <a href="../../../o/m/o/Omo_River_802c.html" title="Omo River">Omo River</a> into 2 different rivers.)</li>
<li>Having worked with the NGA database for Ethiopia, I'll freely concede that it has some interesting problems. However, no one has looked in the Nigeria database to determine what the story might be. The NGA records not only list placenames &amp; their longitude &amp; latitudes, but also flag it with such information as the type of place it is (e.g. habitation, locality, building, waterhole) &amp; if it is known by another name. "Gnaa" may simply be an explorer's error for some other placename. (<i>Note</i>: My excuse for not performing this investigation myself because I've been spending the weekend doing some house remodelling in 100-degree heat.)</li>

<dd>I have no horse in this race; with the right kind of arguments, I would be quite willing to change my vote above. My goal is to put only reliable information in Wikipedia. However, in all three deletion nominations, the same arguments &amp; evidence have been repeated. If you want me to persuade me to change my vote, I need to see the following kinds of proof:
<ul>
<li>Has anyone checked the Nigerian government records? Almost every country has a website: even poverty-stricken Ethiopia has an abstract of its statistical information online. I would imagine that the Nigerian census agency has a website, &amp; the necessary information to provide a decisive answer might lie there.</li>
<li>Has anyone taken the time to research this matter <i>in a reference library?</i> One of those with lots of printed things called books &amp; periodicals? Excuse my tone, but this reliance on the Internet for facts about Africa is about as useful as relying on the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica for facts about astronomy or physics. My local city library even has a reference line, so you could call &amp; get your answer without even leaving home. (And note: travellers have written books in English about Nigeria for over a century, some of which have been published in Nigeria. I'm curious to know whether any such works that <i>should</i> mention Gnaa do so.)</li>
<li>And let me repeat, how about a closer look at the NGA entry. For all we know, the answer may lie in that source. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 04:03, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I would love to explain it for you. If you look at that site, you will see that they use Mapquest to generate "matching addresses." Mapquest is not always accurate. Neither is Google Maps which labels a house two blocks away with my address. As for the date, that is the satellite image date. It is not a picture of that town; it is a picture of the region that town is supposedly in. The poster-size imagery is of the region. You will note, if you use Google Earth, that the image is at very low zoom. You could also compare visible roads to the nona map and see that there are around a dozen "towns" supposedly in the original image that comes up. So that's the explanation. It is, just like image mundi, just a data overlay of someone else's location on someone else's image.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 17:59, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Yes, I think there's pretty clear agreement that a town in Nigeria with a population of 6000 would be notable, if it existed, and that the troll club's use of the name is irrelevant to any article that might be written about that town. But the fact is that we cannot verify that the town does, indeed, exist. Since we can't verify it, the article ought to be deleted. If someone eventually finds some solid verification, another article could be written with actual, valid, facts. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 22:03, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nicodemus is right about the etiquette when I read it. Technically, my comment isn't in a box but it sure <i>is</i> a tally, so I struck it through. I think a reason for the rule is that unlike RfAs, this is not a vote -- we're just giving recommendations to the one admin who will actually make the real decision.
