<p>None of these terms are actually neologisms or even protologisms. As far as I know, Family Guy has not spawned any actual neologisms. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, and specifically, it's not a collection of quotes, which is what this is (or, even worse, non-quotes that attempt to recreate humor and fail.) Only one item is sourced, and its source doesn't assign any importance to the term, nor does it establish that the term is used in the general population, but rather is used by the Family Guy writers. In fact, the only term in the list that's even used in more than one episode is "giggity", but reducing a list to a single item is stupid, and in any case that's not a neologism. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_neologisms_on_Family_Guy_b0c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of neologisms on Family Guy">1st nom</a>. <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>If by englightening you mean, full of unverified stuff that makes us remember funny Family Guy episodes.

<li><b>Keep</b> "Clemen," "dipsoluscious," "fastizio," "gatilsday," "giggity," "hic-a-doo-la," perhaps "sideboob," certainly "slappywag" and "tumorsyphilisitisosis" are all <i>Family Guy</i> neologisms, deserving of listing just as much as <i>Simpsons</i> neologisms. Even if it turns out that none of these were coined by <i>Family Guy</i> writers, <i>Family Guy</i> remains an important means of transmission and take-up for these terms and the show gets credit for them. Each item is sourced to the episode in which it appears, and prior to this second nomination, the article has had three other sources (not just "one" as the nom claims). The second source, alphabetically, [Delarte, 2005], which is mainly concerned with nitpicking <i>Family Guy</i> continuity, apparently finds "hic-a-doo-la" important enough to list as a "dictionary" entry (misspelled on page 29 with an extra H at the end, a correction was issued in August 2006!). [Callaghan, 2005] does indeed establish that "slappywag" is used by staff writers, not the general population. But if we limit ourselves to the main target demographic through the filter of myspace.com, Google searching gets the following number of results:</li>
</ul>
<p>clemen 1030</p>
<p>dipsoluscious 4</p>
<p>fastizio 209</p>
<p>gatilsday 0</p>
<p>giggity 72300</p>
<p>hic-a-doo-la 175</p>
<p>sideboob 1210</p>
<p>slappywag 303</p>
<p>tumorsyphilisitisosis 4</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm of course surprised by the lack of results for gatilsday, but even just four results for the hard-to-spell "tumorsyphilisitisosis" confirms that the general population will make an effort to take up <i>Family Guy</i> neologisms. In conclusion, I think it's a vulky idea to delete this article. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShutterBugTrekker_03a7.html" title="User:ShutterBugTrekker">ShutterBugTrekker</a> 21:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC) Frank Grimes will deflate each one of my arguments in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...</dd>

<dd>Search hits alone can't make for sources.. but even if we're estimating prominence here, 1210 isn't going to be very convincing. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 00:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>your right, 1210 isn't impressive. but what happens when you take off the "site:myspace.com" searchfilter for "sideboob"? it goes up to "about 16,600" <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumerao_9838.html" title="User:Numerao">Numerao</a> 21:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Some of these neologisms have already made (past tense) their way into the popular lexicon.

<li>No, they haven't. Obviously we have some Family Guy fans here. *You* may be aware of these terms, but arguments like "these have made their way into the popular lexicon" are, frankly, completely made-up.

<ul>
<li>I disagree. What Google tells me is that there are a number of Family Guy fans out there, which is hardly revolutionary information.

<li>I don't see what the significance of the reference is.

<li>"It speaks to the notability of one phrase being used as a ringtone." Yes. "Not the notability of that phrase." The phrase = the ringtone. "(or any other)." I'm not talking about any other phrase. "Being a neologism with a life outside of the show." If it isn't a family guy neologism, delete it, the ringtone and the article are definitely outside the show. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 06:05, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that people have Quagmire saying "giggity" on their phone doesn't make the phrase a neologism. It makes the phrase a popular thing to have on your phone as a ringtone. A friend of mine has "Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!" as a ringtone, but that doesn't make the phrase a neologism. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:36, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If it's not a neologism, remove it. This page should only contain neologisms.
