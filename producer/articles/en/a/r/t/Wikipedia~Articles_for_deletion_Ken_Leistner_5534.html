<dd><b>Comment</b>. If it's a cheap shot, it's that of the editors of the article, who thought that Leistner's status as a chiropractor was such a noteworthy part of who he was that they made it the first thing in the article as of the date I write this comment. If Leistner is notable for something else, then that, rather than his chiropracty practice, should be the first thing in the article. Like I said, he could be notable, but the article as currently written doesn't make that case. How long do we have to keep the stub waiting for someone aware of Leistner's supposed notability to demonstrate it through an effective edit? As it is, the only articles linking to the Leistner article are of questionable notability themselves. -- FRCP11 04:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. If your objection to the article is the position of the chiropracter mention, perhaps a better solution might be to edit the article to come up with a more appropriate ordering, rather than deleting the article. Anyone can edit, after all, so feel free to change it (or at least discuss it on the discussion page). Though as I mentioned previously, if you read the entire article (which isn't that long, as you have observed), it's clear that his notability lies elsewhere. <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 10:58, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. My objection to the article is that it describes someone who isn't notable. Someone complained that I described Leistner as a chiropractor, and I simply noted that what I know about Leistner I know from the article written by his fans. I have no desire to edit an article about someone whose fans aren't even willing to make a persuasive verifiable case about his notability. What I see so far is a chiropractor/personal trainer who writes a column for a non-notable magazine and co-owned a gym for six years. By that standard, I could include a hundred <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_Review_4973.html" title="Harvard Law Review">Harvard Law Review</a> editors who've invested in their spouses' retail establishments. A couple of posters insist that he's "well-known in the community," but no one provides a cite for that, so it flunks <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>: personal experience doesn't bootstrap someone, and I haven't written a Wikipedia article about <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Stone_deaa.html" title="Ron Stone">Ron Stone</a> just because he's my second-favorite local <a href="../../../k/p/r/KPRC-TV_5f88.html" title="KPRC-TV">newscaster from my youth</a>. (I edited this entry after Dsreyn's responsive comment below, but it doesn't materially affect his comment.) -- FRCP11 14:49, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There was a "cite" for it already. It was noted that he was a regular columnist for Powerlifting USA for 20+ years, has had a regular column in Milo for 13 years, was a columnist for Hardgainer, etc. It's not "personal experience" to mention these things. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 14:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The guy who writes the column at the back of D.C. Lawyer magazine (circulation tens of thousands) for the last twenty years isn't notable, because even if the magazine is notable (and no editor yet thinks it's notable enough for its own entry), the columns aren't. Lots of non-notable poker players write columns for <s>non-notable</s> apparently notable poker magazines like <s><a href="../../../c/a/r/CardPlayer_c4a6.html" title="CardPlayer">CardPlayer</a></s> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Card_Player_Magazine_2c52.html" title="Card Player Magazine">Card Player Magazine</a>. Shouting to the rooftops that someone writes for a magazine whose own notability is in question is simply proving my point. Lots of dreck gets published because it's cheap to publish magazines that are mostly advertising. What stories did these magazines (and more importantly to this discussion, Leistner) break? What was their circulation? Were Leistner's columns advertised as a reason to buy the magazine? -- FRCP11 14:49, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Saying that the notability of these magazines in question is rather disingenuous, since you seem to be the only one questioning their notability at the moment. As far as advertising, Milo has none other than the inside and back covers, and Hardgainer had virtually none (a page or two per issue), so your claim that "it's cheap to publish magazines that are mostly advertising" doesn't apply to either. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 16:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. The notability of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milo_magazine.html" title="Milo magazine">Milo magazine</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardgainer_%28magazine%29.html" title="Hardgainer (magazine)">Hardgainer (magazine)</a> and the red-linked <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerlifting_USA_16d3.html" title="Powerlifting USA">Powerlifting USA</a> is legitimately questionable, especially given the failure of its supporters to demonstrate otherwise in response to my questions. If you want lots of people questioning their notability instead of just me, I can put them through the AfD process instead of just putting up an <i>importance</i> tag, and you would see lots of Delete votes. I'm doing you a favor by giving the two or three supporters a chance to fix the articles. -- FRCP11 17:04, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
