<p>David Scaffa was born in 1991 in the deep jungles of Niger, Africa. As a boy he was raised by the native black people and grew up as one of them. Many people refer to David Scaffa as probably the most amazing human to ever live aside from Jesus Christ. Hes perfect in everything he does, loved by all, and beyond good looking. He was named Sexiest man alive by Time magazine and Man of the Year. His main love is music and is also the best musician, song writer, and singer in history. Without David Earth probably wouldnt exsist.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-26_8cb4.html" title="Edit section: Thurston Moore, american musician">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Thurston Moore, american musician</span></h2>
<p>Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a singer and guitarist for Sonic Youth.</p>
<p>He was born in Coral Gables, Florida, and raised Bethel, Connecticut. Although he enrolled at Western Connecticut State University, he opted to move to New York City instead. There he learned to play guitar from Glenn Branca and soon co-founded Sonic Youth, serving as a guitarist and vocalist. In 1984, he married Sonic Youth bassist, guitarist and vocalist Kim Gordon, with whom he has a daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore. He is known for playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars along with a host of "other" Fenders like the Mustang and Cyclone. He even customised several of his Jazzmasters, comically naming them "Jazzblasters".</p>
<p>In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist, including 1995's Psychic Hearts. He has collaborated with scores of artists, including DJ Spooky, Nels Cline, William Hooker, Christian Marclay, R.E.M. and Cock E.S.P.

<p>Backyard golf is a popular pastime played in yards across America. The game is very similiar to golf, however, it uses fewer clubs (i.e. sand wedge, pitting wedge, and nine iron). The balls are also whiffle balls that are often taped. The courses typically consist of one central hole location where different tee boxes constitute different "holes." Most courses have nine holes, although larger yards have been known to have 18 or 36 holes. The game is very easy to play as it requires minimal technical skill. The large size of the ball and short distance of the holes make backyard golf conducive to casual play.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of the game's origins remain unclear. It is entirely probable that the game was "invented" many times in many locations as fun lawn game in the vain of horse shoes, shuffleboard, or croquet. The game is very popular in Western Massachusetts. In one community, Ludlow, MA, local youth made frontpage news for an organized tournamemnt.</p>

<p>Army of Juan was a small Ska band that was on the Ska Satellite Records branch of Moon Ska Records. In 1997 the band put out a self-titled album that was created during the months of March &amp; April of that same year. The album covers 12 tracks with titles from "Break Open" to "Amish Beer Run". The band was composed of Johnny"Wkicherbitchin" Mason (on Bass, Vocals), Jim "Go to hell" Wruck (guitar), Chris "I Luv Taco Bell" Hornus (horns, covals), and Scott "Death-Metal Boy" Stevens (drums, cigarettes). It isn't clear, but it appears that this self-titled album is the only one put out by the band.</p>

<p>Alexandre Paul Payette is the co-author of the theme song "Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now" from the sitcom "Perfect Strangers," along with Jesse Frederick and Bennett Salvay. The song was performed by David Pomeranz.</p>
<p>Payette was born in 1952 in Detroit and was raised in Center Line, Michigan. He attended UCLA, where he received a degree in music theory. While working at Warner Bros. Records, Payette wrote and pitched theme songs for a number of sitcoms, including his song, "Enough Love To Share" which was rejected by "Full House." Payette then decided to collaborate with Jesse Frederick and Bennett Salvay on a song for an upcoming ABC sitcom called "Perfect Strangers." His original version, "On The Wings of My Dreams" was sent to Frederick and Salvay, who orchestrated the song and edited the lyrics. The result was "Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now," which was accepted and used for the series throughout its entire run (1986-1993.) While Payette had originally performed the song, David Pomeranz was selected to perform the version used on the show. Alexandre Paul Payette is credited with backing vocals on that track. When Payette was asked to write the theme to the 1989 spinoff, "Family Matters," he declined. Payette passed away in 1998 due to complications arising from prostate cancer. He died in his home in Cincinnati, OH. He was 45. His memoir was published the following year on Woolcraft Press, New York. It is currently out of print.</p>

<p>The Brunei Darussalam Flag of yellow, white and black was redesigned to include the red state crest to mark the public declaration of Brunei’s Written Constitution on 29th September 1959. on the same date Brunei achieved internal self-government and the State Flag is now an important symbol for modern, independent Brunei. But the roots of the flag have a much longer history – one which bring together a long Bruneian tradition of personal standards and flags.</p>
<p>Before 1906, Brunei had no single state emblem. Instead, Brunei royal family members and state officials held personal flags and standard. Of these, the most important belonged to the Sultan and Wazir (Viziers – principal state official).</p>
<p>In 1906 the basic bold yellow, white and black flag was adopted as state emblem. The colours were symbolically taken from the traditional standards of the Sultan (yellow) and the two principal Wazir who signed the history agreement (white and black).</p>
<p>Today there are five Wazirs in Brunei and their personal flags can be also seen flying on special occasions. These include that of the principal Wazir, the Duli Pengiran Perdana Wazir (white with the state crest in yellow) and the four further Wazirs; Pengiran Bendahara (white), Pengiran Digadong (green), Pengiran Pemancha (black) and Pengiran Temenggong (red). When the news, updated State Flag was adopted in 1959 all other individual flags and standard were abolished except for personal flags.</p>
<p>The rectangular shaped State flag of four component portion, two parallelograms and two trapeziums - is cut across by a parallelogram from a point 6.35 cm below the top left corner to a point of the same distance from the bottom corner on the right side. The standard measures 82 cm long by 91.4 cm wide.</p>
<p>The parallelogram dividing the rectangle in this manner leaves two similar trapeziums at the top and bottom of the flag, with the lower trapezium assuming the inverted form of the upper trapezium.</p>
<p>The parallelogram is again divided into two parallelograms of unequal depths, the upper being 2.54 cm wider that the lower which is 19.05 cm in width.</p>
<p>The State crest in red superimposes the center of the flag.</p>
<p>The forefingers of the upright arms, which support the red crest, are equidistant at 61 cm from the left and right sides of the flag.</p>
<p>Embodied in the crest in yellow Arabic script is the state motto, which can be roughly translated: Always Render Service by God's Guidance</p>
<p>Four colours are incorporated in the flag, red for the crest, yellow for the trapeziums, white for the upper parallelogram and black for the lower parallelogram.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The National Crest of Brunei Darussalam</p>
<p><br />
The National Crest of Brunei Darussalam has developed from a Royal emblem and in its original form still maintains its status as one of the Royal emblems.</p>
<p>The present National Crest was superimposed on the National flag after promulgation of the 1959 Brunei Constitution.</p>
<p>The crest consists of:</p>
<p>Bendera - the flag. Payung Ubor-Ubor - the Royal Umbrella. Sayap - the wing. Tangan (Kimhap) - the hand Bulan - the crescent.</p>
<p>The Bendera and Payung Ubor-Ubor have been Royal regalia's since the creation of the crest.</p>
<p>The Sayap - the wing of four feathers - symbolizes the protection of justice, tranquility, prosperity and peace.</p>
<p>Tangan or Kimhap - the hand - signifies the Government's pledge to promote welfare, peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Bulan - the crescent - is the symbol of Islam, the national religion of Brunei Darussalam. The characters inscribed on the crescent is the National slogan, "Always in service with God's guidance".</p>
<p>The scroll beneath the crest reads "Brunei Darussalam" which means "Brunei, the abode of peace".</p>

<p>In 1958, members of the missionary congregation Piae Madres Nigritiae or Camboni Sisters began private education classes for 10 Italian female students. The Holy Family University Institute was founded by Sister Marianora and Sister Fosca with a few Ethiopian Birr and great determination. According to the records, ?The University was conceived as a local institute, pre-eminately destined for Eritrean students, even if . . .it began with a small group of Italian girls.? Their mission was close to the University?s mission today: ?The discovery, generation, and dissemination of knowledge in the service of society.? In the early years, the curriculum reflected Italian educational plans, and courses were taught in Italian with a view to preparing students to receive the ?laurea? degree from a university in Italy. After opening with courses in modern languages, economics and commerce, by 1960 they added mathematics, engineering and architecture. The perseverance and determination of the Camboni Sisters was unflagging. Even though They did not manage to secure the necessary funds to begin construction on a new building to house the growing number of students (486 by 1963). They made an agreement with a company known as African construction a partnership company, which was run by an Eritrean Geo. Haile Hiruy and an Italian Mr. umberto after the construction was finished the Camboni sisters denied the payment which was due which the company filed a legal action against the sisters. However due to the trust which was formed by the company owners towards the sisters because of their religious back ground they didn’t keep a significant document which can be used as an evidence in court of law. Latter the sisters announced that the university was formed as a trust to the emperor to escape further legal action. the state gave favour to the sisters and even threatened the partners for defaming the emperors name as a result The company winded up.In 1964, Emperor Haile Selassie attended the ceremony laying the first stone for today?s Main Building. Continued growth saw enrollment exceed 1,500 students in 1968-69, with the student body almost even divided between Ethiopian and Italian students, (and a few from other countries).</p>

<p>Simulators, Emulators and Debuggers are all involved in the verification and validation phase of any software product. This article aims at clearly mentioning the usage.</p>
<p>Simulators : During integration testing, unit testing of source code , it is generally not possible to use the exact product , then we opt to go in for a simulator to replicate the real scenario as much as possible . For ex: if the product you are developing requires an external interface like say a radio, then if we cannot bring in an actual radio at the place of testing , then we go in for a radio simulator(program which exactly does what radio would do)</p>
<p>Emulator : when your target board is ready with the microcontroller/ processor , it is not possible to debug your code line by line . so we go in for an emulator. if it an in-circuit emulator , it requires u to jus remove the controller / processor in ur target board and then plug in the emulator in tht place.</p>
<p>Debugger: A tool used to test and debug software. A typical remote debugger runs on a host computer and connects to the target through a serial port or over a network. Using the debugger, you can download software to the target for immediate execution. You can also set breakpoints in the code and examine the contents of specific memory locations and registers.</p>

<p><b>FOOLS WHO WRANGLE OVER FLESH</b></p>
<p><b>FOREWARD</b></p>
<p>The authors of this paper (one a vegetarian and one meat eating Sikh) wrangled hard with their own common sense which told them, “don’t be a fool and start wrangling over an issue which our great Guru’s dismissed as not worthy of discussion”. We did however feel as amateur Sikh Historians and commentators on Sikh affairs that we should use our knowledge and experience to clarify what is such a controversial issue. This essay out to be objective as possible but we found ourselves taking one side as we waded through the arguments and counter arguments produced by vegetarian and meat eating Sikhs. One thing that has incensed us is the use of incorrect History and mistranslation to back up arguments. It was these points that we felt needed clarification and we hope the reader will find that this essay does that.</p>
