<p>Listcruft, and quite offensive to those people who have (through no fault of their own) parents who were not married to each other. It might be argued to move to List of people born outside of marriage or some such title but that would be a useless list of mere coincidences. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 11:40, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The list is good. At finnish wikipedia even the leading moderator has contributed to it. The list can be limited to non-living persons if it feels offensive. But these days reasonable people do not see being a bastard as a bad thing. The title can be changed but that has nothing to do with deletion. Many readers of wikipedia will sure find the list interesting, especially after it has grown a bit. --Jarkka Saariluoma 12:45, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The arguments are in the nomination.

<li><b>Keep but rename</b>.

<li>Further comment per <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">User:23skidoo</a>: the word "famous" needs to be removed from the title as well, since any person on any list on wikipedia needs to pass the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guidelines</a> anyway. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">Dancing</a> to electro-pop <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">like a robot</a> from 1984.</sup> 14:15, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> as it requires a POV judgement as to who is "famous", plus it's completely unsourced. If this article is kept it MUST be renamed without the "The" article. I would have moved the article myself but I can't since it's now in the AFD pipeline. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:06, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this is just asking to be libellous. We'd need every entry referenced. At leas a category allows those with a particular knowledge of an individual to see them categories and remove the category if it is inappropriate. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandy_Scott_5a89.html" title="User:Sandy Scott">Sandy Scott</a> 14:52, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> even if it was renamed it would still be a meaningless collection of information. On the off chance it is kept, rename to List of people born outside of marriage as suggested above. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 15:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, maybe our problem here is the use of the word BASTARD, which in our language use is an insult, in older times it just meant people born out of wedlock -- but I fail to see how that makes a person notable. In the case of August the Strong of Saxony we would have to include about 180, and their claim to fame would be depleting Saxony's treasure to the point of bankruptcy by alimony claims <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 15:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Requires subjective judgement on 'famous', many entries are bound to be contested or hard to prove, and an article with that title may as well just put up a neon sign reading "Hey vandals! Come on down!" If this is considered encyclopedic information, perhaps create [[Category:People born out of wedlock]] or something similar. - <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/o/User_talk%7EEronMain_52bf.html" title="User talk:EronMain">Talk</a></sup> 16:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> it doesn't require any subjective judgement if we change it from 'famous' to '<a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a>'. We've got policy, there. We've also got policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> or (if you must keep) <b>Rename</b>: "List of famous illegitimate progeny". But deleting would be best since it is bound to become a vandal honeypot. In fact, the page was created with a vandalistic first edit. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 16:47, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> with namechange. All the entries have articles already, and "vandal honeypot" isn't a valid reason for deletion. If that were true we wouldn't have articles on current presidents. The category isn't "meaningless" the description is tight and accurate if changed to "out of wedlock births". The word "famous" is being used here to mean they already have an Wikipedia entry and are "notable" by Wikipedia standards. If an article is unsourced, it just means someone has to add sources, and in this case its just a matter of taking the source from the individual articles. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 18:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> In order to be kept, the name would have to be changed since "bastard" has a strong connotation which violates NPOV, and the list would be referenced. However, I'm not so sure that the list doesn't constitute <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a>. —<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 19:36, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per above. Serves no encyclopedic purpose, even if renamed, and fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. That the article may be "interesting" is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Strong keep</b> but rename to "List of persons born out of wedlock" or some such. Illegitimacy was an important legal status in many countries (including Russia); the illegitimate couldn't marry, own property, or even work in some professions. Having such a list, especially for people born before ca. 1918, would make it easier for a student looking at the changing status of the illegitimate. I think that at least with respect to historical individuals it's quite encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 21:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I can see how this article is similar to other similar classifications, but I don't believe it is particularly useful. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 21:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b>. I think the list could be useful and interesting. It's got to be absolutely perfectly sourced, though...calling someone illegitimate could be considered slander, expecially if it's not true. Probably more trouble than anyone would want to put into it. Plus, as said by many others, the name really needs to be changed. <a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:28, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the simplest remedy is a move. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 22:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think this is liftcruft, or random, non enyclopedic information. I also think this is un-manageable over time, like <b>famous people with black hair</b>, since it will include too many over time - driven by whether the information is referenced, not true. But if we do keep, <b>bastard</b> seems like the right word. Wikipedia is factual, and unbiased, but not PC.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 23:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But article titles also should be as unambiguous as possible, and fact of the matter is that <i>bastard</i> is an ambiguous term. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">Dancing</a> to electro-pop <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">like a robot</a> from 1984.</sup> 00:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but probably move. Should have a source for each person on the list and shouldnt contain people who arent notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 23:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is per UsaSatsui's argument above. Hiwever, Agent 86 also makes a good case for deletion too. The title of the article made me think it was about a list of famous <i>obnoxious</i> people (not 'bastard' in the sense <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimate.html" title="Illegitimate">illegitimate</a>) but it is misleading. --<a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunStar_Net_0f71.html" title="User:SunStar Net">SunStar Net</a><sup><a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESunStar_Net_e180.html" title="User talk:SunStar Net">talk</a></sup> 23:59, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I can see no encyclopaedic merit in this article. Inevitably some kind soul will add a living person to the list, feeling will be hurt, legal action, etc etc. Also appears be contrary to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 00:31, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> and <b>change name</b> This is a list containing people famous otherwise and generally know for being born out of wedlock. It;s not intended as insult. And because of that the name must be changed, because the literal meaning of the term is intended here, and such is decidedly not the meaning that most people would think of first. It wasnt mine until I read the comments here &amp; looked at the content of the page.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This page serves no obvious people, and with the changes in western morality in recent decades is likely to become pointless. Such a list is begging to be troll-bait. A category is a possible way foward. The criterion of "important enough to have a WP article" suggests that a category may satisfy those who want such a thing. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERingbark_23e5.html" title="User:Ringbark">Ringbark</a> 17:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
