<p>The page is not encyclopedic. It is more instructional than informational, containing suggestions and ideas for design. It also contains much POV text, with phrases such as "A sweater made as a gift usually delights its intended -- but it may never be worn again if it does not serve some practical purpose."

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, while I found it very useful in selecting my next sweater, I think it probably falls short on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> #4 &amp; #6. Nice diagrams though... <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 08:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweater.html" title="Sweater">Sweater</a>, which is tagged as a stub; production of the item is easily part of the main article thereof. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH"><font color="green">SkierRMH</font></a>,<font color="purple">08:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</font></li>
<li><b>Postpone vote</b> As the main author of this article, I would like the opportunity of amending the article to conform to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I wrote it relatively early in my time here, and wasn't really aware of the policies. I believe that this article can be made encyclopedic, in the same spirit as <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_architecture.html" title="Naval architecture">naval architecture</a>. Please give me the benefit of the doubt, in being both a sincere <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedian.html" title="Wikipedian">Wikipedian</a> and capable of writing WP articles; for example, consider my involvement in several <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">FA's</a> over the past few months. I myself now see several problems with the article and its wording, but I invite everyone to discuss the article's shortcomings on its <a href="../../../s/w/e/Talk%7ESweater_design_c065.html" title="Talk:Sweater design">Talk page</a> in a constructive way <i>before</i> proposing it for deletion. Today is a busy day for me, though, since I'm travelling; I'll do the best I can. Thank you very much for your patience, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillowW_a94c.html" title="User:WillowW">Willow</a> 12:31, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Postpone</b> (Man, that's a weird&#160;!vote.) The article, as it stands, could be much worse, and I'm willfully willing to give Willow the benefit of the doubt, as she seems like an incredibly strong contributor. If the article is fixed up within the next few days, let me know. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Sweater design seems as valid a subject as any of these, and is discussed in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_i_1/105-6059848-2336447?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=sweater%20design&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Asweater%20design%2Ci%3Astripbooks&amp;page=1" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_i_1/105-6059848-2336447?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=sweater%20design&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Asweater%20design%2Ci%3Astripbooks&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">large body of literature</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Add <a href="../../../b/u/i/Building_design.html" title="Building design">building design</a> to Tim's list. This is not exactly a knitting pattern, which i would consider a how-to. The wording could be tightened up a bit to make it more encyclopedic but it seems to deal with concepts more than advice. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 16:12, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak delete</b>/ <b>Strong cleanup</b>, the article as it stands now is inappropriate--far too many "shoulds" and opinion statements. It's POV and not encyclopedic. However, if rewritten, it could be legitimate, so I'd say give it a chance, come back in a couple months, and if it's still like this, delete it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 21:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Write on the article where possible, not it's deletion debate (I swear I should make that an essay or something). In my opinion deletion should be reserved for bad topics, and not bad articles. From the vast number of sources (IE dedicated magazines, with significant readerships, to knitting; college courses taught in knitting...) this appears to be a notable topic. It does strongly need cleanup, something I'm not really qualified to do, knowing nothing of the topic, but I'm confidant some editors who know more than I could make this a great article. AfD is not Requests for Cleanup, problems with voice, sourcing, POV or tone are better addressed by editing rather than nuking the article unless they are terminal and intractable flaws (like unresolvable POV definitions for lists, or nonexistant sources). <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for clean-up, there's potential here. Whilst there's no rule to quote (perhaps assumption of good faith?), a promise of clean-up from a productive contributor should count for something. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 23:30, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I am skeptical that this article could ever be encyclopedic - in other words, I don't think there is potential, but I'm certainly willing to suspend judgment.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 00:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> you'll usually find me on the deletionist side of any fence, but I don't understand why this article is on afd and not tagged for cleanup or somesuch. Techniques in clothing design is clearly an encyclopedic topic (though one that may be a victim of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Wikipedia%7ESystemic_bias_52e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>) for which a multitude of reliable sources exist. True, it's not comprehensive and needs work on the tone (more on that on the talk page), but we don't delete articles because they're incomplete or need editing. I'm also a bit concerned that the nominator chose to bring this to afd despite having engaged with the author on the talk page and being directly told of her intention to work on it. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 00:52, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is a valid topic with notability, thae article is not that bad as it stands.</li>
