<p>This article does not do a good job of establishing notability of the topic, and the sources do not seem verifiable.

<p>Appears to be original research. Googling "Milwaukee Brewers" "all-time team" returns nothing that would indicate either the Brewers or a media outlet named such a team. Also, the members of the All-Time Team appear to change depending on who's editing the article. A Brewers Walk of Fame exists <a href="http://brewers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mil/ballpark/walk_of_fame.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://brewers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mil/ballpark/walk_of_fame.jsp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, but the membership isn't consistent.

<dd>I have read it, and agree that it focuses on the person.

<dd>So I can write an article about myself, as long as I title it "Kafziel 1.0" and nobody can speedy it? That's ridiculous. It doesn't "get off track", it's never about any company.

As there was no clear consensus about Deric Williams, which was added into the nomination later on a different basis than the primary nomination, I have listed that page for deletion separately, at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Deric_Williams_96c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deric Williams">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deric Williams</a>.<br />
As to the primary nomination, although a numerical majority of editors were in favour of deletion, the argument put foward was that the article did not satisfy the criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Other editors rebutted that argument, by citing sources showing the article did indeed satisfy the criteria. As such, there is no basis for deletion. This is a deletion debate, not a vote.</p>

<dd>That I cannot say. To be honest, the articles made about as much sense to me as an article on neuroscience. But I wouldn't say to scrunch and merge a bunch of neuroscience articles because I don't know what they mean. For all I know these 'routes' are a great literary achievement, keys to unlock the secrets of the human heart, a stage for exposing the human condition in all its triumph and sorrow, a new Shakespeare Folio for our times, the glory of the age, which future generations will pore over in wonderment and awe, seeking ever-more detail in their quest to understand the minds of those who created such transcendant art, a quest which, alas, will be ever in vain, for the legendary Wikipedia articles that are said to form the keystone, then nexus, they key, the map, that brings together the raveled threads and claims Truth from the shadows... these are forever lost. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:39, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> For what it's worth, I strongly dispute that a Google search turns up a "ton" of information. Many of the articles listed are talking about a band somewhere named "Splash conception", the Wikipedia article is 1st or 2nd (depending on if you search w/ or w/o quotation marks), and there are several Wikipedia mirrors. I fail to see any reputable web sites in the mix showing that this is something more than simply a non-notable neologism. However, if you (or anyone else) disagree please respond. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 03:23, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was speedied with the notation "nn bio by user KennethJDillon". If any of this this true no way is it a speedy -- the article at least <i>claims</i> that he's written five books - seems true enough, he's on Amazon, although "Scientia Press" might be in his mom's basement. The other claims seem a bit over the top... but he is (apparently) president of Spectrum Bioscience Inc. (whatever that is), he was a intellgence analyst did write some paper about that al Queda guy. I dunno, is he notable? I can't really tell, and I'm not gonna vote, I'm just switching this from speedy to AfD. 453 Goggle hits on "Kenneth J.

<li><b>Delete</b> Everything looks wrong on this guy. It appears he <i>is</i> Scientia Press, or is at least its only author. All the external links in the article point to Scientia Press' web site. He identified an Al Qaeda operative as responsible for the anthrax mailings, but I can't find any claim of this that doesn't trace back to Dillon or Scientia Press. The FBI posting for the guy makes no mention of the anthrax episode at all, nor can I find any mainstream news organizations reporting the claim. Dillon has a PhD in history, but claims to have made major medical breakthroughs in areas of, uh, <i>alternative</i> treatments like "Biophotonic Therapy". His book, "Close to Nature Medecine," has an Amazon rank of #2,146,676. He's developed a cognitive cure for depression. Oh, and apparently he can solve our nuclear waste disposal problems. How do we know these things are true? Why, because he told us so himself. Either this guy deserves the Nobel prize in everything, or he's a total crackpot. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:36, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let's see. One the one hand, the <i>AIDS book review journal</i> (which you cited), which is compiled by a general librarian and is not peer-reviewed, recommends Dillon's self-published book as "A recommended book for medical libraries for its historical content and possible basis for future research." On the other hand, the library at the major research institution/teaching hospital I work at doesn't have either of his books on healing, Dillon is not published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, and his only exposure in the mainstream press is three letters to the editor.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm Kenneth J. Dillon. Six comments.
<ol>
<li>Slow down.</li>
<li>Consider that you may be dealing with something you have never encountered before. Historian turns scientist? Doing scientific detective work is right up my alley. Get used to it.</li>
<li>Many of the responses are relying on indicators that may not be as useful in this case as in others--e.g., self-publishing, which I assure you works a lot better than trying to get really novel ideas past editorial gatekeepers. Eventually, I hope to turn Scientia Press into a normal science publishing house, with books by many authors, and spin it off. If prestige conveys credibility, then the fact that one of my books was published by Smithsonian Institution Press is relevant.</li>
<li>The Wikipedia article does not make a claim of "major medical breakthroughs", nor does it claim that my cognitive therapy of depression is a cure.</li>
<li>It would not be reasonable to expect you to read much of what I have written, but you might find at least the article identifying the likely Anthrax Mailer<a href="http://www.scientiapress.com/findings/mailer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scientiapress.com/findings/mailer.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> worth reading. The evidence cited there suggests that FBI takes it dead seriously. It very much looks that, more likely than not, Abderraouf Jdey was indeed the Mailer. And my credentials for being the kind of person who could identify the Mailer in this manner are impeccable.</li>
<li>Read several of my items. You will see that I'm not a "total crackpot", and that what I have been working on is not unimportant.</li>
</ol>

<dd>I formated your comment a little, I hope you don't mind. No one is citing your theories' validity as a reason for deletion. If you can cite mentions of your work or yourself in primary or secondary sources your biography would be worth including. Until it does meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> however, it does not belong. Even if you had cured cancer we would not include your biography until it was verifiable and published in reliable sources. This deletion is not an attack on your character or your importance, just that a biography on you should not be included in an encyclopedia. kotepho 12:12, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Seconding Kotepho. Wikipedia's goal is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. One of the consequences of this is that autobiography is discouraged, per <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, as inherently unverifiable. As noted above, you do not seem to have been covered in any of the traditional media sources that would tend to show you had achieved notariety. Regarding your sepecific claims, they can be included in the appropriate articles, provided they are verifiable. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:24, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To bring up a specific issue on the verifiability, the article suggests that the FBI takes these theories on the anthrax mailings seriously. Can you offer any external source (like the FBI themselves) to confirm this? Everything I can see seems to indicate that you have self-published many interesting things, which very few people seem to pay any attention to. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:35, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> FBI has been badly burned by the Hatfill case, so it is understandably reluctant to identify a suspect in the anthrax mailings unless it has actually apprehended him and obtained a confession or rock-solid confirmation. Not likely with Jdey. However, there is quite a bit of evidence, cited in my Mailer article, that FBI takes him very seriously. As I note, evidence and logic suggest that, more likely than not, he was indeed the Mailer. As for my article on "The Trojan Origin of Roman Civilization", you would do well to read it yourselves rather than to accept someone's dismissive opinion. But I certainly understand what you are talking about in terms of verifiability. It is undoubtedly true that my work has not been covered in the traditional media. According to that criterion, my bio article does not belong in Wikipedia. So I will delete the article myself. Best wishes. Kenneth J.

<dd>Thanks for being bold, but read the AfD notices first. "You must not rename the article unless you make sure the page still links to the discussion page. This is most easily done by creating a redirect from "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/New page name" to "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Old page name". It's usually best to do so immediately before moving the article page, since this ensures no links are broken, even if somebody visits a page in the middle of the changes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You should not turn the article into a redirect. A functioning redirect will overwrite the AFD notice. It may also be interpreted as an attempt to "hide" the old content from scrutiny by the community.".

<dd>First of all, it doesn't need an admin for it to be undone (just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liza_Powell&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liza_Powell&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">click here</a>). Secondly, a redirect is not the same as a merge and there's no problem with being bold and doing a redirect <i>if</i> consensus is leaning that way. Ordinarily removing the AFD tag is vandalism and it should at least be moved to the talk page. In this case, the nominator did the redirect, is he withdrawing the nomination? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 06:03, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologise for the problems, but it was ment as a withdrawal of the nomination, since Liza Powell isn't the page we should be considering since the article's subject's name is Liza Powel, and there is a <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liza_Powel_0597.html" title="Liza Powel">Liza Powel</a> article The content of the articles are almost identical, i didn't think it would be a problem.

<p>This article is about a book with a tentative existence. The fourth volume (specifically) of the Tahrirolvasyleh (or Tahrir al-vasilah) shows little proof of existence. What we have is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the link to the book on a Greek Nationalist site.</li>
<li>A few mentions on anti-Islamic websites and the most notable source I saw was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932303456/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/102-5024364-5119368?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932303456/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/102-5024364-5119368?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">Islam Exposed</a> which apparently quotes it per an Amazon review. I could not find it for sale.</li>
<li>There doesn't appear to be an English translation.</li>
<li>I can't find commentaries on the book in English from any reliable source.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty much it seems like trying to demonize Khomeini. So, do I know if it really exists or not? Well, I'm not fully convinced either way... but right now it's an attack page and we have no evidence to believe it definitively exists. So, it really needs to be deleted unless we can get definitive and neutral references to it. I've searched my library's databases, the internet, etc. and I get very little. This delete/remake/delete has gone on for a while and this will hoepfully clear things up maybe the wider community knows more about this. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">„Ç∞„É¨„É≥</a> 06:52, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is going to be very difficult. Is the book a terrible Anti-Khomeni slur and falsehood, or is the AFD an attempt to supress the truth by pro-Khomeni editors? <i>I have absolutely no idea</i>. (That was a rhetorical question by the way, please don't reply on my talk page as it's unlikely I will vote either way on this one, and I'm not challenging anyone's good faith - I'm sure those of you in the know will appreciate and understand that the dilemna is exactly as I have posted it). How to verify the article if many relevant sources are not in English? Again, no idea.

<li>I had a similar dilemma at the beginning. My answer was: if it's a page and information is being contested then we need strong sources. If there are none it should be gone. If some surface it should be recreated. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">„Ç∞„É¨„É≥</a> 07:30, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Lukas changed my mind! Now that the page is cleaned up (though it could use some more work), its existence is a useful refutation to the rumors re the content of the book. Would be nice if some editor who can read Persian would add more content. Also, publisher should probably be Dar ul Ulum, or something like that. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:34, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe that Khomeini wrote a book; I'd wager that the picture and the download ARE that book. I also believe that the Iranian revolutionaries lowered the age of marriage to nine, based on hadith purporting to come from <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> claiming that she was only nine when she married Muhammad. Apparently it was believed that having a minimum age of marriage for girls that was greater than nine was a slur upon the prophet. Given that the hadith are sourced to Aisha, whom the Shi'a detest, giving them credence seems pointless to me. But ... whoever wrote the text claiming that Khomeini endorsed pedophilia, bestiality, homosexuality, and gosh-knows-what-else was extrapolating from that one fact and saying, "Well, if he endorses sex with nine year old girls, he must endorse sex with anything and everything!" Which there is no reason to believe. Clear fabrication. Otherwise the revolutionaries would not have been killing homosexuals and stoning adulterers. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:54, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, in the NPOV-tidied-up version made since this poll started. I don't understand the doubts about the "existence" of this book (the nominator speaks of a disputed "fourth volume" but the article doesn't even mention it has more than one in the first place. Another person on the talk page who advocates deletion says that it's a "very ordinary book" - so if he's actually read it, it must exist?!) And as for notability, Khomeini is himself so notable that I'd assume just about anything he wrote would qualify. The very fact that people here on Wikipedia get hot-headed about it shows me that there's something to it. A very cursory Google search yields these among dozens of pages apparently quoting the book (I assume that the title transliterated as "Tahrir al-wasilah" is the same work; correct me if I'm wrong): <a href="http://www.e-resaneh.com/English/Scientists%20and%20famous/Ayatullah%20Lankarani.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.e-resaneh.com/English/Scientists%20and%20famous/Ayatullah%20Lankarani.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> <a href="http://www.lankarani.org/fra/tal/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lankarani.org/fra/tal/" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://www.al-fadschr.de/nr081_090/af090/af090_19.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.al-fadschr.de/nr081_090/af090/af090_19.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="http://www.iec-houston.org/journeymagazine/issue2/issue2article13.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iec-houston.org/journeymagazine/issue2/issue2article13.shtml" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 11:10, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dear Lukas, There is a tradition in Shia clerical system: Any cleric who reaches to the highest level will write a book in which he will narrate the basic rules of Islam that are used for every day life of Muslims. Any cleric like Khomeini, would sit down and rewrite what his teachers wrote previously. If you look at these books throughout the history you will see that even the style of these books and wording are conserved. These are not philosophical books and there is no novelty in it. They have to write such book when they recieve the title of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marja.html" title="Marja">Marja</a>. In summary this is a very routine work by any marja, very basic islamic rules, copied from previous sources and contains no novelty. If the issues are controversial, it has nothing to do with Khomeini. All other Marja have the same issues in their book. If you want to see what I am trying to say, take a look at the sources that you yourself provided. You see that Ayatollah Lankarani is rewriting this book. This is a knwon tradition. However Khomeini has some books that are very novel and very controverisial. These books are his personal ideas. He did not copy these books from previous works. For example, Khomeini is known for his novel and controversial works on <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waliyat_al-faqih_%28book_by_Khomeini%29_1ee5.html" title="Waliyat al-faqih (book by Khomeini)">velayate faqih</a>. His main books are listed at the end of his page. <a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> who is insisting to have this article, would like to take one paragraph of this book (out of several volumes) and say that Khomeini was advertising sex with animals&#160;!!! If there exist such a thing in this book or similar books, it is not the author's problem. These are islamic rules. And khomeini is just narrating them. They can not change it or add or delete it. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitso_Bel_d44a.html" title="User:Mitso Bel">Mitso Bel</a>11:40, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the comments - that actually sounds like a great piece of information to be added to the article. It doesn't change the fact that (a) some followers of Shi'a Islam apparently quote this book routinely as an authority on Islamic life, and (b) some detractors of Khomeini have made the book a target of criticism. Both combined make it notable for me. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 11:54, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Lukas, here is very good link that talks about Khomeini's books including this one.<a href="http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/hukumat.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/hukumat.htm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> My problem is that the guy who started the page, want to introduce the book as a book on sexulaity! I doubt there exist more than two pages or even two paragraphs in the book about this issue. One can not say the subject of the book or even a very surprising issue in the book is sex with animals&#160;! First of all the subject of the book is <a href="../../../f/i/q/Fiqh.html" title="Fiqh">fiqh</a>. Second, Khomeini's point on sex is not specific to him. People are surprised because they have never seen Islamic books or they have some political interets. Anyway, why people are surprized about writing two sentence about animal sex. Just search in google. You will find milions of pages about animal sex all by non muslims. I have no problem with having a page on this book. There are lots of pages in wikipedia that are not very significant. But I am worried about political attacks. Why don't they attack other ayatollahs who wrote such things&#160;? Khomeini is neither the first one nor the last one who writes a fiqh book. If we can find an original research work on this book that criticises the issues and khomeini's ideas, we can have a useful page. However all pages provided by <a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> are anti-khomeini propaganda.

<dd>Lukas, my reasoning was... we have anti-Islamic sites quoting volume four of this book as saying things about sex with animals, etc. No scholarly source that I could find mentioned it. There was scant information about the book besides on a Shia forum I found "the fourth volume doesn't exist". Here's where I completely disagree with you: "The very fact that people here on Wikipedia get hot-headed about it shows me that there's something to it. A very cursory Google search yields these among dozens of pages apparently quoting the book". It's really not to hard to get fabricated quotes to be thrown around the internet... I mean, we have past examples such as the protocols... so, if we are really going to claim that all of those quotes are from Khomeini we need to see that some qualified source has translated them from this book. This just wreaks of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> problems. The fact that there is corroborating evidence from Shia and anti-Shia sites talking about the book's existence gives me more faith the book exists... but what's in it and can anyone who reads Arabic verify the integrity of the text that is linked to? It'd be good to have someone like <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">User:Mustafaa</a> take a look into the text I think. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">„Ç∞„É¨„É≥</a> 14:19, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, I agree with Zereshk. I also want to raise another related issue: The point is that, the book has become a target for attacks not only in wikipedia but also throughout the web. The book is not a significant book. And I also doubt that Khomeini wrote the book personally. The tradition is like this: A Marja has a group of students. They will go and collect and write the book and even they will publish it and then they will bring one copy to the Marja for his signature. He will go through the book and will sign it and then the book will be distributed. The reason is that the content of the book is not new. Any Marja has to have such a book and that is more of a formality. In these books there are many thing that are not practiced like eating insects. <b>Neither khomeini nor any other Iranian eat insects.</b> But these issues are usually in such books because 1400 years ago prophet talked about these things. The same is true for sex. But some anti-khomeini guys want to abuse it and say that khomeini was himself such a guy.

"Truthiness" has also been discussed in the Chicago Tribune, Newsweek, MSNBC, the Associated Press, The Huffington Post, and Chicago Reader, on ABC's Nightline, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show (see below). In January 2006, "truthiness" was featured as a Word of the Week by the website of the Macmillan English Dictionary.</i>"?</li>

<li>Kosmix is not a spam site. There was a pretty extensive article about them in the Merc that you can read here: <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/13791484.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/13791484.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/13791484.htm</a>.

Article should not be deleted.</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I originally got involved with this when somebody mentioned it on AfD, asking why this apparant spam was let stand while their article was being proposed for deletion. It does get a few Google news hits, but they seem to all be press releases from Kosmix (and I didn't see any being picked up by any major outlets). Listing here following removal of {{<a href="../../../a/d/v/Template%7EAdvert_8bb0.html" title="Template:Advert">advert</a>}} tag, which indicated to me that if kept, this would always look like spam. Search engine seems to still be in alpha. But, they do have an Alexa ranking of 43,539 (not unusual for spam, and well short of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>).

<dd>There's nothing wrong with POV on AfD, thank you. It is non-notable because there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that discuss the film, and therefore any commentary on it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. The only <i>borderline</i> source is the worldnetdaily.com website, which mentions the film only in passing and provides no analysis. Finally, the phrase "film festival" means nothing to me. For all I know, in Hollywood all you need to do is play a few tapes in your parents' basement, and it's a film festival. The only way we can decide whether these things are worth covering is if other sources have already covered them, and they haven't. Now, let me ask: if we assume that the film is never screened again, and never mentioned again even on the Internet, would you still want to keep the article? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 00:04, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well considering they were just showing a few tapes in my parents' basement (not that my parents live in Hollywood but why quibble) they sure put a lot of money into the festival website. <a href="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> And they do of course prominently list the film in the screening schedule <a href="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/hollywoodsynopsis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/hollywoodsynopsis.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>.

<dd>Yes, absolutely! Being new doesn't mean you can't participate here. Well-reasoned discussion is always welcome. But it's important to understand that this is not a vote and the closing admin is likely to ignore new users who don't say anything other than keep. Note also that Wikipedia has many articles which are arguably <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">non-notable</a> (and probably should be deleted) so if you want to argue for the notability of this article you should argue <i>for the notability of the subject</i> rather than saying that other articles are scarcely any better. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 01:09, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I'm new in the Wikipedia world and don't know all the terms: what means [[WP:WEB], what nom? About sockpuppets I read and I think this concerns only the discussion here - so some of the entries (deletes and keeps) could be deleted. So there is this ad left - I think it means advertisment? For me advertisment has to do something with selling, but sokker is a onlinegame and there are no costs. There are more and more onlinegames and I think it's a good idea to give people some information about these games. For me this information is not advertisment.--Tyriats 13:49, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Point 1 of [[WP:WEB] says: 'The content itself has been the subject of non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.' Mr gibbage, who wrote the article, is one of the sokker moderators and players, but not one of the programmers or creators of this site, so I think he is independent of the site itself. And there are other players, who help him and there is a discussion in the sokker forum, but there is no help from any sokker site official.--Tyriats 06:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>comment</b> That part has been referenced with the [1] part, where it shows how many users there are. It doesn't count "bots", and the number regularly changes as inactives are booted and new users sign up. 23000 is a relatively small number when you consider how many hattrick has (700k+ IIRC) Mr gibbage 10:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>comment</b> Could someone knowledgable please assess whether the state the article is currently in meets the requirements of wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's a yogic concept that has some references out there. It appears this article is more based on new age fluff (i.e. theosophy) than any historical content about yoga {Pranayama, etc). I've no strong feelings either way on this, but if it gets kept I would urge verify, and sourcing tags be added and it be listed for cleanup somewhere that an editor with a greater knowledge of yoga than I could give it the attention it needs.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:34, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Important concept in several religious and neo-religious traditions (Hinduism, Esotericism ....). Needs some rewriting/expanding. I might try to expand it more in a few days. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallarme_fd97.html" title="User:Mallarme">Mallarme</a> 13:52, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but include more references to Samkhya, Vedanta, Blavatsky, Alice Bailey, etc. I agree that at present it reads like original research (but it is not, as a simple google search will reveal), and that the article should definitely be cleaned up with more references, including references to the original Indian meaning (i'll try to add some material on the Samkhyan use of the term when i have time), and less unsourced statements.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Not meaning to criticise anyone's views, but surely whether you believe or don't believe in astral projection, or consider Theosophy to be new age fluff or an authentic tradition of contemporary <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esotericism.html" title="Esotericism">esotericism</a>, is irrelevant to whether this article (and other such articles) should be kept. e.g. I believe <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> is a load of crud, but I still strongly support having articles on Creationism in Wikipedia. I have noticed lately several articles of non-materialistic subjects have been marked POV and/or nominated for deletion. As someone who values a diverse Wikipedia, this is of some concern. Wikipedia is not a hobby horse for particular opinions, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">it is an encyclopaedia</a>. The Linga Sarira is a concept that was originally developed in <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samkhya.html" title="Samkhya">Samkhya</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> and was adapted from there by <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedanta.html" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a>, and finally (in the late 19th century) by the Blavatskyian <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theosophy.html" title="Theosophy">Theosophy</a>, from which it was adopted by the Post-Theosophical (e.g. <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Bailey_5c5f.html" title="Alice Bailey">Alice Bailey</a>) tradition. Therefore it is a notable subject, and the page should be kept. <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_Alan_Kazlev_3836.html" title="User:M Alan Kazlev">M Alan Kazlev</a> 02:59, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, what <i>I</i> believe in is irrelevant. It is also irrelevant that there are a lot of people who don't believe in it, and this article states it as fact. I just thought that this article is redundant. (However, the rewritten article is much more acceptable than the original one.) - <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikon_a19b.html" title="User:Sikon">Sikon</a> 06:37, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>And likewise what I believe is irrelevant to whether the article should be kept or not &#160;:-) Anyway I added some new material, and improved the material that is already there, so hopefully it's of a higher standard now! <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_Alan_Kazlev_3836.html" title="User:M Alan Kazlev">M Alan Kazlev</a> 03:59, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page really does need to be deleted. Certain wannabe young people from Oxford who want to be politicians have created pages for themselves despite the fact they are not notable - i.e. they are only known to a limited number of people in Oxford (and sometimes one other part of the country) due to their grass roots political activity. These people may well become notable, at which point maybe someone else will create a page for them and they won't have to do it themselves. Other pages, such as that for Neil Mahapatra and Alex Deane, other young people from Oxbridge who consider themselves people who will one day be famous, have done the same thing (created vanity articles) and have had them deleted. Lets do the same here. The discussion above ludicrous - only two people came forward to vote to "keep" and both were personal friends of the Antonia Bance. --213.121.207.34 14:03, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would consider this a vote for deletion - I picked it up from the main discussion page on the article...</p>
<p>It's not self-promotion / vanity as Antonia didn't even know about it (cf comments on her website). However, Antonia is not, by the criteria of WP, notable so it should be deleted. Hopefully she will be one day though! Paulleake 17:02, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To be fair, Antonia Bance is prominent in the NUS and comments like 'wannabe young people from Oxford' strike me as sour grapes and a small degree of jealousy. I am also suspicious of the motives of anyone wanting to see the deletion of an article of a member of a mainstream political party. On that basis I think the article should stay for the time being!</p>

<p>n Off-Broadway play that ran for less than two weeks nearly two years ago. No awards, nobody famous involved. Was Prod'ed, but the tag removed with the summary <i>object to deletion; professional production with notable cast members</i>: since the "notable cast members" are <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misha_Sedgwick_1b17.html" title="Misha Sedgwick">Misha Sedgwick</a> and Thomas Blake (not the tennis player), this means either someone is unclear on the meaning of the word "notable" -- and probably "professional", too -- or someone is violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 15:04, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b>. Well, today's peak display of aggressive ignorance has apparently arrived early. "Off-Broadway" typically indicates notability itself; you're generally talking major-market, highly visible, professional productions. Misha Sedgwick, aside from clearly meeting notability requirements on her IMDB entry alone, is also notable (and widely reported in the NY press) as a scam artiste who managed to pass herself off as Edie Sedgwick's niece, even fooling the New York Times, as I recall. The play itself was widely publicized before its opening, even touted in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_Fair_97ac.html" title="Vanity Fair">Vanity Fair</a> at one point as a major event. The director stages professional work regularly in NYC. And so on. Not to mention the playwright's independent notoriety. That the play was neither a commercial nor artistic success hardly contradicts notability; any number of cinematic debacles have (quite properly) their own entries. Given that the nominator spends much more time displaying pique that his judgment should be questioned than in explaining his reasons for supporting deletion, this probably should be a <b>Speedy Keep</b> as not nominated in good faith. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:07, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, I am the creator of the article.

The article has gotten extremely long, so I branched off the trivia and the references to the original trilogy. If you find some of this to be too biased toward rumors and speculation, I suggest a cleanup. If you wish to merge it back with the original article (which is currently at 43KB down from around 82KB) then I will not stand in your way. But to delete it is ridiculous since most of the information CAN be sourced (it just hasn't been). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 22:58, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This needs a serious trim down. There's the mention that a sound effect may be shared between this movie and the Holiday Special. There are coincidences (two different SW actors winning the same <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razzie.html" title="Razzie">Razzie</a> in two seperate years for portraying two totally different characters), allusions to other fictiona universes (I saw a similar scene in Harry Potter, so it <i>has</i> to be mentioned here).

<p>There seems to be doubt as to whether this is a neologism, but a google search brings up only 400 hits, almost all of which (all but 4, according to one editor on the talk page) are Wikipedia pages, mirrors of this page, or articles using this page as a reference.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It looks like google and other search engines bring up enough instances of "Elvis taxon" and "Elvis species" to make a point that this is a credible though arcane term for instances of convergent evolution. Maybe add "Elvis species" as a second direct to this page, as it seems at least as used if not maybe more used than "Elvis taxon". <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 17:55, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't know. "Elvis species" only has 75 hits. Granted, those 75 hits include a lot fewer Wikipedia mirrors, but is 75 hits on Google really enough to call a term "notable"? Aside from student tem papers and state college lecturers, are there references to the term being used by a notable number of people? Otherwise, it fails the very definition of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>: <i>A topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact.</i> This is obviously a very narrowly used phrase, and I don't see its "importance or impact" outside that community. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:20, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term is used in a variety of articles in Wikipedia and a Yahoo search shows that many university professors use the term in their class notes online so if they're teaching it I think it's valid. Also, merging with <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazarus_taxon.html" title="Lazarus taxon">Lazarus taxon</a> would be an incorrect course of action since the two concepts are not related. One involves a species being rediscovered the other involves a species that acts the same as an extinct one. - <a href="../../../d/n/e/User%7EDNewhall_a69a.html" title="User:DNewhall">DNewhall</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It seems people aren't really getting the whole "notability" thing. The notability guidelines specifically say, in the very first sentence, that a topic has notability <b>if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency</b>. So even though professors in the very scientific states of Missouri and Kentucky use it, it <i>still</i> isn't notable enough to merit its own article. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 20:17, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know, seeing as there are a lot of articles that are left to stay in WP that are likely to be far more obscure than this term. Seeing as it seems used as a legitimate term in at least two universities, is taught as part of a curriculum (as both teacher and student notes attest to), I'd leave it in. And if I happened to come across the term and not know what it is, I'd be more inclined to look it up than, say " Naughty Karate" (people, this is just an example, I DO NOT want to start a flam war; if anybody feels an apology is needed, here it is in advance) <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 20:48, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Clearly, at least the <i>concept</i> is valid and notable (you might want to call it something other than <i>Elvis taxon/species</i>, but that's irrelevant). If other scientists use other terms for the same thing, those terms should be added to this article. ‚Äî <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimwi_eb8f.html" title="User:Timwi">Timwi</a> 21:19, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> a search using my local college library periodical database pulled up over 50 printed references to "Elvis taxonomy" &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">‚Ñ¢</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 14:35, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Faarwolf business is noteable, it set off broad controversy across the online gaming world. If you Google Malice Faarwolf you get several hundred hits to pages in at least 3 countries with her identity being "unmasked" and its ramifications to the gaming world. Faarwold as a single search term returns well over 1000 hits.

<dd>Hate to break it to, but <i>the online gaming world</i> is itself pretty non-notable. Just because it's <i>numerous</i> doesn't make it notable.

<p>Consensus on the article's talk page is that this article is very, very bad. Currently, it almost entirely a pro-homosexuality <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">soapbox</a> article - it doesn't even <i>describe</i> the criticisms of homosexual and bisexual behavior before it starts "debunking" them, but it doesn't "debunk" any of the criticisms of heterosexual behavior listed. Many comments have been made about this on the talk page and the article has not improved. I have considered improving it myself, but when I tried to fashion a plan for improvement, I came up with the following (posted on the article talk page):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Also, the gender of one's sexual partner(s) is far from the only basis on which one's sexual behavior can be criticized. To have a complete article on this topic requires that we include documentable criticisms of behaviors such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premarital_sex.html" title="Premarital sex">premarital sex</a>, non-reproductive sex, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_sex.html" title="Casual sex">casual sex</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adultery</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a>, <a href="../../../b/d/s/BDSM_7cde.html" title="BDSM">BDSM</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestiality.html" title="Bestiality">bestiality</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>, other <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships.html" title="Age disparity in sexual relationships">age-disparate relationships</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhibitionism.html" title="Exhibitionism">exhibitionism</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyeurism.html" title="Voyeurism">voyeurism</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyamory.html" title="Polyamory">polyamory</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swinging.html" title="Swinging">swinging</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_toys.html" title="Sex toys">sex toy</a> use, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_fetishism.html" title="Sexual fetishism">sexual fetishism</a>... and the list goes on, I'm sure. Now that I've put together this list, I am becoming increasingly doubtful that this is a useful article title for Wikipedia. Maybe it could work if we divided it up into sections according to the grounds of the criticism (religious doctrine, physicial harm... I don't know what the categories would be exactly) rather than the behavior being criticized. As it stands, I'd rather that the sections currently in the article be subsumed back into <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexuality</a>, or <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexual_behavior.html" title="Human sexual behavior">human sexual behavior</a> as appropriate. I'm almost thinking this should be nominated for deletion, as I'm not sure whether the article could ever be more than an incoherent assemblage of POVs. Of course, this is Wikipedia, so maybe someone will come along and edit it and prove me wrong."</dd>

You perhaps could have tried an RFC, don't know if there's reason to make one while there's an AfD now. But it is very unsourced, and has not been attracting editors making the necessary changes. Nom doesn't mention criticisms of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstinence.html" title="Abstinence">abstinence</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monogamy.html" title="Monogamy">monogamy</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproductive.html" title="Reproductive">reproductive</a>, marital, and "<a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanilla_sex.html" title="Vanilla sex">vanilla sex</a>" and who knows what else besides (everybody's a critic). It would have to be all or nothing, and it's got to be cited responsibly, and that would be a practically Kinseyian undertaking. I don't see any content worth merging into other articles, though the topics could possibly be addressed in other articles‚Äîstarting from scratch (though I suspect most of them already contain criticisms). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 19:50, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see how it's fixable. Inherently OR and POV, unless expanded to book length to cover all viewpoints.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I did consider nominating this for AfD myself, but was waiting to see if it could be improved- it hasn't been. I suspect it will always be hopelessly POV.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that it is unsourced (one of the few articles here still unsourced, probably) and that it needs more work, but I fail to see why it is "inherently POV". Because it covers statements that themselves are obviously pov? I hope that is not what you mean. It may be that the title needs changing - the original idea was that it would cover criticisms of the three major orientations, and then it seemed appropriate to mentions criticisms that were more general. I could see including criticisms of autosexuality, etc. It is extremely valuable to see what kind of criticisms have been leveled at sexual behavior over the ages, because it contextualizes the ones in use now. Why would you want to get rid of this kind of coverage??? And the thing about being pro-gay. What?! What's pro or anti anything about it, unless some stuff has been put in since last I looked at it, and then it can be taken out. This whole effort to get rid of this material makes no sense to me. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 03:01, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm just not buying that this is the way to organize this type of information.

It seems like begging for a POV minefield, frankly. Calling this an encyclopedia article is like calling <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossfire_%28TV_series%29_836c.html" title="Crossfire (TV series)">Crossfire</a> a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_film.html" title="Documentary film">documentary</a>. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 09:21, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Hello. I created the Ascent Media entry. I apologize for the "corporate ad" feel and apparent 'lack of distinct information', it wasn't my intent for the entry.</p>
<p>My decision to give Ascent Media an entry was driven by my interest in the parent company, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Holding_Company_8ba5.html" title="Discovery Holding Company">Discovery Holding Company</a>, and by Ascent Media's large size of roughtly $600M in yearly revenue (largest in post production work as far as I can tell). Further, I noticed that there were other post-production firms listed on Wikipedia: <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-production.html#Major_post-production_companies_include" title="Post-production">list of post-production companies</a>.</p>
<p>My approach in creating the page, was to initially use the SEC filings as a starting point <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320482/000104746905019465/a2153553zex-99_1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320482/000104746905019465/a2153553zex-99_1.htm" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. However, I am not an expert in the media space, so I didn't understand what, for instance, "Creative Services" meant.</p>
<p>Given my lack of knowledge, I did some google searches on the company and I found some of the news articles listed in "History" - including the Business Week article which discussed the deal with Sony for media conversion.</p>
<p>My next step - and perhaps where you feel it is a corporate ad - is that I created subsections for "Creative Services", "Media Management Services" and "Network Services" and I referenced the Ascent Media corporate page - which gave a long list of words I'd never heard of.. So, I took the keywords from the corporate webpage, and I searched wikipedia for them - and I added links where appropriate.</p>
<p>So - net of this was that I began to understand (roughly) what Ascent Media does: And I began (sorta) to understand. I now know that "Creative Services" is video and audio manipulation - everything from 'scoring' (adding a soundtrack) to editting (linear *and* non-linear - apparently some old analog difference). Similar level of understanding for Media Management Servcies (basically transfers between different media types) and Network Services (apparently you need to be able to distribute shows using satellites, etc.)</p>
<p>But - I feel far from enough of an expert to try and summarize this on the page by deleting stuff..</p>
<p>Net: I gave a very valid attempt (and many hours - check the history) to trying to make an appropriate Ascent Media page. My hope was that it was a good starting point for someone knowledgeable to improve... And, yes, I recognize that the entry isn't perfect, but I expected (hoped?) for some help.</p>
<p>I would obviously be disappointed to have the work deleted simply because I wasn't knowledgable enough to get to the encyclopediac 'essence' of Ascent Media.. Any suggestions (or edits) are welcomed.</p>

<dd>That's why he is listed as that having his only film role! But he is an actor and was in a movie. People have been asking about him over at IMDb on Lindsay's discussion boards, so I think a small article about him that is linked to Lindsay's page is nice.

<li>The reason why I added his article in the first place is because I get asked questions about him all the time at IMDb. And when I tried to add information about him to Lindsay's page, the editors <i>deleted</i> it because it "wasn't relevant". They told me I was <i>free to make my own page about him</i>. And then I made a page for him and people are allowed to petition for deletion? That makes no sense to me. Either let Mike's info be put into Lindsay's article or let Michael have his own article. But not having any information on him at all makes <i>no</i> sense because people ask about him all the time at IMDb Message Boards, and they come here looking for information and can't find anything. So what does everyone suggest should be done? Keep in mind that Michael Lohan has his own page at IMDb and is going to need a link to that page if people decide to merge with Lindsay Lohan. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephe1987_e945.html" title="User:Stephe1987">Stephe1987</a> 20:25, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

It was revealed in 2004 that Michael Lohan had spent much of Lindsay's preteen years in prison for securities fraud. In 2005, he was sent back to prison for "aggravated unlicensed driving" and attempted assault.</i> It seems relatively simple to say that also had a minor role in Parent Trap, and then blank his article as a redirect page. I think the editors on the LL article on wrong on this point. However, maybe some people attract so much attention that their family need articles even if it bends <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <b>Tentative merge and redirect</b> but I remain open to persuasion either way. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:31, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought that we should <b>merge</b> the articles, too. But <b>Wikipedia didn't seem to like it when I added in the stuff about Michael Jr.-- they told me to make a page for him</b> and deleted all the stuff I wrote without notice or asking me about it. It seems rude that they just delete your stuff without telling you first. Or they leave a note in your discussion telling you what they did without asking first why you did it. And you can only write like two sentences in your edit summary, so there is no way to explain what's going on *rolls eyes*! The two Michaels, like you said, were mixed up, but you are wrong about Michael not being credited for the Parent Trap. <b>He is credited for the Parent Trap.</b> The <i>uncredited</i> roles were from the late 1990's to early 2000's when he and his little brother and sister would go around with their mom and be uncredited extras in Lindsay's films, remember? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephe1987_e945.html" title="User:Stephe1987">Stephe1987</a> 22:04, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I added a link to Michael's IMDb page from his name and the birth years of the Lohan siblings (so people who come on here know how old they are because people are always asking how old they are), as well as the fact that they have uncredited roles as extras in the films sometimes-- two sentences! If the editors don't revert again, I (the person who wrote the article) also agree that this article should be deleted. I don't know why they didn't just let me add in a little bit of information on him in the first place-- it would have saved us all a lot of trouble.

<dd>I'm sorry but, as I explained on your talk page, that can't stay. An external link to someone other than the article's subject is a no-no. Also, you've added information that is absolutely unencyclopedic‚Äîher parents' birthdates could be considered irrelevant to Lindsay's article, never mind her siblings'. Their uncredited cameos in her films are not relevant, either. Any one of the changes you made would be sufficient for <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a> status to be revoked due to irrelevance to the subject. With all possible respect to Michael, specifically, one film appearance eight years ago is insufficient notability for an encyclopedia, and <b>barely</b> enough for the briefest of all possible references in Lindsay's article. Among the things <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>, it is not a complete list of everything.

<dd>I see no other solution than to put the information and link back in. There is <b>less that one sentence</b> about each of the siblings-- not <b>nearly</b> enough to say that there is too much information on someone other than Lindsay Lohan. In fact, <b>all the information was in the same</b> sentence! The fact that they travel with her and their mother, who is Lindsay's agent, is also VERY relevant because they have uncredited roles in almost all of her movies (also <i>one</i> sentence). Also, the reason why I put the link to Michael's IMDb page (if you read his talk/deletion article) is because people want to delete his page, so I think it's best to just link his page to the IMDb article about him if he doesn't get his own page. Please tell me what you think makes the most sense to do: either give the Lohan kids each their own page (which seems silly because there is only part of a sentence about each of them), or add in their birth years to say how old they are, (and a <i>lot</i> of articles have birth years for siblings, so it's not too much info or irrelevant) and say they're extras in her movies (which they are). Also, what about the link to Michael's IMDb page-- why not just link it to his name? Perhaps we should put a number by it and have the link as an external link? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephe1987_b266.html" title="User talk:Stephe1987">User_talk:Stephe1987</a>

<dd>This is not nearly as simple as you are making it seem. First, a <b>lot</b> of articles may indeed have peripheral information about siblings and the like; you will find that is not the case in <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA"><b>featured</b> articles</a> (seriously, and please, go read some). Indeed, articles that <b>do</b> have such listings should be cleaned up to remove most (if not all) of them; bad habits in articles are not excuses to spread them to other articles. The external link for Michael <b>absolutely</b> cannot go back; as for her siblings' uncredited exploits in her films, I would be more than happy to file a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">Request for comment</a>; however, since we once again are talking about the possible delisting of a Featured article due to the relevance (or lack thereof) of the information, I wouldn't hold up hope that your suggestions will survive.

Debate seems fairly notable as many Islamic online carry the video of the debate, or debates as their seems to be several parts. I have added in several generic details (date, location, event). Article was created on the ninth and AfD went up on the tenth.

<p><b>del</b> a neologism attempt.

<li>Is it current in English usage so that it can go to wiktionary? Wiktionary seems to collect lots of garbage lately. An occasional looker (mainly when creating disambig pages with wiktionary link) I am, yet have already fixed several errors and outright hoaxes there. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 02:04, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This has widespread usage and it certainly isn't an attempt to coin the term. I think it would be better served to be merged with some other Japanese terms such as <a href="../../../d/q/n/DQN_618c.html" title="DQN">DQN</a> instead of seperate articles though.

<li>Please provide reputable references for the origin and "widespreadness" of the term. Google gives tousands of hits, but for wrong "neta", at least in the first 300 hits (way beyond my usual diligence level). If it is spread wide, it must have been done quite thinly.
