<li>No, addressing your concern here is fine, that is the very purpose of this discussion page, to discuss validity. Compared to low-budget film stars or dead famous people, there are no Google results, and he is known mainly for his joking... sorry, but, no, he is not notable. And here at Wikipedia we don't care how notable someone *might* possibly become given time, only about how notable they are right NOW. Please see <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> for details. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 02:10, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, please sign your responses in a discussion so we can tell who said what. As it is, some users (such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChill_Pill_Bill_4117.html" title="User:Chill Pill Bill">Chill Pill Bill</a>) have taken this as malicious/fraudulent commenting, and I do not necessarily blame them. EDIT: and don't think we can't tell from the history who *really* wrote what, because (as demonstrated) we can. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 02:10, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, NOW i get it.. You're all racists and hate black and hispanic people like this wonderful man. Damn, another blatant example of a hate crime in progress.

<li>PLEASE sign your posts so we know who says what. You may not find any black/hispanic teachers on here, but you will NOT find many "whiteys" either. Teachers are, as a rule, not important enough.</li>

<li>I was wondering when this issue would come up. We've already clarified that party leaders are notable in all (or almost all) cases. I suppose this is as good a time as any to clarify the rules for leadership candidates as well.</li>

<p>The Manitoba Liberal Party is a significant force in Manitoba politics -- it doesn't have many seats in the provincial legislature now, but it was the official opposition party less than twenty years ago. Its history dates back to 1882.</p>
<p>A credible case can be made that anyone who runs for the leadership of this party is automatically "notable". I grant, however, that de Jardin's situation is borderline.

<li>Indeed, Sam, it seems that quite a few of us are interested in learning more about this guy. It would be a shame if those who are not interested decide to delete the article and prevent it from ever gathering more information about him.

<li>As Ground Zero says above, this <b>isn't an internal position</b>.

<ul>
<li>I'll say it again -- nobody's saying that the office Jardin ran for is unimportant or unnotable. But running for that office <i>by itself</i> does not make you notable, any more than every person who ever ran for Governor of Hawaii is notable. (Or even Governor of California!) So yeah, we need to know more. The person to address that point is <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a>, who created the article.

<li>I wish I remember whose comment I got this from, but... it's a core principle of Wikipedia that its contributors only do what they want to do. And all in all, this works pretty well. Undoubtedly, CJCurrie is our house authority on Manitoba politics, but we shouldn't put him in the hot seat for expansions to any given article. Anyone with access to a newspaper microfilm collection with any Manitoba daily could surely find out more about de Jardin's candidacy.

<li><b>Comment: comparison to U.S. politicians</b>. If I understand the Canadian system, a provincial premier is pretty much the equivalent of a U.S. state governor. And when a party comes to power, its party leader becomes premier. So in effect, somebody who runs for party leader is trying to become premier. ¶ I know, I know, there are factors that don't apply to U.S. politics -- coalition governments, party leaders have other responsibilities, etc. But it's a close approximation. ¶ So the nearest U.S. equivalent to would be somebody who once ran for Governor, lost by a big margin, and never did anything else to make the news. There are <a href="../../../r/e/s/Results_of_the_2003_California_recall_c4a4.html" title="Results of the 2003 California recall">plenty of people like that</a>. How many of them are notable?

<li>As I'm not voting, I'll take some liberty and comment on the above if that's OK. This is a sensitive area. Anything to do with religion, the Middle East etc. generally is.

<li>I've just removed a section that's clearly inappropriate (consisting of claims about what U.S. white supremacists think of Islamic groups, and a long quotation from a journalist about one person who's Muslim and a fascist), together with a couple of other unsubstantiated claims. I've also reordered the text to flow more smoothly, and corrected a number of internal links.

<p>Since one of the claims about <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is that its article attempted to make connections between Islam and Fascism that some editors thought to be non factual.

Hence the need for an article on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>.</p>
<p>I urge people to think about the encyclopedic nature of the topic of historical and current Islamist alliences with fascists.

<dd>I would support renaming this article Totalitarian Islam or perhaps Totalitarianism in Islam would be a more neutral name. I just really <b>really</b> think that the word fascism and its deratives have been made so ambiguous through constant misuse that they are not at all encyclopedic unless the article is about the term. As this article is not about the term and is not really about fascism but rather several flavors of Totalitarianism some of which might contain some aspects which may relate to fascism. In any event a name change would increase its chances of surviving this VfD (I think). <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 07:05, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's quite confusing, Dalf. You voted delete on Americofascism. You haven't suggested to redirect it or rename it to American Fascism or something else as you are preaching for this article. If we follow your reasoning above talking about the misuse of the term fascism, we would assume that we will be ending having 100 plus articles of Islam. What would be a difference between Islamofascism and Totalitarian Islam? IMHO, this article is just a mirror of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>.

<dd>You could be right. The truth is I think all of these articles are problematic. I voted delete on Americofascism because I did/do not think it is a real term. That and it was an obvious <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation. Also note that I voted delete here as well ... I am just sort of thinking out loud down here in the comments. As to the confusion you mention, redirecting any article to a title with the word fascism is IMHO a bad idea. Other the word inflames emotions, and even when used correctly it is ambiguous because of the cultural and vernacular history associated with it. My comments here about moving things should be seen as saying "if there is appropriate content for any of these article I think a better title can be chosen". That goes for articles about criticism of or reactions to American foreign policy as well. All in all I still stand my my original statement that I made in my vote <b>*SIGH*</b> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 09:16, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I see an agreement with what you explained. I think, if someone wants to denote a fascist, he should simply use "fascist" and then if needed stipulate the religion or the nationality. The vast majority of Muslims are not fascists. Any religion, creed or philosophy can be perverted and twisted to meet extreme aims. Therefore, the term Islamic Fascism can be used as Italian Fascism, Spanish Fascism, American Facsisms, etc... As replied to Klonimus about his ignorant and personal definitions, I disagree totally about the term Islamofascism. The term 'Islamofascism' will need a book length theorisation by somebody who knows the subject inside out before it can be used in serious political discourse, rather than knockabout polemic.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For instance, Klonimus wants to reserve it for a specific strand of Wahabbism. Yet the parallel between reactionary Islam and fascism is to my mind best illustrated by the Iranian revolution. Those events met many of the classical criteria that differentiate fascism proper from other types of authoritarianism, such as military dictatorship or peronism. It was - and still is - a regime of crisis, built on the mass mobilisation of the middle class to crush an insurgent workers' movement. Yet it is, of course, 100% shiite.</dd>
<dd>But even though I'm picking Klonimus up on this point, I'm not claiming deep enough knowledge to pontificate with authority. Until a useful definition can be established - assuming that it can be - the term should be used with utmost care. Especially by jobbing hacks who lack any expert perspective.

<li><b>Keep</b>, normally I would vote delete for micronations, however this "cosmonation" and James Thomas Mangan seems to have garnered some notoriety, appearing on national television in 1958 to claim space and in front of the UN. I dont know too many micronation creators that would go to the trouble he has in promoting his claim. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 03:33, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If the kooks behind these one-person "micronations" have actually gotten enough attention to be notable, then write an article about that person and describe their pet project within it, but don't pretend like these things have any independent existence. I don't even know what that crap about the flag being seen by millions and being "formally raised" at the UN is referring to—it seems patently false on its face, and is at best overblown hyperbole of what was probably one kook waving a painted bedsheet on the corner of 1st and 43rd. I'm surprised at the lax critical thought in some of the above votes in assessing the veracity of the article's claims, especially considering how three of the four "sources cited to are nothing more than collectors' references (so the kook did make his own stamps and coins) and the fourth was obviously self-promotional material. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 08:19, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I wrote the article, so I'm biased, but I see no reason why Wikipedia should not document historic eccentrics, non-conformists and oddities of this type; Mangan's particular obsession clearly had a resonance for the times, and the references are all perfectly valid sources documenting that - <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a>'s rant notwithstanding.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 23:48, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rant? Yes. I was tired. But I still stand by the substance of my comments, and dispute that the NCS flag was "formally raised" at the UN Building—<i>who</i> exactly was it raised by? The article right now makes it sound like the UN did it as an official action. And what are the details of this supposed television broadcast? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:58, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't have the time nor the inclination to address the many inconsistencies, false assumptions and factual errors in your rant, however the article is based entirely on the cited sources, which of course is why they are cited in the first place. If details are lacking it is because the sources available don't provide that data. There are probably other sources that do clarify those details, and when and if they come to hand the article will be modified accordingly. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 00:10, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have to say that I don't care for the particular sentence in question. Your wording suggests that the flag raising was an official UN ceremony, or at least approved by the UN. Common sense suggests that this was unlikely, and that they simply staged the flag raising while the UN guards weren't looking. Of course, you can't insert your own inferences, but if your sources our incomplete, your language should reflect the fact. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 00:20, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>I agree - I've removed the word "formally", as it implies a degree of recognition on which the sources are silent. Having said that we shouldn't automatically be dismissive of the idea that someone at the UN facilitated a flag-raising ceremony - after all the fellow who founded the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Service_Authority_90b0.html" title="World Service Authority">World Service Authority</a> and Prince Philippe of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Araucania_and_Patagonia_22b9.html" title="Araucania and Patagonia">Araucania and Patagonia</a> have both given addresses to the General Assembly at various times. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 01:15, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Felipe has renounced his claim to the Kingdom of A&amp;P, but continues as an advocate of indiginous rights. Presumably he spoke to the UN in the latter capacity. As the WSA, I'm a little suprised that anybody at the UN would give them the time of day -- aren't they sort of in competition? ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 01:56, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Just under the bar of notability IMHO. I'm inclinded to think that all winners of WSOP/WPO events, and any poker tournament with an entry fee &gt;= $10,000 (or EUR 5000) are intrinsicly notable. Ditto for any winners of prize &gt;= $1,000,000 in any poker tournament.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I wrote almost all of the poker player articles we have (not this one, obviously), and I agree this guy is non-notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think that Wikipedia should become a repository for explosive-making recipes if only because it would open up legal issues in many countries, especially in relation to anti-terrorism laws.

<ul>
<li>Do you have something against keeping explosive information in the public know? Why is that? Ever heard the phrase 'if we outlaw guns only outlaws will have them' It has certaint connections to this here. I'm explicitly saying that knowlidge about explosives is vital to anybody who has contact in some form of the other to them. Be it professional, hobby or michevious. I truely believe in the freedom of information, the freedom to learn and know. There are no boundries and no exclusions to this, be it how suspicious or otherwise. And no, I have not recieved any cease and desist letters, I have just noticed as an avid collector of high energy information that this particular gem was exiting the 'know' at lim. lightspeed. And kind of went 'wow this should be accessible to all, it's right down and dirty brilliant knowlidge' wikipedia was a kind of a natural continuation of that thought process. Information in itself is as far as I know legal. What would constitute as a good reason for having bomb making instructions. Well, the need for a bomb obviously. But it's a different thing to say 'here's how to make DPPP' than it is to say 'Psst! take this bomb and kill someone' See my point? There are articles of all kinds of things.. Poisons for example, Just doing an article on deadly nightshade (orsth.) does not imply 'here's the vial, slip it into his lordship's wine before dinner' NPOV. <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphood_5c65.html" title="User:Zaphood">Zaphood</a> 13:51, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, what we have here is a failure to communicate (maily mine) I see your points and will try and make a sort of a forward escape.</li>
<li>Zeroth point: <a href="../../../c/a/k/Cake.html" title="Cake">cake</a> <a href="../../../m/u/f/Muffin.html" title="Muffin">muffin</a> &lt;- compare
<ul>
<li>I suggest that <i>you do exactly that</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/k/Cake.html" title="Cake">cake</a> is not a how-to, a recipe for making cakes akin to this recipe for making diphorone pentaperoxide, but is an encyclopaedia article about cakes. The recipes for cake are, of course on <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Main_Page">Wikibooks</a>, in the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Cookbook">Wikibooks:Cookbook</a>, in <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Dessert#Cakes.2C_Cupcakes" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Cookbook:Dessert">the section containing cake recipes</a>. I suspect that you noticed this, since you came back later and added <a href="../../../m/u/f/Muffin.html" title="Muffin">muffin</a>. Part of that article, too, is a recipe that doesn't belong in the encylopaedia, but in</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yes one can do thease magical things here in wikipedia, like add stuff to other stuff, Did you discover this by my example&#160;? Well then, consider the wage naught, and I see you went straight away and effected this newly-found ability (it is called editing, now say with me ee-di-ting) to add the 'transfer to the recpie wiki' (orsth) stub to muffin and then had the ultimate grace to come and whine about it on my goddamn VfD? what's up uncle G&#160;? didn't sleep well&#160;? on crack&#160;?<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphood_5c65.html" title="User:Zaphood">Zaphood</a></li>

<ul>
<li>But wasn't till i pointed it out to you <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphood_5c65.html" title="User:Zaphood">Zaphood</a></li>
<li>First, I feel that transwiki would be the smart thing to do. There are allready synthesis for thermite and cyclonite under chemistry there. But I really feel that I do not have the competence to write a textbook or a manual on synthesis or any subgategory thereof. I just happen to have first hand knowlidge that this synthesis works and has been sort of a status quo way of obtaining DPPP.
<ul>
<li>Transwiki would be the lazy thing to do. Please stop attempting to burden other editors with a complex transwikification task when you, as the original author, are right here, apparently perfectly capable of submitting text to a wiki, and can submit your own original article yourself. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:45, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please accept this uncle g I would consider it an insult if you were to transwiki anything of mine. I trust your ability not and even you dount your resolve and energy<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphood_5c65.html" title="User:Zaphood">Zaphood</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second (not a hosting service): Point 2 states that material not used in a encyclopedic article are bad. Well I looked up encyclopedic and I really can't see the basis on which you state that this wiki entry does not have the qualities. It is educational, it is how should I put this, part of the circle of learning if you are looking for information on organic peroxides. All the uploaded pictures are used and the patent is on this VfD page, so I'm not hosting bull per se.
<ul>
<li>It's a how-to, a recipe indeed, not an encyclopaedia article, as explained. The articles at Wikibooks, such as the cocktail mixing instructions in the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Bartending">Bartending</a> book, are "educational", too (intentionally so, indeed, as part of Wikibooks' remit to hold "instructional materials"). But they aren't encyclopaedia articles either. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:45, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article being trivial: Well DPPP is considered the 'holy grail' of organic peroxides. It outstands in many ways compared to other 'easy' synthesis of similar material. First of all it's safe compared to the others, It's not too sensitive if stored right and is probably the fastest explosive around outrunning C4, TNT, RDX and just about anything except a few exotic compounds that have no use except as curios.</li>
<li>The copyright again. I'm saying it is in the public domain. If the original author who worded the synthesis came around he would not mind at all. And if he did I find it strange considering that this was released on the sciforums forum and discussed there extensivly untill someone desided it's too simple and too effective to be let sit where anyone can learn it.</li>
<li>Hosting it on my webserv: Well how would that help someone relying on wikipedia for knowlidge. I can't very well put a link to my homepage on wikipedia now can I&#160;? wikipedia is not a linkfarm (pun)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not the only way to publish stuff. Funnily enough, the World Wide Web contains more than just Wikipedia. It also contains your own web site, just as it contains my web sites, where I publish knowledge that <i>I</i> don't want to be lost. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:45, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yeah uncle g spare me the rethoric, I'm not like you and you do what you see best, I do what I see best but I really could not care less about your practices uncle g.<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphood_5c65.html" title="User:Zaphood">Zaphood</a></li>
<li>Legal issues other than copyright: I know it's a bum having your twin towers blown up but frankly, this has nothing to do with that or the laws that followed. If some country want's to orwellianalize the world, that's the shortcoming of the people who let that goverment do that, not the fault of the internet, not the fault of free information exchange, not the fault of learning interesting stuff and certainly not the fault of my finnish ass. Fine your homeland security act says that your MiB's can come here and put a slug in my head (read it it really gives the right to go on foregin soil and kill 'terrorists' (ie. anybody who is not playing on team america) without scrutiny) But after me, someone is bound to find this or similar in a book, and think 'wow this is great, why isn't it in the f*cking encyclopedia' Well if all the books aren't burnt and his emotion controll chip let's him have emotions such as 'wow'
<ul>
<li>Assuming that all Wikipedians are United States citizens isn't going to convince people that your arguments have merit. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:45, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I used the term 'your' in the sence that they weren't MINE. Tell me uncle g where are you from?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd bet a cup of stale coffe and a napkin you are from U.S. or her former colonial master the brits, which pretty much merits 'scum of the earth' in my book but what have you..?<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphood_5c65.html" title="User:Zaphood">Zaphood</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bomb making instructions: There isn't a way around this 'm afraid. If you put yeast and sugar in water, put that in a bottle and close the cap, what do you have? An improvised explosive device with a built in timer. It's all in the perspective, I think NPOV states that you should not assume that something is used for bad, when valid causes can easily be found. That pesky tree stump in the field, the warm fuzzy feeling of having a couple of kilos of high explosives under the bed, that painfull tooth, etc... And if your 12yr old son without your knowlidge should want to make explosives, which would you choose: Poor info that ends your kid in a grave OR Good info that keeps him safe&#160;? Think about it.. Because of good info I still can type (a mishap with ammonia and iodine, but i was lucky because I knew it's gonna make a bang, just had no proportion, but I was afraid of the stuff and that's because of good info and that's what saved my fingers)</li>
<li>The patent: This synthesis is superior to the patent 1) It has pictures 2)German patents are only accessible to german speaking people 3)If you are looking for information on ketchup, would you rather a)google the recepie b)work on a tomato farm&#160;? I'm willing to bet a pack of cigarettes that you can't find this german patent because of a) you are lazy enough to weigh a pack of cigarettes lower than a trip to the public (patent) library b) You need a german patent library. (will send 1 pack of ciggies upon proof of discovery and a mailing address, offer valid if I have a spare pack of ciggies) <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphood_5c65.html" title="User:Zaphood">Zaphood</a> 13:24, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well that was exactly not the point i were trying to demonstrate, but close. The point is that there are easy ways of doing things and hard ways.

Wikibooks is a wiki. Anyone who can (demonstrably) write an article here can write the same article there. Putting this through the transwiki system is burdening other editors <i>such as me</i> with a lot of complex edits; whereas it's very simple for the original author to submit the original article directly.

<li>Comment: Well yes, it releases some chlorine fumes. In this scale hardly enough to 'choke' someone but I have intimate knowlidge about this synthesis and the once wide discussions about it on chemistry webforums. But dangerous fumes do occur. This is covered by the risk disclaimer. As for the blowing arms off: It is not all that sensitive while wet of either acetone or water, nor does it explode if the synthesis is followed and temperatures in excess of boiling are not allowed to happen in the cool bit of the synthesis, even so I doubt it very much it would actually explode, just spoil the process. Well in thease levels of confinement and scale. And yes, some rephrasing would be in order for it to remain in the actual cyclopedic part of wiki. As for the legal entanglements, I very much doubt that anyone outside the brainwash scheme of the media actually doubts terrorists ability to get hold of high explosives. So for the rest of the world it's just information like any other. I really have to wonder why goverments should be to only ones with the ability to release joule in a short period.

It's a plastic explosive, you can't just brew that stuff up with zero training and a garden shed.

<b>Keep</b> phat phaggots</p>
<p><br />
<b>Abstain</b> I feel the need to put in my two cents worth; May I draw your attention to the exhaustive (but still amateur) discussion of diPhoro-Penta-peroxide on the sciencemadness.org pages: <a href="http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=179" class="external free" title="http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=179" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=179</a> . You have to remember that many of the members there have no formal chemical education (and although many do, including myself, there is a lot of dilly-dallying). A few things become clear during the long discussion; After three native German speakers with formal chemical educations examined the patent, in addition to the review of literal and non-literal translations into English: it was determined that the patent is very vague on the process, and key steps and methods are [opinion: deliberately] omitted. Basically, the patent does not provide a <i>formal method of synthesis</i>.</p>
<p>The synthesis here is also very unscientific, irresponsible and possibly a copy violation. That being said, I would like to change the article so it can be kept. From a chemistry major, this kind of thing is pretty interesting [strange to you probably!] I am suggesting collaboration between aforementioned proper scientists and Wiki to create an <i>encyclopaedic</i> article, with as little reference to synthesis as possible. Would you all be prepared to keep the article if it were changed from a backyard syth. page to an article discussing the actual compound? Keeping in mind that all information was researched independently, and often factually verified by many people at university facilities - if you were worrying about verisimilitude.</p>
<p>Sincerely ‘Ramiel’, sciencemadness.org moderator, Chemistry Major.</p>
<p>post sans Master Thief Garret: Unless performed correctly (and I will reiterate that this is not a correct method for the preparation of pure DPPP) the synthesis will only result in acetone peroxide. To actually produce DPPP you need a proper understanding of some fairly advanced laboratory method, some expensive glassware, or failing those two – the ability to buy in restricted chemicals. Please don’t shoot your mouth off&#160;;) Furthermore, a number of lead block tests for sensitivity have been independently performed on pure DPPP, and found that it has a surprisingly high tolerance to shock when compared to other complex organic peroxides... just so you know.</p>
<p>Definetly needs to go to wikibooks see <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis:Cyclonite_synthesis" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Chemical_synthesis:Cyclonite_synthesis">wikibooks:Chemical synthesis:Cyclonite synthesis</a><a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 01:08, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The entire article is non-canonical Fanon, later completely disproved by Star Trek: Enterprise</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> - The entire Centauran concept was started as a fan theory based on one line in the Original Series episode "Metamorphosis" where Zephram Cochrane, the inventor of Warp Drive was referred to as "Zephram Cochrane of Alpha Centauri". For three decades of Star Trek, that was the only official reference to Alpha Centauri and its inhabitants. Star Trek: First Contact in 1998 established that Mr. Cochrane was originally from Earth, and presumably moved to Alpha Centauri after inventing Warp Drive, since the entire plot of the movie was about his first warp flight, launched from Earth, and he'd never been in space before.</p>
<p>Then, Star Trek: Enterprise comes along, as a series set only a century after Cochrane's flight, and spaceflight takes place much closer to the worlds of the Original Series, and even focuses on the founding of the Federation. Presumably the Centauran race would show up even once, instead they are never mentioned. Instead the episode "Twilight" it is explicitly stated that Alpha Centauri was one of the few Earth colony worlds that existed in the Enterprise era. "Terra Nova" established that the more distant Terra Nova colony was the first Earth colony to be built on an inhabitable world (instead of presumably having pressure domes), so at least originally and in the Enterprise era all the worlds of Alpha Centauri cannot sustain native humanoid life (without later terraforming). In the episode "Zero Hour" where we actually see the founding of the United Federation of Planets, the founding worlds were explictly stated to be Earth, Tellar, Andor and Vulcan. By this point the Centaurans have been explictly shown not to exist.</p>
<p>The Centauran race was a popular matter of Fanon, and typically used widely in the FASA and Last Unicorn Games Role Playing Games, and in many of the novels, but they don't have a shred of evidence making them anything canonical, instead evidence points very strongly to their nonexistence.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as per unsigned nominator: "The Centauran race was a popular matter of Fanon, and typically used widely in the FASA and Last Unicorn Games Role Playing Games, and in many of the novels...."

<li><b>Keep</b>. As this race has appeared in non-canonical published sources, they are a legitimate subject. However, I do feel that someone with some knowledge of the subject should separate out fan speculation from published fact.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Give it a rest guys, no non-Trekkie cares whether an imaginary race is "canonical" or not. If there's a lot of fan fiction and other unauthorized stuff about the Centaurans, then they're notable. For accuracy's sake, the fact that they were invented by fans instead of by a Paramount studio hack needs to be mentioned.

The first paragraph is merely a dicdef and is similar to what is given for the "traditional skinheads" category on <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinhead.html" title="Skinhead">Skinhead</a>, which category explicitly includes Trojan Skinheads. The terms are essentially synonymous, and any difference is individual interpretation. The remainder of this article gives "Trojan Skinheads" a weakly related and unverifiable definition (no supporting hits on Google) as a "music style" and movement or period subculture in the UK, but the same author used identical text to define <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Tone_71f7.html" title="Two Tone">Two Tone</a> and the latter term is widely used for the music. If the vote is to keep, with the idea that there may be more to say about Trojan Skinheads as a distinct group (doubtful), then all but the first paragraph should be deleted, the page should be marked as a stub, and it should be renamed to the singular. - <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUnconventional_7269.html" title="User:Unconventional">Unconventional</a> 17:16, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>You seem to not understand what I am saying. It is not a "research". It is a "legend". AFAIK the guy intends to write a series of articles about gay rights in many countries. Please look at <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_Rights_in_Poland_c96b.html" title="Gay Rights in Poland">Gay Rights in Poland</a> for example. It has an entry: <i>"Gay Friendly level: 4.0"</i>. IMO this way is much clear than he would write in every article one and the same text:
<dl>
<dd><i>... exists some antidiscrimination law or recognition of cohabiting same sex couples. Gay scene is good, and community is tolerant. But there are some prejudices. There is no discrimination in law.</i> (this corresponds to level 4; the same for other levels).</dd>

<ul>
<li>I don't know, Mikkalai--if it's a Level assigned by some organization, then he should cite a source. If it's a shorthand he's developed himself, then it does seem to come pretty close to original research. Trying to evaluate the quality of the local "gay scene" (as "great", "good", "small", with various qualifiers) is something that's awfully difficult to NPOV. For the political and civil rights categories in the series of articles, he might be better off just adopting one or more of the measures from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indices_of_Freedom_7618.html" title="List of Indices of Freedom">List of Indices of Freedom</a>.

<li>Agreeing with TenOfAllTrades here; this scale of "LGBT friendliness" is the creation of the user user:80.53.83.194 and not any kind of more widely used definition. It does not belong to mainspace. If s/he wants to preserve it, s/he should register and place it under hir own user page. As far as I am concerned, it seems interesting althought overtly generalistic - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 09:49, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sticking to my story here. This “legend” constitutes a table of categorisation, and must as such necessarily be considered a piece of original scholarship by its creator. The information involved here is far too complex and ambiguous to be rated on a simple scale. I appreciate what the creator is trying to do, but either an external source should be quoted, or each entry should be treated separately. <a href="../../../e/i/x/User%7EEixo_d259.html" title="User:Eixo">Eixo</a> 12:25, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even as a categorisation scheme it is still original research. The categorization scheme is not encyclopedic in and of itself. It doesn't represent a body of knowledge.

<li>It's a dicdef. It's already in Wiktionary. The suggestion to redirect does not make sense to me in this case. First, the term can apply to examiners of all tests, not merely standardized tests.

<p><b>Delete</b> as a neologism. It's certainly true that most American actors don't do British accents well (vice versa is true as well; remember Emma Thompson in <i>Primary Colors</i>?), but "Hollywood English" is <i>not</i> a well-known term for the phenomenon. The claim that the accent in question has a "distinct Australian undertone" is POV, as it probably only sounds Australian to Brits, but not to Australians. The claim that the accent involves "tension on vowels" is meaningless without a definition of "tension"; if <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenseness.html" title="Tenseness">tenseness</a> is what's meant, well, probably <i>all</i> accents of English use tenseness as a vowel feature. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub>comhrá</sub></a> 20:49, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not persuaded that a concept of Hollywood English actually exists. There are a wide range of individual actors, of varying degrees of ability at imitating foreign accents, and a wide range of characters with different English accents to be portrayed.

<li>Your provincialism is showing. I've seen my fair share of British domestic entertainment (the kind that normally doesn't get to a wide American audience) to know about the near-universal awfulness of British actors attempting American accents.

<li>I didn't ask for clarification of your assumptions but thank you for providing it anyway. If it's the limited cite-ability of the term you object to, then perhaps we can arrive at a more acceptable name whence it can be moved.

<li><b>Re: "bloat"</b> - Why should a large potential for expansion be a negative thing? If the list ever gets too long, it can be divided by subtopic. <b>Re: POV battleground</b> - The topic is definitely a magnet for controversy. But I maintain that "controversial" is no reason to disqualify an article. Otherwise we could justify deleting abortion and the Iraq War and stem cell research and scores of other useful articles. So far, the list seems to be devloping nicely.... there have been several attempts at stupid additions to the blunders list, but these have been quickly fixed. And I'm amazed and impressed that a non-biased section on blunders in politics has already been added to the article. Wikipedia repeatedly impresses with with it's ability to find NPOV on the most controversial of topics, even if it can be, at times, a long hard road getting there. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 17:12, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Now I'm really angry. There is no such thing as a "re-vote" on a VfD. If an article has changed, the right thing to do is simply to point out in a conspicuous comment that the article has been improved, and urge those who wish to change their votes do so. Given that the criterion for deletion is "rough consensus," the customary criterion is a 2/3 vote, and the acting sysop can exercise judgement, it is not at all hard to garner enough support to keep an improved article. It happens all the time. The VfD 5-day period is deliberately set long to to allow for this, and in practice the backlog these days is so long that even more time is available This "re-vote" is not much different from someone, without consensus, just deciding to delete all of the existing votes. It's easy enough to get an article kept. We don't need to add new policy to allow parliamentary maneuvering. If this "re-vote" is accepted as valid, count me as a "delete." (If, on the other hand, it is ignored and the previous, valid set of votes is considered, then my previous vote stands). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:43, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Bahahaha</b>. I mean, get rid of this thing. The original title was laughable at best; it reminded me of an old and unintentionally hilarious Batman comic. Seriously, the word 'boner' meaning blunder isn't encyclopedic. Maybe in the 70s, or in England. I don't know. The list in its current form isn't much better, anyway. There isn't any hope for it to be complete, and there'd be inherently conflicts over what's considered a blunder. Like when the Mongols invaded Japan and were wiped out by a typhoon, is that really a blunder or just bad timing? A blunder would infer that there was a mistake made in strategy, do unexpected events count? And what would constitute an unexpected event?

<li><i>"The original title was laughable at best; it reminded me of an old and unintentionally hilarious Batman comic"</i>. The original title was actually <i>based</i> on that old and unintentionally funny Batman comic.&#160;:-) But, despite the silly title, even the first draft of the article was meant to be an encyclopedic, expandable stub. What's with the "death to coddled pet articles" attitide? That makes no sense. If you vote based on that then you are voting based on your opinion of the article's supporters and not on the article.

<li>Or, you know, the subjects you didn't mention that were in my reply. What with all the Mongols and the invading of Japan.

<li>The Mongols invading Japan and being taken out by a typhoon is a disaster, not a blunder. Is you look at the introdiction for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_disasters.html" title="List of military disasters">list of military disasters</a> it mentions bad weather as a possible cause of disaster. (It contributed to the French loss at Agincourt, among other battles.) On the introduction to the list of historical blunders page it indicates that, to be a blunder, something must have a bad result <i>and</i> be the result of bad decision making. The Mongal invasion could only be considered a blunder if they had a space-age, accurate typhoon prediction system and ignored it. The necessary technology did not exist, thus they had no reliable way of knowing that a typhoon would strike, thus it was not a blunder... but merely bad timing, as you suggested. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 20:56, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. I was taken. He suggested it in the Vfd of his article as if something he'd found in passing, but he did NOT divulge that he had just invented it. He then begged me to use this new procedure in his stead since if he used it it would look like he was trying to save his article. So I read the rules, it said if two people changed their votes it could be used, so I dutifully started it in the hopes that it would solve the huge debate that had previously raged. I cannot say whether he was intentionally decieving me or not... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 23:39, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</s> it was all a misunderstanding... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 04:12, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, nono, not "beg" in the actual sense, but he said "<i>Yes, I call for a revote. You seem to know the proper procedure for doing that. Since you have more experience at this then I, could you please put the header in place or whatever needs to be done?

<dd><b>Hold.</b> We don't delete policy proposals. We either accept them or reject them. If they are rejected then they go to "rejected policy proposals". I made this proposal in a good faith effort to make the system better. Was it inspired by problems I encountered on wikipedia? Yes. Isn't every proposal similarly inspired? However, don't disparage it just because it was made quickly.</dd>

<dd>MTG, you misunderstood what I wrote. I never intended for the proposal to be taken as anything other then a <b>proposal</b>. I was told that there was no revote policy, so I said in response "How does this sound?" and "Well, for what it's worth, there's the "how to do a revote" proposal for all to consider." On the proposal page, I clearly put "This is a <b>proposed policy.</b>" on the top of the page, and listed it on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_policy_thinktank_91d8.html" title="Category:Wikipedia policy thinktank">Wikipedia policy thinktank</a> for proposed policy accordingly. (Look at the original version of the page and you will see this. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Revotes_on_Vfd&amp;oldid=12751917" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Revotes_on_Vfd&amp;oldid=12751917" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.) I made every reasonable effort to indicate that this was a proposal and not official policy. Also, knowing that some people would take things the wrong way, a couple hours after I posted it, realizing that the proposal would just cause more controversy in the short term, I said forget about it; I said that I would not ask for a revote. Then Master Thief Garett said, that, it's alright, you can ask for a revote. So, I asked him to do the how and why or whatever needs to be done so that the revote procedure would be done in a regular and traditional way and be free of any perceived bias.</dd>

<dd><b>I did not intend for Master Thief Garret to use this proposal.</b> The fact that it <i>was</i> used is about the worst possible thing that could happen. The whole point of asking MTG to initiate/supervise a revote was so that it would be unbiased and done in a verifiably unbiased way. There was no attempt to deceive.

<li>It is a new template, created in the last month or so, to help reduce the constant confusions as to what was policy and what wasn't.

<li>Actually, it was on Vfd before I posted that on the commons. The article was on Vfd about 10 seconds after it was created because someone saw the name as inappropriate. I posted that bit in the commons in the hopes that the post would draw objective, open mined people into the discussion (of at least people who didn't want to see the article deleted)--people who would see the inherent usefulness of the article and help improve it, but the post clearly had the opposite effect. People seemed to take offense at being called "pesky deletionsts" (in retrospect, that's kind of obvious), and a few even seemed determined to delete the article at all costs. However, I must say that the majority of people have mellowed in the past day or so. The war drums have stopped. I actually have much more respect for the deletionist point of view now, thanks to the efforts of some very wise Wikipedians.

I believe it's also a skier's reference to fresh snow. That's at least 4 legit meanings which a user might look up with this term, so perhaps a disambig is in order? -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 06:49, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, disambig if needed, maybe to white powder (gunpowder) or similar. Never heard of <i>rocket candy</i>, and my experience with the stuff is you can't get a rocket to lift with only sugar and pot <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrate.html" title="Nitrate">nitrate</a> as described, effective rocket fuel needs at least some <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorate.html" title="Chlorate">chlorate</a>, a far more dangerous and effective oxidant.

<li>I see that the article has an "Other meanings" section, but since "white powder" as an alternative explosive/propellant to "black powder" is not the phrase's meaning most often seen in the press in recent years, I vote to <b>disambiguate</b>. Cocaine, anthrax, and unknown-suspected-contraband are all at least as common uses of "white powder" as this one. This article should be kept, but I don't think this meaning should redirect to <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_candy.html" title="Rocket candy">rocket candy</a>. Maybe <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_candy.html" title="Rocket candy">rocket candy</a> should redirect to White powder (propellant) or whatever title this article gets after disambiguation. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:49, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Disclosure</b> - I added the other meanings section on the theory that anyone who looks up "white powder" will more likely be thinking of one of those meanings - but that underscores the propriety of a disambig. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD</font><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">Abram</font><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">son</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">thi</font><font color="red"><b>m</b></font><font color="DarkGreen">k</font></sup></a> 22:13, 2005 May 6 (UTC)</li>
