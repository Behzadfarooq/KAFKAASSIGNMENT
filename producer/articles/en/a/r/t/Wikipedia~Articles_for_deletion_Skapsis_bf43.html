<dd>The primary issue is not whether the article is promotional. That can be solved separately by just deleting the link and the reference to the blog. Instead I nominated this article for deletion because it does not appear to meet the requirements to be in an English language encyclopedia. The article states that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skapsis&amp;oldid=118235267#Other" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skapsis&amp;oldid=118235267#Other" rel="nofollow">all the possible sources</a> are in foreign languages (overlooking the fact that this blog is not in English either). Skapsis articles don't appear on either the <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skapsis" class="external text" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skapsis" rel="nofollow">Portuguese</a> or <a href="http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Σκάψις" class="external text" title="http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Σκάψις" rel="nofollow">Greek</a> Wikipedias. There's just one physical reference cited in the article and that's a book in Italian. If there are thousands of academics in English speaking countries studying and writing about ancient Greece, why haven't they written about the term? If they haven't seen fit to discuss it, then is this term notable? "Skapsis" is <a href="http://www.kypros.org/cgi-bin/lexicon/" class="external text" title="http://www.kypros.org/cgi-bin/lexicon/" rel="nofollow">not in the online ancient Greek lexicon</a> that I consulted. Most of the great ancient Greek texts are available on-line translated in English and if this really was a common concept in ancient Greece, then the article's creator should be able to cite the locations in these online texts where the idea is discussed -- both for us and for the readers.

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems pretty clear to me that the article was created purely to promote a blog. The connection between the Greek farming term and education appears to be pure original research. At best, this appears to be a candidate for transclusion into Wiktionary. More likely, it just needs to be deleted. I'd be very happy if someone could prove me wrong by citing references to support the assertions made in the article; I would also be very surprised. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 10:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please try and be not so limited. Read what I have advised you to and you will see this is not a promoting article. That is all that I strugle against.</dd>
<dd>Have you seen the blog? You should, so you can be sure that none of the contraindications apply. I've read the links, and kepted them for me, so I can investigate them further, but I haven't found any real problem in the article. I agree that it may seem as an advertizing, but is not, and if there where to be more in the net about this word it would be there. I have searched. And I imagine that you have searched to without any luck. You think that the only occurrence of this word in the net, which is in no way any of the unadvised entries, sould be taken of?Sarasoar 01:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But I can tell you more. I have just done this article because a lot of people complaint that they had no way to know what skapsis is in the maner that I did in the article. The blog is a philosophical and poeticaly artistic way of aproching the same subject. I would neve explain the meaning of skapsis there. You may consider this blog the exact happening os skapsis, is the propoer action I have described in the article taking place. Is the best example for the article, and the article is an instrument for those that what to know more about the word. To see an advertizing action is to see ambliopicaly, is compleatly equivocal. There is no motive. Tel me a reason for advertizing? If you woul know the content os the blog you would see tha this is the most outrageuos thing to say.Sarasoar 02:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Are you familiar with Gilles Deleuze? His book What is Phylosophy?, with his cowriter Félix Guattari. The last post of the blog, in which the article is mentioned, posts the end of the introduction that is a severe critic on marketing and universal capitalism, or professional comercial formation. This is our doom. Skapsis is all against the ideias that the article have been acused. And the article came out because in the making of the blog there was nothing about the subject. But you know this allready. Please read the introduction to this book, you will see the nonsense of the acusation. And it's very bad that someone may mix philosophy with marketing, but this is possible because marketing have tryed to be criator of concepts. So now all creation of concepts must confused with marketing or advertizing...?</dd>
<dd>I new that some blog readers might find the article to be an over flow of information that would diminish the poetical dimension of Skapsis, so I have done this last post exaclty to give the tools to understand waht realy is the reason behind the occurrence of the article. My doing of the artical is the first step of the concept age, the encyclopedia. So you probably won't find any artical to be most apropriate to be in an encyclopedia than this one about skapsis. Skapsis is almost the same as the action of encyclopeding, and the mention of the blog is essential to give a dimention to it, it's to bad you can't read Portuguese.</dd>
<dd>All this was very sucsseful: The article is the first age of the concept: the encyclopedia, the blog is the second age of the concept: the pedagogy, and the atacks the article has recived show the presence of the fear for something that is very bad, which is the third age (and fake) of the conept: marketing. This last way of the concept is all that I want to see away from me or from the blog, the most as possible. That is why I have erased immidiatly the acusation from the artical itself.&#160;:If I would be doing what as been injustly said it would be the same as destroying the pupose of the blog, which is much more important than the article. The seconde age of concept, pedagogy, is the most importante of them all.</dd>
<dd>Please read the introduction to book that is referenced above. Only then you will see the nonsense of acusing this article to be advertizing.Sarasoar 02:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sometimes occurres that a fear for something to come arround brings the fealing for that. Only you, that are policiating the Wikipedia, would see advertizing or in any way a promoting action facking to be an article. But this is much more than an article, this is the product of the encyclopedia it self looking into the pedagogy being born. Encyclopedia has a bit dificulty in understanding pedagogy, so it tries to explain what is inexplainable. Al exlanation creates the ilusion of understanding, but the only understanding possible comes with pedagogy, the living of the concept. If you read about you don't know, you just think you do; you only know in your one experience and only if you are well advised, which is the function of pedagogy, to guide through the processe of empirical knowledge.</dd>
<dd>If something was not fully explained please ask for more. If this was a bore the fault is yours, you must go into philosophy so to understand the ofense of this acusation. It would even be a reason for processing the acusator. It not only is nonsense but more gravely is difamation.<i>"89.155.26.189 11:09, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd>ElKevbo, if you realy what to see references that prove all the article says just go and confirm it with the Franco Montinari Greek Vocabolary, the only reference I know to provide this information. I have said this before, but you seam to ignore what I say. The contection bettween agriculture and education is contemporary to Ancient Greece. I realy don't understando wy you act like this if you dindn´t even made an efort to understand what I say. <b>There is no source for skapsis in the internet</b>, the blog is the only source. Can you understand this? And can you understand that this article would never work as a promotion for the blog? Ask a portuguese reader to tell you all about it, and read the introduction to <i>Waht is Philosophy?</i> of Gilles Deleuze, which is the post that redirects here. I you are capable of understanding philosophy you will see that your worries are pointing to the wrong direction. This is becaming extreemly ofensive!89.155.26.189 11:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Is it possible for you to get out of the virtual world and veryfy a more that reliable sorce as the vocabolary I've mentioned? And that would involve providing multiple, reliable sources that meet the non-negotiable requirements of WP:V and WP:NOR. This Vocabolary is more that enough. I can't understant wy you steel complain? If every time that a subject is not verifyable in the net would be deleted thaere wuold be no Wikipedia for starting. All has a first time, and for Skapsis the first time in a sistematic and resposnsable manner is the blog.89.155.26.189 11:27, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
