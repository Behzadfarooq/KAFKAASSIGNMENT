<p>stubby article on yet another worldsim, with one line of text and an external link to the homepage. "True World Simulator" returns 31 hits on Google. "WorldPower" + nationsim returns 0. "SuperPower Classic" on Google returns 2480 hits: 21 are displayed, and the other 12459 are deemed <i>very similar to the 21 already displayed</i>.

<li>According to Geo-Political web-based simulator, "50 members and daily activity" seem to be criteria for the success and notability of such a simulation. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 18:56, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hey whats that? This is a free dictionary, its supposed to contain INFORMATION. My articles are just that, information. I see no reason what so ever to delete these entries just because they don't return enough hits on google.</p>
<p>Also, search for WorldPower 3.0 and you will get a hit on the nationsim directly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by [[User:Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005|Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005]] ([[User talk:Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005|contribs]]).</small></p>

<li>First of all, Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a dictionary. That is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>. Also, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia Is Not</a>... an indiscriminate collection of information. That is to say, simply because something <i>exists</i> or <i>is true</i> does not grant it automatic inclusion in Wikipedia. Generally, for things such as websites or games, the object in question must be "notable" for its importance in a particular field or area of interest, or for its visibility in popular culture. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 17:58, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Okay, encyclopedia. Whatever. They are all notable. If you did some time to read up on this subject you would see that there exists like 50 or so (and probably more thats just not listed) nationsims, but only TWS, WP, SPC and Qpawn are really big. Thats why only did pages for them. If I wanted to, I could have done it for every single nationsim but I didn't since there are many that have been inactive for years now. So they are significant in this context, they are significant in the world of nationsims. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This is why I withheld judgment on Qpawn and SuperPower Classic. Also, a dictionary is <i>very</i> different, and serves a distinct purpose, from an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 18:03, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I <i>know</i> what a dictionary is and I know what an <i>encyclopedia</i> is. Thank for that brief but unecessary lesson.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the WP and TWS entries are only one-liners because I don't have any more information on them. There is probably alot more information to fill in there. If you look at the wikipedia entry for goverment simulation you will see alot of info on TWS that I plan to put in there. As for WP, no I don't have anymore info. If you want to delete it, even though its notable, I demand a vote of some sort.<a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 18:07, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>HA! I got info on WorldPower aswell! Eat that! Now leave me, and my contributions alone and go find something useful to do <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 18:52, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter. Simply because there is information available on something does not automatically grant it notoriety or notability. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 18:53, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>No, as you obviously don't recall I already explained why they are notable. Did you even read the whole article? What matters now is that they are no longer one-liners.<a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 19:17, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is probably the longest discussion without a single vote on VfD that I have seen. That being said, I'm really not sure that the notability of these nationsims extends beyond the people that play them, and since there aren't too many that are active, I suggest we <b>delete</b> them all as the "biggest one" of these three has 68 listed registered users. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">T</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">C</a> 19:33, August 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are thousands of players playing these games, and thats what I call notable. US gov sim for example, has about 500 members. The ASG has 500 members. WorldPower has 80 members. This is large, and saying that its not just because you never heard of it is sad. I hope people start harrasing the articles you do aswell. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 19:41, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please do not think of this as harrassment. We are simply trying to come to a consensus on what ought or ought not be considered encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 19:43, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then whats the problem? They were all empty entries before I created them. I'm okay that someone removed my addition of SPC to the entry for <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> but none of the others are conflicting with more "important" entries so I see no reason not to leave them alone. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 19:48, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> all three as essentially non-notable forums outside of their own fanbase. The thousands of duplicate hits for "SuperPower Classic" are simply individual forum posts. TWS doesn't have an Alexa ranking, TP is on a forum hosting site, and SPC has a rank of ~200,000, and that's including a second forum/site on the same host.

<li>I vote to <b>Keep.</b> This is a notable genre in internet gaming. Is this not the debate? If so, then let my opinion be heard. This is a notable genre, though it may not have the number of users as EverQuest, or World of Warcraft, or even Master of Orion 2. Measuring the notability in numbers, though, is both very difficult, given the constant fluidity of geopolitical world simulator gamer population, and in many ways incompetent. The genre doesn't have great numbers for a few reasons, not one of which is not that the genre itself, more a subgenre of simulation, is unimportant. These games are long, many times tedious, and most people only want to play one of a very few nations, and when they do get it, they may leave. Also, think about it. When was the last time you saw an ad for any of these games? See, there is no member benchmark for notability, because that would be silly. It's the idea behind the game that we should be talking about. The idea to put players in the shoes of world leaders has been an idea in the backs' of many developers' minds, starting with Civilization, which could qualify as the first nationsim, and now we are just carrying that tradition on. Allowing players to have "power" over a nation/organization is an idea that, frankly, few have picked up on. Call me a partisan and ignore me, if you wish, but my points are still valid. This idea is notable and deserves to be heard, not ignored. <small>This unsigned vote was by DJ_R.
