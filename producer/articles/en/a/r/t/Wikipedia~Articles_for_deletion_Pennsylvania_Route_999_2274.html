<dd>Funding is a complicated issue; most (or all?) states have a state aid system, in which the state provides funding to local governments for local improvements. These are not marked by the state. Similarly, many states choose not to sign some of the more minor state highways. And in a few states, the numbers are assigned to and marked along major highways, regardless of whether the state maintains them. Essentially, a numbered and signed state highway is a highway that the state not only (usually) maintains, but has decided that it is useful to mark it as part of a system for motorist navigation. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 02:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This section of roadway fails notability. Apparently there has been no coverage in reliable and independent sources where it is a primary subject. There is absolutely no Wikipedia policy that every section of road with a number on it is inherently notable so that it doesn't need to satisfy the basic notability criterion. The government pays for and puts numbers on lots of things, such as toll booths and salt spreading trucks. Signs are pretty cheap. There are marker signs on every mile of interstate, but that does not entitle every mile of interstate to its own article. There are articles about sections of state higheway less than 1/3 of a mile long, and articles about county highways are defended with the same arguments as for longer statw highway sections. The notability arguments do not go beyond "ILIKEIT" and the joy of making an article out of every datum in a state database of numbered roads. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 15:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh really, have you <i>read</i> the ILIKEIT essay? I argued for notability here, I pointed out that the state highways form the backbone of the state's transportation infrastructure, and that they are notable because of this. Trying to dismiss all the "keep" arguments by labelling them as "ILIKEIT" is really very insulting. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:52, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Okay, this road exists. <i>So what?</i> Let's say I made an article on a farm, and the only thing I said was "This is a farm. It was established in 1900. It covers 10000 acres. It is on the border between Kansas and Oklahoma. It recieves farm subsidies from the government". That would be most certainly deleted. But because it's a <i>road</i>, it gets kept? <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_U.S._Roads_Newsletter_Issues_Issue1_fd35.html#Notability_of_state_highways_is_challenged" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Roads/Newsletter/Issues/Issue1">And this kind of blatant votestacking doesn't help</a>.

<li>Farms are not maintained by the state and given a number. One farm is not, by itself, important to the local economy. One farm is not known and used by thousands of people in one day.

<li>I don't think anyone is arguing "Cruft Blvd. in Podunk, Idaho" deserves an article because it's a road, and therefore notable (or if they are, they're seriously mistaken). State highways, though, are another matter. If they weren't important, they wouldn't be state routes in the first place. That's the basis behind the "State routes are inherently notable" debate: That being enshrined into law makes them so. The comparisons to farms and mailboxes and the like are just silly, because it assumes that if <i>all</i> roads aren't notable, <i>none</i> of them are. There are some notable roads, just like there are some notable farms (though I'm unaware of notable mailboxes at this time). As I mentioned in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Minnesota_State_Highway_127_9237.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Minnesota State Highway 127">other AfD</a>, it may be a good idea to go to mediation or some other dispute resolution process and hammer out some notability criteria for roads. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not my point. My point is that other things with this amount of information would be deleted, and a road should be no different. Plus, all your arguments for why a road must be notable apply to pretty much every room in any City Hall with a big enough population. For instance, let's take the legislative chamber of a random city. Thousands of people use it every day, and it's very important to the local economy, as they make laws which regulate it. It may or may not be given a number, but being given a number is really not even close to notability. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 22:03, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However, there is little notable about a City Hall. Specifically, there are 5400+ road articles about roads in the U.S. Do you believe that they should be deleted? --<b><a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschen7754_0301.html" title="User:Rschen7754">Rschen7754</a></b> (<a href="../../../r/s/c/User_talk%7ERschen7754_920e.html" title="User talk:Rschen7754">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rschen7754_abd2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rschen7754">contribs</a>) 22:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're arguing from an interpretiation of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> that I disagree with. I agree that, for it to work well, there have to be somewhat relaxed standards for notability, which is why many road articles certainly deserve to be kept. But this does not have multiple reliable sources, so it fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. And besides, the <i>only information in the article</i> is date of establishment, date of completion, and location. Summary style does not demand that you split <i>everything</i> out, and this is one of the things which should not be. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 22:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Summary style and notability conflict in this and other similar cases. Though if you went into newspaper archives, you probably could find many independent sources, such as coverage of the state takeover, and the building of the Lancaster and Millersville Turnpike as a private toll road in the 19th century. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~pacahs/toll.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~pacahs/toll.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is a starting point. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 22:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact remains, there is next to no information on this topic. Regardless of summary style, I do not think it should have a seperate article. And the fact that the notice that the precedent was being challenged has to be so blatantly biased (and calling this a vote, no less) does not help. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 22:26, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Because my experience is that in contentious issues, a merge consensus is declared not the purview of AfD, so I say delete, because a merge to me is "delete but save the information".
