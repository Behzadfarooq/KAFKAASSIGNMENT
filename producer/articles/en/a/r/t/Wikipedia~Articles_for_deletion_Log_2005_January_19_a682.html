<p>This is not what it purports to be, (a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List.html" title="List">list</a>) but a single entry. I don't see any reason to have a list of religious leaders from each year in history, so I believe this page is unecessary. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequencefree_fa0e.html" title="User:Consequencefree"><font color="#3399FF">ÅrÐ£nT</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsequencefree_ce75.html" title="User talk:Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCFF">†</font></a></sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Consequencefree_273b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCCC"><sub>∈</sub></font></a> 02:59, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think if we had an actual list like this, it would be great. Even if this was the only year we covered, it'd be good. Unfortunately this is rather weak. The originator of the article could at least have named the pope at the time. I suppose I'll go and do that.

<dd>You make a point, but I think a page for every year is excessive. by century, or even by decade would constitute more of an actual list since religious leaders are often the same for many years. Perhaps a change to List of religious leaders in the 1700s or 1740s would be appropriate?

<dd>I agree, no need to make a list entry for every single year.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> by different sort. I'll go against the crowd here and say theres no reason for something like this sorted by year. By decade, alright, but having one year out of the entire eighteenth century and it having only one entry seems pretty useless and the other pages by year are just as bare.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems dumb. What is notable about the state of world-wide religion in 1741 that we need a list of the religious leaders in that particular year. Even dumber would be to add a few thousand articles to the Wikipedia with the list of religious leaders in each year. The list for Y would generally be nearly identical, if not actually identical, to Y-1, because religions don't change their leaders frequently. Anyway, why would anyone ever need/want to know who all the religious leaders in the world were in a particular year. Lists like this just make Wikipedia seem stupid, and diminish its authority. In one of Jorge Borges' stories, there is a hilarious list of "lists", including Objects that from a long way off look like flies. I'm expecting to see that as an article on Wikipedia any day now. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:43, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was delete. Note: This decision should not be considered as a precedent against future articles about the event. This article is being deleted because it is overly specific to a single year and had too much of an advertising tone.

<p>An undergraduate newspaper at a college is rarely notable. No evidence is supplied to indicate that this particular one is. At best this would be a note in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Oxford_d5ff.html" title="Jesus College, Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a>. (And — Lo! — what do we find to be already at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Oxford_d5ff.html#The_Welsh_connection" title="Jesus College, Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford#The_Welsh_connection</a>?) The epithet (calling it a "title" is somewhat of a misnomer) is hardly notable, either. It doesn't just apply to the Welsh. (I've heard it used of several <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrarian.html" title="Agrarian">agrarian</a> communities.) And I doubt that an article on it could ever be significantly more than the relatively self-explanatory dictionary definition ("one who shags sheep"). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:33, 2005 Jan 19 (UTC)</p>

<li>To my mind, a printed newspaper in the English language (nothing ethnic there, just en. versus other namespaces, and major papers in other languages should absolutely be here) is real, hard and pretty likely to pass the notability bar - for campus media, at the very least for a merge and redirect. I was still about to vote delete as unverifiable, but by its <i>correct</i> name, <i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22the+sheepshagger%22+%2Bjesus" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22the+sheepshagger%22+%2Bjesus" rel="nofollow">The Sheepshagger</a></i>, it checks out. Indeed, it's <i>the</i> newspaper of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Oxford_d5ff.html" title="Jesus College, Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a> and is cited on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=+site%3Awww.jesus.ox.ac.uk+%22the+sheepshagger%22+%2Bjesus" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=+site%3Awww.jesus.ox.ac.uk+%22the+sheepshagger%22+%2Bjesus" rel="nofollow">three official college Admissions pages</a>. The college is eminent but small, so <b>borderline keep</b> or <b>strong redirect</b> (there's nothing yet to merge) from The Sheepshagger to <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Oxford_d5ff.html" title="Jesus College, Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 19:49, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>You didn't need to Google. I pointed out where it was mentioned in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Oxford_d5ff.html" title="Jesus College, Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a>. As I said, my opinion was that it didn't warrant an article, merely a note in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Oxford_d5ff.html" title="Jesus College, Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a>. And — Lo! — it <i>already was</i> a note in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Oxford_d5ff.html" title="Jesus College, Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a>, before this article was even created. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:08, 2005 Jan 20 (UTC)</li>
<li>Incidentally: The Sheep Shagger refers to the newspaper as a Scandal Sheet. (Indeed, it refers to it as a <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandal_Sheet_b385.html" title="Scandal Sheet">Scandal Sheet</a>.) Having been involved in such publications when I was at university (I'm actually using the same pseudonym here as I used to use all of those years ago.) I can assure you that they are <i>not</i> automatically <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">notable</a>, by a <i>long</i> chalk. (I offer as evidence for this the fact that <i>no-one</i> has come forward and said "I remember Uncle G! You're —".) Being intra-mural gossip, they <i>do</i> tend to fall foul of exception #6, being only of interest to a very small group: the other members of the college at the time. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:08, 2005 Jan 20 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am sorry!The supposed vandalism occured because I accidentally pressed the wrong button while trying to answer Frederik's comments.I ultimately ended up sending him a message.Please check every name that I have included like AP Mitra,Gopalan,Ramalingaswami,Narasimha,Menon,Seshadri and others.You would not find anything dubious.And google is a very poor guide to assess the importance of a scientist's work.I doubt you would find anything notable in the google if you search Yellapragada Subba Rao but he remains a giant(incidentally I included his name.)Google would not tell you much about JC Bose's prior discovery of wireless.He was an unassuming man.How many would know that Zuse was the discoverer of modern computers.And would it surprise wikipedians if I was to say the Television was patented in the 19th century.The discovere remains obscure.I obtained all this informaton from the reference I have cited.Incidentally the inventor of television is named there and I leave it to the wikipedians to find it out and see if he merits inclusion!I must admit I am partial to Ramalingaswami and Johnubi as they taught me and Johnubi's discovery that sodium valproate is a mood stabilizer when it was believed for over 50 years that lithium was the only option has benifitted someone close to me personally as it has done millions.Please go through the book and see for yourself if any of the 1000 named there are without any merit.I admit Johnubi is not as well known as he desrves because he gave up science at an early age after having published Biological Basis and therapy of neuroses again a masterpiece which established that neuroses also had a biological basis.I guess I have made the point.It is upto wikipedians to decide whether Johnubi,Zuse and yellapragad merit inclusion. Hi I am a Wikipedian and I had created the article on Johnubiprasad.It is ceratinly not anonymous!Let Frederik have his way but please check in the book if the information is correct beforw deciding to delete.Johnubi was my teacher as was Ramalingaswami whose page I was hoping to create along with Mriganka Sur's.My request is to check the information in the book before voting;should be easy enough!John Connolly,Canada</p>
<p>PS By the way it would not matter to Johnubi who has left science over 15 years ago.He is a recluse now.But I would expect objectivity from Wikipedians.</p>
<p>I have been through the book TOP 1000 SCIENTISTS FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME TO 2000 AD by Philip Barker.It is in the MIT Library where I am based.The name certainly does not seem familiar but it is there in the book.However,I think I would need to contact the author of the book for further details.Until such time,I suppose it may be a wise policy to exclude the name.Perhaps others might want to peruse the book themselves to see what they make of it.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as he's a full professor at a good university, with several books and over 350 journal publications to his name.

<li>This is a tough one. Certainly, the university is notable, but is this individual building? There's nothing I see in the article which makes me think it is. Perhaps there are significant events which happened here which made it notable, but if so, somebody's got to put them in the article to make it worthwhile.

<li>Oh, definitely the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_76d5.html" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a>'s <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Hall_0a2b.html" title="South Hall">South Hall</a>, built in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, making it nineteen years senior to the California parvenu, yet only the second oldest building on the historic UW campus. (North Hall is the oldest). South Hall is the headquarters of the College of Letters and Science, a fabulous and colossal entity larger than many other entire universities, proudly boasting thirty-nine (39) top-notch departments and five (5) first-rate professional schools. South Hall is strategically located on the lovely glacial drumlin known as Bascom Hill, within a short distance of the famous Statue of Lincoln and the historic Sifting and Winnowing plaque. In springtime, the grounds surrounding the building afford excellent views of attractive young women disporting themselves on the green lawn. A firebombing during the era of campus protest thankfully left no visible scars on this elegant structure (apart from security mesh on the first-floor windows).

<li>It's more the significant bit than whether it's the most famous or not. I'm happy with, say, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Palace_5465.html" title="Winter Palace">Winter Palace</a> pointing to the building in St Petersburg rather than any other Winter Palace, as it is significantly the most famous.

<li><b>Process Issue</b>. The Southall version rv-ed, as a fork and simply an impediment to the VfD under consideration. (Yes, merge the Southall material into <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southall.html" title="Southall">Southall</a>, and if its advocates want <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Hall_0a2b.html" title="South Hall">South Hall</a> as a redirect (or maybe someday a Dab if a worthy South Hall comes along) they can ask for it after this VfD completes.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The middle-school one also rv-ed, as this title is not suitable for it. (Write an article like South Hall Middle School if you really have nothing better to do, and that will get its own day on VfD.)</dd>
<dd>The question at hand is whether UC's South Hall should have an article, and others for which this name is not the ideal one are irrelevant to that discussion. There is such a thing as a "save" on VfD, a rewrite that turns a deletable article into a keeper, but that requires a rewrite that deserves exactly the title under consideration; articles that might want or deserve redirect or Dab-link from it need not apply.</dd>
