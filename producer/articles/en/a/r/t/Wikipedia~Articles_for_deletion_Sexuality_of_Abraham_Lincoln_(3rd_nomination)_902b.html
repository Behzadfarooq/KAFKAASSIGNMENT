<li>Yes, this article quotes some sources such as the NYT, but careful observation will bear that they are secondary/tertiary sources, not primary sources. They are generally media coverage (and negative coverage at that), concerning a book.</li>
<li>The only primary source is a C.A. Tripp, who is not a historian and is strongly contested within the academic community (as the article itself points out.) Thusly, more length is spent within the article <i>disputing</i> the thesis than verifying it.</li>
<li>The sections that are not a direct reference to C.A. Tripp's book are unreferenced accounts of Lincoln's past, thus classifies as original research.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="../../../r/e/d/WP%7EREDFLAG_c5bc.html" title="WP:REDFLAG">WP:REDFLAG</a> requires that "Exceptional claims require exceptional sources." <b>For this rather extraordinary claim, we have only ONE primary source, who isn't an historian.</b></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a debate about the validity of the <i>article</i> not the <i>content of the subject of the article</i>. The fact that this rediculus book has created such a controversy is a reason to include it, not delete it from Wikipedia. -- <b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 23:45, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Incidentally, <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> suggests that this should be <i>kept</i> not deleted.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, whether or not the allegations are true is irrelevant, we can still cover the allegations in an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> manner as long as there are plenty of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable sources</a>, which there certainly are in this case. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/i/User_talk%7EKrimpet_8927.html" title="User talk:Krimpet">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Krimpet_c408.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Krimpet">review</a>) 00:03, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - nothing new advanced by the OP that hasn't been amply addressed in one of several previous AFDs. I see no valid reason to delete this article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:32, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is the same argument over and over. Understandably the article upsets some people but the fact that the subject is controversial is no reason to delete it. --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParammon_7bc5.html" title="User:Parammon"><b>ParAmmon</b></a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParammon_d650.html" title="User talk:Parammon">cheers thanks a lot!</a>)</span> 03:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Understandably? There's no shame in Lincoln possibly being gay. And how is it extraordinary is it to suggest that someone might not have been straight? <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 05:14, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Content disputes can (and have been) discussed on the talk page. The amount of controversy and interest in the article gives overwhelming endorsement of its notability. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agne27_bd48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agne27"><sup>Cheese</sup></a>/<a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27"><sup>Wine</sup></a> 05:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Can't find anything improper with the last AfD closing 2 months. Subject has been covered by 3rd party sources.

<li><b>Keep, again. And keep next time too.</b> If a nybody trots out a new argument that wasn't answered thoroughly in the previous AFDs, let me know on my talk page and I'll gladly consider it. As it is, currently, there's nothing more to say. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 04:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for the third time. The mere presence of this continuing controversy affirms the need for an article. Let the critics, instead of pursuing deletion, work contructively toward improving the article. <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppBob_6a21.html" title="User:CoppBob">CoppBob</a> 19:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> yet again. WP should consider a waiting period following a closed AFD before an article gets nominated again. There is an inherent bias toward deletion: if it's deleted, any recreation is speedily deletable (even though consensus could change); if kept (consensus could change) and it gets nominated over and over again until enough people aren't paying attention perhaps and don't participate in the debate and then it's deleted. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:46, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume that this AfD have been started in good faith</a>. If Lincoln had been a living person, I cannot see the sources mentioned being sufficient for it to pass <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (for instance, just because <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> called <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> gay, doesn't mean we have an article entitled Sexuality of Bill Clinton). Just because Lincoln is dead does not suddenly give a purposed serious encyclopedia a carte blanche to speculate about his sexuality. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERailwayman_cc4b.html" title="User:Railwayman">Railwayman</a> 15:09, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In reference to the Log Cabin Republicans and generally, the sexuality of Lincoln comes up in conversation. Having a page that curious people can go to figure out where the suggestion of homosexuality came from, and what (little) evidence there is, is completely consistent with the purpose of Wikipedia. About the nomination; Wikipedia is supposed to be a encyclopedia, which IS a tertiary source. We're supposed to use secondary sources when possible! <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 17:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
