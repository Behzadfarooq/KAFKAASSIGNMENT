"Related to noteworthy people" is not a criterion, and no evidence that Cosmo has written about him has been presented. Perhaps he appears as a model in Cosmo ads? That is not notability. Additionally, the recreation of deleted content and the blatant <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>-gaming count against any leniency. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 04:43, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> by an astonishingly wide margin. No reliable sources (article is currently "sourced" by press releases and an entirely different person's IMDB entry, offered as someone Van Leer has "worked with"). The Cosmo exposure ("sourced" by part of a press release that does not mention Van Leer by name) was apparently some sort of "One hot guy from each of the 50 states" gimmick article so he was not the primary focus. His own resume on his <a href="http://www.blakevanleer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.blakevanleer.com/" rel="nofollow">personal website</a> notes that the highlights of his acting career include such pivotal roles as "Boy" in the West Nottingham Academy production of "West Side Story." Plus he uses way too much product in his clearly severely damaged hair, but I suppose that doesn't really have a bearing on his Wiki-worthiness. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:30, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I notice some sort of nerdy "rivalry" here between some kind of online gaming group (Shadowclan) and that guys that make this Blake Van Leer topic. To my mind that puts the legitimacy of some of the keep/delete votes in question. I have no doubt that quite a few of these delete requests are just being done to cause turmoil for instance. Personally I think the article should be given a chance to redeem itself as it does sound like there are verifiable claims of notability. The problem is just that the article needs time to be cleaned up. I say "Get a life!" to all those partaking in this online gaming feud. Drouillm 20:51, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not a online gamer at all (yep, believe it or not I've never played World of Warcraft&#160;:-P), so until the first deletion nomination, I had never heard of either of these gaming groups. Because I wrote a talk message on the original article asking if it was <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and suggesting moving it to user space, it ended up on my watch list.

<li><b>Keep</b> There clearly is evidence that he was not in an ad in cosmo magazine and was actually written about and listed with several other bachelors from each state. You can google the issue that he was in when you search 2003 cosmopolitan bachelor's November issue. However this was 4 years ago and I'm not sure if it's still noteworthy.

<li>As has already been pointed out, the much-vaunted Cosmo article, discussed at this <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_Oct_7/ai_108581053" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_Oct_7/ai_108581053" rel="nofollow">press release</a> linked in Van Leer's article, takes as its subject one bachelor from each of the 50 states. The press release for the article, which was called "Hunks Across America," lists 50 different names of people who appeared in the article. Van Leer is listed in one line as the hunk from Maryland. Even if this article is accepted as a verified reliable source (and I have no problem accepting it as such), Van Leer was <i>not</i> the primary subject of it. He was one of 50 subjects who, if this article was typical of articles of the type, had at most a single page and most likely a half- or a quarter-page as 2% of the article's subject. This does not come anywhere remotely close to satisfying the requirement that coverage of an article subject be non-trivial, and even stretching the point beyond all reasonable lebgths and counting this as one source, there do not appear to be any others. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:01, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>From what I understand your correct that Van Leer is listed among many. However each "hunk" or "bachelor" has a half or whole page with detailed information about them.

<li>Your accusation of sockpuppetry is cute, but I actually had the Blake Van Leer article watchlisted since Blake announced in the first nomination that he would recreate this article if it got deleted. Since he and his bunch were involved in AFD nomination of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowclan.html" title="Shadowclan">Shadowclan</a> article as well, new activity there from him also seemed likely.
