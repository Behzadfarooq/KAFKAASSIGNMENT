<p><i>Note: This list has been renamed many times and was AfDed without success under those other names several times. I'll link the discussions once I've found them</i></p>
<p>This list has certainly a noble intent, but it just didn't work as encyclopedic content. It has by now degenerated into a list of nearly everything, which can by linked to the word <i>cult</i> (in any meaning) by googling for primary sources. The immense effort some contributors put in this list, should be be redirected into adding specific, full-prose, verifiable statements about the <i>cultishness</i> of the groups in their articles proper.</p>

In addition, the list got worse, since the last AfD. At that time, a closely limited set of sources where used (which had its problem itself, but limited the amount of very silly list entries), now everything found with Google is fair game for inclusion. It's even hard to tell apart additions by User:Cairoi, who is thought to try mocking the list (in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>), from "serious" additions. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 10:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I readily agree that an editor has been overactive in adding new entries recently. That is not a reason to delete the entire article. In fact, there's an active discussion about splitting the article to deal with that issue.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If the list is in poor shape it is because it has been under what certainly appears to be a sustained and deliberate effort to push as many false negatives and false positives as possible into the list. Yes, this is the explanation for many of the bizarre entries such as "Chado, the cult of the the <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> Japanese tea ceremony" and "Psychology of the self (Jungian)", which are supported solely by the 'personal crusades' that JzG mentions.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- a POV/troll magnet if ever there was one. As stated above, just about every religious group has been called a cult by someone at some time, and there's no verfiabile, authoritative standard for what is and isn't a cult. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 22:17, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - inclusion is subjective ... if (insert name of theologian) calls "atheism" a cult or (insert name of atheist) calls "Christianity" a cult, (never mind that neither is a discrete organization) and some media outlet picks up on it, do atheism and Christianity make the list? What about Islam? <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Islam+cult" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Islam+cult" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> What about Bahai? Islam considers them to be a cult. Inclusion on the list is inherently subjective (aka POV) and, IMO, that has no place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:10, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> since I don't see anything <i>inherently</i> POV or OR about this. However, the list's references do need a very vigorous overhaul. Many of the entries assert that various publications have referred to them as cults without even providing a link or other information to verify it. So the article is in poor shape as it stands, but IMO the correct approach is to fix it up rather than deleting it entirely. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>POV is <i>not</i> <b>not</b> NPOV. Clearer: NPOV is achieved by accurately capturing reputable POVs not excluding POVs. Note that Islam isn't a cult, because it isn't unorthodox; it's well over a thousand years old.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 02:14, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It isn't unorthodox according to whom? And why does one thousand years matter? An unbiased reporting of someone's point of view is one thing. That's not a POV problem. But this isn't an unbiased reporting of someone's point of view. Rather, it's a biased reporting of someone's point of view. The requirement for inclusion given in the article is that a media source has referred to the group as a cult within the last 50 years and that the group has been in existence at some point within the last 150 years. Under that standard, Islam, Bahai, and the Roman Catholic Church all qualify. In a church I used to belong to, the pastor gave a sermon one Sunday called "How do I know if I'm in a cult" and one of the standards was that the organization does not recognize the Christian trinity. Well, just about any non-Christian religion would qualify as a cult under that standard. The fact that a subjective decision is being made about which groups to include (where does the number 1000 come from and how did you decide Islam is not unorthodox?) means that it is inherently POV. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:26, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These sort of criteria will have to be worked out and clearly stated by the editors of the article. It's not necessary to figure out every detail right here and now, that's not what AfD is about. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not asking to figure out "every detail" - I'm asking about selection criteria for a list ... that's a pretty BIG detail. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:02, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So include those, then, provided the sources meet whatever standards are decided on for that list. Of course it's possible to write a POV article by picking and choosing what to include, my point is that the article isn't <i>inherently</i> POV. It's possible to write it in an NPOV manner, and simply providing an example of how some particular version of it is POV doesn't change that. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I have edited this list for a long time and participated in some of the previous AfDs. My view is that the problem with this list and with many other lists in WP is the lack of consistency and the lack of a solid criterion or criteria for inclusion. Many lists in WP are sometimes used as subterfuges to bypass the Wikipedia content policies of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a>. I would encourage voters here to help make <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a> a guideline to avoid problems such as the one we have experienced in this list.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no better-sourced list in Wikipedia. Show me one which is more rigorous than this. If we delete this list, we should delete all lists. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 10:26, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The quantity and availability of sources is NOT the problem. The use of inherently subjective selection criteria is the problem. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:02, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And I would also add that having done a little work with the references to see how the current situation stands, I'm not tremendously impressed with them. If the article survives AfD I'm going to convert everything over to cite.php and I expect it'll bring to light a lot of very vague references (there's already a ton of nonspecific Washington Post refs I converted on my first run-through) and references to unimportant sources. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:00, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article is extremely biased to minority groups. It is a good example of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a> in listing opinions upheld by a majority of editors - as is mentioned above, inclusions of entries even though backed by sources were being removed time after time, dispite adhering to the inclusion criteria specified at the top of the article.

<li><b>weak delete</b> - Concept is not inherently POV, but it seems the criteria are inevitably POV. NPoV should be "List of cults according to authority X", but that would be copyvio. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 19:18, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>May I point out that the criteria themselves have been changed over time? Frankly, I'd <i>like</i> to see the criteria change to something more rational. However, what has not been addressed is the degree to which the current criteria were forced on the article as a poor compromise after the previous AfDs -- a compromise forced, in large part, by the same people who are now complaining that the poor criteria of the article are a reason to delete it on <i>this</i> AfD. (Frankly, I'm puzzled. Why does Pjacobi refer, above, to "The previous nominations, I've found so far"? Out of the six he lists, two of them are provably about <i>completely different articles</i> which happened to be of a similar nature. Of the remaining four, two shouldn't have been hard to "find", since in both cases, <b>Pjacobi initiated them</b>.

<ul>
<li>The list could be valuable, but it is the fact that the criteria do change over time that concerns me. Even "good" criteria are unstable. In most lists, the criteria for inclusion are part of the list name, or nearly so. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 02:53, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Important, and I imagine that many are interested in referencing a list of cults. However, the article should define the primary sources it accepts for inclusion in the list and why. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonger_f897.html" title="User:Monger">Monger</a> 19:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, clear NPOV violation. There's no method to find out if each single religious movement is a cult or not. So the only two available options are to delete the list or to allow everyone to include to the list everything they might call cult. -- 83.237.59.172 20:46, 11 June 2006 (UTC) <i>User's sole edit.</i></li>
<li>A limited point of view is still a point of view. I dunno...the title has the word "referred" to in it, so it sort of has that disclaimer. But the word cult is quite negative. I could go either way on this one, but I'll say <b>(weak) delete</b>, as it more accurately fits my current view on such things. --<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYossarian_a081.html" title="User:Yossarian"><span style="color:black"><b>Yossarian</b></span></a> <a href="../../../s/o/v/Image%7ESoviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG_ed0a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/3/3f/Soviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG/30px-Soviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG" alt="" width="30" height="15" longdesc="../../../s/o/v/Image%7ESoviet_Canuckistan_Flag.PNG_ed0a.html" /></a> 22:32, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> is not a POV word, it's a technical term.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is useless. Either the list can have a definitive non-POV criteria for inclusion or it should be deleted. As it stands now it is becoming listcruft, with editors adding entries rigfht and left just because a Joe Blow referred to a group as a cult.

<li>Comment: criteria for inclusion is currently not just any "Joe Blow" referred to group as a cult - basically "Joe Blow" has to be a journal or mainstream media. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 23:20, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>"If it couldn't survive as a category..." Well, see, we have no information that it <i>couldn't</i> survive as a category. The information that we have is that on one particular occasion when it was put to a vote, a majority of the very few people who knew about the vote said "delete". Since not many people have category pages on their watchlists and because category-for-deletion tags don't show up on anything the average reader sees, it's highly questionable to think that the few people who voted represented everyone who would have been concerned -- or even a reasonable sub-sample. By the way, isn't it ironic that the person attempting to get this list article deleted (who is also the one who initiated such attempts twice before that) was <i>also</i> the one who put that category up for deletion? And listed as one of his reasons that it couldn't do the job as well as a list could?
