<li><b>Keep</b>. It's more widespread than the article made it out to be. It's known (and played) in at least one other summer math program and several high schools, and has been around for several years. This article would not have been abandoned - I for one was planning to make additions to the page, which in my opinion would have made it less of a nontopic without substantial information. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESho_Uemura_8e10.html" title="User:Sho Uemura">Sho</a> 22:01, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Color or Country is a game I have known for two years, and I assume that it has been around for several years before that. Its lack of a clear way to force someone to lose makes it as much a joke as an argument about politics. It is sufficiently widespread for me to have met several people who have already heard of it, and it is certainly not just limited to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_USA_MathCamp_4278.html" title="Canada/USA MathCamp">Canada/USA MathCamp</a>. <a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYashabk_fe7c.html" title="User:Yashabk">Yasha</a> 22:49, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you had actually seen Bigfoot, yes. I think we can trust that the multiple Wikipedians on this page who have direct experience with the game are not malicious liars. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 01:30, August 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Something just occurred to me. I posted a description of the game as I remember it without having read the article, and it then turned out that I had correctly identified it. So even if you aren't willing to trust me to be honest on principle, it can be demonstrated that I wasn't lying about it being an actual game. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 01:34, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It looks like somebody already deleted the article out of process. If it described a game in which players take turns naming colors, and lose if they name a country, then it's a real thing, and we should <b>keep</b> it. I learned about the game three years ago, and have played it with several groups of people. In any case, the article should be undeleted immediately, so that we can deal with it properly. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 01:02, August 13, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is about a real game, popular enough that I have met people playing it on different continents.

<li><strike><b>Unable to tell</b>.

With major rewrite (by me, but still), article now contains much more information, presented in a much more organized and coherent manner. Although the notability test may fail on google (even with hits at <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1353595" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1353595" rel="nofollow">everything2</a> and <a href="http://www.mathcamp.org/hunt/2003/PieceOfRope.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mathcamp.org/hunt/2003/PieceOfRope.html" rel="nofollow">mathcamp</a>), this does not necessarily imply lack of notability, as other users have shown. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelso_ce03.html" title="User:Telso">Telso</a> 08:58, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Everything2 is sort of half-blog, half-wiki. Anyone can create any article with any phrase as a topic, including <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=849354" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=849354" rel="nofollow">May I suggest not getting married in West Virginia?</a> and <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1079449" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1079449" rel="nofollow">The British get freaked out by American nonchalance regarding capital punishment</a>. So the existence of an Everything2 article on a topic doesn't imply notability in any meaningful way. And of course Mathcamp.org knows about it if they invented it. However, the rest of the world does not seem to have taken any note of this game. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 09:33, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So you've now shown Color or Country fails the notability test on Google. But I admitted that. The point is that just because something doesn't exist on Google doesn't mean it doesn't exist (Google is NOT a deity). A number of Wikipedians from a number of different regions and schools in North America have heard of this game, and this is just the Wikipedians who noticed the article on VfD. With all the ones who missed it and all the non-Wikipedians who've heard of it, I think this easily implies passing the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability test</a> (which isn't policy anyway). In fact, neither is the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance test</a> (which it probably passes as well). The only policies that apply are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifibility</a>, which this passes considering how many people agree this is verifiable, and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a>, which this is not, again because many users agree this isn't isolated. Do I really need to search for less verifiable things on Wikipedia to handwaive my point, just like you did when you searched for inane things on everything2 to handwaive your (and my!) point? I may be a deletionist at heart, but this constant nitpicking is reminding me why I stopped watching VfD. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelso_ce03.html" title="User:Telso">Telso</a> 18:54, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm curious how you come to this conclusion. There are a bunch of people voting on this page, some of whom never went to mathcamp, who have heard of this game. I learned for this game back when I was in college at MIT six years ago. I didn't know what Mathcamp was and I didn't know anyone who had gone to Mathcamp. So it certaintly isn't a phenomenon restricted to Mathcamp. Do you seriously think we are all high school students enjoying our little joke? You seem to be attacking this with a vehemence usually reserved for pranksters and vandals. <a href="../../../c/m/o/User%7ECmouse_943a.html" title="User:Cmouse">Cmouse</a> 15:22, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I don't think you guys are pranksters, and if the page is kept I'll just shrug. But it really bothers me that there seem to be substantially zero webpages about it (and by contrast the equally silly game Mornington Crescent has nearly a thousand Google hits). People create webpages about almost <i>anything</i> at the drop of a hat... I've researched my share of highly obscure topics. It's all the more anomalous because it's a geek/nerd type topic, which are normally heavily over-represented on the Internet (a million pages for the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a> and only a handful on, say, ancient Persian poetry). It's a mystery I'd really like to clear up. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:03, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mornington Crescent is connected to a popular radio show. There are no pages dedicated to Mornington Crescent; all or most of the pages found by searching for Mornington Crescent are pages about the radio show, with Mornington Crescent a subtopic. Color or Country doesn't get on the Internet as much because it doesn't have that connection. Also, most people learn Color or Country by word-of-mouth, and so it tends to spread within groups that have ways to communicate other than web sites. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESho_Uemura_8e10.html" title="User:Sho Uemura">Sho Uemura</a> 23:02, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I too have met several people who know of this game, none of whom have ties to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_USA_MathCamp_4278.html" title="Canada/USA MathCamp">Canada/USA MathCamp</a>, proving that it is not limited to that camp.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It sounds just a little too absurd: a game that neither side can lose except on purpose. Who plays this and why? How about a game where you have to say a word, any word, and as long as you don't say the word "Wikipedia" nobody ever loses. Why on Earth would you play such a game? Is it a test of endurance, just to see who gives up first? Some major detail seems to be missing here. Or is the article just written badly and fails to explain properly? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:41, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The way people lose is generally by getting carried away, for example starting naming continents, whereupon someone says "Australia" and loses. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlatypeanArchcow_1412.html" title="User:PlatypeanArchcow">platypeanArchcow</a> 05:53, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>So Europe and Asia and North America are considered to be colors? Do people play this game sober? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:13, 13 August 2005 (UTC

<li>It gets zero (or one) Google hits. Several users here are saying they've heard of it, yet the most common test for noteworthiness comes up empty. See my comment below for the Google search link. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:36, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We've verified its existence, yet the most common test for noteworthiness fails us. Hmm, what could that mean? Perhaps we shouldn't be relying solely on a popular search engine? Wow, what a shock! <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 05:39, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I once saw somebody accidentally lose the game by saying "Spain." He was mocked thoroughly. Also, note that saying things that aren't colors or countries is allowed, so saying "Europe" has no effect on the status of the game. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 22:39, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have you ever argued over politics? Neither side can lose except on purpose. Why on Earth would you do such a thing? Is it a test of endurance, just to see who gives up first? The reason Color or Country is called a game is because it is for fun, not because it is some measure of skill. As a conventional game, Color or Country sounds rather silly: you can say "blue" each turn and not lose. However, one should not judge Color or Country as a game, but judge it is a phenomenon, a pastime, or an odd form of conversation. The fact that <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> asks why people would play this game, and the fact that many people <i>do</i> play it, should make it an interesting enough phenomenon to keep as an article. <a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYashabk_fe7c.html" title="User:Yashabk">Yasha</a> 19:10, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article as it was submitted to VFD was rather garbagey, but I removed most of the Mathcamp-specific stuff and cleaned up the wording. As long as the article doesn't imply that Mathcamp is the only venue for the game (which I thought it was before this debate surfaced) it is a fine little stub. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlatypeanArchcow_1412.html" title="User:PlatypeanArchcow">platypeanArchcow</a> 05:53, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not a joke. I've run into it in three seperate places at this point - one of which was MIT. I've heard of this game years before I had heard of mathcamp. <a href="../../../c/m/o/User%7ECmouse_943a.html" title="User:Cmouse">Cmouse</a> 06:25, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Anyways, the point is that there are several pages relating to the game high up on the list of hits, and I think that still stands. <a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYashabk_fe7c.html" title="User:Yashabk">Yasha</a> 18:02, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The now-defunct <i><a href="../../../m/o/p/MOP_af29.html" title="MOP">MOP</a> Literature Page</i> has documentation of it going back to 1997 (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970720103131/mail.med.upenn.edu/~freiman/FoGaHSMP.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19970720103131/mail.med.upenn.edu/~freiman/FoGaHSMP.htm" rel="nofollow">link at archive.org</a>. One reason why it may be hard to google is that, being a folk game, there may not be a universally accepted name. ("Color Country Game" gets four hits in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=2lL&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22color+country+game%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=2lL&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22color+country+game%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">a google search</a>, although all of them are associated with the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_Olympiad_Program_7643.html" title="Mathematical Olympiad Program">Mathematical Olympiad Program</a>, which I don't think has yet been mentioned as one of the number of math camps that foster this game. 69.204.162.12 19:44, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems the main argument for deletion is that the game is stupid. It is openly acknowledged that the game is stupid, and this has nothing to do with the worthiness of the article. Wikipedia has an extensive article on <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mornington_Crescent_%28game%29_7356.html" title="Mornington Crescent (game)">Mornington Crescent</a>, which is essentially the inverse of this game. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 06:29, August 13, 2005 (UTC)

Arguably, no matter how silly the game, there is a noteworthy social phenomenon associated with the "Mornington Crescent" game... at least noteworthy enough that people have bothered to make webpages about it.

<li>Very unlikely. The excluded pages were all human rights type pages ("without regard to race, creed, color, or country of origin") which would not mention the game.

<li>Your claim was that it is not notable because of the Google search that you posted.

<li>that's a good point. If you add a page for your drinking game and get 8 or 9 of your friends to come on the vfd page vouching for it, it would meet the standard that we're currently setting here. This of course begs the eternal question "how do we define notable?" If your drinking game became popular in your apartment building and 75 people played it, does that make it a "social phenomenon?" I am not a proponent of the google test mostly because of the insanely high false positive rate, but if something scores a big zilch, that's really saying something. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApollo58_818b.html" title="User:Apollo58">Apollo58</a> 23:38, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>What we have here is a bit different from "8 or 9 friends."

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I've never actually participated in a game, I've heard it referenced by multiple unrelated social groups in real life.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - I have scoured my address book for geeky friends who went to math camps around the country, as well as asked numerous acquaintances at MIT, and no one reports ever hearing of the game. I would argue that it is known only to a very, very small and insular social circle and probably treated as a joke even there, and hardly qualifies as a "social phenomenon." I played a bizarre card game in summer camp that some of my friends made up that was quite popular and if you looked really hard you could probably find 100 people with a dim recollection of it, but that doesn't make it a social phenomenon.<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApollo58_818b.html" title="User:Apollo58">Apollo58</a> 23:32, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't know most of the people here who know Color or Country (e.g. some are ten years older than me). That would seem to show that it's not restricted to an insular social circle.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I first encountered this game at the PROMYS program, and later at my high school, and later at several other programs. Arguments that the game is stupid are irrelevant, since the discussion regards the worthiness of the article, not of the game. The fact that people would play such a game at all is fairly surprising and interesting information. While this game is confined to a small culture, this culture consists of much more than Mathcampers. It tends to spread through various programs such as Mathcamp, CTY, Ross, PROMYS, MOSP, the U.S. Physics Team training camp, Clay Research Academy, and many others. However, it is not confined to those programs. It is fairly well known to nerds in many high schools who did not go to any of these programs. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathNerd_a40a.html" title="User:MathNerd">MathNerd</a> 03:28, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: At least something useful is coming from this VfD. I imagine that whoever originally posted the article, along with Rock Scissors which pretty much is non-notable, thought it was an isolated Mathcamp phenomenon. As a result of this discussion, various people have realized that their social group did not invent Colour or Country, and a lot of the history of a difficult-to-trace phenomenon has been traced. I guess VfD does generate some light along with its heat every once in a while. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 04:46, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Another comment</b> - I want to further differentiate this from Mao and Mornington Crescent, because in those games you can actually win. This game has no purpose other than to confuse newcomers, which is fine, but then it doesn't move beyond that. One can only lose, and if the newcomer isn't an idiot s/he will probably not lose. In mornington crescent, a quick newcomer can win in one move and the game ends. If the newcomer here passes the test, the game immediately becomes unfunny. Not that this has bearing on delete/keep, just saying.
<ul>
<li>Another difference is that Mao and Mornington Crescent have hidden rules. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 05:39, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Game might be a better comparison than those two, altho it isn't quite the same. But it appears to have similar difficulties with winning/losing, and doesn't have hidden rules. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMairi_7ec6.html" title="User:Mairi">Mairi</a> 05:41, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Blind, stupid persistence. Of course, you've got to be imaginative as well or the spectators boo you. I've played and won 4-hour games, but I've also had much shorter games with experienced players.
