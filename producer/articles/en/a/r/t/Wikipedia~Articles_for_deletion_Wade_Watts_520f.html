<li><b>Weak delete</b> for notability by association. Potentially, though, a state president of the NAACP may be notable. Not at the moment, mind you. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> for the reasons explained by JzG. I would be willing to reconsider if a) evidence of greater notability was presented and b) the efforts to turn it into a promotion for Johnny Lee Clary ceased. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:46, 27 July 2006 (UTC) <b>Keep</b> after JCarriker's revision, but I must observe that many of the sources used are of less than the highest quality, particularly the one which is a plain-text document saved as a Microsoft Word document. Since it shows itself within the first few paragraphs not to have been checked from grammar mistakes ("who's" when it should be "whose") I can't imagine that it can be considered a terribly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not consider any of the sources to be excellent, but I do feel that they are reliable and are all from publications. With the exception of the Newsweek story, I would not add any of them, to say George W. Bush or John Kerry, given the wide availability of source on both men. However, the amount of information available without original research on Watts is rather limited, I feel that in proportion to the topic and difficulty of finding source on him the sources are quite good. The sources also distinguish themselves in that, while there are some discrepancies between them they agree on the basics where their subject matter overlaps.</li>
<li>I do not particularly care for that source myself; especially the format the document is in. A <a href="http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/520.article.print" class="external text" title="http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/520.article.print" rel="nofollow">better-organized html version of the article</a> appears on the Florida Baptist Witness website. I chose the text document only because it is the original source of the article, but I have no objection to substituting the present version for the html one. The Southern Baptist Press distributes stories to smaller more localized Baptist publications, giving it a very high readership. In spite of the poor archive format and the grammatical error, I think that it can be considered a generally reliable source of information on an article about a Baptist evangelist. These types of grammatical errors are common in smaller publications, and while it may not inspire confidence, for it does not cast doubt on the content of the article just the grammatical compotence of its author. If you have deep concerns about any of the other sources, please bring them to my attention as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Info on talk page is material for an article. See Category:John Clary merge. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I had no trouble finding sources about Watts independent of Clary's website and have used them to expand his article, complete with inline references. This man served as the leader of the Oklahoma NAACP for sixteen years, and is respected by members of both the civil rights and Baptist communities. He was a major figure in the civil rights movement in Oklahoma. State wide figures are considered notable by wikipedia guidelines. It has been asserted on the article talk page that Watts was a member of LBJ's civil rights commisson. The only online source I found for this was Clary's website, a source that I chose not to use at this time, but I see no reason to question the veracity of the claim. Such accomplishments make him notable in his own right—his connections to more prominent people only makes him more notable and it easier to expand and reference his article. I'd like to ask those that have already voted to please review the current version of the article. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 19:58, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This man was very well known in the Civil Rights era.

<li><b>KEEP</b>Does it really matter if one promotes another? The Reverend Wade Watts was a civil rights activist and that in itself should be enough to keep the entry in wiki. H has done more for Black America than some other notable people. So I say keep the entry.

<li><b>Keep</b> - per above statement. Orangehead 17:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I feel that watts is a great man, look at the hatred made towards him and how he overcame. He has been an inspiration to many, including the former leader of the KKK Johnny Lee Clary, who says Watts was instrumental in his conversion to christianity and rejection of Klan policy. He is quite famous, but because it is pre Net days we must look deeper. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 07:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC) <i>Note: <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> (<a href="../../../p/o/t/User_talk%7EPotters_house_10fb.html" title="User talk:Potters house">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Potters_house_3c91.html" title="Special:Contributions/Potters house">contribs</a>) is the article's author.</i></li>
