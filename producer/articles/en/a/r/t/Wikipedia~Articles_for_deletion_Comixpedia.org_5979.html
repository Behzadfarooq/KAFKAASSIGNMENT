<ul>
<li><b>COMMENT</b> from author... <b>this is not a POV Essay</b>. The critical commentary in the article is intended to <i>document</i> the creation of a webcomic encyclopedia and the reasons for such a creation, not to <i>argue a point</i>. In fact, the article is not critical in and of itself, but rather <b>documents criticisms</b> that have been raised. This documentation takes the form of both paraphrasing and quoting cited sources. At no point does the article itself make an argument about Wikipedia. If it is interpreted as doing so, that was not the idea and I apologize. However, actually reading the article should show that this is the case quite clearly. Many of the reasons the Comixpedia encyclopedia was created had to do with the feelings of failure that existed in some way or another by members of the Wikipedian community in regards to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the idea of this site not meeting web standards of notability, please take into account the following:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>This comic encyclopedia is linked to by several pages in the Wikipedian webcomic project pages as an alternate venue for webcomic pages that are found to not be sufficiently notable for this encyclopedia.</li>
<li>This site is owned by Comixpedia.com, a site that is notable enough in the webcomic community to both have an Alexa rating of "181,818" and be listed in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The site has only been operational for 2 months, which serves to deter it from having a high Alexa rating.</li>
<li>The site was born out of criticisms raised by the writer <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Burns_704e.html" title="Eric Burns">Eric Burns</a> of the popular <a href="../../../w/e/b/Websnark.html" title="Websnark">Websnark</a> blog site. Both of which are listed in Wikipedia and are seen as notable in the webcomics community.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Additionally: As for the argument that this piece is "original research" article and fails to meet <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> standards, this is a baseless accussation. All the facts documented in the article are available at one of the following sources:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.websnark.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.websnark.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> and related talk pages</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These sources are cited in the article itself. Rather than hitting <i>delete</i> so early, why not suggest improvements to the article if you feel it is not adequate.</p>
<p>ALSO OF NOTE: the idea that this article is a copy should not be a problem under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. Obviously, I hope that this article will be added to by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">Wikipedian webcomics community</a>. Another idea: If you feel the article is not worthy on its own, it may be a good idea to <b>merge</b> the information contained in this article with that in Comixpedia.com's article, as the sites are owned by the same company... in fact, it appears someone has already created a section in that article for Comixpedia.org (not me), so perhaps this information can be <b>merged</b> and incorporated there if editors feel that this article is not worth its own page.</p>

<li><b>Abstain</b> - I'm ambivalent about whether Comixpedia.org is an encyclopedic subject or not, but this is, as written, overly self-referential to Wikipedia, as it seems to focus more on the controversy that lead to the creation of WebcomicsWiki than the actual creation and history of WebcomicsWiki. The POV issues can be fixed, but first the article needs to be rewritten to be more about the site and less about the (largely unimportant in a larger sense) controversy. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:27, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b>: Regarding your above comment... That has to do with the fact that the site has been up for only a short while. As the site grows, this will obviously (hopefully) be resolved. Also, as writing about the creation of the site would be undocumented-- THAT would certainly qualify as original research, and thus make this an unencyclopedic article. I tried to write the article using sourced material to avoid it being judged as original research and failing the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> provision. As I said, it probably makes sense to just <b>merge</b> this with the appropriate section in the Comixpedia article more than anything. I'd do it myself now, but I don't want to open myself to criticisms of running or whatnot. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 04:02, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Merge it into the comixpedia article as a separate section, having a .org and .com article, both run by the same company seems kind of superfluous.

<dd>I don't take anything personally. In fact, I didn't know that a .org section had been created in the Comixpedia entry when I created this article. Otherwise I simply would have added the info there. So, in fact, I agree that two articles aren't needed. What I do take personally is accusations that I tried to write a biased article or something. It certainly documents a bias, but I don't think the article itself is biased, and it does provide valid information about the reasons behind the creation of the WebcomicsWiki. Notice that the wikipedians who are real visitors of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> section of the site are the ones who are providing the most valid and knowledgeable discussion.

<li>I've replaced it with an NPOV-stub. Article space is emphatically not where we carry rants on Wikipedia guidelines. Do that either on the guideline's talk page or in your userspace. I nevertheless would <b>strongly delete</b> my own stub because it's a brand new website that has yet to meet any kind of notability bar. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:42, 15 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Once again, I would suggest you read the article. You emphatically argue that the article is a rant, I emphatically argue the opposite. The site was formed because of disagreement with Wikipedia guidelines. The original article documents that disagreement with cited sources and points to 2 outside articles. The original article does not attempt to say who is RIGHT or WRONG in the dispute. Also, replacing the article with a stub does not allow voters to see the original article. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 23:36, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I did read the article. I don't participate in AfD without doing so. And rewriting the article has turned into something that is at least not s writing out of someone's disagreement with a Wikipedia policy. Everybody has a history button, and is able to use it with a click of a button. It is everyday practise to rewrite an article during AfD, and is positively encouraged. As I said, such commentary on one persons view of a formative guideline belongs either on that guideline's talk page or in userspace. We avoid self-references in article space, and even if we allowed this one, it would be a hopeless POV article since it wouldn't include any other POV. If it did, it would immediately duplicate the proposal's talk page, so we go full circle. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:38, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to Comixpedia. Regarding Tedzee's precedent below, I actually think it's better to just say something was founded by disaffected Wikipedia members. If you have criticisms of Wikipedia guidelines in an article, you can't make it NPOV without including the other side also. And Wikipedia articles are not the place to argue about Wikipedia guidelines. Therefore I can't really see how to include the original discussion of concerns while keeping the article in line with Wikipedia policy. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:15, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
