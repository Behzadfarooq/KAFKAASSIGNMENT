<p>Person seems to be entirely fictional (hoax). I can find no reference to either the father or the son playing for watford FC - very strange indeed. Seems to be connected in some way to the <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Cashmore_06d1.html" title="Ian Cashmore">Ian Cashmore</a> article - unsure of reason <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 00:07, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - yes same author - Ian Cashmore seems to be real, his father seems to be real - his grandfather and greatgrandfather's career for Watford FC? Seems to be fictional. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 00:25, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The info sounds entirely plausible but given the near non-notability of the person, the author really has to give some citations or verification. Without that, it's impossible to judge the veracity. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 22:24, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Trefor Jones' <i>The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who</i> is probably as accurate as a stat book can be. The book references Football Association records, club records, various libraries and record offices, the details of various other club statisticians. No Cashmore is listed, thus we can say with 99.9% certainty that no such player played for Watford. So, with the various details of Dennis' life all non-notable, the only possible reason for a keep is the claim that he helped design Watford's Family Enclosure. I checked Oliver Phillips' official history, and the chapter on 1982-87 contains a single mention of a "new family enclosure in 1982." Still, whether Dennis designed it or not, that's not really a justification for keeping the article.<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 22:25, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Thanks for your messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can assure you that "this person" is certainly not a hoax, and I am just glad that his family have not seen this.</p>
<p>I am not sure why Denis is not listed in the current Who's Who, as he has been in previous editions. In fact Trefor Jones is actually related to Denis (his nephew), as his mother was Denis's sister. You can verify this be contacting Trefor Jones direct, or via the archives at either the Watford Museum or Watford Football Club.</p>
<p>Would it help if I can get a copy of a Watford football programme showing Denis? I understand why you have to be vigilant on which articles you include, but I can assure you that the information is 100% accurate. Moreover, would it be useful to get Trefor to write a corroborating letter, or have some input?</p>
<p>I actually represent Denis's grandson Ian Cashmore (Trefor would be his great uncle) for his tv and radio work, and he has asked me to deal with this for him, which is why I have made these posts on his behalf, but I have no problem asking him for Trefor's details, and for a copy of a programme if this is any use?</p>
<p>Please let me know what you need from me to resolve this.</p>
<p>PeterCarrig</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> A letter from Trefor would be classed as original research I'm afraid - are there previous copies of the who's who floating about somewhere? What we need is something like that from either Watford Football club or another media source that identifies him as a player.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Thanks for getting back to me so quickly Charlesknight!</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there are previous editions around. I am going to ask Ian to get onto Trefor (who will no doubt have copies of them all!!! And I will also ask him to get hold of a Watford programme if possible.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I might the club a call and see if they have something on file there.</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice, and I'll get back to you when I have more!</p>
<p>PS. By the way, I think HornetMike has misread the article, as it was not Denis who designed the Family Enclosure, it was his son Raymond (Ian's dad) who did this. It was part of a competition in the early 80's which Ray won.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, or smerge to the notable relative's page. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 16:10, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have now received a copy of a Watford football programme from Ian dated 30 Novemeber 1929 which shows D.Cashmore in the players lineup. I have posted a copy of the cover of this programme together with the players diagram and an enlargement of such.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been advised that Ian has spoken with his Dad who says he has many of Denis's Watford medals if you would like them to be posted here. Obviously that will take a while for him to do, but in the meantime hopefully the proof the attached programme provides will be of interest to you. Ian's dad is also going to contact Trefor, but since any evidence he can provide seems to "not be admissbale(!)" I am not sure what he will be able to offer.</p>
<p>Ian has pledged to check his grandfather's listing on here soon (as his schedule allows), and provide any additional dates / names etc which might be required. I have also just added more exact dates to the main listing.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, and I hope that this will resolve the validity of the listing.</p>
