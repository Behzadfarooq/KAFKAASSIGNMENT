He's label is 1389 Records. He's distro companies are bassivity and obese records...please feel free to look these up...aslo look up "sizzerb" which is his alias you will find 30 000 matches on google...this is absurd...then delete jr writer and whole dipset...how can we close this arguement</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b> - This seems to be nothing but a vanity/spam page. I took the liberty of inspecting the contributions of everybody who contributed to this page, and it appears that almost all of them have <b>only</b> contributed to this page (and a couple of off-shoot pages that are concerned directly with this rapper). Are all these guys working for the same marketing firm or what? I tried to google some information about this "famous" artist and only found this wikipedia page, mirrors of this wikipedia page, and a couple of minor blog entries. Is this guy really famous enough to merit his own article? Is he really that famous in Serbia/Canada? - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 05:50, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>"I tried to google some information about this "famous" artist and only found this wikipedia page, mirrors of this wikipedia page, and a couple of minor blog entries." um ok...here are a few i found when i googled it:</p>

<p>not everything is internet based as these magazine scans show and there are still 21,1000 matches on google for "sizzerb" as of right now, so therefore i don't think this is a spam/vanity page and should not be up for deletion. If you're not very familiar with the mixtape game you shouldnt be deciding whats "famous" and what isnt, you saying you only found wiki pages and blogs show you are clearing lying and hating and are probably friends with the guy who originally wanted to delete because you 2 have some sort of nerd alliance...anyway if you chose to delete this i will save the information i have showed and send it in an email to the wikipedia contact with LINKS after i have had a thorough amount of time to find everything related on this artists which will clearly meet the criteria and i will suggest to whoever appointed you admin to reconsider</p>

<dd>Please sign your comments with four tilde (~) characters (or hit the 10th button on the editing toolbar). Leaving off this important element on your comments (and the fact your are removing AfD tags yourself) makes you look like a newbie. And that brings me to my main point... why is it that all of the contributors to this article <i>only</i> make edits related to this musician? It makes it look like you're spamming.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, the fact that he seems to have appeared in several published works (and has a top 20 hit in Serbia) would seem to qualify him under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. But just for the record, most of those links are dead, make no mention of Sin, or are hosted by Sin's own site. Also, a #19 hit in a small county like Serbia does not a star make.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question here is whether or not this article is mere advertisement, or if it provides information that the general population might be genuinely interested in. This one seems to close for me to call, since I have never heard of the subject in question. (But then again, I'm not a big Serbian Hip-Hop fan ^&gt;^ ) Does anybody else have any comments about this (other than the people who have created this article)? - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 17:56, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have no idea but I looked at the history too and it seems to be quite a few different people editing the article. For example I corrected a few spelling errors of his projects and the name of his record label. Again you are telling me the links I posted are dead, well I just checked all of them like I did last night and no they're not and every single one of them has a mention of Sin. So therefore you are wrong on both accounts, again. And how can we have an intellectual debate when everything you say is simply not the truth? The one's hosted on his site are newspaper articles who's text you'd have to look up to find it on the web. Wikipedia does not have population guidelines of countries that make "stars". This is a joke, I suggest you educate yourself before you start trying to delete articles. Start by looking up rap on wikipedia then go ahead and look up mixtapes, then look up the american DJs hosting his mixtapes. You said yourself he qualifies under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. So it seems to me you are just either racist against Serbs or just have no knowlegde about the role mixtapes play in making rap "stars" as you call them nowadays.--Mistabusta 22:43, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>stop putting the delete notice on if you yourselves have no reason to delete it</p>
