<p>Ray of Light Theatre is a regional theatre company in San Francisco, CA. Founded in 2001 by Shane Ray, the small theatre began by producing a small eight person musical in a local elementary school with a budget of only $5,000. Since that time, ROLT has grown to become one of San Francisco's premiere local theatre companies. They produce Broadway style shows 5 times a year throughout San Francisco.</p>

<p>James Rhine was a contestant from Big Brother 6, coming in seventh place overall. During that season, he was a constant target, but proved quite difficult to eliminate, as he won more Veto challenges than any other Houseguest in Big Brother US History. James was often targeted because he was perceived as being deceptive, and his elimination occurred when the two opposing alliances in the house - between whom James had meticulously played the entire game - came together to eliminate him. Interestingly enough, James was never Head of Household during Big Brother 6.</p>
<p>Big Brother 7 brought a change to this trend, and - on Week 3 of this season - James won the HoH Competition. His original nominations were Will and George, but when George vetoed his own nomination, James made the controversial decision to put Jase up as a replacement nominee.</p>

FADE copy protection was created by Codemasters and introduced in thier game Operation Flashpoint. It is notable because when a pirated copy is detected elements of the game (accuracy, player damage) degrade. This strategy was employed to induce "pirates" to buy the game.</p>
<p>Some people say that FADE-like concepts are employed in Safedisk and SafeDVD protection schemes.</p>

<p>As the aircraft approaching the VOR ground station, the radials get closer to each other and the needle becomes more sensitive. Minor deviations may caused for adjustment in order to maintain the aircraft on the specific radial. More closer to ground station, the needle increasingly oscillates and OFF flag may momentarily appear. The TO/FROM display also will interchangably appears between TO and FROM, not sure whether the aircraft is coming to or going away from the station. The presence of these erratic indications occurs when an aircraft enters the area called cone of confusion, an area overhead the beacon. ICAO recommended that for propagation specifications, the signals required to be transmitted up to 40 degree in elevation. However, in the modern practice, most VOR ground stations capable of radiate signal of up to 60 to 80 degree above the horizon. But it still leaves gap overhead, in form of a cone where no planned radiation takes place. When passing through cone, the airborne receiver will comes under influnce of weak overspill signal, causing confusion to the indicators. The time aircraft will be inside the cone depends to it's height and ground speed.</p>

<b>Ehyeh</b>: the name of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> given to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> at the burning bush. Yeh, a contraction is used in 227 different names throughout the Bible as "Jeh." It was added to the name of Oshea by Moses in Numbers 13:16 to form Jehoshua (Jeh-oshua-Greek Joshua), the root of the name of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. Thus, the name Jesus, correctly Jehsus, would incorporate the Divine name.</p>
<p><b>Ehyeh asher Ehyeh</b> (I AM that I AM) was the full statement of God to Moses concerning his name. God said his name would be "Ehyeh" for ever (see Exodus 3:14).</p>
<p>Scholars are not in total agreement that Yeh should be rendered Jeh. Stating there was no letter "J" in the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> alphabet. However, it does appear the sound of the letter "J" was in use in Old Testament times. It certainly was in use in the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian.html" title="Egyptian">Egyptian</a> language that heavily influenced much of ancient Paleo-Hebrew. <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardic.html" title="Sephardic">Sephardic</a> Hebrew which appears to have deeper Paleo-Hebrew roots than Ashkenazi Hebrew, does employ the letter "J" sound as "jod," one of the three ways the letter "I" was apparently pronounced. The rule of grammar seems to be when the letter "I" is followed by a consonant it would be pronounced as "I" as in Israel. When it is followed by a vowel it can be pronounced as a "Y" or a "J" as in Judah. Thus, some choose to say Judah while others Yehuda. Indeed, professor <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Strong_ffa5.html" title="James Strong">James Strong</a>, expert in Hebrew renders Judah "Yehuwdah. (#3306)" We can see then the use of Ehyeh contracted to "Yeh" or Jeh was in wide use among the Paleo Israelites.</p>

<p>Graduated from the Royal Ballet School dancing the "pas de deux" in the second act of Aida at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.(Leontine Price as AIda) Joined The Royal Ballet in 1958 performing in all the reperoty of the period and the films made by Paul Cziner of that company. Later was principal dancer at the Stuttgart Ballet and FRankfurt and Berlin (1961-64). Due to injury stopped dancing but was mentored by Dame Ninette de Valois to continue developing as a choreographer and ballet master. She recommended him to the Shah of Iran where he became Ballet Master and Choreographer to the National Ballet.(1965) The Shah requested de Warren concentrate on developing a national organization and performing group that would preserve all Persian tradition in ethnic, courtly ans mystic dance traditions. He created the Mahalli dancers of Iran that toured the world as ambassadors of the Iranian culture. They performed for president Ford in Washington for the Bicentennial Celebrations and toured the USA several times. De Warren was appointed "Master of the Dance" to the Court. In 1976 the warnings of the impending revolution brought him back to Britain where he became the artistic director of NORTHERN BALLET THEATRE. His work brought that company to the forefront of British companies with heir touring program surpassing 200 performances a season. They performed regularly at the Sadler's Wells Theatre and the Dominion Theatre in London. Princess Margaret became their Royal Patron and Rudolf Nureyev, who had met de Warren earlier, became a permanent guest artist and accepted the title of "artist emeritus", a distinction no other company could boast. Nureyev recommended de Warren as Director of the Ballet at La Scala, Milan, a position he held for many years. He updated arcaic working methods and increased performancers from fifty to one hundred a season. He invited an international roster of guest choreographers and ballet stars from both sides of the Atlantic. He was also artistic supervisor of the La Scala Ballet Academy and founded the Pre Professional College which still runs today. He joined Sarasota Ballet as Artistic Director in 1994 and retires in June 2007 after 50 years as a professional in the Dance World. He has choreographed over 65 works which vary from purely classical and narrative to quite unexpected combinations of ballet and circus celbrating the Ringling, Barnum and Bailey's Greates Show on Earth, which was originally based in Sarasota, and LAST CALL, based on Jack Dowd's celebrated sculpture will be his last work for the 2006/07 season.See www.robertdewarren.org</p>

<p>The March 1980 crash of a Soviet-made Ilyushin 62 Polish jetliner and the deaths of 31 Americans including a 22-member U.S. amateur boxing team with several U.S. Olympic team candidates. Preparedness was a factor in the dental team's ability to resolve many notable and unexpected problems. Jurisdictional restraints that Polish authorities imposed on the U.S. investigative team hindered its efforts to identify American passengers. The team used dental and fingerprint methods of identification whenever possible and obtained further evidence from anthropologic methods, visual recognition, and personal effects. Dental readiness, organization, methodology, and lessons learned are documented in this paper.</p>

She has been nominated for Canadian Comedy Awards for her work in improvised theatre and has also done a fair amount of work producing comedy shows and improv festivals in her hometown of Toronto (notably, the catch23 Tournament of Wonders, catch23 Improv, &amp; Comedy for the Snobs).</p>
<p>Aside from live theatre, Johnson has done sporradic work in independent films. Some titles include: Secondary High (2002); The Water Game (2002); The Affected Turtleneck Trio (2001); I'm Not Martin! (2000); and Uranium (2004).</p>

She does, however, publish her own zines and underground comics, reviewes of which pop up in Canada's Broken Pencil Magazine from time to time.</p>
<p>The Sweetie Pie Press, run by her with a loose affiliation of collaborators, is the small independent press Johnson runs to create and dirtribute her zines and comics. The Sweetie Pie Press is also the banner under which she creates crafts, 1" art buttons and other small objects for sale through independent craft fairs throughout North America.</p>

<p>"In 1970, after receiving her diploma from the School of the Syndicate Chamber of Parisian Couture, Fashion Designer Adeline Andre entered the House of Christian Dior as assistant to Mr. Marc Bohan for the Haute Couture collections. On August 27th, 1981, Adeline Andre registered the pattern of her "three sleeve-hole" garment at the I.N.P.I. National Institute of Industrial Property in Paris and on February 26th, 1982 at the W.I.P.O. World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A "three sleeve-hole" garment is also part of the museum collection of the F.I.T. Fashion Institute of Technology in New-York. Adeline Andre's first show, ladies ready-to-wear collection for fall-winter 83/84, was held on March 16th, 1983 at the Daniel Templon gallery. Staged within a grand painting by Gerard Garouste, the guests, wearing the collection, posed for giant polaroid shots. Up until March 1987, Adeline Andre presented her collections in places that had never before been used for fashion-shows, like the "Grant Salon" of the International Conference Center where the Treaty of Paris was signed, putting an end to the Vietnam War for example.</p>
<p>In these places, she presented her collections on models such as Anh Duong, Angela Wild, Dovanna, Terry Toye and Eugenie Vincent, whom she asked to mingle among the guests, creating a calm and intimate atmosphere as opposed to the podium shows of the time.</p>
<p>During the furor of padding and stretch in the fashion world, Adeline Andre presented tall and slender shapes with slight and svelte shoulders in fluid materials such as, silk crepes, wool satins, fine cashmere cloths--always dyed according to her personal colour range and also knits with rolled hems.</p>
<p>During the following years, she concentrated on creating designs for her private clientele, male and female, for whom she produced new made-to-measure collections, displayed for the first time at "Top of wear" parties, travelling private presentations in galleries, workshops or the salons of her friends in either Paris, London or New-York.</p>
<p>In 1994, Adeline Andre moved into her atelier-boutique at 5 Rue Villehardouin, in the Marais, the old Paris quarter near Place des Vosges. As well as her ready-to-wear collections, each season, since 1995, she has presented a Couture collection.</p>
<p>Since May 1997, Adeline Andre is an invited member of the Syndicate Chamber of Parisian Couture. As part of the Haute Couture shows organized by the Syndicate Chamber, she presented her fall-winter 97/98 Couture collection, on the 7th of July 1997, at the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art and her spring-summer 98 Couture collection, on January 19, 1998, at the "tepee" of the Georges Pompidou Center.

<p>In August/September 2006, GLEN (Global Education Network of Young Europeans) organizes a Europe-wide campaigning tour through several European countries in order to sensitize a wide European public, and particularly European youths, about our responsibility for global development. The project will consist of seven public events in seven European cities (Riga/Latvia, Krakow/Poland, Olomouc/Czech Republic, Bratislava/Slovakia, Sopron/Hungary, Munich/Germany, Strasbourg/France). Organizations and activists involved in development issues and interested young European citizens will discuss about challenges of global development, such as reduction of poverty, prevention of HIV/AIDS, sustainable development etc., and about the development policies of the EU and the countries where the project takes place. A group of young campaigners will link these events by traveling from one city to another by hitchhiking. On their way they will gather opinions from car drivers and an interested public about the discussed global issues and will provide them with further information. Extensive media coverage about the project will furthermore contribute to the goal of awareness raising. A main focus of the campaign will be the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which are the framework for the current EU development strategies.1 At present around 88% of the European population has never heard about the Millennium Development goals.2</p>

<p>The main goal of the project is to promote the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a common European responsibility and to involve young Europeans in a dialogue about global development.</p>
<p>According to the main objective, the objectives of the project are: 50 young Europeans from at least 7 European countries have organized a common campaigning tour through 7 European countries in 7 countries a public event has taken place where the tour participants, young local citizens, local activists, and public decision-makers have discussed the Millennium Development Goals as a common chance of European cooperation. media in the 7 countries have, by reporting on the project, contributed to inform a wide public about the MDGs and issues of global development the European network of organisations conducting the project (GLEN, its partner organisations and its young volunteers from at least 7 countries) was strengthened by a common, Europe-wide activity</p>
<p>According to the main objective the target groups of the project are: young activists and “not yet activists” in the 7 countries involved – to be reached at the local events and by media work decision-makers and future decision-makers in the 7 countries involved – to be reached at the local events and by media work a wider public (such as car drivers and the local population in the cities where the events take place) – to be reached by the hitch-hiking campaign and by actions around the local events and media work</p>

<p>Each involved GLEN partner organization will organize one event day, so a total of seven event days will take place:</p>
<p>23 Aug 23rd: Opening event in Riga, Latvia 27 Aug 27th: Event in Krakow, Poland 29 Aug 29th: Congress in Olomouc, Czech Rep. 31 Aug 31st: Event in Bratislava, Slovakia 2 Sept 2nd: Event in Sopron, Hungary 4-5 Sept 4th-5th: Event in Munich, Germany 7-8 Sept 7th-8th: Final event in Strasbourg, France</p>
<p>At all seven events, the MDGs are discussed in a public forum through presentations, workshops, and discussion forums. The Eurizons campaigners will meet interested young citizens, local NGO activists, but also political decision-makers in these discussion events. Furthermore, colorful activities such as photo exhibitions, movies, games, concerts, theater, and further campaigning actions will be organized by the local support teams and by the hitchhiking campaigners in order to raise awareness about our responsibility as Europeans in a wide public. In each city one main topic will be discussed (e.g. gender, migration, HIV/AIDS, reduction of poverty, sustainability...), so the whole European tour gives an overview of the variety of the challenges of global development. Advertisement over newspaper articles, e-mail newsletters, posters and flyers will promote these events trying to attract around 100 participants at each event. In total around 700 Europeans will therefore be involved in the project through the events in the cities alone. Around 50 young activists from the seven partner organisations organizing the events will be involved in the preparation of the tour and the events. The tour will culminate in a two days closing event in Strasbourg, during a plenary week of the European Parliament. It is planned to engage in a dialogue with European Members of Parliament and with representatives from the Council of Europe at this occasion.</p>

<p>50 young Europeans from 7 different EU countries will travel in mixed international tandem teams from station to station, campaigning on their way. The hitchhikers will take part in a multipliers seminar two months before the tour starts, where they will be trained in appropriate methods of awareness raising and where they will develop creative campaigning actions together. By performing the hitchhiking tour as a race between the campaigners and by conducting campaigning activities on the road, they will attract the attention not only of drivers on the road, but also of media. A car/van will accompany the tour, carrying media equipment and other materials, being available for campaign activities on the road or in gas stations and, if necessary, to pick up delayed campaigners. Assuming that each of the 25 tandem teams will use around three lifts each time between two stations (the average distance between two stations is around 400 km), the group will have the opportunity to discuss with around 75 drivers on each trip. In total, around 450 drivers from different backgrounds and from different countries will be interviewed about their opinion on European and national development policies, which will be explained by the hitchhikers. This discussion promotes a dialogue both between different nationalities and between generations (young campaigners driving with adult drivers) and supports a common identity as Europeans, as the involved people have to position themselves as Europeans within a global context. Why hitchhiking? Hitchhiking connects European people from very divers backgrounds who would otherwise never meet. Traveling together in the same car is a good setting for intensive exchange. Being free of charge, hitchhiking stands for solidarity and independence and therefore is attractive for a wide range of young people. It is also a good means to address issues of global development, e.g. global economy (production of cars within the globalised economy, economic interdependencies…), European policies (agriculture, transports, migration policies…), sustainability (ineffective use of cars, limited resources, CO2 emissions, Kyoto protocol…) or global solidarity (sharing resources, international cooperation, common interests…).</p>

<p>The named activities should contribute to the following results: Through the discussion events in the cities a truly European dialogue about Europe and the Millennium Development Goals has been facilitated between young activists, to-be-activists and decision makers. Through the tour and the campaigning activities around the discussion events, a wide public has been sensitised for their responsibility as European citizens for global development. Intensive media coverage has raised public awareness of the mentioned topics. Through the common campaigning activities around 50 young Europeans have developed awareness about the differences between the involved European countries concerning both the acceptance of the European Union and their views of the Global South. The experiences gained throughout the project have strengthened the European partner network of GLEN and have created a deeper understanding about the involved organizations and their approaches. New ideas have been elaborated for further activities within the network.</p>
<p>The achievement of the goals will be documented by documentation about the 7 events in 7 cities a list of the campaigning participants of the whole project tour reports from the hitchhikers on the website and in the documentation, signatures or a short questionnaire from the drivers media reports about the project and hits on the website pictures, films, reports and other documentation material</p>
<p>The evaluation of the project, according to its planned objectives, will follow the overall monitoring and evaluation standards of the GLEN network and additional requirements of the donors for the project.</p>

<p>Lockeland Springs is in East Nashville, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, roughly between Gallatin Road and Shelby Park, Eastland Ave and Shelby Ave. There are over 1500 households in the neighborhood. The neighborhood association was formed in 1978.</p>
<p>In 1786, this land was granted by the State of North Carolina to Daniel Williams, in payment for service in the Revolutionary War. The first house in the area was the log cabin Williams built on the site of the present Lockeland Design Center. Later, country estates dotted the landscape: Lockeland, Lynnlawn, Edgewood, and Springside, to name a few. Subdivision of these estates began in the 1870's, and the building of the Woodland Street Bridge in 1886 and the introduction of electric streetcars spurred suburban development. By 1890, electric streetcar lines linked east Nashville with downtown. Prior to this, only the wealthy could afford to commute from their estates to the other side of the Cumberland River. Access was further facilitated by the construction of the Sparkman (Shelby) Street Bridge in 1909. Lockeland Springs was annexed to the City of <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville.html" title="Nashville">Nashville</a> in 1905.</p>
<p>The Lockeland Springs Neighborhood Association is a progressive organization that has worked to improve and promote our historic neighborhood and to protect the quality of life for our diverse group of residents. In years past, the LSNA has sponsored many events, including landscaping projects at Lockeland School, Holly Street Firehall, and the East Branch Public Library; numerous neighborhood tree-planting days, alley clean-up projects, and twenty annual Christmas Tours of Homes. The LSNA has donated funds to start an historic preservation collection at our neighborhood library, spearheaded the organization of a PTO at Lockeland School, and formed a Neighborhood Watch Program for its eleven hundred residents. Meetings are held on the fourth Thursday of every month, and include speakers on such topics as East Nashville Development, greenways and parks, school issues, and historically appropriate landscaping.</p>

<p>Vezon is the mysterious seventh Piraka. He was with the others when they found Makuta's armor in Mangaia, the gateway to Metru Nui. There, they all learned of the Mask. But Vezon abandoned the group and went to Voya Nui on his own. When he arrived, he did all that he could to get the Mask without the Matoran seeing him. He figures that if he was seen, the Matoran would tell the other Piraka when they showed up. He made it to the Mask of Life, but did not have to fight Umbra. When he touched the Mask though, he was fused to the back of an enlarged Fenrakk Spider. The Mask was also fused to the back of his head, but he could not leave. Vezon is now the final Guardian of the Mask of Life. He carries the Spear of Fusion, which can fuse two beings together and defuse them again.</p>

<p>Fenrakk is an enlarged Fenrakk Spider for Vezon to ride. He was enlarged by the Mask of Life. Most of his powers are given by the Mask, therefore are not his own.

<p>Llanllyfni is a largely Welsh-speaking former slate quarrying village in the county of Gwynedd in Wales, and the Anglican parish covering several other villages in the Nantlle Valley (Welsh: Dyffryn Nantlle). The parish church is dedicated to St Rhedyw, as is an ancient well that has been used since pagan times that stands behind the church. St Rhedyw's Day is celebrated on July 6th every year with the holding of a funfair on the village's playing field, which at one time used to be a major event where farm-hands were hired for the coming year. The village has suffered greatly at the hands of poverty and depopulation, and the only remaining retail business is the local public house, the Quarryman's Arms.</p>

<p>Harry Hemmendinger (1915-2003), American color scientist.</p>
<p>Hemmendinger's work in color standardization and measurement established him as one of the world's preeminent experts in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_science.html" title="Color science">color science</a>. After graduating from Harvard and Princeton, Hemmendinger joined the U.S. Navy and worked in submarine warfare research. During his service, he met his future business partner Hugh Davidson. After the war, both men worked in general physics at <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Aniline_%26_Film_31fa.html" title="General Aniline &amp; Film">General Aniline &amp; Film</a> Corporation, where they became increasingly interested in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorimetry.html" title="Colorimetry">colorimetry</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_theory.html" title="Color theory">color theory</a>. Their first contribution to the field was their development of the Automatic Tristimulus Integrator, the first device to enable rapid automatic measurement of <a href="../../../c/i/e/CIE_1931_color_space_7885.html" title="CIE 1931 color space">XYZ values</a> of the color spectrum.</p>
<p>In 1952 Hemmendinger and Davidson left General Aniline &amp; Film to form Davidson and Hemmendinger. Their first succesful product was a colorant-mixture analog computer, COMIC, introducted in 1958, the first automated color matching system. Hemmendinger also evaluated colors for the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munsell_color_system.html" title="Munsell color system">Munsell color system</a>Munsell books, and his contributions are still used as standards.</p>
<p>In 1967, Hemmendinger and Davidson developed COMIC II, a digital version of their earlier color matching computer. Shortly after this, their company was sold to Killmargen and combined with their Macbeth Instrument Development Laboratories. Hemmendinger left Kollmorgen in 1970 and formed the Hemmendinger Color Laboratory, a consulting firm specializing in colorimetric and spectrophotometric standards</p>
<p>Hemmendinger received the Godlove Award from the Inter-Society Color Council for his work, and frequently consulted with the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Bureau_of_Standards_1592.html" title="National Bureau of Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a>.

<p>Hans Christian Korting (*March 21, 1952, in Tübingen) is a German dermatologist and allergologist.</p>
<p><br />
Korting studied medicine at the Johannes-Gutenberg-Universität Mainz from 1970 to 1976. In 1977 he obtained his M.D. degree there. From 1977 to 1979 he was trained in medical microbiology at central medical services units of the German Army (Bundeswehr). He was trained as a dermatologist at the Department of Dermatology and Allergology of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in München (Germany). In 1985 he obtained his post-doctoral degree (Habilitation). He has been working there ever since, currently as a professor and Academic Director. The focus of his scientific activities is on the characterization of the development of localized fungal infections of the skin and related mucosal surfaces. He concentrates on secreted aspartic proteinases of Candida albicans as virulence factors and toll-like receptors as relevant mediators of the inflammatory host response. It is his prime concern to develop active pharmaceutical ingredients for the treatment and prevention of fungal infections reflecting the increased understanding of pathogenesis. Moreover, he is interested in the development of new biological drugs such as plasmin as well as small molecules which are capable of influencing inflammation in the context of signal transduction such as sphingosine-1-phosphate. He has been awarded several scientific prizes, among others he has obtained the Paul Gerson Unna-Preis of Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft as well as the prize for promotion of research of Deutschsprachige Mykologische Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>He is working on the board of several scientific societies, in particular for Deutschsprachige Mykologische Gesellschaft as well as Gesellschaft für Dermopharmazie, or Society for Dermopharmacy, which has been co-founded by him. He is the editor or co-editor of a series of biomedical journals, among others mycoses, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents and American Journal of Clinical Dermatology as well as Hautarzt.</p>
<p>Prof. Dr. Hans Christian Korting has published more than 300 scientific articles and 16 books.</p>

<p>(Government College, Mangalore ) Dakshina Kannada is a district known well over for the high value it places for education and intellectual progress. This was witnessed even way back in the 19th century. In 1864, the impart of education in the only English school in Dakshina Kannada was the German Basil Mission School which was more religious than secular. Hence was conceived the Provincial School.</p>
<p>The Presidency town being far away from Mangalore, the benefits of higher education eluded the eager learners of the district. A committee comprising of a few citizens--- M/s M. Ramappa, Srinivasa Rao, I Ramachandryya, N Gundu Rau, N Thimmappayya, Sadat Khan, C. Rangappa, Narayana Pai, and T. Muthuswami Aiyar, collected an endowment of Rs. 65,000 and in September 1866, under the recommendations of Mr. Powell, the Director of Public Instruction and sanctioned by the Government, the Provincial School opened from class 1 to Matriculation; the F.A. course was introduced in 1868.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that from its very inception with 315 pupils, this institution has been “open to all classes of the community without any distinction of caste or creed”---- a dictum that holds its strength even to this day. However the travails had only just begun. After being housed in a rented building it was only in 1870, after overcoming a great deal of struggle and controversies did the school establish itself with a building of its own and with a European graduate from Trinity College Dublin, Mr. Ormsby, as the head master.</p>
<p>The institution was on the path of progress- a compound wall, a garden well laid out, introduction of classical languages in the curriculum from the 5th to the 8th classes. Care was also taken for the welfare of teachers.</p>
<p>Around 1875, many administrative reforms were introduced to all Government schools--- promotions were regulated, Attendance of students strictly enforced and regularity was insisted upon in the collection and remittance of fees. Alongside, in accordance with the Government orders, which asked for uniformity between Madras and Bombay presidencies in 1879, the Provincial School was designated the Government College, Mangalore. The lower classes were gradually abolished and transferred to the Municipal Middle School, Mangalore.</p>
<p>The struggle ensued in the growth of an institution is visible right through, even in the history of this college. At times, even threatening the very existence, were almost successful proposals of handing over the institution to private management. Nevertheless, the college continued to hold its ground. The government decided that for the cause of education in the district, which should not suffer, the college would continue as a government college.</p>
<p>In the meantime, efforts were on to start B.A.classes in this college. Many of the students being poor, were unable to go to Madras to continue with their studies. In 1872, for the first time and 1884, subsequently strong recommendations were made by the Director of Public Instruction, to start degree classes in this college; both attempts being unsuccessful.</p>
<p>These disappointments however, did not slacken the continuing efforts to improve the quality of education. The formation of a Reading room, a newspaper club for the students were the first inclusions for a development that went farther than mere curriculum subjects. Lack of funds, which as we all agree, a torturous factor was no different even then. It frustrated development, dampening the enthusiasm of well-meaning headmasters. Out of this, rose the idea of self-financing, though to a very tiny extent. For the first time in 1896, voluntary subscriptions were initiated from students to provide them with facilities like the Reading room and a Drillmaster. The want of funds nevertheless continued to hinder the fruition of many new ideas.</p>
<p>In accordance with the wishes of the subscribers of the Endowment fund, hitherto all headmasters of the college were European graduates. Towards the end of the 19th century with the transfer of the headmaster, the Director of Public Instruction expressed the opinion that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A native would do very well as the college has shown as good record under a native as under a European headmaster".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also felt that importation of a European into the Provincial Educational Services would deprive a native of a step in his promotion and this would not only cause hardship but, importantly, would also create discontentment among the Indian teachers. Therefore, henceforth-Indian graduates also took over the mantle of headmastership.</p>
<p>The turn of the century saw the first lady students enter the portals of this institution in 1902. It was on the 18thMarch 1905 that the institution celebrated its first Annual Day- The College Day- setting the beginnings of a new vibrant tradition continuing even to this day.</p>
<p>The college continued to tread well on its path to progress with a steadily increasing student strength, infrastructure strengthened in the form of buildings, books for the library, a compound wall; the intermediate replacing the F.A.course, initiation of a student council, a well equipped library, considered the very best of its kind in the west coast, the burgeoning of various associations, the Dramatic Society and the Scientific Society being the first among them. Under the college activities, the mock parliament was an important innovation. A portico was constructed and a garden with a fountain enhanced the beauty of the place. Of course heartaches abounded with continued rejections for upgrading the college, threats of closure, stoppage of development works and the ever-present fund crunch.</p>
<p>The 1920s saw a surge of academic and cultural activities under the dynamic stewardship of G.K.Chettur, an academician and scholar par excellence- The College Karnataka Sabha, the Malayalam Association, The Students Co-operative Stationary Society, a Pupil- Teacher Association to name a few. ‘The College Times’ a weekly wall magazine is a literary milestone of the college. Started with an intention to bring out the hidden talents of the students this turned out to be a highly potent forum for a student’s expression of creativity.</p>
<p>The Government College Miscellany, the brainchild of G.K.Chettur, was a journal reflecting the richness of ideas of the students and teachers of the institution. The Miscellany was honoured with contributions by well wishers unconnected with the College. Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore’s poem “ Tumultuous Years”, a message sent to the College in 1933 can, without doubt, be considered a feather in the Miscellany’s cap.</p>
<p>That the norm of the education imparted to the students of the college did not limit itself to the curricula is quite clear from the debates conducted by the college student Union. Topics of social importance and issues highly relevant to the times were discussed and debated upon with seriousness.</p>
<p>The Institution has always been cognizant of the fact that the students are most important and naturally therefore, follows their mental, intellectual social and physical development and achievements. To this end, Government College, Mangalore did not hesitate nor lag behind in instituting scholarships to encourage and prizes to reward their endeavors. The Provincial Scholarship, The Old Boys’ Scholarship, The Scholarship for the poor, to name a few, along with prizes for achievements for academics and sports were generously awarded to Students.</p>
<p>In 1948, after long years of agitation, the Government College, Mangalore was raised to first grade status. B.A, B.Com classes were started and the high school and model training sections were handed over to the Department of Public Instruction. The institution had stabilized itself as an Intermediate and first grade college, and life seemed to go on without much changes. The tutorial system continued as in the previous years; a Social Service League, started a year earlier, continued to extend its services towards national interests, and the various associations continued their activities with fervor. The Mock Parliament, which had ceased its activities, was restored during the 1950s.</p>
<p>With the reorganization of states on linguistic basis, Dakshina Kannada was integrated with Mysore. In 1957, The Government College was affiliated to Karnataka University and the Pre-university course and the first year of the three-year degree courses of the university were started. Subsequently, the college was affiliated to the Mysore University. The study of Hindi, Mathematics and a classical language was made optional. During the academic year 1959-60 the B.Sc course was started and new courses in B.A offered. To house the departments of Chemistry, Botany, Zoology and Statistics, a new science block was constructed. To commemorate hundred years of this glorious institution a centenary building housing the sciences was constructed. Yet, the travails of a growing institution continued to impede a steady upward climb. Economic crisis was an impediment to the rapid improvement of infrastructure. For lack of student strength, the Home science and Malayalam departments were closed.</p>
<p>The year 1993 saw this historic institution open yet another chapter. With a view to giving the students of this coastal region better opportunities, the Mangalore university took over this college from the government. On 7th March 1993, Government College Mangalore was renamed University College. The pre-university course was delinked gradually and today this institution, which started in 1869 as a school , stands as a first grade college.</p>
<p>Since then can be seen rapid growth in many spheres. While subjects like Geology and Statistics had to be discontinued for lack of demand, Microbiology,Computer Science and Computer Applications were introduced in keeping with the trends of the times and the needs and demands of public.</p>
<p>The college today is concerned with the educational and developmental needs of the lower middle class strata of society—a line of thought with which this institution was conceived in 1866.</p>
<p>Tradition is still very important to us, as is modernization. This is evident in a myriad aspects of the college. Keeping in tact the culture and ethos, which evolved through the years, is a challenge well and sportively faced by all—the staff and the students. The various associations continue with their activities with enthusiasm, though in a couple there are changes in nomenclature, the fundamentals being the same; The Dramatic Society of yester years is today the Fine Arts Association while the Social Service League is today the N.S.S. The Co-operative Society continues in its endeavour to provide affordable and convenient services to our students. Our wall magazine, now Prathibha Taranga, continues to draw creative talents.</p>
<p>Physical education continues to be a priority. Our students----a studious, ambitious, conscientious lot---- also evince keen and active interest in sports and games. A new State-of –the-Art Gymnasium was opened in 2003, only so even our students have an exposure to the latest in the field.</p>
<p>Our library can be considered an apt symbol of a blending of all that has passed, that exists and that is still to come in this institution. Today the library can boast of a collection of over 60,000 books spanning two and a half centuries. To give our students better facilities and a conducive atmosphere, a new library building was constructed and open to use in 2000.Cognizant of the changing world scenario, University College endeavours to help the students of this institution keep pace. However the institution still holds strong, the mission with which it was founded.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES From its inception with 315 pupils, the college has been open to all classes of the community without distinction of class or creed. MISSION &amp; GOAL</p>
<ul>
<li>To cater to socially and economically underprivileged sections of society.</li>
<li>To bring about an overall development of students--- academic, physical- and inculcate social awareness.</li>

<p>LIBRARY Our library is one of the oldest in Dakshina Kannada , housing over 69000 books . it is a matter of honour for us that our library contains books published way back in 1824, which we have treasured even today. The library has been shifted to a new building in 2001 for better facilities, which was made possible with University and UGC assistance.. computerization of the library is one of the immediate projects on the anvil Rs..70,000 has already been sanctioned towards this from the university. Under the UGC X plan Rs. 71,976 has been utilized by the library towards books and journals and the University contributed Rs. 50,107 for the purchase of books and journals in 2003-04. Computerization: Introduction of new software i.e. ‘Libsys’ during 2003-04 has begun a new era. Books accessed during 2004-05 are fully computerized and titles acquired earlier are being done so.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-02_5d1c.html" title="Edit section: NirmaLabs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NirmaLabs</span></h2>
<p>NirmaLabs, the most recent initiative of Nirma Education and Research Foundation – NERF, is an incubator to spawn High Tech Knowledge based Wealth Generation ventures. The basic idea is to identify individuals with technical knowledge and experience, bring them to NirmaLabs campus, and groom them to evolve project plans for high tech wealth generation ventures. Such projects and teams will then be seed funded and incubated to bring the concept to venture fundable level. NERF is putting in the initial seed fund.</p>
<p>This initiative of incubating individuals by NirmaLabs, is different in the sense that it will invest on persons rather than on their current ideas.</p>
<p>Nirmalabs will adopt a multi stage process namely -select -groom –team -incubate -spawn -grow. First we will promote the concept to attract the best people to consider NirmaLabs. The selection will involve filtering process through assessments based on the application write ups, series of tests, personal interviews, and brainstorming sessions.</p>
<p>NirmaLabs approach weighs heavily on systematically grooming of the selected individuals to</p>
<ul>
<li>Think differently,</li>
<li>To aim big, with</li>
<li>In depth understanding of - technology, and of High Tech markets</li>
<li>In depth understanding of how to evolve breakthrough innovative approaches to creating new value propositions</li>
<li>And developing sensitivity and understanding of what it takes to build of high growth businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The grooming exercise will culminate in each participant developing a business plan which will form the basis for selection for incubation. All incubated projects will be assigned a mentor. And powerful network of Torch Bearers and Role Models will be available for them to tapp to refine their ideas and edges.</p>
<p>To do this effectively, NirmaLabs will operate in specified focus areas to provide the necessary synergetic ambience and environment for venture creation in technology driven – high growth areas. While ICT is the area of initial focus, subsequently, other high-tech areas like biotechnology are on the anvil.</p>
<p>NirmaLabs is a not-for-profit Section 25 Company set up by Nirma Education and Research Foundation (NERF). NirmaLabs has been established with an objective to nurture talented individuals in their pursuit of high-tech, knowledge-based wealth generation. NirmaLabs has a corpus of over Rs. 5 crores earmarked to incubate promising individuals and projects. The Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, has decided to support NirmaLabs as one of their Technology Business Incubators.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley Ecosystem: Now in India</p>
<p>NirmaLabs is recreating the same ecosystem, right here in India. Our unique “groom-incubate-grow” program is designed to transform outstanding individuals into Global Techno Entrepreneurs. NirmaLabs will initially focus on the ICT sector, but will expand to other emerging areas like biotechnology and life sciences.</p>
<p>The program begins with identifying the right minds - individuals with technical knowledge, experience and entrepreneurial aptitude. In addition to “Direct Candidates”, “Corporate-sponsored Candidates” are also encouraged to apply. Selected candidates go through a specially devised three-phase program. There is a provision for concurrent incubation and grooming for individuals / teams with ready business plan.</p>
<p>1. Groom Individuals &amp; Form Teams</p>
<p>During the first phase, you will be groomed to identify and germinate an enterprising idea - by inculcating a detailed understanding of hi-tech markets, emerging technologies, and the mechanics of a high-growth business. During this phase there will be an opportunity to form teams of individuals with complementary skills.</p>
<p>2.Incubate Projects</p>
<p>The second phase involves incubation of the project idea, wherein you / the team will get the opportunity to evolve and develop a value proposition and transform it into a fundable enterprise, by interacting with torchbearers, mentors, and venture capitalists. NirmaLabs will provide sustenance and invest a seed capital to the tune of Rs. 20 lacs in the project.</p>
<p>3. Start-up Company and Grow</p>
<p>The next phase is a spin-off of the project as a start-up company with venture funding. NirmaLabs will then be involved in further growth of the company by continually providing it with opportunities for strategic networking, reality checks, and exploring new horizons.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, within a period of about 30 weeks, you have the opportunity to be on your way to become a Global Techno Entrepreneur, with a large equity in your own sunshine venture.</p>
<p>Approach revised to encourage individuals / teams with ready Ideas / Business Plans</p>
<p>In response to requests from individuals / teams who may have ready ideas or business plans for early incubation, we have created an opportunity that would accommodate such cases. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>individuals or teams with ready ideas or business plans</li>
<li>teams with complementary skills</li>
</ol>
<p>We have revised our approach to now provide for evaluation of teams and incubatable business plans every 10 weeks during the 30 week grooming programme. Once approved, the incubating project team can pursue incubation and grooming concurrently. This also makes the project eligible for early seed funding of upto Rs. 20 lacs and monthly sustenance of Rs. 8000/- for every team member.</p>
<p>This implies that while attending and participating in the grooming activities is mandatory and first priority, such individuals / teams could be permitted to utilize on an average upto 4 hrs per day in working on their incubated project. No out station travel would be encouraged for this purpose during the grooming phase.</p>

<p>Gossiping is something most girls deal with,they have probably both dished out and recieved some. If you are one of the girls who have experianced both you will understand how bad you feel after you have talked about a dear friend.Or how bad you feel after finding out something a friend has said about you. I am admitting that i have talked about my friends and i am reading books to get better at stopping.If you are insterested in these books look for "make it real" by point of grace to help you though your habit.In this book it says God gave girls the gift of gossip for a reason in him it is called sanctifies gossip this means you should use you gift of the mouth to spread the right word not the wrong one .What i mean about the right word is the scripture. When jesus rose from the dead three women witnessed the angle in the tomb to spread the news not three men . So please you your gift of gossip in the right way the sanctified way.</p>

<p><b>Montreux</b> first was formed when Darol Anger, formally of the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Grisman_eb63.html" title="David Grisman">David Grisman</a> Quintet, met with <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Ackerman_e2c1.html" title="Will Ackerman">Will Ackerman</a> (former President of Windham Hill). He recorded on Will's Album <b>Passage</b>, and Will, impressed by his work, asked Darol to record an album in his own name. Darol met with Barbara Higbie and made their first album: <b>Tideline</b> on the Windham Hill label. Meeting critical and commercial success for its blend of <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical.html" title="Classical">classical</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk.html" title="Folk">folk</a> elements, Darol asked longtime friends and DCQ colleagues Mike Marshall and Todd Phillips to join the duo. Andy Narell also stepped in as steel pan and percussion performer for Montreux's first album: <b>Live From Montreux</b>, named as the <b>Barbara Higbie/Darol Anger Quintet</b>. Mike and Darol made a duo album on the record label, <b>Chiaroscuro</b>, where Michael Manring, a session player for Windham Hill and frequent collaborator with other Windham Hill Artists, including <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Hedges_cfc0.html" title="Michael Hedges">Michael Hedges</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_de_Grassi_57a4.html" title="Alex de Grassi">Alex de Grassi</a>, joined them.</p>
<p><b>Montreux</b> continued to make two more albums as a band: <b>Sign Language</b>, and <b>Let them Say</b> (featuring percussionist Tom Miller). <b>Sign Language</b> was nominated for a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> for best <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a> song: <b>To Be</b>, written by Higbie.</p>
<p>In 1991, after 9 years, the group decided to split to persue their own solo carreers. Since their split, the memebers continue to have successful carrers in the music business. Marshall and Anger created a bluegrass group, Psychograss, on the Windham Hill Label, and, though they have since moved from Windham Hill, Psychograss continues to perform together. Anger also created The Turtle Island String Quartet and Marshall created the Mondern Mandolin Quartet, both on Windham Hill. Higbie and Manring released some solo albums on Windham Hill as well. In the mid 1990s, after Will Ackerman sold Windham Hill to <a href="../../../b/m/g/BMG_0403.html" title="BMG">BMG</a>, the members created their own record labels and continue to record on them. Some memebers still express desire to reunite and perform again, though the goup as a whole has not reunited since their split. Marshall and Anger continue to perform together as a duo, and with other artists (including <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bela_Fleck_9d77.html" title="Bela Fleck">Bela Fleck</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCandless_471e.html" title="Paul McCandless">Paul McCandless</a>, Phil Aaberg, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Grisman_eb63.html" title="David Grisman">David Grisman</a>.

<p>Bornean orang-utans (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) also known as the red ape, or the 'old man of the forest', are said to be the largest of all arboreal (tree-living) mammals. Typically, they have a long-haired coat which is of a red/brown colour and, like humans, their molar teeth is covered with a thickened enamel. The Males characteristically possess a large throat patch and large cheek pads.</p>

<p>They inhabit and are found in Borneo, Asia, and their habitat consists of the canopies of Borneo's tropical rain and swamp forests. Their lifespan in the wild is approximately 45 years or more. The Females can weigh up to 45kg, while the males may weigh as much as 120kg. The essential component of their diet is fruit, and they especially favour the durian fruit which is known for its foul smell. They are also found to feed on insects, small vertebrates, leaves and bark.</p>

<p>Adult male and female orang-utans are mainly solitary and are diurnal and arboreal. It is known that in captivity, female orang-utans have given birth at as young as seven years old, whith gestation lasting for 244 days. Usually the female orang-utans will give birth to one offspring every 8 years, thus equating to 3-4 young in their lifetime. Females will travel with their young until they reach adolescence.</p>

<p>Due to extensive deforestation of their habitat and through land conversion to palm oil plantations, orang-utans are now classed as Endangered with an estimated of only about 50,000. Even now, young orang-utans are still being captured for the pet trade. The major problem is due to their long birthing intervals, thus making it very diffcult for the orang-utans to naturally absorb even small population losses.</p>

<p>Josef Marais and Miranda were balladeers. Both immigrants to the U.S., they met during WW2 while working at the Office of War Information. They pooled their musical talents, fell in love, and built a strong and dedicated marital and musical partnership. They first presented their artistry to the rather specialized audiences who attended New York folk music clubs such as the Village Vanguard. However, their popularity quickly grew, not just in the U.S. but worldwide, and resulted in a loyal following that has persisted from 1945 to the present. Their repertoire encompassed an eclectic selection of folk ballads, art songs, indigenous music, and original compositions, sung in both the original language and the English adaptations of Josef's arrangements. Whether they performed a song that was original or traditional, their presentation was utterly unique and their style completely their own. Their voices blended masterfully with Josef's guitar and baroque viols, while Miranda often provided rhythmic accompaniment on indigenous instruments. Together, they unerringly conveyed their joy in music and their zest for living. Josef and Miranda performed for their enthusiastic fans in typically sold out halls, large and small, all over the world. Their broad appeal drew high accolades from a variety of fans. Press releases and reviews supporting them can be found on their website www.maraisandmiranda.</p>

<p>The Drive at Five is the segment on the station that plays songs for people on their way home from work.

The Lead-Foot Alerts are generally phoned in by people that have just recieved a speeding ticket. There is also a clip played ~15 minutes into the The Drive at Five from that morning's BOB &amp; TOM Show.</p>

This job title limits what the person can do medically and have to be supervised by a paramedic. Usually after a few years a Technician will be promoted to a paramedic. The pay is also slighlty less.</p>

<p>Environmentalists are stumped to discover that in the past 6 months, the population of elephants, across Africa, has tripled. That's right, tripled. It is a population explosion that shows no signs of slowing. The population increase was first noticed by scientists about 10 years ago, but Al Gore was skeptical that these findings were accurate. As it turns out, it was an inconvenient truth, for preaching environmentalists. Their population is growing at more than 175%! That's growing almost as fast as ExxonMobil's profits for 2006. Signed, a Colbert National.</p>

<p>Born February 31, 1982 John Koyish was destined for greatness. Because of his Mexican-Irish heritage he was often referred to as Mr. Koy-irsh. After college he started his life as a destitute network engineer working for Global Linking Solutions in what would be considered by many, the begining of the end for Mr. Koy-irsh. When he was not being subject to the constant verbal and physical abuse of his co-workers he could be found in his cubicle crying and wondering where his life had taken such an unforunate turn of events. He would often think to himself that perhaps he was Adolf Hitler in his pervious life or maybe Ghengis Khan aka Temujin. It is said that when he has passed away the world will enter into a state of mourning and great suffering that shall last between 20 seconds to 20 years. One can only wonder if this is true.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a little known fact is that Koy-Irish is fatalistically an avid fan of the Atlanta Falcons. When others show him the error of his ways, he rebutts with what can on</p>

<p>Super8 is a brazilian pop/rock band who was formed by high school friends Alex Tamulis and Marcelo Bohrer in São Paulo, in 1999. They invited friends Cristiano Colela (bass) and Guilherme Aguiar (drums) to join the band. In the beginning, things were pretty difficult for the band. They built their own studio and recorded their first demo, containing 8 songs. They saved money for the mixing and mastering, and the results pleased the band. They sent the demos to famous producers such as Nilo Romero and Paul Ralphes. In the beginning of 2004, they recorder their first album, entitled "Super8", with Nilo Romero producing the album and Antoine Midani mixing it. The album was recorded at the famous studio "Nas Nuvens", in Rio de Janeiro. The producer presented the final work to different labels, but no answers were given. The band decided to keep on raising funds and recorded the video for the song "Pensando Bem", which was broadcast on MTV Brazil. Super8 opened shows for Kid Abelha and Skank in Mogi das Cruzes, a small town in the greater São Paulo area, and it helped the unsigned band to promote their album. Drummer Guilherme Aguiar decided to leave the band, and GG replaced him. The video featured the new drummer, and consequently all the following concerts during the years. They continued to perform through 2005, but Alex decided to quit to pursue solo interests, and the band went on hiatus, without confirming the break-up. They affirm they will return the activities in the future and they still have the same goals that got them started.</p>

<p>Carol Wayne (born 9/4/1942 in Chicago,IL USA) an actress known for her comedic portrayals of dim-witted buxom sexpots, began her show business career as a teenage figure skater in the Ice Capades along with her brunette younger sister Nina Wayne (9/18/1943). The Wayne sisters later became showgirls of The Folies Bergere in Las Vegas. Carol followed Nina to Hollywood in the mid 1960's and the sisters began appearing in TV shows of the era. Nina co-starred in the short-lived sitcom Camp Runamuck as girl's counselor "Caprice". Carol did TV guest shots on I-Spy, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie (as dim-witted popstar "Bootsie Nightingale"), Love American Style, Emergency!, The Fall Guy, and became famous for her 100+ appearances (1971-1982) on The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson in his "Art Fern's Tea Time Movie" sketches as the Matinee Lady. Carol was married three times. Her second husband was rock and roll photograper Barry Feinstein (the father of her only son Alex) and her third husband was television/film producer Burt Sugarman, who produced the gameshow Celebrity Sweepstakes on which Carol often appeared. Carol's film appearances include The Party (1968) directed by Blake Edwards, and Savannah Smiles (1982). Carol was close friends with comics Pat McCormick (her co-panelist in the 1984 TV special Best Chest in the West) and Richard Pryor. Carol was replaced in the Tonight Show Tea Time skits by actress Teresa Ganzel in 1982. In 1984, Carol declared bankruptcy, posed for Playboy in the February issue (her measurements: 39C-24-35) and was seen in her final film, Heartbreakers. In January 1985, Carol and her companion Edward Durston vacationed at the Las Hadas Resort, where Carol drowned under mysterious circumstances in the shallow bay waters of Manzanillo, Mexico. She was pronounced dead at age 42 on Jan 13, 1985. Her companion Durston had returned to Los Angeles without Carol days earlier after a reported argument. An episode of Mysteries and Scandals on E! network (episode #111) covered the career and death of Carol Wayne. Nina Wayne had a daughter Jessica with John Drew Barrymore (father of actress Drew Barrymore) and retired from acting.</p>
