<li>I do appreciate that you and Rodney are artists, but to be featured in Wikipedia you need to pass the test of <i>notability</i>.

<ul>
<li>The reference I cite is for sure not Dr. Chang's website, Dr. Chang's website is only the source where you can find the link to proven third party evidence. Dr. Chang is known as a web historian. It is one of his foremost goals to give evidence. Look up the weblinks too for third party evidence. One more thing: if you refer e. g. to a press article you have to scan this article, right? And for sure you show this scanned article on your website. How else should it work? Of course this article then is shown on your website but nevertheless <i>is proven third-party evdidence</i>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 14:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This is simply false. There are dozens of links clearly providing third-party evidence. Of course they are often to be found on Dr. Chang's website! Where else and why not! He provides every visitor with evidence by giving the link to the documented third-party facts. If one scans a document she or he gets from a third party and links to this document on his website within his website it is nevertheless a third party document. I just want to make it clear that a third party document is a third party document not matter where it is shown. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 16:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Pygoya and myself founded the Webism Group of Worldwide Artists after our 1st real life European art tour in 2003. Of course we work together. We work together for global culture, peace and understanding. We have reached quite notable results as you surely found out. We are more than 50 worldwide artists, some of them at Wikipedia already. I put the article "Pygoya" to Wikipedia because he simply should be in with his 10 degrees, including 2 doctorates, honorary professor, NBC Real People Show, inclusion in Ripley's, Who's Who, his art on show around the globe in museums and galleries, etc. etc. He's also a digital art pioneer, ask <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Gartel_78cc.html" title="Laurence Gartel">Laurence Gartel</a> who's in Wikipedia. Everybody could have put him in with his acknowledged merits. So why not me. I just point to the facts. What about a broader audience for this entry so I do not need to give further explanations. To me it would be in no way understandable if you wouldn't let him in. And this not because we work together but because the facts speak its own language.<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 17:38, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please note that this is not about "letting him in". Please read the guidelines provided. The article as it stands will either be deleted, or it will need to be cleaned up as per Wikipedia guidelines. The article of <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Gartel_78cc.html" title="Laurence Gartel">Laurence Gartel</a> id a good example of a simple and straight-forward biography, although it lacks references for some of the assertions made.

<li><b>Delete</b>. <s>Suspicious keep</s> This definitely seems to have started out as a vanity puff piece; and it still needs substantial cleanup to reach encyclopedic tone. It's pretty clear that Artingrid is closely associated IRL. And the number of anonymous votes here sure suggest sockpuppetry (poorly executed, since anon votes should/will not be counted here). However, there appears to be at least a claim of genuine notability in having displayed at a number of museums of worldwide reputation. Seems to get some mention in indexes of artists online, e.g. <a href="http://www.americanartists.org/art/artist_detail_321.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanartists.org/art/artist_detail_321.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.artmajeur.com/pygoya/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artmajeur.com/pygoya/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, both of which appear to be independent sources rather than ones controlled by Chang or direct friends. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:53, 13 January 2006 (UTC) <i>Followup: Unless or until someone else provides verifiable links to the museum exhibitions claimed, I'll trust Jossi's below judgement about the non-verifiability of theses shows.

<dd>Well, Like I say, it's a pretty weak keep. But the several stated showings at known brick-and-morter museums and galleries seem to give Chang the nudge. Not to slam-dunk notability (a group show isn't <i>that</i> hard to get), but to the minimual standards I have in mind. But if his works really did appear at "Bronx Museum of Arts in New York (1987), Shanghai Art Museum (1988), Holter Museum of Art (1990), Tartu Art Museum in Estonia (1990), the Las Vegas Art Museum (1990), and the Vienna Museum Complex (2003)." that seems notable to me. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 22:07, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am really trying hard, to see if indeed Mr. rtChang passes the notability test.... but the more I research these exibitions the ony thing I encounter are self-published accounts of these.

<dd>Actually, I did so initially too, but you separated the portion of my comment with the signature from the initial part.

<dd>Also: Read Wikipedia welcomes unsigned comments too if in good faith.</dd>
<dd>To make it totally clear who Artingrid is:</dd>
<dd>Ingrid Kamerbeek, Bahnhofstr. 7, D-87527 Sonthofen/Bavaria/Germany, artist.</dd>
<dd>Want to know more? Ok, look up my website.</dd>
<dd>Just search for Ingrid Kamerbeek in Google.</dd>
<dd>Pygoya lives on the other side of the world: Honolulu, Hawaii.</dd>
<dd>Working together on a worldwide scale with and for artists has nothing to do with the fact that Pygoya with his acknowledged merits belongs to Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Whatever they might state their names to be in the outside world, if they do not have WP usernames, they do not have an established WP reputation. Specifically, such anon IPs are often used by "meatpuppets"... people recruited by interested parties solely for the purpose of a particular vote; and as such are not counted as votes among the Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 22:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - If 10 degrees including 2 doctorates besides many other worthy proven achievements are regarded as not notable what else is notable! For sure Pygoya is a computer art pioneer and distributor on the internet. His art is logically developed from the classical board image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enormously risen prices for participation in art fairs and exhibitions is doubtlessly one aspect of Pygoya's efforts to establish art soleyly created by changing pixels to art. This way global culture and exchange is made possible for any artist around the globe at low cost. Press reports give evidence of high interest in digital art. Pygoya on his website presents a great resource of third-party confirmation of his achievements and activities. Digital art is a medium which without the internet wouldn't have come true. And it might be destiny that this is a fact also with Wikipedia. arno signarowski 13.01.2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 217.253.170.158 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.253.170.158_2d2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.253.170.158">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Rodney Chang "Pygoya" has been displaying his artwork on absolutearts.com since 2002. Pygoya has been a regular contributor to the absolutearts.com blog forum since 2004. His efforts as an artist are matched also by his commitment to unify artists around the work for better promotion and creation of exhibitions regardless of an artist's physical location. absolutearts.com can verify that Rodney Chang "Pygoya" is a computer art pioneer.

<dd>With all due respect to the above anons, obviously friends and/or associates of Mr. Chang, and non-withstanding the fact that Mr. Chang is an artist, please note that the criteria for notability of a person for their inclusion in Wikipedia is quite specific. Please read Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. Concerning absoluteart.com, that in itself is not a mark of notability, as there are hundreds of artists in this and many other art websites. There are hundreds of thousands of digital artists that may consider themselves pioneers, but that is not sufficient, I am afraid. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> 17:44, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So - if one of the largest, oldest online portals for fine art is not a creditable source to vouch for a computer artists notibility, who is? "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field". Rodney Chang "Pygoya" falls in this catagory, in my opinion. ALSO - I think you may find that he also could be considered as one who has "A large fan base, fan listing or 'cult' following".

<p>According to Wikipedia guidelines the admin who votes for deletion of an entry should not be the same who decides. And especially not in your case because you do not look at this article from a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 22:53, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fear no more ... as the nominator of the AfD, I will not close it. Another admin will. And BTW, I am as neutral as it can be... I never heard of Mr. Chang until a few days ago when came across this article while doing RC patrol (recent changes patrol against vandalism of Wikipedia). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> 23:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, just for clarification of the above said: it gives a false impression. Of course unintentionally, right? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 00:23, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The admin who closes this AfD will be someone uninvolved with the voting. That's how these things are done. Some neutral admin will look through AfD votes that are a week or so old, count up the votes (including discounting anons or brand new accounts), and decide what action is appropriate. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:07, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Thank you both, Jossi and Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters for your explanations. I am totally sure that nobody who does research work on the internet as you surely do and moreover somebody who calls himself a digital artist who comes across digital artists and art sites all the time can "avoid" to know Dr. Rodney Chang (Pygoya) because he is everywhere on the web. There are also links to his website from the articles Jossi initiated at Wikipedia and carefully watches. Just some thoughts... I have many more...<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> 00:23, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you accusing me of something? That is indeed preposterous. I have never heard of Mr Chang, Webism or Artingrid until a few days ago when someone added a long piece of material to this article and it lit up on my RC patrol console as possible giberish addition by an anon IP. Now, you can believe that or, not. That is your prerrogative, of course. In Wikipedia we ask contributors to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 01:15, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
