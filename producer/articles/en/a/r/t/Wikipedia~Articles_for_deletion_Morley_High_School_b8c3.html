<li><b>Comment</b> I understand you wish to keep it based on the fact that it is a school article <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a>, but calling this a "nice article" is a stretch. If I may quote: <i>"Also there has been a crack down on fatty and high in sugar foods and fizzy pop and fast food cannot be purchased. However the overweight community of the school has gone on strike saying that they cannot deal without coca cola and fatty foods through out the day."</i> We don't need more poorly written articles like this... We need decently written, factual articles. I slapped a cleanup tag on this for a reason and as I said above, I implore those interested in retaining school articles to clean this up because the article is a mess.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, it's pretty easy to single out the worst line in an article and say it should be deleted. I prefer to look on the bright side with sections like <i>In July 2001 the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_Council_2fc4.html" title="Arts Council">Arts Council</a> awarded the school the Artsmark at the Silver level. The school was one of only three in <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> and 13 in <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> to be so recognised. Morley High School is a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_school.html" title="Specialist school">Specialist Technology College</a>.</i> I would also point out out that the nom did not complain about the writing style. If the issue is cleaning up the article, rather than "notability", it would be far easier to start with tags and the talk page, rather than AfD. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:25, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment from Nominator</b> - The reason I did not complain about the writing style was that it wasn't the writing style that bothered me. It was the fact that the school appears to have nothing more notable than an "Artsmark". The school my adopted son goes to is a Business and Enterprise College. Does that mean that <b>it</b> qualifies for an entry here too??? I think not... <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Thor Malmjursson</a> 22:20, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I never said anything about deleting this based on the fact that it is poorly written <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a>... I never said it should be deleted at all. I'm merely saying that calling this a good article is a stretch and in fact it is a pretty poor example of what a school article should be. For the record, I did tag it &amp; post on the talk page since <b>I</b> am the one complaining about how it was written, not the nominator.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 22:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: (i) I said "nice article". I see six good lines of text, therefore I stand by that comment. We need more articles that start that way. Anything objectionable, perhaps the line you singled out, probably took 5 seconds to remove. I hardly think it worth talking about, because our only concern should be the validity of the topic. Furthermore, as a rule, I do not enjoy criticizing other people's contributions, nor do I view AfD as the right forum for content complaints - at the very least, the article talk page should be used first. For all I know, fatty foods may have been an issue that received media attention in connection with this school; (ii) nominator should submit an article on son's school. Even better, get son to write it. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't criticize because I enjoy doing it... I'm simply pointing out when an article is substandard. Regardless, someone cleaned the article up rather nicely, maybe because they saw the talk page, maybe because they saw the comments here. Either way the article is much improved, which is the end result I wanted to see.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 00:21, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
