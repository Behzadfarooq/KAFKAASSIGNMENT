<li><b>Merge</b>- Wikipedia should have a list of films with the most expletives in. Although this would be less accurate it is a more interesting statistic.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This is the third time this has been nominated over the years, and the article still has the same problems. It isn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> <i>per se</i>, but it is <i>unmaintainable</i>. Any verification of (or addition to) the article requires sitting through a each movie and counting how many times the word "fuck" is used.

<dd>Well okay, but I don't see why getting into this level of movie trivia is doing something better than other Almanacs. Added to that why limit to this word? I imagine there are plenty of words more shocking to hear in films today. Maybe we could have List of films ordered by uses of the word "cunt" or List of films ordered by uses of the word "kyke". If rarity matters maybe List of films ordered by uses of the word "quincunx". All of these could be verified in similar ways, checking scripts etc, but that doesn't mean any of them would be definitively correct as there are many scripts that get filmed out there. Especially when you include non-US English language films.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 17:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>To Early To Decide Yet</b></s> Given that this page was actually meant to document a current event, I do not believe that this would qualify as a violation of any of wikipedia's policies.

On a side note, my request has since been fulfilled, thus illustrating a perfect example of rational behavior in a matter of controversy.

2) Does Wiki want to record its own edit wars, and is it able to sufficiently objective in doing so&#160;?<br />

<dd>I'm not denying there's no material to write about. I'm just saying, do we need the posterity to remember some insignificant editorial squabble again? "The great big Wikicorporation coffee room penny jar squabble of February 2006", this time about a twenty-coin bill, oo? I've been reverting vandalism and stuff like that for a while now, and I sure won't write articles like "Vandalism of Wikipedia article on Endless Online". Nobody wants to hear how I get up at the morning, look at watch list, and revert trolling, or get bored at 3 am and revert the vandalism as it comes. People are grumbling about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a> article being retained, not to even mention crying for merge for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29_8987.html" title="Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)">Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)</a> - and this was a case that got international media attention! The issue is not that you've not been studying the thing hard enough; the issue is that edit/revert wars happen here and they are pretty insignificant in the face of great cosmic scale or some other funny expression like that. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:23, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mythology? No, there is definitely an "English race." I hesitate to say "race" because we sound like we're talking about racism here, which this is not a discussion of, but there are uniquely English aspects to England that do not involve borrowing from other countries, including ethnicity and names. Your own narrow view that England has no culture and no heritage is itself POV; this article is (now) not. There is a "native" population of England just as much as their is a native population of Scandinavia - would you include Mohammed on a List of Scandinavian given names because there are a few Muslims in Norway named Mohammed?

<li><b>Comment</b>** Out of interest, of the "approved" names left on the list, of the 13 male names, 4 are English forenames, by which I mean derived from Anglo=-Saxon; 8 are "imported" from non-English languages (French, German, Old Norse etc) and one - Lincoln - is a surname reused as a given name - and if that sort of name is to be counted, the list is potentially infinite. Of the 18 female names, again, 4 are of Anglo-Saxon origin, 8 are non-English, and a depressing 6 are surnames recycled. On this showing, I think I am forced to conclude that pro tem this is a bit beyond the powers of Wikipedia to make anything useful of, and I have changed my vote above to Delete. I might consider supporting a properly constructed and monitored article such as List of Anglo-Saxon forenames, List of Medieval Christian names used in England, or List of Forenames commonly used in England in the 19th Century, for example - but such lists would be of near-dictionary length and would need ferocious sourcing.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaffelde_d573.html" title="User:Staffelde">Staffelde</a> 16:42, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>You must be reading a different article from <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln.html" title="Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, or you are understanding "given name" in some different sense. Are you trying to extend "given name" to cover place-names as well? Lincoln started as the name of a town, then became a surname. This article, if words mean anything, is about names given as forenames, so L is a town-name, or a surname taken from the town-name, used as a forename. This is a perfect illustration of the sorts of problems that this article generates, and of the obstacles of understanding which will make it extremely difficult to get anywhere useful with it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaffelde_d573.html" title="User:Staffelde">Staffelde</a> 00:17, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was okay, this one's a very difficult case. First of all, I will be discounting the views of <i>everyone</i> who opined solely because it's a suspected autobiography. The nominator himself argued for deletion "regardless of questions of encyclopaedic merit", and that's just <i>not</i> the way we do things here. It's not appropriate to delete an article merely because of who you think the author is (caveats about banned-by-ArbCom sockpuppets notwithstanding), and there's equally no point in counting the opinions of those who said "keep because I don't like the nomination". Now, the remaining opinions hinge on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; there have been claims that she does and does not pass the notability guidelines. Does she count against "Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers"? Frankly, it's hard to tell, as evidenced by the split here. There is no clear case either way, so the final closing will have to go down as <b>no consensus</b>. Those who wish to hurl rotten tomatoes and uncouth epithets are reminded that I have a talkpage somewhere.

<dd>I <i>have</i> reviewed all your comments on this page. It remains the fact that (1) the Sofia Echo article "about" her relegates mention to a trailing paragraph and does not actually support the claim to notability as a "popular" TV host,(2) the books are self-published with no evidence of significance or sales and (3) the subject scores around a dozen unique Google hits, half of which are adverts for her books. You have decided you want this article kept, which is your prerogative, but there is absolutely no indication that she passes <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which makes this a vanity autobiography, exactly as stated; the facts in this article originate with someone who says of herself that "Nelly Coneway is one of the most talanted and respected Bulgarian journalists in America". About half of what she posted has been removed as unverifiable puff. Of course none of those things individually necessarily make a subject non-notable - <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gunther_9e2d.html" title="Robert Gunther">Robert Gunther</a> self-published his book and still has an article, not least because the book is cited as a primary source by many biographies of famous 17th and 18th Century scientists - but together they make a pretty strong case for genuine scepticism about the importance of this subject. And the union flags are there so I can find my comments in long interleaved discussions - but even if that were vanity it would be irrelevant as an argumentum ad hominem and because I have not created a Wikipedia article about myself. Your faith in the improtance of this person is touching, but in the absence of any verifiable evidence of importance, I think somewhat misplaced. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 14:34, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's not that I have decided that "I want the article kept", it's because I believe that Ms. Coneway qualifies for inclusion and makes a nice addition to the encyclopedia.

<li>(Further to above comments, particularly JJay's, while I grasp the point being made and while I agree that autobiography is not something to go deliberately hunting, my reading of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> is nevertheless that the practice of creating one's own article, whoever one is, is STRONGLY discouraged. You are quite right to point out that "strongly discouraged" does not equal "totally forbidden" or "automatically deleted", but I think the guideline, if it means anything at all, must mean that there have to be unusually good reasons for allowing a self-created article to stand. I don't believe that in this instance there are unusually good reasons. This woman is not of sufficient stature as a journalist, author or "meeja" person to justify bending what is a very strong guideline. She comes in with no more than 57 Google hits, most of which are to self-promoting websites and duplicates. Ditto her publications, and her TV and journalistic ventures are significantly undistinguished. I just don't think her achievements are such as to merit bending what is quite a strong practice guideline.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaffelde_d573.html" title="User:Staffelde">Staffelde</a> 12:31, 1 February 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li>You are fully entitled to your interpretation, but try to maintain perspective. Guideline does not mean policy. This guideline mandates no action. It is a guideline for editing articles. Any article can be entirely rewritten. This is the case for many if not most of the offerings here. The "original sin" of an article's creation- in this case unproven I would point out- has no bearing. Lastly, I would assume that all guidelines are important to the people who care about them. When you repeatedly talk about a "<i>very strong guideline</i>" or "<i>quite a strong practice guideline</i>", I immediately wonder where I can find our "very weak" guidelines. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:24, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

The two Bulgarian-language books are also published by the same publisher. So the claim to be a "published author" is weak in the extreme.

<dd>I would hate to see a duff article scrape through simply because I have blurred the reasons for deletion (now I am turning to Ignore All Rules...). This article was definitely begun by the subject, as is clear from the caption ("Me taken by my son" or something similar) on the image of the subject that User:Nelly06 uploaded at the same time as placing the initial article (see user contributions, of which there are VERY few). That would normally count as Vanity and be off straight away. In which connection, the following is from <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>: "The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them." That seems fairly clear to me.</dd>

<dd>This lady has, it is quite true, a far more verifiable public profile than most, but the other information regarding her achievements from elsewhere is difficut to evaluate and borderline; and I am still think that autobiographical article + borderline significance should = delete.

<dd>I am concerned that, if this is allowed to stay, it makes a sort of back-door precedent for borderline "semi-notables" to create their own entries and then rely on the force of inertia to keep them, whereas surely the trend of thought so far has been in the other direction. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaffelde_d573.html" title="User:Staffelde">Staffelde</a> 17:57, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That's what she says about herself, sure. What to the reliable external sources say? The only cited on merely mentions that she was on TV at one time, does not say how popular those shows were, how prominent her role was within those shows, or indeed how popular she is.

<li>The Sofia Echo story says "David was born to an American father and a Bulgarian mother from Vidin". Doesn't sound like a famous TV star to me.

<li>The Sofia Echo article reads like the autobiographical entries. Perhaps submitted by the author herself. The Sofia Echo article refers to an award by GWB to the son. This is not notable. "Presidential" awards are routinely given to all levels of education - for example, the <a href="https://www.presidentschallenge.org/order_center/index.aspx" class="external text" title="https://www.presidentschallenge.org/order_center/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">President's Physical Fitness Award</a>. Students within all schools who achieve a certain level can receive these preprinted congratulations from the president; it is something that the schools can order. This may be the <a href="http://www.naesp.org/ContentLoad.do?contentId=1052" class="external text" title="http://www.naesp.org/ContentLoad.do?contentId=1052" rel="nofollow">President's Education Award Program</a>, which again can be ordered by schools.

<p><b>Keep</b> Having considered everything I have changed my mind and realised that this site DOES deserve an entry. If for no other reason than its inclusion in The Sun, the highest circulating English-speaking newspaper on the planet. However, IP addresses of edits should be closely monitored for vandalism - ie if its true that users of that site are altering other Wiki entries to fake deaths - ie Clive Dunn - then it should be pulled. There is no way it can be merged because, as much as anyone did, the creators of Death List actually invented the idea. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 16:58, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment relating to above statement</b> That is not relevant - it's not the number who voice an opinion either way but what they state. Death List relates to a unique discussion area and members do not choose their own picks, as in Dead Pools etc. Instead, a central committee makes the decisions and it is up to members to provide updates on the health and well being of those listed.

<p><b>Response</b> I don't have a problem with anonymous editors or with new editors. We were all new once, and I contributed anonymously to many articles. But, for better or worse, it is standard proceedure in closing AfD debates to look at the history of users contributions. The opinions expressed by users who have a history of contributing to Wikipedia are generally given more weight than the opinions of those who show up to "vote" on a single AfD. Therefore, I was simply pointing out information that the closing admin may want to consider. <a href="../../../t/m/s/User%7ETMS63112_ebc1.html" title="User:TMS63112">TMS63112</a> 17:56, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Response</b> to TMS63112: If you are suggesting that my opinion on this matter should be taken less seriously because I have not commented on other Wiki articles, I most seriously object. Just because I couldn't care less about most of the topics covered in Wiki does not mean my opinion with regard to this topic is less valid. --In eternum+ 00:30, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was getting 608, but now am getting 9,350. So, its not a difference in preferences. You're just hitting different servers, as we're apparently in the midst of a "Google dance" (I suspect its over now, and if you redo the search, you'll get the higher number).

<li>No, it went up to only 617. I don't get it. And if I take out the double quotes, I still only get 745.

<ul>
<li>Actually, everybody "found out" before the Google IPO, back when Google dances were a bigger deal. This is a very *minor* variation. The unique results remain similiar, as do the top results. The raw hit figure (617/9350), is a nearlly trivial figure. As said many time, one site can account for hundred of thousands of hits. In fact *non-existant* urls can be included in that "hit" figure (I'm not talking of down urls, I'm talking of urls that never existed). Perhaps, I should add yet another qualifier to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a>, as this test continues to be a problem. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:43, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>There are</b> many academic user bios of current researchers who are not particularly well known. There are grad student bios, C.V.s, and even undergrad bios. It does not make sense to target new articles of this nature when there is no automatic mechanism to remove the many many academic bios that already are wiki articles. Because of this inequity, I suggest the academic bios NOT be deleted or userfied until a reasonable method of vetting the huge number of existing bios it instituted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vanity and personal publicity play a very different role in academics than they do in most other walks of life, and the notoriety of a particular research often depends more on that person's ability to sell and self-promote them self than on the quality of his or her work. I have found many wiki pages related to an active scientific field being used as shameless self promotion by one or another research group that would like to increase their notoriety, and interlinked academic bios are a big part of this. Most hot research topics now have wiki articles of this nature. Are those who acted first in this regard, those who are better seller of themselves, are they to be grandfathered in? This would make wiki a tool in deed. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidchild_def0.html" title="User:Androidchild">Androidchild</a> 05:08, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"Day by day the feasting continued, until its noise and the festal joy of its revellers aroused a mighty enemy, Grendel, the loathsome fen-monster. This monstrous being, half-man, half-fiend, dwelt in the fens near the hill on which Heorot stood. Terrible was he, dangerous to men, of extraordinary strength, human in shape but gigantic of stature, covered with a green horny skin, on which the sword would not bite. His race, all sea-monsters, giants, goblins, and evil demons, were offspring of Cain, outcasts from the mercy of the Most High, hostile to the human race."</i></p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> according to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">Wikipedia:Speedy keep</a>, this can also be done when the nominator withdraws the nomination and there have been no delete votes (could be applied here) or if the nominator states that they support a keep/rename/merge/move/redirect.

<li>I am dreadfully sorry, it was his father called Anthony wasn't it, I beg your pardon.</li>
<li>Indeed, it seems my claimed title of 'expert in British Aristocracy' is not very well deserved as I have, after searching through my newest records found that in fact His Excellency's father is not the Earl of Shaftesbury as I first said. I have, however, found a reference to him in one of the newest books I have on English peerage as Baron Ashley, I must therefore presume that he has assumed this title. Perhaps a better update to the article would be naming Lord Ashley as the Heir Presumptive to Lord Shaftesbury. As for Lord Roberts all information cited I believe is still correct. It was from his mother's side that he inherited the wealth, not actually having anything to do with his title. His Uncle was the person I was thinking of as the 'late' Lord Shaftesbury, when in fact it was the late Lord Jersey that died unfortunately in a car crash a few months ago. My most sincere apologies for causing any confusion.</li>
<li>Dreadfully sorry, I just remebered I forgot to cite my source. It was Burke's 2006. I get a pre-published version every year.</li>

<dd>You are a liar. I have not been link dumping. I have been placing links to critical articles, essays and audio resources that expose the horrendeous false teachings of Rick Warren and his Purpose Driven® Movement, that each and every person can research into for themselves. The book by Warren is a book of falsehoods and Scripture Twistings and should <b>NOT</b> even be promoted on Wikipedia in any size, shape or form, whatsoever. The amount of people that have already been deceived by it is an <b>INJUSTICE!!!</b> Everything was fine until you came along and deleted the whole lot and started demanding I do this and that.

Once again u r using leading language. What if Prof. Rao has no objection to publish a page on his art&#160;? It has been published in many places.

<p>Because, multiple reasons. 1) It's not notable, a violation of Wikipedia policy. 2), Prof. Rao wrote it himself, a violation of wikipedia policy. 3) it's original research, a violation of wikipedia policy. 4) it's a vanity article, a violation of wikipedia policy.

<dd>It's not against policy, but it is strongly against guidelines because of the impossibility of writing in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> terms about yourself, plus the fact that autobiography will often include facts which are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's waaaaay too early for this article to have any basis in reality other than in the hypothetical. As the article itself mentioned, even the name "Generation Z" is controversial because members of this generation are still far too young to have developed any peculiar generation-specific characteristics. In fact, most of them haven't entered school or even been born yet.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I'd try again in 20 years or so when we know more about this generation's culture, and hopefully by that time we'll have found a much, much better name than "Generation Z", too. &#160;;) <a href="../../../e/k/e/User%7EEkedolphin_6de2.html" title="User:Ekedolphin">ekedolphin</a> 08:20, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> It was used in (and the title of) this article which I found with Scholar Google, which according to its self “Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, abstracts and articles, from academic publishers, professional societies, preprint repositories, universities and other scholarly organizations. Google Scholar helps you identify the most relevant research across the world of scholarly research.” [<a href="http://www.lasseigne.com/education/Art082503a.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasseigne.com/education/Art082503a.pdf" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>] --<a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfwood_93bd.html" title="User:Elfwood">Elfwood</a> 10:28, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with others that it is far too early to begin writing an article about this geenration, however I do feel it is important simply to have it defined as the succeeding generation to Gen Y. This way it won't be a red link on other pages. Just my two cents. <a href="../../../8/7/2E/User%7E87.80.126.226.html" title="User:87.80.126.226">87.80.126.226</a> 10:41, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with the above that we need it defined as the succeeding generation. "Generation Z" will suffice as a 'holding' name for some years until a proper name can be assigned. The points made in the article about this being the post 9-11 generation were valid. 209.30.169.106 18:32, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure it does. Generation Y is controversial and/or unsuitable in many circles as the name for the Gereration of the 80's and 90's. Why would Z, which is even more made up, POV, and fanciful name be appropriate?<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:20, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the objection is the name, I don't care if it's called something else. Call it 'The generation after generation y' if you wish, or 'the generation from 1997' onwards. Other generations sometimes have disputed names - 'Silent' generation or 'Air raid' generation? But as a generation, these children born into a post 9/11 world exist. So I think the basic entry should be kept (while not caring if it's Generation Z or something else.) 209.30.169.106 22:36, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No generation is listed as having ended at 11.15am on 28 Jan. Whereas the Generation Y page does list Generation Y as having ended around 1997/2000 (as generations do after about 20 years). Therefore, since babies are still being born, a new generation must exist.209.30.169.106 01:53, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Compromise suggestion - add the Generation Z information to the bottom of the 'Generation Y' entry page as 'additional information - post Generation Y'. 209.30.169.106 22:47, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the only argument for keeping this seems to be that it is next in alphabetic succession to the one which is next in alphabetic succession to Generation X, which is the only real one.

<li><b>Delete</b> This appears to be a replica of the listing Nouveau Acropolis Films, without the proper embedded links or attention to being updated. It's been suggested that this be merged with Acropolis Films, LLC, however I believe that to be a mistake as Nouveau Acropolis Films is a definable term that will be searched upon once this company gets more recognition of its work. If you look at the properly updated Nouveau Acropolis Films, you will see that it actually has a lot to offer as its own listing (if people will do some research into it, and give it more description). Such analagous listings can be exampled in <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samsung_Group_daea.html" title="Samsung Group">Samsung Group</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samsung_Electronics_549c.html" title="Samsung Electronics">Samsung Electronics</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krispy_Kreme_ffba.html" title="Krispy Kreme">Krispy Kreme</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doughnut_%28food%29.html" title="Doughnut (food)">Doughnut (food)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Wheels_2a3d.html" title="Hot Wheels">Hot Wheels</a>. Just because the company that makes a product is listed, doesn't mean the product itself shouldn't also be listed. Photoactivist 22:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A singer in a Christian band, Allmusic knoweth him not and the 350 or so unique Googles are liberally peppered with search engine spammers and web forums, I didn't see any evidence of substantive notability. Everything here could be merged to the band's article (which is small) - with the possible exception of his marital status, which is trivia.

<dd>Josh Scogin was ground-breaking for Christian hardcore/metalcore, and easily has the most recognizable voice in the Christian faction of the genre. I guess it would be good if that information were put within his Wikipedia entry, though, right? Anyways, I don't see the necessity to delete his entry simply because many people don't know much about him. However, alot of the information could be merged onto the band page ... but Scogin was not only involved with The Chariot, but the early Norma Jean and Luti-Kriss as well. I personally think that he has earned his place as a vocalist and is worthy of an entry ... however small. That's my opinion. <a href="../../../i/f/f/User%7EIffer_8396.html" title="User:Iffer">Iffer</a> 05:12, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Delete.</b> NN. Just because this guy might have played with a guy who then later was in "somewhat known" group that alone does not make him notable. Not enough google hits no proof of record sales about 5,000. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 09:16, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep.</b> I guess I forgot to make my opinion known. Maybe I wasn't clear ... he didn't play with a guy who became known, he <i>is</i> the guy I'm speaking of.

He's a member of a band that barely scrapes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and I don't see anything about him that can't be mentioned on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chariot_9e90.html" title="The Chariot">The Chariot</a>. Furthermore, content on Wikipedia is required to be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>.

</ul>
<p><b>Keep.</b> What if rather than deleting the entry, verifiable biographic information was added? Also, how do we decide whether is influential enough to warrant his own wiki? As his influence is relative depending on who you are talking to, gauging it can be hard. For instance, to metalcore/hardcore listeners he is extremely well known, and his work has had a huge influence on the sound of both those genres. However, the average person would probably not even know that metalcore existed, much less who was or wasn't influential in its history. To note, Norma Jean has sold well over <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/normajean|" class="external text" title="http://www.purevolume.com/normajean|" rel="nofollow">5,000 records</a>.</p>

<p>Buried deep within this article is the germ of something which might be notable, so the speedy tag was not really appropriate. On the other hand, even if it is notable, this article is possibly woirse than no article at all because it looks so very much like a <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> failure.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If it's deleted once and recreated, it will most likely be deleted again. The issue is that there are billions of podcasts/blogs/websites of great interest to their creators, but not to enough other people to go into an encyclopedia.

<dd>That clears up a few things indeed. Someone complained to the info-en mailing on his behalf on how someone kept changing it.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This article is really unencyclopedic in a sense. But it is aimed to teach a certain number of people the main concepts of wikipedia and its use. It has a certain user-group of people who want to learn this in order to make their own, encyclopedic entries. You might call it something like help. And here we have various examples of help...</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policy_trifecta" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policy_trifecta" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policy_trifecta</a> says:</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia created by a community using a wiki. Those three basic characteristics suggest three basic guiding principles for editors, of which all others are corollaries:</p>
<pre>
   * as an encyclopedia: Neutral point of view - our basic editorial policy
         o Corollaries: Conventions on verifiability, citation, original research, style, deletion, etc.
</pre>
<pre>
   * as a community: Don't be a dick - our basic social policy
         o Corollaries: Be civil, Keep your cool, assume good faith, avoid personal attacks.
         o Strongly implied are the one revert rule and consensus as opposed to voting
</pre>
<pre>
   * as a wiki: Ignore all rules - the suggested personal policy
         o Corollaries: Be bold, avoid instruction creep
</pre>
<p>As I surfed looking for answer to your deletion request, I haven't found anything that would be against my course! It has neutral point of view, it serves the community ... it is natural to have a course on what is wikipedia and how to use it inside wikipedia!</p>
<p>btw, there are several undeleted courses: a very similar content! Just take a look, please... <a href="http://www.jerryslezak.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=AdvancedMacro" class="external free" title="http://www.jerryslezak.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=AdvancedMacro" rel="nofollow">http://www.jerryslezak.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=AdvancedMacro</a></p>

<p>Could you explain me a little more in detailed what is the problem with my "unencyclopedic" entry? I don't want to bother the community; if you think that my content really doesn't belong here I'll move it somewhere else. But isn't it crazy to move a content on wikipedia outside wikipedia?</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. While I haven't got time right now to read through the whole article for POV or OR weaknesses (which doubtless exist), the topic of the page as such makes sense to me, and I can't follow the criticism expressed in the nomination about its duplicating or forking other articles. This doesn't seem to be a POV fork, but rather a legitimate attempt at factoring out an aspect from a larger topic, and then linking to a set of other main articles, which all seems perfectly reasonable. The problem about confusion with <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_criticism.html" title="Biblical criticism">Biblical criticism</a> can be solved by a simple dab remark. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 13:45, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Try reading the talk page of the article you have listed for deletion Biblical inconsistencies was moved to Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible as mentioned on the VFD page. If we then go to the talk page we find <a href="../../../i/n/c/Talk%7EInconsistencies_in_the_Bible_ae8b.html#Requested_move" title="Talk:Inconsistencies in the Bible">here</a> that the article was then moved to Inconsistencies in the Bible.

<p>This is a perjorative nick-name. The article is without merit and a redirect fails NPOV.

<li><b>Keep</b> This term has been used a great deal and it should be defined and explained in wikipedia. The title is not pov any more than the title <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> is point of view; it's just what the article has to be called. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 20:11, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Nigger" has a long and detailed history; "Franchise F.C." is a neologism that could never get more than one or two lines devoted to it (even in its current state it is stretching the term, as the Manchester United claim is somewhat dubious and should be removed). To vote keep on those grounds is to vote keep for any other newly-coined POV term. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 08:44, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>.The Thoraldus article is a hoax, intentionally or not. Essentially it's just a name in a charter upon which the author or his spurious source has invented a biography. Many of its claims are false, such as that on the "Earls" of Lennox. Archibald Lawries' <i>Early Scottish Charters</i> lists in its index only one Thoraldus (alternatively Toraldus or Thorandus in other charters), a man who was the archdeacon of Lothian (as Lothian did not have its own bishop, he is the next best thing). The charter he was talking about, (Lawrie CLIX, p. 122) does not contain the name Thoraldus, but Thor (a different name), so the entire article is nonsense. This Thor is known from other sources, <i>Thor de Travernent</i>, son of a man called Swain, and held the manor of Tranent in <a href="../../../h/a/d/Haddingtonshire.html" title="Haddingtonshire">Haddingtonshire</a> - i.e. he was a native Anglo-Saxon lord of the area, and nothing to do with Stirling. Articles like this are why people call wikipedia a "dumping ground". - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 15:14, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b>, I wouldn't worry about the redirect from Strivelyn; it's quite harmless, and is a genuine early version of the name. The form of it in the charter he was talking about is Streuelyn/Strevelyn; but he got a lot of things wrong. The author seems to have been promoting a clan page. I reverted his edit to the Stirling page. The page has an "interesting" genealogy - quite spurious - and to make it work, the researcher changed the witness <i>Tor vicecomite</i> to <i>Toraldo, Vicecomite</i>; otherwise, the witness list he quotes is accurate, although either he or his source has murdered the Latin. The charter he talks about is preserved in the <i>Liber de Calchou</i> (lit. <i>Kelso Book</i>), it was issued about 1143 by David I to Kelso abbey, and it grants the Abbey use of a salt pan at a place called "Carsach". The only connection with Stirling was that it was issued there ("apud Streuelyn"). The author is correct that this Thor Swainsson was a sheriff ("vicecomes"), but other charters strongly suggest he was sheriff of Haddington (e.g. otherwise he only witnesses grants concerning territory in Lothian, where he would be an appropriate name). He can't have been sheriff of Stirling, because we know that the sheriff of Stirling in 1147 (a year when Sheriff Thor witnesses a grant made in Edinburgh to Dunfermline Abbey of a toft in <b>Haddington</b>), that the Sheriff of Stirling was a man called "<i>Dufoc</i>" (?Dubhtach). - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 22:20, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Wojciech Zurek is a top researcher in quantum decoherence and is a Phi Betta Kappa scholar. This is his theory and I have received emails from him that my interpretation is close to his. In considering this matter please refer to his paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0308/0308163.pdf" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0308/0308163.pdf" rel="nofollow">Quantum Darwinism and Envariance</a>. It provides many interpretational sections on his theory and is relatively transparent. Here is one quote:</p>
<p><i>Quantum Darwinism differs from</i> the traditional approach suggested by the von Neumann model of quantum measurement and offers a new perspective on the emergence of the everyday classical reality that is complementary to the one suggested by decoherence: Selection of preferred states occurs as a result of the ‘selective advertising’, a proliferation of the information about the stable pointer states throughout the Universe. This view of the emergence of the classical can be regarded as (a Darwinian) natural selection of the preferred states. Thus, (evolutionary) fitness of the state is defined both by its ability to survive intact in spite of the immersion in the environment (i.e., environment-induced superselection is still important) but also by its propensity to create offspring – copies of the information describing the state of the system in that environment. I show that this ability to ‘survive and procreate’ is central to effective classicality of quantum states. --<a href="../../../j/o/c/User%7EJockcampbell_9c7a.html" title="User:Jockcampbell">Jockcampbell</a> 16:16, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>[This might really belong on the Talk page, but so long as it's reasoanbly short it can stay here for the moment.]</p>
<p>As I am the author of the entry under consideration but am relatively new to Wikipedia and am unsure of the quality of argument required to trigger the deletion of a page I will present a detailed and referenced refutation of this nomination for deletion. The nominator expresses two unsubstantiated points.</p>
<p>First: <i>It sounds like my uncle Herbert Ingham's pseudoscience to me.</i></p>
<p>This point is easy. Quantum darwinism is the integration and perhaps the culmination of several topics of research carried out by <a href="../../../w/o/j/Wojciech_Zurek_eb2e.html" title="Wojciech Zurek">Wojciech Zurek</a> of Los Alamos National Laboratory and a group of collaborators over the past 25 years. These topics include <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decoherence.html" title="Decoherence">decoherence</a>,pointer basis and <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einselection.html" title="Einselection">einselection</a> and their numerous articles have been published in peer reviewed journals. A small subset of these papers are linked on the page and I will provide them here for easy reference:</p>

</ul>
<p>If the theory of quantum darwinism cannot qualify as true science then very little can.</p>
<p>Second: <i>The princiles of evolution an quantum mechanics are much to different for their to be such a connection.</i></p>
<p>This objection, is more plausible and may well be the unexamined opinion of the nominator but the connections between evolution and physics has been championed and documented by some of the most illustrious modern physicists including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Archibald_Wheeler_eaa8.html" title="John Archibald Wheeler">John Archibald Wheeler</a> and many of those he taught and mentored. Zurek, a Phi Betta Kappa scholar and a former student of Wheeler's writes:</p>
<p><i>Both of these themes – quantum natural selection and envariance – have benefited from the inspiration and support of John Archibald Wheeler. To begin with, one of the two portraits displayed prominently in John’s office in Austin, Texas, was of Charles Darwin (the other one was of Abraham Lincoln). This was symptomatic of the role theme of evolution played in John’s thinking about physics (see, e.g., Wheeler’s ideas on the evolutionary origin of physical laws10). While I was always fond of looking at the ‘natural world’ in Darwinian terms, this tendency was very much encouraged by John’s influence .It seems quite natural to look at the emergence of the classical as a consequence of a</i> quantum analogue of natural selection.</p>
<p>Another of Wheeler’s former students, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Deutsch_377b.html" title="David Deutsch">David Deutsch</a>, the founder of Quantum Computing and winner of this years $100,000 EDGE OF COMPUTATION SCIENCE PRIZE considers evolutionary theory along with quantum physics two of the four strands of knowledge that when understood in an integrated fashion will provide a deeper understanding of reality: <a href="http://www.qubit.org/people/david/index.php?path=The%20Fabric%20of%20Reality" class="external text" title="http://www.qubit.org/people/david/index.php?path=The%20Fabric%20of%20Reality" rel="nofollow">David Deutsch's site</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Smolin_7643.html" title="Lee Smolin">Lee Smolin</a>, another distinguished physicist, has proposed the theory of <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmological_natural_selection.html" title="Cosmological natural selection">cosmological natural selection</a> to explain the existence of the finely tuned fundamental physical parameters making our complex universe possible. Smolin writes of the connection between physics and Darwinian processes:</p>
<p><i>There is only one mode of explanation I know of, developed by science, to explain why a system has parameters that lead to much more complexity than typical values of those parameters. This is natural selection.</i></p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Dennett_375e.html" title="Daniel Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a>, of Tufts University, perhaps America’s best known philosopher, in his book Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, describes how Darwinian theory is proving a powerful tool in many areas of research. He describes it as a ‘universal acid’ that eats away at our anthropomorphic world view. New fields of study abound having an ‘evolutionary’ prefix. Here are a few of the many with Wikipedia links: <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_psychology.html" title="Evolutionary psychology">evolutionary psychology</a>,<a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_linguistics.html" title="Evolutionary linguistics">evolutionary linguistics</a>,<a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_epistemology.html" title="Evolutionary epistemology">evolutionary epistemology</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_economics.html" title="Evolutionary economics">evolutionary economics</a>.</p>
<p>In short, although some minds are ignorant of the well reasoned connections that have been made by reputable researchers between evolution and quantum physics, as well as numerous other fields, that does not mean that these connections have not been made and have been found by many to be compelling.</p>
<p>I cannot help but reflect that Wikipedia itself may well be seen as the accumulation of a body of knowledge due to a Darwinian process and appreciate that a mechanism is required to ensure the non-survival of entries reflecting vandalism, ignorance or cant. I trust that this mechanism is capable of properly evaluating these unfounded objections to the quantum darwinism page. --<a href="../../../j/o/c/User%7EJockcampbell_9c7a.html" title="User:Jockcampbell">Jockcampbell</a> 03:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to one or two points made here: first, Dennett might be America's best-known philosopher (I doubt it, but I might be wrong), but he's not a very good one — and you don't even refer to him as commenting on this particular theory (your argument seems to be: Dennett says that Darwinism is a pwerful tool, this theory refers to Darwinism, therefore this theory must be sensible/true/useful...). Secondly, citing other loopy theories like evolutionary epistemology and evolutionary economics doesn't do much to convince.</dd>
<dd>The points that I and others have made above are the ones that are key to whether or not the article should stay; telling editors that they're too dim or ignorant to understand the subject of the article probably isn't the most sensible way to argue against deletion. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 14:53, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You mean to say you've never heard of Velvetism? Well sir, velvetism is a much larger movement then your awareness of it gives it credit for. Held in high regards by many who value the socialist and libertarian movement, Velevetism has grown imensely in the recent past. Velevetism is one of the few ideologies that supports legalization of vicitimless crimes such as marijuana use, which is the most likely reason that it has such a large group of teen agers and young adult followers. Maybe you dont support liberal values which is why you have not heard of Velvetism. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.142.215.159 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.142.215.159_cad1.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.142.215.159">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I can't quite follow you. These are certainly not "unreferenced"; both articles explicitly refer to sources from a "Laogai Research Foundation", apparently an NGO monitoring human-rights abuses in China. Do you have any particular reason to believe they are not reliable? - The existance of <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laogai.html" title="Laogai">Laogai</a> in China as such doesn't seem in doubt, or does it? Of course, collecting information of this kind in a country like China is bound to be fraught with problems, and some warning remark about the degree of reliability feasible in the circumstances might be appropriate - but "hoax" seems really far-fetched. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 22:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I quote from <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laogai.html" title="Laogai">Laogai</a>: "<i>It is often confused with, <b>but completely different from, reeducation through labor</b>, which is a system of administrative detentions.</i>" When sources such as these are used, one cannot help but wonder about the accuracy.

I am doing this free and altruistically and while I am doing it there is one that is dedicated to criticize before hoping to see the results. If I have chosen to make this page it is by the facts that occur with <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Signage_f4fe.html" title="Digital Signage">Digital Signage</a> where it seems that the only thing that it matters are the external links and advertinsing and the order of such and not the information that is offered to the users.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> — What "results"? So far, you've stopped editing, and what you <i>have</i> done is promote links to external websites only to generate revenue and traffic, and place a lot of unnecessary information on the page.

<p>Before criticizing and accusing is better to inquire a little.</p>
<p>TheMost of the content of that glossary is based on <i>"The Digital Signage Glossary of Terms is an open source project with the cooperation of the Digital Display industry. D3 magazine would like pay special thanks to the digital signage software provider SCALA for their help in compiling the terms and definitions presented. If you would like to help us expand on these terms and definitions, feel free to email us with your ammendments, new terms, or suggestions lief@d3magazine.com "</i></p>
<p>I thought that Wikipedia was an suitable place to offer that knowledge to the users, but if it isn´t then that somebody erase it.</p>
<p>Kareeser, finally I say that I do this in my free time, and I do that from an altruistic form. There is no one external link in that page, only knowledge.</p>
<p>Everybody can see the log of the modifications done to the page and see that while somebody was working ther other was criticizing before hoping to see the results.</p>
<p>Let's Wikipedia decide.</p>

<li>I created the page so I'll chime in here. I think it could be narrowed down to "notable" all-ages venues, and I understand that Wikipedia is not a random collection of lists; however, Wikipedia is full of lists that, while not of interest to everyone, are of interest to a very small subculture -- or even to a small fraction of that same subculture. For example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_black_metal_fanzines.html" title="List of black metal fanzines">List_of_black_metal_fanzines</a>. Believe me, a list of notable all-ages venues in the United States is a list that would be of interest to hundreds of people -- not just bands trying to set up shows at such venues, but also people interested in setting up similar venues in their towns, people writing about such venues (when local print media write about such venues, they invariably treat them as unique oddities), and so forth. I'm surprised that Wikipedians are acting like listings in Wikipedia are supposed to be popularity contests -- the "why should we even care" comments above, for instance. Just because you personally are not interested in a topic doesn't mean that the topic is not of use to anyone at all. And, the reason that the list is not extensive should be obvious -- the community has not had a chance to add to it yet. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamiem_66c8.html" title="User:Jamiem">Jamiem</a></li>

<dd>The number of black metal fanzines is small (and anyway I'd burn that as cruft) but the notable small venues can be collected in a category, whihc will allow subcategories by region and so on. As a list it has two major problems: spamming with non-notable venues, and the absolutely vast number of potential includees. Go with a category, they work wel for this kind of thing. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 23:57, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see what you mean. If this ends up being deleted, I may create a category, or better yet, write a new article about the all-ages punk rock phenomenon in the US.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> This article just needs expansion. When making an attempt to verify notability, I highly recommend actually reading some of the websites rather than simply counting them.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I did indeed visit the websites you mention before nominating this substub for deletion. The fact remains that Mr Morris simply isn't notable. He may have worked at Trent and Leicester Sound (along with hundreds of other people) but there dozens and dozen of people <i>more</i> notable than him in ILR that we <i>don't</i> have articles on. He may be mentioned on certain fansites for Trent and LS, but that still doesn't change his fundamental lack of notability. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">DVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 21:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I understand the assume good faith policy, but my experience with afd, good faith, and radio (internet or otherwise) topics here at wikipedia is that these articles are submitted for afd almost as automatically as a bot sorting their categories. Guy Morris didn't just work at Leicester Sound, he was the morning DJ on their first air staff. All the information I read points to him being a historic figure in radio for this region. I still say the article needs expansion rather than deletion. Maybe there are dozens of people more notable than him that don't have articles. I'd say that's irrelevant to this discussion. To me this just means somebody should write or request those articles not that other articles should be deleted. Surely wikipedia doesn't delete articles simply because more notable articles don't exist yet. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 22:17, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It should not be deleted because there is no reason for it to be.You may think that it is unencyclopedic, but the people who actually like to play RuneScape and go and fight these things may need advice or tips on how to beat them,etc.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarikochi_1ade.html" title="User:Tarikochi">Tarikochi</a> 01:39, 3 February 2006 (UTC) - I would also like to add that the "TzHaar Fight Cave" is not a location, despite its name. The "Fight Cave" is actually a RuneScape mini-game, furthering the reason why this article should not be deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I admit I have an addiction towards this RuneScape game, however I really don't think RuneScape warrants 16 articles. This is one of the articles that doesn't warrant to be an article. —<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><b>M</b><small><b>ESSED</b></small><b>R</b><small><b>OCKER</b></small></a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker">talk</a>)</small> 02:18, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a lot of time and effort wasted if this was to be deleted. Some information on a small subject is better than no information on a small subject.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> There is a lot of useful information in the article, and it is an integral part of the RS series (into which it should be reinstated).

<li><b>Keep</b>. TzTok-Jad was an article about an important monster in RuneScape (the most powerful). There was also an article about the TzHaar Fight Caves and the fire cape. Recently, it was all merged together. The TzHaar Fight Cave is not a regular location, it's an important mini-game like <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_Wars_d694.html" title="Castle Wars">Castle Wars</a>.

<li><b>Merge without redirect.</b> First of all, let's be fair: we have an article that covers "Google Images", "Google Groups", "Google Froogle" and others (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Google_services_and_tools_9f55.html" title="List of Google services and tools">List of Google services and tools</a>). So I'm not advocating to retain Google and remove Yahoo. I'm against *all* articles of this kind, not for their commercial/advertisement aspect, but simply because they are a maintenance pain. Nobody can keep up with each and every feature/service a web site decide to provide; so, unless we have historical info, commercial facts or even undocumented things that can interest/be useful to the user (such as Gpuzzle or April Fools Search), all that such articles supply is info which are either found on the original site itself (so why replicating them here?) or info that are outdated (which will always happen soon or later). Thus I think that when possible we should ascribe them to a proper context-article, where they can be indicated to the user as external links. Or in other cases simply cited in the main article as "some additional services". As a rule of thumb: avoid info and details that easily become outdated. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGennaro_Prota_b0f2.html" title="User:Gennaro Prota">Gennaro Prota</a> 00:23, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge &amp; redirect</b>. I don't see what the harm in keeping the redirect is; should the technology become outdated, if people happen to still remember it and type it into the box, it redirects to Yahoo. No harm done. Incidentally, Yahoo Photos has remained unchanged for the past five or so years. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaggaga_12ad.html" title="User:Raggaga">Raggaga</a> 00:59, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Britpop as a genre is very hard to define, and I could make a strong case for the removal of many of those listed. No doubt, someone else would make a strong case for the <i>reinstatement</i> of a few names that I have just removed.

<dd>You'll notice that I've trimmed a lot away already. I've also changed the definition of what is acceptable there by restricting it to British, first-wave britpop bands - otherwise it's just unmanageable. Feel free to trim away further.

<p><b>Keep and cleanup.</b> The list is manageable, you just need a few editors working together towards consensus. This isn't out of control like the Best-selling artists/albums articles.

<dl>
<dd>Your other point (I got an edit conflict as you were adding it) - I read NME every week in that era so I have a fairly good idea already; that's not the problem.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Caveat:I am not thrilled with the idea of putting my name in support next to anything related to donkey punching. However, I must vote my wikiconscience here for a few reasons. First of all, the teabagging precedent (God, am I citing something called the teabagging precedent?) and the previous AfD show a developing consensus on such topics. Secondly, the article itself has developed beyond that of a dicdef (if the article stunk, I would probably vote for transwikification). Tertiarily, it is not a neologism or <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">bull shit</a>, as I have heard this term since at least 1997. So, yea, save the donkey punch (note to StarryEyes: I do agree that anything containing the words <i>Tony Danza Variation</i> is highly suspect). <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 00:00, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Current status as an urban legend is more likely than not due to a lack of verifiable sources...it would not surprise me to see reports of it in documented abusive relationships.

<li>I will have to <b>Abstain</b> here since I count XWayfarer as a personal friend. However, I would question the nom's judgement that the site is non-notable; while "Seventh Sanctum" gets 18,800 Google hits, slightly on the low side, looking at <i>how</i> those hits refer to Seventh Sanctum shows that people are recommending it as a valuable resource; people are calling "the best source on the Internet"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:w5kJFEIVArsJ:www.nmyworld.com/+%22Seventh+Sanctum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=51&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:w5kJFEIVArsJ:www.nmyworld.com/+%22Seventh+Sanctum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=51&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> and "the current champ"<a href="http://fmwriters.com/Visionback/Issue29/Questing.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://fmwriters.com/Visionback/Issue29/Questing.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. <a href="http://www.sou.edu/english/resources.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sou.edu/english/resources.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you have a college's English department putting the site on a list of resources it recommends to its students, and<a href="http://www.fantasticsfilm.com/home.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fantasticsfilm.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">these people</a> are using the site's generators in making their independent film series.

It does not have the two album releases on major labels required, and while the author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStifle&amp;diff=37721728&amp;oldid=37720946" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStifle&amp;diff=37721728&amp;oldid=37720946" rel="nofollow">claims</a> it meets the criterion of having been <i>prominently</i> featured in a <i>major</i> music publication (my emphasis) (<a href="http://www.drownedinsound.com/bands/3386/" class="external text" title="http://www.drownedinsound.com/bands/3386/" rel="nofollow">see here</a>), I do not see this as either prominent or major. Additionally, the band members' names on the article do not correspond with the names on the website. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 11:17, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am the original poster of the article. I would agree that the band are just emerging into 'wikipedia' status so to speak, and are on the border between being notable enough, and not quite. I felt they had a large enough fan base, radio play, and publication reviews to warrant a placing. On reading through the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria, it would seem that 'spot' (ie. one-off) radio plays are not enough. However, the support of Drowned in Sound, I thought, was enough. Perhaps the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drowned_In_Sound_bf66.html" title="Drowned In Sound">Drowned In Sound</a> could be updated a little. It has continued to grow over the last year, and is now Europe's most widely read music website. It has more readers per week than the NME for instance, and is perhaps the most significant 'tastemaker' within the UK indie community. (I don't think I should be the one to update the entry for it though, as it could look like I was trying to manipulate things in favour of the plans and apologies entry!). I would argue then, that it is both prominent and major for an indie band. No hard feelings if you disagree and delete the entry though, it is reassuring to see that Wikipedia has such stringent entry conditions. PS - confusingly, the band members change their alternative names every year or so, so there are several versions out there! If I knew their actual names, I'd have gone with that...

<li>Since you mention NME, can I ask - have you/they been featured in NME yet? If they have, in what context?

<li>They haven't been featured in the NME (as far as I know). Would probably be on their press sources on their site if they had, but no mention of the NME. That may change in upcoming weeks with a new single out in March, but for the moment, no NME. Gus Peterson 15:50, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not saying an article in NME is essential of course, but it's a reasonable indicator along with what else is written here that this band aren't quite notable enough yet.

<p>I'm doubtful of her notability and suspect this is either promotional or a hoax, especially since the user who first created the article just <i>happened</i> to be named Honey101. I found no relevant Google results for 'Honey model', the "official website" link at the bottom points to <a href="http://www.com" class="external free" title="http://www.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.com</a>, and there's no assertion of her notability anywhere in the article. They include a Victoria's Secret catalogue cover shot, but it <b>cannot be her</b>, given that that was a Fall 2002 issue and she was just <b>twelve</b> when it came out. They do not say anywhere in the article what work she's done. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 23:24, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
