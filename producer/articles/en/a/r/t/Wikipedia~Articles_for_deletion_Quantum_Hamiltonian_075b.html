<dd>The article has been changed considerably since I made my vote, <strike>but I still maintain <b>delete</b></strike> [delete vote cancelled, see above, <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a>]. The article currently <i>cannot</i> say anything other than what <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_%28quantum_mechanics%29.html" title="Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)">Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)</a> does for quantum mechanics, or <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_mechanics.html" title="Hamiltonian mechanics">Hamiltonian mechanics</a> for classical mechanics. If you wish to add information on how to incorporate electromagnetism into Hamiltonian formalism, either in classical or in quantum mechanics, then add appropriate information to the two articles above. (I must also say, as an aside, that the article <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_%28quantum_mechanics%29.html" title="Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)">Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)</a> is itself not in the best of shape and definitely needs some work.)
<dl>
<dd>the article tries to <b>distinguish</b> the two. they, or their applications should not be confused. again, a reason to keep it with a strong call for improvement, which has been this issue's history as far as i can trace it. andrej.westermann 17:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>it is. but again, not well known. look it up. or add the link. or follow it. there was a paper, for the time i have lost it, anyone care to help? how should i ever get to complete it if i constantly have to argue against completion due to being incomplete? andrej.westermann 17:27, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The statement "Hamiltonian ... is time and mass independent" is pure, utter nonsense: how can Hamiltonian be mass independent for a massive particle?
<dl>
<dd>AFAIK, it needs be mass independent initially to describe mass. andrej.westermann 17:27, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The statement "Hamiltonian ... uses wave functions" does not mean anything; in first quantization Hamiltonian is an operator that acts on wave functions (states), it is the generator of time translations.

<dd><b>Some replies</b>:
<ul>
<li>"Hamiltonian is mass-independent" is generally wrong. It does contain a parameter, <span class="texhtml"><i>m</i></span>, the mass of the particle. Leaving aside subtle thins such as mass renormalization (which only occurs in QFT), this is the mass of the particle. The typical example would be <span class="texhtml"><i>H</i> = <i>p</i><sup>2</sup> / 2<i>m</i></span>. Your example contains an <span class="texhtml"><i>m</i></span> under the square root sign.</li>

<dd>suggesting removal of AfD as further investigation indicates attack from a possibly biased group of contributors. <b>Before you take offense</b>, note that i said possibly, as it is my interpretation from reading <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics">Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics</a> and the corresponding Talk page.

<p>again, this whole discussion seems to be vs people not being aware of this Hamiltonians significance, which to me is just te argument to keep it. If you would help phrase why it can be disregarded in your fields, that would really improve the article. i have tried in the intro but naturally can not make a convincing case to irrelevance&#160;:). The subject itself will always stay short and precise but because of its implications (and differing interpretations as to validity), it should stay separate. andrej.westermann 17:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I simply do not understand why you want to create a separate article. Hamiltonians are indeed very important. They are important in classical physics, where they are certain functions of coordinates and conjugate momenta (and possible explicit time), and they can be used to obtain equations of motion as Hamilton's equations. They also have a geometric significance, as generators of time translations, using symplectic manifolds, Poisson brackets etc. All this is described in the article <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_mechanics.html" title="Hamiltonian mechanics">Hamiltonian mechanics</a>. They are also very important in quantum physics, where they are operators that act on states and again are generators of time translations. They can then be identified with energy operators, for example in the famous time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation<img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/b/d/abd6f0133c673fb04b1c7a477197d730.png" alt="H|\psi\rangle=E|\psi\rangle" />, where <span class="texhtml"><i>H</i></span> is the Hamiltonian (operator), <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/0/5/605b44d27aad3e8e841b1dd43053faa1.png" alt="|\psi\rangle" /> is the eigenstate of this operator and <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i></span> is the energy, the eigenvalue. All this is described in the article <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_%28quantum_mechanics%29.html" title="Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)">Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)</a>. I do not see what can you possibly say in a new article that is called "Quantum Hamiltonian" that is not already said in one of these two. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:22, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>exactly the point. there is no need to state anything new but there is a need to state the differences you just mentioned in one article. they do well make the distinction themselves, however, for the layman, this distinction gets easily confused and i am still looking for a way to clear this. so far, this is the way and i have tried keeping links to it few and if possible only from the disambiguition page or the areas you mentioned.andrej.westermann 17:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I suggest reading good books on Quantum Mechanics. You can always use Wikipedia as a secondary reference, to clarify concepts that seem unfamiliar. Generally, the connection between classical Hamiltonian and quantum Hamiltonian is made via the "canonical quantization" formalism: the Poisson bracket is replaced by commutator (times some factors such as <span class="texhtml"><i>i</i></span> and <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/d/f/9dfd055ef1683b053f1b5bf9ed6dbbb4.png" alt="\hbar" />). Classically, Hamiltonian is just a function (in most cases it is just the energy). In quantum mechanics Hamiltonian is an operator. In both cases they can be viewed as time translation generators (classically by the Poisson bracket action, quantum-mechanically by direct action on state vectors, or by commutation on other operators). All good books on quantum mechanics usually describe this. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Final final comment: if you really want to write an article on how Hamiltonians are used in classical and quantum mechanics, what are the connections, what are the differences and similarities, then it should not be called "Quantum Hamiltonian". It should be called something like "Hamiltonian in classical and quantum physics" or something similar. That might, indeed, be quite useful. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For what it's worth, I consider the relationship between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of a physical theory to be about the deepest topic there is in mathematical physics.

However, the first step is necessarily to delete the current text. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 02:47, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> with possible <b>further action</b>. I've tried to use cascade-formatting to make this legible; there is a lot to note here.</li>

<dd>This is illustrative of the problems with many specialized-field science articles on the encyclopedia at this time. At its best versions, it has duplicated the effort of the two existing articles discussed in above notes. At its worst, it has been disingenuous and factually inaccurate. The justifications given on the article's discussion page are particularly circuitous or nonresponsive. And, of course, the references are varyingly unacceptable (a toequest.com forum post), extraordinarily generic links that are functionally definitions, or wholly inapplicable to the topic discussed (William H. Rowan's original work). The encyclopedia has standards for math and science articles that are steeper than those for, say, popular culture, and this does not meet them.

<dd>Wikiproject Physics has largely concluded this author is, to use their words, "a crank or a prankster". This article and references to it have been systemically poor since inception, and have been all but exclusively the playground of a single-topic account (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_andrej.westermann_fbd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/andrej.westermann">andrej.westermann</a>) and a veritable host of sockish-seeming IPs (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.226.146.13_5835.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.226.146.13">84.226.146.13</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.227.60.147_4734.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.227.60.147">84.227.60.147</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.227.80.45_e5eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.227.80.45">84.227.80.45</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.227.129.102_e390.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.227.129.102">84.227.129.102</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.217.60.227_96fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.217.60.227">89.217.60.227</a>), perhaps from a semi-dynamic host. As further evidence of the curious lack of transparency by this editor, the piped link to this page from <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swinging_Atwood%27s_Machine_24fb.html" title="Swinging Atwood's Machine">Swinging Atwood's Machine</a> is particularly evasive -- AfD readers will likely have to examine the article code to even locate it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_mechanics&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78444059" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_mechanics&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78444059" rel="nofollow">This diff</a> from <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> illustrates the use of another inappropriately piped link to this article by this IP cluster.

<li><b>Delete</b> this as an unusable version.

<p><b>DELETE</b> absolutely and agree to all except the sockypuppet theory and making obscure critical comments (including yours truly), will be logged in always when doing even minimal maintenance and generally get informed about most anything re Wiki and applied Hamiltonian. Final comment: E=mc<sup>2</sup> as polar spherical hamiltonian brought me here, please excuse my other ignorance and any trouble caused therefrom. THANKS A LOT! andrej.westermann 20:25, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
