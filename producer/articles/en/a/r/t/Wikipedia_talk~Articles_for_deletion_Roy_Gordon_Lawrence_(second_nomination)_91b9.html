<li>THANKS,Andyru now it just goes to show who is realy trying to make this page a soapbox. you!look at all of your entries. They are all of william01! Move on! you can try to protect you friend Roy Lawrence, but people should know of his past! I have kids and I am thankfull of this page as it informs us about possible threats to our kids. You worry me andyru,that you are so dead set on hidding his past,,do you have kids??? 70.26.46.45 18:17, 3 April 2006 (UTC) 18:13, 3 April 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Well, since you know who I am and keep listing my full name, why don't you pick up the phone and call me (you have my number, and I'm at it). Don't ask me rhetorical questions. Your IP address traces to a ROGERS customer here in Ottawa. I'd be happy to discuss this... you'd actually be VERY surpised at my response! Instead, you're cowardly hiding behind anonymous usernames on the internet. Andyru 19:09, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, and I'm not dead set on hiding his past, but I am against this article being used to demean two local churches here in Ottawa. And honest, that is the only thing "you know who" cares about -- bringing negative attention to those churches (because they are filled with people who rejected him). So, while you try to act pious about "informing the public", are you going to create a page about the other guy (Marshal?) and let everyone know where he goes to church? No? Isn't it the same? Andyru 19:14, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>yes andyru,,I know you, and you don't want me to call you because you'd actually not be VERY surpised at my response!you need to move on stop hiding behind you computer! Go out make something of your self! for once!And stop trying to hide the truth! Jugementonyou 03:57, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ok since I'm new I don't know if this is ok (let me know) but I think this personal commentary is obviously not helpful to the decision. However I won't delete it because I didn't post it. SunbirdInc 07:56, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I moved these comments over to the talk page (where they belong), and thus removed the strikeout font. Andyru 15:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dear Jugementonyou, i'm not the one hiding anonymously behind a computer, you are (seeing as you know my name, but are to scared to reveal yourself, even by initals) . The irony in your above paragraph is poetic. I like how you completely avoided my question though, so I challenge you again: <i>So, while you try to act pious about "informing the public", are you going to create a page about the other guy (Marshal?) and let everyone know where he goes to church?</i> Are you going to "hide" him (as you accuse me of), or in that case do you just recognize that there is no encyclopedic value? If you want to be consistent, I'll look for your page on him to be created. If not, then recognize your hypocrisy. Andyru 15:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>dear andyru, I have removed your soapbox paragraph as you did to others. Please respect this and keep your personal problems of this page ,Some of us take this matter very seriously, If I were you I would to, Jugementonyou 13:36, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>They are put on the talk page, they were not removed. You are not to delete the nomination statement, it is the whole point this page exists. I will no longer respond to you as I have identified you as an Oosterman. Sorry, the only thing you can do with a narcissist [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissist" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissist" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissist</a> ] is ignore them.

<li>Dear "Sunbirdinc" - read what I put in the nomination at the top. Read the 3 links, you'll quickly see that there is a agenda to NOT keep articles dear to Williamo1's heart neutral. Did you read all the comments about Williamo1 on the 3 pages (made by neutral Wikipedia people)? And now that Williamo1 is using sock/meatpuppets... Andyru 14:26, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Andyru, kinda like John Kerry, your rhetoric doesn't match your record. Both you and Williamo1 both have condemning contrib's (very much focused on one topic). The only edits you've ever made are related to the whole citywide/lawrence/william oosterman topic. Unfortunatly this leads me to think you are somehow involved and it makes it hard to imagine there is no agenda on your part. Try finding other articles contribute to as well. It might be a better use of time. SunbirdInc 16:46, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>SunbirdInc, (you're clearly not Jugementonyou because he can't spell ... though I suspect the lot of you are all the family members of Williamo1, or possibly this Marshal guy or Jamie) I've made no attempts to hide my purposes here and/or my involvement or lack thereof... in fact they've been clearly spelled out each time (in this project, I spell it out clearly above at top of page). Williamo1 can take his soapboxes elsewhere. The only reason I came onboard was to help remove the slander put online by Williamo1 about other people and churches. These articles are not encyclopedic, and i'm in favour of their removal. The Roy Gordon Lawrence article may have a place here if kept neutral, but clearly Williamo1 over the past several months has no intentions of keeping it neutral.. thus, I'm in favor of deleting the soapbox. After this consensus (whatever it is) is reached, I'll be off too&#160;:) Concerning records, your only contributions are on this project page. If you know me so well, why not just phone me to find out where I'm really at, instead of assuming based on the input of "you know who." (are you Williamo1? should admins take a moment to check your IP?, or are you just a friend coming on board at the 11th hour?) At least I'm being honest about the situation (note: though Williamo1 threatened me legally because I accidentally wrote "London" instead of "Sault Ste. Marie" when trying to show him an example of the "golden rule" - "do unto others as you would have them do unto you"). Get these articles off Wikipedia and stop using them as soapboxes. Move on people... there is an entire other side to these stories which you don't see us spreading around the internet (and you'd be so upset if we did, so stop calling the kettle black). Did you even read the [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1</a> ]&#160;? These are comments made my other neutral people. Andyru 17:42, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SunbirdInc, I may be confusing you for someone local in Ottawa who is related to this mess. I assumed this based on your recent sign-up and only 1st post to the AFD page. Perhaps I'm wrong, you are a lot more coherant and analytic than the above crew. You're right ... I have been a bit ranty here. The closure of the AFD "should" mark my exit of following these articles on Wikipedia. The two major soapboxes have already been removed, this page on RGL may have some value here... that is what the AFD is for though... to decide just that. Until this AFD is closed though, I have no qualms responding to these anonymous personal "challenges" to me. But they should be kept to discussion pages, not project pages. Andyru 15:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
