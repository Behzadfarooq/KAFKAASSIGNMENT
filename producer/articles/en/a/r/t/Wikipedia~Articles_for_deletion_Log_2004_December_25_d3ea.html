<p>Start of How To article. Someone might suggest where it should be transwiki-ed, but it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. There was a previous incarnation of an article of this title, apparently also deleted/transwiki-ed: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_How_to_play_the_violin_June_16_Discussion_81ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/How to play the violin/June 16 Discussion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/How to play the violin/June 16 Discussion</a>. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:49, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was thinking <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a>, yes. Seems like a decent target to me. Also, we could develop a template for wikibooks similar to the one we use for wikiquote (instead of "Wikiquote has a series of quotations by or about X", it could be "Wikibooks has an instruction manual relating to X"). <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 05:26, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, rename and rewrite.</b> I suppose as a violinist I should weigh in here. The article could be called <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin_technique.html" title="Violin technique">violin technique</a> or even basic violin technique -- kill the how-to part of the title. It could cover the French and Russian schools, include a basic repertoire list, and dispense with the how-to style of writing. Potentially it is quite encyclopedic, if it is written as knowledge and not as an instruction manual. Don't really feel like tackling it myself right now though. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 03:23, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, rename, rewrite</b> is an excellent idea. I think a lot of the material from the section 'playing the violin' on the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a> article could be moved here. Do get rid of the 'how to' part: an encyclopedia is NOT an instruction manual. <a href="../../../j/_/l/User%7EJ_Lorraine_a27b.html" title="User:J Lorraine">J Lorraine</a> 12:14, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No, I think it's an honest entry from a serviceman/woman. Acronyms are very common in army parlance and only half-joking most of the time; <a href="../../../f/u/b/FUBAR_2b4b.html" title="FUBAR">FUBAR</a> and <a href="../../../a/w/o/AWOL_9edc.html" title="AWOL">AWOL</a> are just the tip of the iceberg. That said, I don't think the current entry or the topic as a whole is salvageable in any way. "The military mind" sounds much too vague and subjective. If there have been objective facts, studies, books, whatever on it, I'm all for rewriting. Pending such a rewrite, delete. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 01:52, 2004 Dec 25 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: It's a shifty dictdef of private vintage in this form. Of course the phrase is used, but it's not used in a special way, and particularly not in <i>this</i> special way.

<li>An absolute superlative. The observation that these acronymns exist in an hierarchy comes from Algeo &amp; Pyles, ed. <i>History of English.</i> Partridge is also absolutely chock-a-block with military slang.

<li>Delete this orphaned dicdef.

<li>Lexor is a total idiot who has no idea how to use Google. If you typed "protein linguistics" you do not get 1 result. You do not search Google by using underscores between words (e.g. protein_linguistics) <i>Comment left unsigned by 68.97.132.215</i> <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 01:47, 2004 Dec 26 (UTC)

<li>In my defense, you'll notice I used the autowiki link: [[Google:protein linguistics]] (note the absence of an underscore!), which generates the link <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=protein_linguistics" class="extiw" title="google:protein_linguistics">Google:protein linguistics</a>, this generates a search for "protein_linguistics" (with the underscore), rather than "protein linguistics" (which is a <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=707" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:707">bug</a> in the link generation software which I was not aware of).

<li>I think this is not so clear. My concern with this page is largely the opposite: the application of linguistics to biology, including proteins and others entities, is well established, yet this article makes it sound newfangled and conjectural. For example, probably the most widely used textbook in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioinformatics.html" title="Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a> is <i>Biological Sequence Analysis</i> by Durbin et al., which describes computational biology techniques explicitly in terms of linguistics. It was written in 1998. Having said that, a lot of the Wikipedia article does curiously focus on its authors work, esp. the link about "precision, recall and f-scores", and the manner of writing and focus on metaphor makes it sound somewhat quirky. Also, I don't see why we need an article about "protein linguistics" in place of a more general article on the application of linguistics to biology. At any rate, I wouldn't object if the article were deleted, but perhaps Natarajanganesan could write a more objective article (or perhaps he'd rather not). BTW, a more responsible article on linguistics &amp; biology is in <a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v420/n6912/full/nature01255_r.html&amp;filetype=&amp;dynoptions=" class="external text" title="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v420/n6912/full/nature01255_r.html&amp;filetype=&amp;dynoptions=" rel="nofollow">this Nature article</a> (it was one of the 15 google hits). <a href="../../../z/a/s/User%7EZashaw_2198.html" title="User:Zashaw">Zashaw</a> 01:54, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - as modern Swedish artists go, he's notable.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, can any conceptual artist be said to be "notable" in the terms that appear to be being used. This article is factually accurate, and this guy is notable within his sphere (I saw an exhibition of his in Stockholm whilst visiting family). Just because this artist doesn't have a legion of drooling fans creating massive numbers of webpages (and those that do exist are admittedly mostly in Swedish) doesn't make him unnoteworthy. This page just needs moving that's all. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 01:57, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article established that he was notable, I would change my vote to keep. If he's had a major exhibition in Stockholm, fine, put it in the article, and then we'd have info on something notable rather than some Swedish dude. Not all conceptual artists are notable, and this article doesn't say he is one anyway -- it says he's a "contemporary artist working within the field of new-media and the conceptual problematics therein", whatever that means.<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 02:03, Dec 26, 2004 (UTC)

When it comes down to it, this guy is not internationaly famous, nor is he famous in Sweden, but he is notable within his field.

<li>Delete: He is one founder of the abnormalAUDIO project. That's the closest thing the article offers for notability, and it requires external research to establish that that's meaningful. It's true that Wikipedia is not paper, but it's also true that, while we can be more contemporary than most, we still should be somewhat conservative. Most artists have original ideas or techniques, but we have to rely upon the arts community to act as a sort of peer review to separate the notable from the struggling.

<li>That's no valid argument. If it's fiction or not is irrelevant. Should we remove all of our mythology entries just because they are fiction, or characters like Tintin. It's mostly the notability that is relevant. Streets and busroutes generally shouldn't be included how real they may be. The example about removing Lithium (if serious) is absurd.

<li>Skrewts are not Tintin (there's a statement you don't write every day). I believe Antaeus wished to make the point that they are *only* part of the fictional world and do not project <i>at all</i> from the book they appear in. This makes the article nothing more than textual analysis. The article says what the book says. If this is okay, then <i>everything</i> of this nature should be included. There could be an article called shooting up (Naked Lunch), which would not be <i>about</i> heroin use in Naked Lunch, but would <i>enumerate</i> the shootings up. Enumeration is not encyclopaedic.

<li>Dr. Zen explained what I was trying to say, yes. The comparison of lithium with the Blast-Ended Skrewt is indeed silly, but if I left the impression that I considered it silly merely because lithium is real-world and the BES is fictional, that doesn't reflect the actual issues on which I base that judgement. I don't use the word fancruft anymore for a number of reasons, preferring <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html#GOOPTI" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">GOOPTI</a> instead, standing for Granularity Out Of Proportion To Influence. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithium.html" title="Lithium">Lithium</a> is not only one of the major building blocks of our world as an element of the periodic table, it has had a tremendous impact on human affairs from spending several decades as the <i>only</i> known effective treatment for certain mental illnesses. Now, I'm not saying that fictional constructs never influence the real world; that was apparently misread from my remarks. But how much influence has the BES had on the real world? Has it had the influence of a Tintin, let alone of a mythological figure? Hardly. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:56, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Blast-Ended Skrewts have had little or no influence on the world but that is a moot point. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a place were you go to get accurate information on different subjects. Is it totally inconceivable that one might actually want to know how a blast-ended skrewt look like? Maybe you are talking about them with someone, and you think, "Hmm, what did those guys look like?" (kinda silly i know&#160;:P but you get my point).

<li>James, David (and others): <i>please</i> try to accept that some people's interpretation of what are meant by certain deletion policies differ from yours and while they may not (always) be right, your views and interpretations are not canonical either.

<li>Sorry if I appear overly short, sometimes; a significant number of people, most of them rather new to the project, have of late started to push us into a rather more significantly "deletionist" than the one that Wikipedia was founded with, and it is most... frustrating, especially when, time and again, each newly-deletionist user uses the arguments that we argued with the last lot. However, this is not the place to be having arguments as to how you think we should change the policy to something different to how we wrote it, many moons ago. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 03:37, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess you didn't write it well enough "many moons ago", then. In my opinion, this article has "no potential to be encyclopedic" because the subject is too trival for an encyclopedia, not notable enough, which is what I said in the first place. My guess is that you couldn't get consensus "many moons ago" on what it means for a subject to be "encyclopedic"; so it was deliberately left vague, with some enumeration in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> of areas of agreement. The failure to produce clear criteria as to what Wikipedia is means that each case has to be argued now on its own merits, each time. We can agree, at least, that this is exasperating. As for whether the newbies are decidedly more deletionist than the oldbies, I cannot comment, being a newbie. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:50, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are missing the point of Wikipedia - it is not a paper encyclopedia - therefore it can never get to full. Nor can a subject ever be improportionately covered - Wikipedia is always growing, and improportion is only noticable through "Random Page". Therefore the only criteria which we should use (unless we believe ourselves to be infallible) should be factual accuracy, varifiability and occasionally clutter. The articles I am submitting are factually accurate - they begin by describing that the object comes from Harry Potter, afterwhich I describe them within the context of this world. You can varify the articles by reading a copy of Harry Potter (I can dig up page references if you so wish). They certainly do not clutter - no other article is likely to fall under the name 'Bubotuber'; if one does this will likely be secondary (so Bubotuber (Harry Potter). Thus, there is no reason to delete the article - it is a waste of your and our time: the article does no harm. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 01:04, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I've read Harry Potter. All 5 of them. This is mentioned as a sort of aside, to make the herbology (or something) class repulsive and boring. The information is better presented togeter with other little bits of similar information, so that people don't have to go running all over the Wikipedia to find the information on the Flora and Fauna of the Harry Potter Series. It's not a matter of totally expunging the information from the Wikipedia, it's moving it to a more useful location (in my opinion, anyway). <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">hfool</a> 03:27, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Dan, if you read through this page for a few days, you will see that "non-notability" is the main reason that articles are deleted, along with vanity and advertising. "Non-notability" is the main way in which articles are not "encyclopedic", which is specifically mentioned in the deletion policy. The "-cruft" suffix denotes various types of trivia and non-notability, "fancruft" being one of the most common. The article under discussion is "fan-cruft", meaning non-notable trivia. It is beginning to seem to me that what gets deleted as "fancruft" depends on who is voting on VfD on any particular day, and that, indeed, there are numerous people who think all fancruft should be included. Shouldn't there be a consensus on this, rather than every VfD vote rehashing it? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:49, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>I would certainly favour a reasonable consensus - by which I can't see how we can say we'll only put in notable academics, industrialists, geographical features, etc. when we'll allow anything mentioned in passing in a work of fiction in. That would certainly boost those who wish to mock Wikipedia in the press. But given the size of the user base, anything decided with less than 100 people voting would be utterly silly, so it would have to be a well populised vote. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 17:12, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>This kind of substub is moronic. There are around 200 countries in the world. Every one of them has a Defense Ministry, a Post Office, an Agricultural Ministry, and probably a few others. If someone is qualified to write an article on any of them, and wants to, he can. Great. Meanwhile, what is the point of an article that is indexed in Google under "Afghan Defense Ministry" and says in effect, "The Afghan Defense Ministry is the Defense Ministry of Afghanistan". It is verging on nonsense that could be speediable. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:36, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I disagree. We can all agree that the topic deserves an article. Obviously, this is not that article, but I don't think it's barren enough of facts to warrant deletion. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 23:08, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: The article says in its entirety: "Afghan Defense Ministry is an organ of the government of Afghanistan. The name applies to both the bureaucracy and the building in which it resides. Some of its functions include overseeing the Afghan National Army." Stubs are one thing, but anybody seeing the phrase Afghan Defense Ministry knows alll this without reading the article. The only actual information in the article is that the Ministry has its own building, which is, anyway, a reasonable guess. This kind of "article" makes Wikipedia look foolish and moronic. Why don't you add an article on "Kabul Police Department" while you are at it? Here's the text: "Kabul Police Department is the organ of the city government of Kabul which oversees the police department." Good grief. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:50, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. <b>Delete</b>. I believe it is completely barren of facts other than what is clearly implicit in the title.-- Robert Pendray 23:54, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Substubs are not nonsense, but I do believe they fall under "very short articles with little or no content" of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. Hence, they are speedyable by admins who wish to do so. (Or so is <i>my</i> interpretation, at least.) Of course they are also expandable by contributors who wish to do <i>that</i>. Speedy or expand, your choice. What I <i>am</i> strongly opposed to, however, is listing these things on VfD. This is a policy/precedent discussion, not really a discussion on this specific article. BM, could you do me a favor and, in the future, consider taking this to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_b56c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Candidates for speedy deletion">Wikipedia talk:Candidates for speedy deletion</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia_talk%7ESubstub_9736.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Substub">Wikipedia talk:Substub</a>, a vote, a village pump post, or something similar? I don't think putting these things on VfD is the best course of action. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 02:05, 2004 Dec 26 (UTC)

<li>Surely anything that is speediable, as you say this is, should also be eligible for regular VfD deletion. If an admin sees this here and wants to speedy it, I don't have a problem with that. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:24, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it is, and I'm not saying this VfD is <i>invalid</i>. It's just that VfD is a whole lot more administrative overhead. And now that it <i>has</i> been put here, I don't think it would be wise for an admin to speedy it. For one thing, there is no agreement here over whether it should be kept or deleted. This VfD has to be taken to the bitter end, I'm afraid. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 15:24, 2004 Dec 26 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you're missing the point, Dan. People are not arguing that the Afghan Defense Ministry should not have an article, they're arguing that the current article is not acceptable, and that even <i>no</i> article would be better (presumably because the red links would alert people that a new article could be created). "Starting" an article is too trivial to count for anything, if you don't put in <i>something</i> that at least <i>hints</i> at a direction for expansion. (For example, see <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Frankfurt_9e40.html" title="Harry Frankfurt">Harry Frankfurt</a>). <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 12:16, 2004 Dec 26 (UTC)</dd>

A timeline of upcoming elections is something that would be of use and interest, but someone actually has to make the article here. As mentioned above, the 2004 version wasn't well used (though I suppose someone could fill it up after the fact). If no one wants to sit down and make the list, then it should be deleted. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:37, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The policy BM quotes from is 'Wikipedia is not a place for conducting business'. Elections are not commercial enterprises! <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> 09:55, Dec 26, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If it's known any given election is scheduled in 2005, this is only because of the <i>previously</i> enacted, currently applicable law. That such an election is coming up will be notable and relevant to the state of the polity in question <i>as of the time the election is listed</i>, not just later. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 11:44, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As the Elections in 2004 wasn't almost completely empty and the Elections in 2003 doesn't exist, that suggests this will remain empty. If someone actually makes the effort to show that these will be filled and improved, good, keep it. But as it is, these articles will just annoy anyone following the links. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 17:17, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. (Please) I created the Elections in 2004 page about a week ago and haven't had the chance to fill it yet so you can't draw any conclusions from that. I created the 2005 page and intend to put in planned elections even where the date is uncertain (the list is ordered by country). These pages spring from the respective year pages which state 'X elections held/to be held this year' which I found to be annoyingly incomplete without a link to where they actually are. <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBtljs_9e53.html" title="User:Btljs">User:Btljs</a></li>

<dd>I did link several sources on their website, which can be removed if there is a consensus that such links are inappropriate. I did in, addition, put "Request a catalog" on the bottom (really because I love their catalog and many others have said the same), which can also be taken out if necessary. However, I am in no way affiliated with IronMind, other than being a happy customer, and they are certainly a notable organization - the long list of institutions that testify to using their products <a href="http://www.ironmind.com/ironcms/opencms/IronMind/Main/institutionalCustomers.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ironmind.com/ironcms/opencms/IronMind/Main/institutionalCustomers.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> should be sufficient affirmation of that.

<dd>Further, the statement <i>They are renowned by weightlifters for their innovation, product quality and customer service</i> is factual and representative of a majority viewpoint; it is part of the reason the company is notable. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_194a.html" title="User:Ground">Ground</a> 00:44, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>But you haven't removed the "renowned" sentence. How do you know this statement is true? What is the source for it? If it is based on your personal assessment of "weightlifter opinion", based on what other weightlifters have said to you, that is unverified and unverifiable <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> and is not admissable. Statements made in the Wikipedia must be based on verifiable public sources, nor personal impressions. For example, if a recognized journalistic source about weightlifting has surveyed weightlifter opinion regarding the quality, innovativeness, reputation for customer support, etc, and that is the finding, then you can report the finding and state the source. Otherwise, it is indistinguishable from the P.R. puffery of the company, and is no better because you don't work for them. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:17, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<p>Why not talk about the Captains of Crush controversy? Used to be that you could get the cert if you had the gripper closed from parallel to close (the hardest part). Unfortunately, they decided that they'd change these rules and all subsequent closes had to be done with a credit card between the handles, widthwise, before start. This means for many that they'd be in a mechanically disadvantaged position and interestingly enough NOBODY has closed the #4 with these new rules. Many who were 1/8" or less on the #4 before the rule change abandoned the quest.</p>

<p>I am aware that the website has been reviewed in 2004 already and has passed a community review, however I believe that certain things have changed that may warrant a re-review of whether this website should indeed be listed.</p>
<p>The main reason for that is that ironmind.com appears to be a link farm - look at this example of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=http://www.ironmind.com/ironcms/opencms/ironmind/forms/tramadol-ultram/&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=edi&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=http://www.ironmind.com/ironcms/opencms/ironmind/forms/tramadol-ultram/&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=edi&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">related pages</a> in Google to see what I mean. Searching for ironmind.com on Google also yields a lot of results showing how aggressively this website is advertised, as such I am confident to say that the entry on Wikipedia - especially since its suitability for an encyclopedia was already disputed at one point - only exists to boost its Google <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagerank.html" title="Pagerank">pagerank</a>.</p>
