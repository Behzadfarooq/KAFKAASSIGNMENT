<p>This page provides little or no context. It attempts to cover a subject already covered throughout Wikipedia, but instead results in an article that can be summed up by the title, like "The community of editors in Wikipedia." Wikipedia doesn't need an article about its own community, plus, it might be a conflict of interest, as it is edited by the community. <a href="../../../v/o/x/User%7EVox_Rationis_5531.html" title="User:Vox Rationis">Vox Rationis</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/x/User_talk%7EVox_Rationis_fcd6.html" title="User talk:Vox Rationis">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vox_Rationis_1a05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vox Rationis">contribs</a>)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> While certainly there are concerns with NPOV regarding something that is relatively close to home, and there are going to be some users who want to stack the books, the subject of this article is itself not inherently a problem. Wikipedia is notable, and one aspect of that is the people on it, or the "community of Wikipedia" . Now it could belong on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> as a section of that page, but I think there is enough information on this subject that this would have to be a spun-off sooner or later. As it stands now though, this page is minimal in terms of content, so I don't mind too much if it's deleted now, but I wouldn't say it is a problem to include the subject on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:41, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The "Wikipedia Community", while known in Wikipedia's circles and surely worth mention in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article (where it already is mentioned), it is <b>not</b> notable enough for its own article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The synthesis of tidbits of outside information is practically the definition of original research. Yes, there are sources - great. But these sources don't support the article as a whole, just small parts of it. Recreate when multiple reliable, independent sources piece this info together. Delete as long as its Wikipedians who are doing it. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 02:20, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, for now. The article is only a few days old, so I suggest we watch it a while and see how it turns out. People who have concerns can contribute and suggest changes. If it is not considered suitable in a few weeks/months, nominate again. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Move</b> to project space. As an article, it looks like it must fail <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> until some later time, and it is far more mired in conflict of interest issues than other Wikipedia articles about Wikipedia. It could always be moved back in the future if it looks like it is possible to properly source it. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see any useful content that isn't already at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, where it belongs. Sub-articles are normally only created when the relevant section on the main article becomes unwieldy; this is not the case here, so there's no reason to move that information out into its own article. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 13:36, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
