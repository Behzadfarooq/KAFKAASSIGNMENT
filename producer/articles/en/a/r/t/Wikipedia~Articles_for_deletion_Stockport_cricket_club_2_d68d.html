<li>But no cricket club without a website has an article... It is also different for Pakistan, Bangladesh and West Indies where use of the Web for such things is far less.

<li><b>Delete</b> I feel I need to explain the structure of English cricket. At the top level, there is the County Championship. This is equivilent to the Premiership. There are 18 counties. In addition, there is a minor counties championship, perhaps equivilent to football's lower professional leagues. Very few players in minor counties cricket are professional. Then, below that, is league cricket. These are Saturday afternoon cricketers. This is where Stockport is. Now, there is no promotion between these levels. Therefore, Stockport cricket club can <i>never</i> become any more notable than they are today. I understand that the previous keep was on account of people not really understanding <i>quite</i> how insignificant this club is... <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">smoddy</a> 13:05, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I understand perfectly well, and there is no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't cover clubs like this. This should not have been renominated. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 15:37, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I undeleted it because 11-7 is not consensus for anything, and the original poster has no right to ask for it to be automatically deleted if other people have also edited the article. I have no opinion on whether this should be allowed so soon after the first vfd debate, or on the article itself. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 13:09, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not really. Most cricket clubs in the country are that age. My town club was founded some time in the 1860s, yet Monmouth Cricket Club is red. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">smoddy</a> 13:59, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>But Wikipedia has hardly started crawling yet. It will have much more depth in 10 years time. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 15:39, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps WP will evolve into <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, but it isn't there yet. Consider (1) that many places that have such clubs are stubs, and (2) we have a single article on a minor county. Look at the <a href="http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/sports/others/cricket.html" class="external text" title="http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/sports/others/cricket.html" rel="nofollow">number of cricket clubs in Greater Manchester only</a>. Now further consider that at the next level down, the top club league in Lancashire is the <a href="http://lancashireleague.com/" class="external text" title="http://lancashireleague.com/" rel="nofollow">Lancashire League</a>. I can't find which league Stockport are in, but it's below this. Starting from the bottom and working up isn't a very clever approach to writing articles. Revisit this issue in 10 years perhaps, but not now. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 18:19, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was not under the impression that Wikipedia as a whole used any specific "approach to writing articles". Nor do I believe that arguments such as "there are more notable things without articles" is a valid reason to delete any article. The correct response would be to <i>write an article</i> for the more important cricket clubs if cricket clubs interest you, and leave the valid stub be either way. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 23:35, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe your original reasoning was "cricket clubs are inherently notable", though it would be interesting to see you justify and elaborate on that comment.

<ul>
<li>Tony has pointed out the verifiability of such clubs. It is trivial to make the articles NPOV. Uppland has noted that the clubs typically have a great deal of longevity, including the one in question. If those qualities are not enough to create an assumption of noteworthiness that must be overcome in order for me to agree with deletion, I don't know what qualities would be. Also, if people went through and re-nominated every article that finished VfD as "no consensus" (or worse, <i>deleted the article anyway</i> as you did with this one), VfD would be an even more aggravating place to spend time than it is now. I hope you're not really suggesting that articles be nominated time after time until they reach consensus. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 23:35, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> again.

<li>Yes, about half-notable clubs. This article can never be verified, because no sources exist. The club will never become even remotely notable. This isn't just a "lower division" club. This is a "right down the bottom of the scale" club. Improving our cricket coverage will never, I repeat, never, encompass this sort of article. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 19:09, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a cricket club. It's simply incorrect to say that it isn't possible to write a verifiable article. <a href="http://www.cheshire-cricket-board.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.cheshire-cricket-board.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Cheshire Cricket Board</a> lists the club's name and a contact name and address, and gives match summaries involving the club's teams. It isn't a prestigious county club but it's active in local league. If someone wants to write about it, I see no reason why they shouldn't. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:34, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed it does appear to be in Cheshire rather than Lancs. However I count about 56 clubs in Chesh. plus 12 unafilliated clubs. There are 53 traditional counties in England and Wales, so we're saying that you've just requested about 3000 rather mundane and difficult to verify articles, whilst bearing in mind that <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire_County_Cricket_Club_814a.html" title="Cheshire County Cricket Club">Cheshire County Cricket Club</a> itself doesn't have one yet. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 20:47, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether Cheshire County Cricket Club has an article or not is irrelevant. When someone wants to write an article about it, an article would be written. Just because no one has yet isn't a good reason to delete other articles. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 23:35, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We're discussing whether to delete <i>this</i> article, not whether a further 3,000 articles should be written. If someone wants to write a verifiable article about a small cricket club, I personally have no problem with that.
