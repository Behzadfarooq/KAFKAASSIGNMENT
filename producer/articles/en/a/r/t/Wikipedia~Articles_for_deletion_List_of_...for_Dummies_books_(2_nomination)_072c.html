<li><b>Keep</b> Two of grounds for deletion are incorrect. It's certainly verifiable, given that you can check the titles against the publisher's catalog, which is certainly reliable enough. Not to mention the Library of Congress, Amazon, and whatever else is available to the book ordering trade. So we have only WP:ISNOT, particularly 1.7.3 to argue about. And that's where I can say as a list, this has some potential use, if any of the titles warrant further elucidation, even a whole article. I'd suggest making this part of the main article, but then we'd have problems with that growing unmmanageable. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>BTW, since the Publisher's catalog might remove books once they're out of print, I'm not inclined to rely on it. Still, the <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...for_Dummies_1cf8.html" title="...for Dummies">...for Dummies</a> article could use a bit more about the categories of books. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:40, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as I advocated before. This is a mirror of a list which is available online from an authoritative source. The list at the publishers is complete, accurate and up to date - our list is not guaranteed to be so as new books are published all the time. Previous and present keep arguments often rested on the fact that ...for Dummies books are notable; that is not questioned, but <b>we already have an article on ...for Dummies books</b>, this is just a list of them at an unspecified date. There are precisely zero bluelinks to individual books, making this list considerably <i>less</i> useful than the one on the publisher's website, which has a short synopsis for each book. This list violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as both a directory and an indiscriminate collection of information (why this particular publisher's catalogue?). This is simply a copy and paste of the listing on the publisher's website on an unstated date; "<b>do not add copies of primary sources</b>". <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 08:25, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per the previous AfD. This is one of the true publishing success stories of the last 20 years. We obviously need the list if we want to be a serious reference work, that goes beyond video games characters, obscure porn stars or irrelevant diploma mills. Nominator cites wp:not without referring to a specific clause- not really surprising since none apply. Concern over lack of sources may be valid, although nothing prevents the nom from adding sources. In fact, few of our hundreds of book lists have sources, essentially because the publication of the book proves its existence. Examples include <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cookbooks.html" title="List of cookbooks">List of cookbooks</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_memoirs.html" title="List of political memoirs">List of political memoirs</a>, or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_books.html" title="List of fictional books">List of fictional books</a>, etc. Ongoing discussion on talk page showed interest in improving the list, something this nom ignored when making this nomination. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are comparing a list of political memoirs and fictional books? Those lists contain notable authors and political figures created by wikipedia. This list is stolen from one publishers page without asserting any significance. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Those lists are incomplete, lack clear inclusion standards and have no references. This list has the potential to be complete and has clear inclusion standards. Otherwise, you are certainly entitled to fail to see the significance of the Dummies series, but the significance is clearly implied, not the least because we have an article on the series. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:24, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point was that this list, unlike those, has fewer problems with the completeness of the list. If it's missing a title or two, that is easily correctable, and more likely because a new title was just released than any actual problem. And there's no question that the <i>...for Dummies</i> series is itself notable. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:29, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The series is notable that's why it has an article: <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...for_Dummies_1cf8.html" title="...for Dummies">...for Dummies</a>. This is a list taken from the publishers website of titles. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 01:44, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>and since people may have an interest in knowing whether a particular book in the series has been published, well, I see the purpose of this list. Sorry, but the summaries in the main article are incomplete, and making them exhaustively complete would just be excessively detailed.

<li><b>Keep</b> or delete the entire Wikipedia database.

<li><b>Delete</b> - If the publisher's list only included current in-print books and we listed out-of-print books, AND we included ISBN references and listed authors for each individual title, AND we had articles on individual books then I might be inclined to change my mind. But right now it's just copyvio listcruft, and according to the article it's over six months out of date.

<li>On a personal note, I am apalled by the lack of civility in this AfD discussion. But I agree with JJay; the clause of WP:NOT needs to be identified if it is to apply as evidence for supporting deletion. And while he has contributed subsequently to the downfall of civility in this discussion, I don't agree that JJay's original Keep vote insulted anybody. His points were all rational regardless of anybody's judgement on their applicability. --<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitch_5ab1.html" title="User:Kitch">Kitch</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/t/User_talk%7EKitch_10d3.html" title="User talk:Kitch">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kitch_c2c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kitch">Contrib</a>)</sup> 12:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
