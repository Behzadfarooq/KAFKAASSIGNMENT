<p>No sign of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> -- i.e. it doesn't look like there are (any) non-trivial outside sources about this school that we can use to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article. A Lexis-Nexis search shows no non-trivial coverage even at the local level. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22collier+high+school%22+wickatunk+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22collier+high+school%22+wickatunk+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">143 unique ghits</a> for <i>"collier high school" wickatunk -wikipedia</i>, so unlikely this school has any non-trivial outside coverage. Reply to de-prod comment "interesting and unusual for being run by a non-profit corporation rather than by the state or religious institution; mergable/redirectable to parent organization" -- it's not for us Wikipedians to judge what's notable by virtue of being "interesting" or "unusual" -- <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">if publishers outside of the school agree that the school is unusual and therefore decide to publish things featuring the school, then we've got something to build a Wikipedia article on.

<li>No, all schools are NOT notable. There is no policy, guideline, or anything like that on Wikipedia that says that. So saying that "all high schools are notable" is NOT a valid argument, and is the same as saying that all people are notable or that all companies are notabile. I really hate people who use this BS argument. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 05:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Interesting. We just deleted a couple of non-notable high schools. Schools are no more inherently notable than libraries, hospitals, or churches. I've been here a while, and as far as I know, only municipalities, provinces or states, and countries can claim inherent notability. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 19:49, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The school is apparently for "students with difficulty adapting to public schools." I am not clear which categories of students are served by the school. The implication is that school systems that can't handle a student (for whatever reason) pay to send the student to this school.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Such a criterion would include all private schools, where many students attend because of some incompatibility with the public school system.

<li><b>Delete</b> Article is not supported by any independent sources (let alone non-trivial independent sources), and I, like Pan Dan, find none.
