<p>This article was made by one user who also claims to be the creator of the very system that it talks about. Speedy was removed, as was prod twice, but I still have questions about this article's notability and other information related to it. I may add several other articles to this list if speedy tags are removed from them as well. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 06:43, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have added the other article to this AFD, as the speedy was removed by the same editor who removed the prod. I am unsure as to whether or not this person is the author, though. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 06:45, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I've been in discussion with the author about the concept of federated system models and decentralized models and everytime I refer back to the article, it has notice. The author does claim he invented the concept, but has willing remove any such claim to allow the article to stay. - reader <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.186.238.190 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.186.238.190_0990.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.186.238.190">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>But that is not the issue here. The issue is whether or not these articles should be included as part of Wikipedia based on actual notability and use of these things, despite the author being the creator of the concepts. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 06:57, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Point taken. The naming is similar to other articles in Wiki. The concept actually mainly refers to a decentralized software model. Whether it's notable, I'm not the expert, but being a software developer, the concept is intriguing. - reader <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.186.238.190 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.186.238.190_0990.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.186.238.190">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>The intriguing or naming is also not the issue either. It is an issue on the truth behind the content, as well as what appears to be <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>. Also, please sign your comments with four tildes (~~~~). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 07:08, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a interesting term. I'm not interested in enforcing anything, but the definition of vanispamcruftisement is highly subjective. I, we, thought that wikipedia was an all encompassing encyclopedia of all things, big or small to big or small groups. I agree, ownership should be removed, but notibity is also subjective. You do what you see fit, but I'd change the name to have it suit the concept better and leave it for the public to decide. I can't help mention that Open Space Technology started on a similar foot as a concept and is still considered unimportant on wikipedia, but it's there and I can say it's in practice where I work.206.186.238.190 07:28, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is an all encompassing encyclopedia, but there are issues that concern the notability, etc. of this/these computer system(s), particularly due to the fact that the original author created the program(s) in the first place. I realize that it is subjective, but when an author publishes his own work to Wikipedia, he has more to gain from that than anything else. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 07:30, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I really don't want this disputed any further. Just delete the article. I don't understand why it is such an issue to publish a concept by the author or creator of that concept who of course would know it best, and I mean any concept by anyone. Anyone can dispute ownership, but I really don't care who claims ownership over this. It's a concept, not a product, to freely share amongst the public and wikipedia looked like a good medium for it. Again, just delete it, both Federated Model and Decentralized Model, which I agree should have been named Decentralized Software Model, though I still think Federated Model is as notible as <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federated_school.html" title="Federated school">Federated school</a> which is really a type of federation, but I'm not disputing a thing at this point. Also, how do I delete my account? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Demelo_c453.html" title="User:Robert Demelo">Robert Demelo</a> 07:49, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Wishy-washy word choices in industry shouldn't be in the encyclopedia"&#160;?? OK, lets look at this for a sec. Encyclopedias are full of "Wishy-washy" industry words that are NOW considered non-"Wishy-washy". For example the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ether.html" title="Ether">Ether</a>. What is the definition of "Wishy-washy" anyway and where does it say they can't be in an encyclopedia. Talk about irrational!!64.231.64.244 05:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The desire to redirect a rambling article about a model of a system to a concise article about the system itself seems utterly rational. I am certain that a sentence like: <i>"Decentralized systems do not lose control of it’s internal processes, functionality or data, they communicate with external systems, decide whether to use external data or functionality and vise-versa."</i> was <i>never</i> used to describe ether. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:56, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> because a <a href="../../../s/y/s/System.html" title="System">system</a> is not a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model.html" title="Model">model</a>. <i>Definition: A physical model is used in various contexts to mean a physical representation of some thing. That thing may be a single item or object (for example, a bolt) or a large system (for example, the Solar System).</i> In this case, the Decentralized Model or Federated Model refer to the physical enbodiment of decentrlized or federated <i>things</i> of which a system is a <i>thing</i> comprised of smaller <i>things</i>. We don't have to define the <i>what</i> of a Decentralized Model to merit validity to the context(s) of the <i>decentralized physical representation of some thing</i>.64.231.64.244 04:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The word "system" is sufficiently broad to encompass all "things" which a decentralized model could model. We <i>could</i> have an encyclopedia with one article for every notable concept or object in existence and a seperate article for a model of every notable concept or object in existence, but I think most people would find an encyclopedia like that to be rather silly. Another layer of modeling is also possible. One could create an article for a "Model of a Decentralized Model." Why not? Models also exist in the real world. When I was a kid I had a model of the human heart. Before building the model, I created a model of the model on paper. Should Wikipedia have a "Heart Model Model" article? Or just an article on the heart? <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:56, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that this discussion has been going on for this long validates the reasoning to <b>keep</b> the article. It appears to me that no one has thoroughly verified the sources to this definition and the fact that a good portion of this encyclopedia is thinking that a <i>system</i> is a <i>model</i> in this case re-enforces the rationality in favour of this document though it's examples refer to systems directly, it is the context in which the system(s) is/are being referred to that matters. Let me remind you that it is NOT the definition that is relevant here, but the need for the subject and it's context of meaning to exist on Wikipedia so to develop the world's most comprehensive encyclopedia of world knowledge. The definition of what is non-encyclopedic is highly subjective and I strongly insist that the determination of what warrants representation in Wikipedia be <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientifically.html" title="Scientifically">scientifically</a> rationalized. 64.231.64.244 05:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your final sentence, when analyzed logically via <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllogism.html" title="Syllogism">syllogism</a>, reaches the conclusion: "I strongly insist that the highly subjective be scientifically rationalized." <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:56, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let's apply <a href="../../../d/e/d/Deductive_reasoning.html" title="Deductive reasoning">Deductive reasoning</a> which is much more detailed than <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllogism.html" title="Syllogism">syllogism</a>, which is <i>possibly</i> a more analytical derivative of <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllogism.html" title="Syllogism">syllogism</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">Scientific method</a> should be applied when determining article acceptance to Wikipedia. 64.231.112.181 01:31, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
