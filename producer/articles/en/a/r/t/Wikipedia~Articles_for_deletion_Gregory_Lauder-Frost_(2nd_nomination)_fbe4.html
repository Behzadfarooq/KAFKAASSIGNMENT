<li>I'm going to vote <b>keep</b>. The article has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair, with GLF and his friends adding a disturbing amount of trivia, dubious assertions and unverifiable original research. There's little question that much of the current piece is vanity, and should either be deleted or significantly truncated. Notwithstanding this, Lauder-Frost is a public figure (of sorts) in the United Kingdom: he once held a leadership position in a fringe organization, and has been cited in the mainstream media numerous times. This article is in desperate need of revision, but the subject is above the threshold of notability in my eyes (unfortunately). <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 02:42, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nothing wrong with this article. I strongly disagree with Lauder-Frost's politics myself, but he is politically important and significant.

<li>Incidentally, Baumfabrik, though I hold no brief for GLF, he is not a "maggiphile" if by that you mean a fanatical admirer of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> - he is a different kind of conservative. On the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Democratic_Alliance_9b06.html" title="Conservative Democratic Alliance">Conservative Democratic Alliance</a>'s web forum, he (ironically, considering his fervent anti-Communism) expressed admiration for the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>'s blocking of Western TV signals and suggested that we in Britain should do the same thing with American-style satellite channels.

<li><b>Delete</b>: vanity. A genealogist and accountant who, 15 years ago, held a couple of positions within one <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Monday_Club_21bd.html" title="Conservative Monday Club">British fringe political organisation</a> (with fewer than 600 members) and held an honorary post in another; resigned after being accused of cheque fraud, and rejoined a couple of years ago. Lauder-Frost is an untiring self-publicist, contributing to Wikipedia <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Robert_I_edba.html#Gregory_Lauder-Frost" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Robert I">under a number of names</a>, but he is politically unimportant, and I do not believe he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He has never held local or national political office. No BBC news programme appears to have interviewed him since 1992 <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/contributor/607487" class="external autonumber" title="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/contributor/607487" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

GLF gains 1420 G-hits, but once again they all seem to be either Wiki mirrors or self-penned postings to various blogs, forums and genealogy web pages. This isn't a notable individual - it's an individual desperate to appear notable. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 14:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>Please get it right. When he resigned t=from the Monday Club, the leading Tory pressure group int he UK at the time, it had over 1600 members of the National Club plus those in the branches. Lightoftheworld 16:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>:I have commented on the Talk Pages, all ignored and abused. But points in the above need comment. Lauder-Frost resigned from the Monday Club (at the time had 1660 members and about 45 members of both houses of parliament) before any arrest or charges were brought. He has appeared in several news interviews in the past decade. As for letters to the editor, these equate to a public statement by the individual. If in a political position they carry importance. As for friends/supporters of GLF supporting his entry, how does that differ from this concerted attempt by similar politically-minded friends on Wikipedia ganging together to destroy it? <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">Sussexman</a> 06:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Based on the length of the article one would think Gregory Lauder-Frost is the most important person in UK politics today and one of the most important people who has ever lived. The article is mostly filler of little interest to anyone outside of Lauder-Frost's immediate circle and while <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> I guarantee you that no one but a vanity publisher would ever put this article in print. Editors who were banned by the ArbComm from this article have been flouting the ban by editing as anon IPs from a dynamic ISP and a circle of Lauder-Frost's friends and supporters have expanded this article to excruciating lengths and are tenacious in defending the inclusion of the most trivial of details such as who attended what dinner. The only surprise is that they have not (yet) posted the menus on the rationale that they give the reader a sense of the importance and dignity of the occasions. The article is unencyclopedic in its length and content. Homey 14:53, 4 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

<p>GLF was a very prominent figure on the respectable Tory Right. He consistantly supported the traditional wing of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party (UK)</a> and spoke out constantly for his beliefs. He was a principal officer and activist in the most prominent Tory pressure group ever. No (referring to comment above), he was not an MP (selection has been tightly controlled by liberals since the mid-1980s) but he did more for Toryism than any of the time-serving careerists who do absolutely nothing for conservatism.</p>
<p>Lets be absolutetly honest here. He/his article has been attacked almost from inception by the likes of CJCurrie and his friend Homeontherange, as well as GroundZero on every pretext they could possibly think of. Homeontherange tried before (December) to get this article deleted when it was a fraction of its present size. Now he is trying again. (He has also attacked just about everyone and every group with any association with GLF with the most self-righteous, cynical, and sarcastic comments imaginable). Homeontherange has now used as his principal arguments vanity/flattery and lack of sources. Yet when more sources were added following that complaint he deleted them anyway. (Please name me one article that displays as many sources as this biography?) As for the vanity/flattery bit I would argue its garbage because I cannot see anything there that is untrue: it is a political biography of a figure who was extremely active in his cause.</p>
<p>Now I understand that some of you may be Left-wing and see Lauder-Frost as 'the enemy'. That he may (have) been. But give him credit for supporting what he believed in, just as you do. Thiose interested in British politics will normally have heard of him. One further bonkers comment by the detractors: that of "anonymous" posters. You all know this is just yet another excuse to attack those you don't like. Please grow up. We are ALL anonymous. Calling yourself 'The Mummy' and flagging up a template saying you're a native English speaker tells us nothing. Get real and get decent. Wikipedia's policies, so many of you say, are "civility" and "good faith". I don't see that present in so many of the detractor's comments. Lightoftheworld 15:59, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
<li>"Those interested in British politics will normally have heard of him." I'm sorry, but that statement is simply untrue, for the very good reason that he's never achieved anything - unless you count attending dinners, writing letters to newspapers and contributing to obscure periodicals which probably count themselves fortunate to have a circulation running into four figures. You just don't get it, do you? It's nothing to do with being left or right wing. To take an example - and I stress I am not comparing the two men in terms of their beliefs - I personally have a deep loathing of Nick Griffin and all he stands for, and in terms of the political process he's a nobody; I do believe however that there needs to be an article on him, because any survey of the British political and cultural landscape which leaves him out will be seriously deficient in explaining the events which affect anyone who lives in modern Britain. On that criterion, GLF is simply a nonentity. I realise he's important to his friends, as we all are; unfortunately that doesn't make him interesting to anyone else, and Wikipedia doesn't exist to provide a fan site for anyone. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 20:17, 5 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>Almost certainly this <b>entirely new</b> "Stephen Burnett" is a sock-puppet of one of the detractors. Of course everything Lightoftheworld has said is absolutely correct. GLF was very prominent in his day and he was a research assistant for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Biggs-Davison_64e8.html" title="John Biggs-Davison">John Biggs-Davison</a> for two years at Westminster. He is well known. I once attended a meeting, about ten years ago, at which <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Redwood_dc2f.html" title="John Redwood">John Redwood</a> was the speaker. During questions he sat and answered them, and looked totally disinterested. Then someone quoted GLF. Redwood's face actually lit up and he stood up, to answer with difficulty. This is not a fan mail from me but a statement of fact. <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">Sussexman</a> 07:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I notice from your user page that you claim to be a lawyer; perhaps, then, I ought to excuse you for having picked up a few dirty habits. Trying to discredit someone by slinging mud without a shred of evidence, in the hope that some of will stick, may be a well-established legal practice. It's less successful in an environment with more rigorous standards of debate, and a proper right to reply. As I have a user identity and a posting history going back 12 months, accessible at a click, it's not even very bright, as smear tactics go. Let's be charitable: perhaps you've misunderstood the term, and you simply use it to describe anyone who doesn't agree with you. Still, thanks to you we have yet another of GLF's great achievements to add to the record: the mention of his name once caused John Redwood to get off his backside. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 19:32, 6 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

My area of expertise is African comparative religion and history; I am not particularly interested in British politics, but I know how a good article should be structured. I am becoming a little tired of you describing me as "scum", "evil", "Marxist" and a "coward and a smearer" because you don't agree with the way I have edited your autobiography. If you have specific criticisms of my editing, let's discuss them on the GLF Talk page - I'm sure we can agree on content and wording - but lay off the personal attacks on me, the nominator and other editors. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 09:24, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I endorse Humansdorpie's version. It seems to me that by cutting out all that trivia GL-F's achievements are made more apparent. Edwin Hale 8 June 2006.</li>
<li>Having waded through the article itself and the comments thereon it is clear to me that although he appears to be rather dotty Mr Lauder Frost has a place in the polis and so deserves an entry in the wikipedia. Nevertheless the present entry is far too long and self-serving. It requires severe pruning. It is also clear that there is a concerted campaign by his detractors and the left to have the entry deleted on personal and political grounds. That shabby attempt to impose censorship should not be allowed to succeed. The entry, suitably abbreviated, should remain. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.133.182.60 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.133.182.60_0f1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.133.182.60">contribs</a>) 08:15, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
