<p>Though Mr. Mona is the editor of two magazines, he is not-notable outside of a small group of people, mostly RPGers. Some one like <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Gygax_b6d5.html" title="Gary Gygax">Gygax</a> is notable because they have been mentioned in pop culture. But Mr. Mona isn't notable by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a>. Not all Editors of Dungeon or Dragon magazines need to be listed in Wikipedia, if any need to be, only the important ones should be. <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 23:44, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No offense <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranden_7134.html" title="User:Branden">Branden</a>, but you probably don't really rate a page either, under <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, vanity information. Your page seems a bit vain and self-serving, espcially when it was started, and has been edited under a lot of IP addresses.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work".

<dd>In addition to being editor of two magazines, Erik Mona has written several works for RPGs <a href="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&amp;creatorid=593" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&amp;creatorid=593" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Also see the number of works credited to him on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/102-4323079-2056917?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank&amp;field-author-exact=Erik%20Mona" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/102-4323079-2056917?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank&amp;field-author-exact=Erik%20Mona" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As for not being notable outside of RPGers, I guess one would have to define what constitutes a "small group of people." Judging from Mona's body of work, I would certainly say that he mets that standards for notability.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbstrd_a943.html" title="User:Robbstrd">Robbstrd</a> 22:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Out of a world population of 6+ Billion, how many of them do you think have heard of Erik Mona? I would say the number is around a couple of million, most, if not all of them gamers, like myself, who keep abreast of what goes on in the rpg industry. The rest probably wouldn't care who he is. I don't think that meets the standards of notability.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 01:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Mona edits the single largest and most prestigious publication in the RPG industry: <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28magazine%29.html" title="Dragon (magazine)">Dragon (magazine)</a>. A simple Google search of the works he has authored turns up multiple independent reviews, which according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> is criteria for notability. "Faiths and Pantheons" + "review", for example, turns up 3,520 hits. A Google search of "Erik Mona" turns up 34,900 hits. If this article is deleted we would in effect be saying that no RPG authors except perhaps Gygax merit an article. As to RPGers being a "small" group of people, there are millions of RPG players worldwide. Because of his role at <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paizo_Publishing_25ef.html" title="Paizo Publishing">Paizo Publishing</a> as Chief Publisher, Mona has one of the most influential roles in the entire RPG industry serving these customers. Delete nomination here is well-intended, but off the mark. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 23:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So did Roger Moore and Kim Mohan and others, but does that mean they deserve articles here? Big wigs like Gygax, Arneson, Greenwood, Weis and Hickman, Adkinson, THEY deserve articles. IMHO, Mr. Mona doesn't. Dragon has plenty of independent reviews, but has it won any awards since he began editing them? So, if we keep this article, then we should be creating articles for all RPG authors? I'm an inclusionist and I don't think they all should be.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 01:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So it seems we disagree, and I respect your right to a different opinion. As I see it, Moore has authored numerous publications and probably deserves an article; not sure about Mohan. I agree with you about Gygax, Arneson and Adkinson; I don't know enough about Greenwood, Weis and Hickman to have an informed opinion. But fortunately we don't have to have to reach consensus on the relative importance of any given RPG author, which is an inherently subjective exercise. WP:Bio sets out the suggested criteria, and it would seem that Mona meets those criteria (multiple independent reviews of his work). <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 02:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. And not just because I think Erik is a swell guy. &#160;;) Actually, it really doesn't matter whether or not Erik has a wikipedia article, nor I suppose does it matter whether <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Holian_d871.html" title="Gary Holian">Gary Holian</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Jacobs_b7a0.html" title="James Jacobs">James Jacobs</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_K._Reynolds_998f.html" title="Sean K. Reynolds">Sean K. Reynolds</a>, etc have articles on wikipedia. I do think that the reasons for deletion presented thus far are flimsy, especially compared to the reasons presented against them, and I don't want to see a precedent made of deletion for the sake of deletion. Perhaps if there were more people clamoring for deletion, it wouldn't seem like a lone crusader's goal. Erik's had a not insignificant body of work, though admittedly it's not enormous by comparison to a lot of other folks: <a href="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&amp;creatorid=593" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&amp;creatorid=593" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>

<dd>Also, <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeon_%28magazine%29.html" title="Dungeon (magazine)">Dungeon</a> did win an <a href="../../../e/n/_/EN_World_2d40.html" title="EN World">Ennie</a> award at <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gen_Con_0fbf.html" title="Gen Con">Gen Con</a> last year, so there's at least one award. BOZ</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Though an award is an award, an "Ennie" is an industry specific award. And I don't think a deletion will be happening, as it already has more <b>keeps</b> then <b>deletes</b>, unless a bunch of ppl come on and vote for it to be deleted. As for Erik being a swell guy, I have no way to verify that, and it also has no bearing on the AfD&#160;;-).--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 06:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, for the all the reasons already outlined above, Mr. Mona is a major figure in the gaming subculture. The fact that many of those who exert influence on the game lack entries indicates an area for expansion. It does not imply that one of those actually with an entry should get excised.
