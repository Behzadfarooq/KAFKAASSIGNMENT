<li>Huh? It's not a neologism, and is a topic of psychopathology and (for better or worse) in the popular press. This VfD nomination seems bizarre. <s>Keep.</s> -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:42, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC) ...... Sorry, I was so amazed by the notion that "phobia" was a neologism that my normal mental processes shorted out. I still think this is a bizarre nomination; but any new and sound content of the article should be <b>merge</b>d with that of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a> or that of relevant articles linked from <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a>, and it should then be redirected to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:48, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please highlight what is "bizarre" about this nomination: it seems to me to be an invented term (i.e. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>) and a quick <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a> only returns 200 or so hits, most of which do not appear to be for the usage as defined within the article. If it isn't I invite people to supply references in this VfD and I will happily stand corrected change my vote. Any "bizzareness" will be revealed by the outcome of this VfD. Also, please bold your vote (Keep or Merge) for clarity. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 10:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry about the lack of bolding, now corrected. But perhaps you and I are using different google tests. My own gets <i>one million</i> for "phobia". The word is hardly new: the <i>OED</i> says it has been in use for over two hundred years, defining it as "Fear, horror, <i>or aversion</i>..." (my emphasis). But perhaps you're treating its use for a mere attitude as a novelty. Let's see what the new article says: <i>Usially</i> [sic] <i>it</i> [sc. "phobia"] <i>is described as fear, dislike, disapproval, prejudice, hatred, discrimination, or hostility towards the object of the phobia.</i> Thus it overlaps with the psychopathological usage of the word: the extension of a word with a strong meaning to everyday uses is normal in language: cf "starving", "famished", etc.; which I think are about as commonly used to describe the humdrum sensations I'm experiencing right now than they are for Oxfam's areas of concern. Here's Coleridge in 1801: "I ... have a perfect phobia of inns and coffee houses" -- thanks to his considerate addition of "perfect", this sounds like an attitude to me. So the word is widely used and two centuries old, the extension to mean mere "dislike" (etc.) doesn't seem new, and thus the description of the word or usage as a neologism seems bizarre. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:30, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)

Obviously some confusion here, a lot of it caused by the nature of the article in question which is why I think, given the lack of actual material within, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a>
<ul>
<li>Ah, I'm starting to follow. But only starting. There doesn't seem to be any claim in the article, though, that "phobia attitude" is a set phrase. The creation of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobic_attitude.html" title="Phobic attitude">phobic attitude</a> as a redirect to this article seems bizarre, since that phrase too seems little used. The article seems pretty innocuous, though: a collection of the dislikes of prudes and others. It also seems superfluous. I've no idea why the author would have wanted to create it. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:48, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Phobic attitude" it is just a phrase, like "tall grass"; don't be picky. If you don't like this particular concatenation you are welcome to replace it by <b>[[phobia (attitude)|phobic]] [[attitude]]</b> . I am immensely surprised that you people don't see the difference between <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agoraphobia.html" title="Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a>. Not to say about <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.html" title="Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia">Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 16:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Given the above, I'm inclined to believe Phobia (attitude) refers to the phrase (phobic attitude) rather than being a qualifier for word phobia. The article itself gives no clues as to what phobia (attitude) refers to. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 11:52, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Look into <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitude_%28psychology%29.html" title="Attitude (psychology)">Attitude (psychology)</a> and look into the previous version of (medical)<a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a>. If you think that I missed something, please improve. 16:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All you can derive from the <i>Attitude</i> article is that a phobic attitude would be a manifestation of fear vis-a-vis a given object. Ergo, a phobic attitude may consist of, say, running away from a lion. If someone is a "homophobe," he would run away screaming from homosexuals. The previous version of the phobia article (that you mentioned) is utterly flawed and a wikipedia article is no evidence that you are right (if wikipedia articles were always right, none would be edited and none would be deleted).&#160;;-) <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 20:20, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Indeed, that <i>is</i> what you do if you misuse "<i><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobic.html" title="Phobic">phobic</a></i>" to refer to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice.html" title="Prejudice">prejudice</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatred.html" title="Hatred">hatred</a>. <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a> is a misnomer/neologism that has (unfortunately) a wikipedia article. Equating hostility with phobia confuses people and makes them think that, for example, the <a href="../../../k/k/k/KKK_5ce8.html" title="KKK">KKK</a> is merely frightened of African-Americans (or that the KKK's hatred stems primarily from its extreme fright). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 22:17, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extremely strong keep</b>. I specifically cut out this piece from medical phobia in order to <b>clear-cut separate the medical from non-medical usage</b> of the term. Each and every "pseudo"-"Xfobia" or "anti-X" article, like <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a>, started from one and the same phrase <i>"XXfobia is fear or hostility towards XX"</i>. And now you are telling me that phobia (attitude) is a neologism. The medical <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a> article contained all these pseudo-phobias. So the topic is perfectly valid. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 16:30, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sigh... There is a <b>major</b> distinction between saying that being anti-X is defined as anti-X and saying that being X-phobic is defined as being anti-X. A=A; A does not per-se equal B. Also, other flawed wikipedia articles shouldn't be cited as proof. Rather, they should be changed/deleted. At least you admit that they are "<i>pseudo-phobias</i>." The question is whether <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo.html" title="Pseudo">pseudo</a>-phobias and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologisms</a> should be on Wikipedia. At most, articles like <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a> should begin something like: "<i><b>Afrophobia</b> is a popularized neologism that is often used to refer to...</i>." <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 20:32, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sigh...Grunt... Since it is fashionable now to slap the label "phobia"onto any kind of dislike, we need one single article that says what you have just written: that this usage of the word phobia is <b>not</b> medical, that these are not "phobias" in the long-sustained meaning. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:34, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sigh...Grunt...Bypkl6qy&amp;uge@ri... An addendum to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a> will fill this need quite well.

<li>I'm in favor of taking out large sections of excessively long articles and putting them into articles of their own, but this is not what's happened here. You're pulling out one use of a term and giving it its own article like a 2nd entry in a dictionary or something, specifically apparently because you don't like what you see as a confusion between the "real definition" and a false "popular definition". This looks a lot like POV pushing, although I'm sure that wasn't your intention. Your arguments make sense, but they're unconvincing. I'd prefer to see the material at Phobia#Non-clinical_uses_of_the_term be expanded and clarified rather than to see it split off into its own article...and at such time as it is sufficiently large to warrant its own article, I'd like to see a discussion of how to name that article on Talk:Phobia. I think that something with the word "Prejudice" in its name would be a much better title for such an article, however, than something containing the word "Phobia". <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 21:52, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>No,no,no. I can read a dictionary myself. I cannot, however, find one that defines phobia as (to quote from the article in question): "<i>Prejudice, hatred, discrimination, or hostility</i>." A phobia is something that leads one to experience emotional responses correlated with extreme fright: Increased <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulse.html" title="Pulse">pulse</a>, high <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_pressure.html" title="Blood pressure">blood pressure</a>, extreme sweating, trembling, etc. That type of "strong aversion" can be defined as phobia. I doubt that most racists experience these symptoms when they encounter objects of their hatred. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 18:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK. It seems you almost nailed me here. But I added some of these from all listed "pseudophobia" articles, quoting:
<ul>
<li><b>Afrophobia</b> is an fear of or hostility toward...</li>
<li>Caucasophobia ... denoting hostility towards</li>
<li><b>Christianophobia</b>, also called <b>Christophobia</b>, refers to fear or hatred of</li>
<li>Islamophobia is a contemporary neologism defined as prejudice against</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>etc. These definitions are phrased differently, but you have to agree that basically they speak of something common, a kind of negative attitude to the object of "-phobia". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 05:14, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ok. To tell you the truth, Mikka, I think that all of the articles that you've cited should note that they are <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologisms</a>. I see that what you have done by creating this article is try to make a link for people so that they understand what "phobia" is meant in all those various articles. Your efforts are admirable and I see that you have only tried to be helpful. However, I think such an article is liable to confuse people and lead them into thinking that defining phobia (even as an attitude) as "<i>prejudice, hatred, discrimination, or hostility</i>" is technically acceptable. Therefore I suggest the following (and I hope we can achieve some consensus on this): The common (but technically flawed) use of the term "phobia" should be placed prominently in the wiki article <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a>, and discussed more thoroughly there. The links (<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a>, etal.) should also be placed in that section. You have mentioned that this usage of the term is too inconspicuous in the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">Phobia</a> article, and I hope this suggestion would resolve that. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 06:04, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>You don't have to tell me the truth;-) yes, they are neologisms, so what? They are in wikipedia, not deleted.</li>
<li>"technically acceptable" thingy: Words have their semantic ranges. (I feel very uneasy when I have to teach someone English, which is not my native language.) Take the word "<a href="../../../c/r/e/Cretinism.html" title="Cretinism">cretinism</a>" and tell me how many usages of this word are "technically correct", i.e., refer to the deficiency of <a href="../../../t/h/y/Thyroid.html" title="Thyroid">thyroid</a> <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormones.html" title="Hormones">hormones</a>? The same with "phobia". Want it or not, all dictionaries quote two meanings: the "techically correct" one, ie a kind of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disorder.html" title="Disorder">disorder</a>, and "common parlance", i.e., "fear, dislike, or aversion", which does not necessarily produces high blood pressure and sweating.</li>
<li>I am also well aware of a natural resistance of many people to propagating new meanings of the words. The life of a language is a combination of both flexibility, to accommodate the changing world, and conservatism, to keep the language from turning into a mess. Therefore I am not planning to wage edit wars over the issue.</li>
<li>I am aware as well that some people go over the board with words, and I anderstand your concern about encouraging the "nontechnical" usage of the word. Recently I have found an amazing example at this <a href="http://www.changethatsrightnow.com/shortdescriptionlist.asp?phobiaid=1821" class="external text" title="http://www.changethatsrightnow.com/shortdescriptionlist.asp?phobiaid=1821" rel="nofollow">lovely website</a>:

<li>This completely misses the point.

<li>In this relation I would suggest you think about reasons for the existence od <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> pages.

<ul>
<li>If you feel that strongly that the content of Non clinical usage of the term should not be included in the article, the proper way to handle this is by taking it up on the talk page. Since it's a bit late for that, perhaps you would consider renaming those parts of the article you've taken out and put in Phobia (attitude) and putting a disambig note at the top of the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">Phobia</a> article. I wouldn't personally be in favor of such a move, but I wouldn't oppose it as strongly as I oppose what you've done in the absence of discussion. (And no, let me clarify, I oppose what you've done, not the fact that you did it without discussion. If you'd be willing to discuss a change of name for the article and to put a HUGE {{cleanup}} on the resultant article, I'll be more than happy to reconsider my vote, and possibly to even urge others to do so as well.) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 09:37, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> back into <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a>. Use of words belong to Wiktionary.

<li>On that note, although it's not particularly germane to this discussion, I would say that <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Phobia (disambiguation)">phobia (disambiguation)</a> should point to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">Phobia</a>, <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html" title="-phobia">-phobia</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice.html" title="Prejudice">Prejudice</a>.

Am I the only one who sees this whole thing, not just Phobia (attitude), but even worse-so <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Phobia (disambiguation)">Phobia (disambiguation)</a> as a potentially HUGE can of very slimy worms? <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 09:44, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>
