<li><b>Delete</b>. The problem I have with all of these is that people like me who aren't interested in Digimon have no way to know which of the characters are notable without doing mind-numbing research on the subject, which none of us want to do. But the people who <i>are</i> interested in Digimon think that every last Digimon character is absolutely above the threshold of notability for inclusion in a general encyclopedia like Wikipedia. It makes no sense to me that we have a notability test for the biographies of actual people, and we have no such test for Digimon (etc) characters. This undermines the Wikipedia in a major way. How many times have you read something like: "(fill in the blank) is definitely more notable than Machinedramon, and we do have an article on Machinedramon". Digimon/Pokemon characters (along with Star Trek episodes) are almost the paradigm example of things which ALMOST ANYTHING is more notable than. For this reason, my opinion is that no individual Digimon character is notable enough for a general encyclopedia and every single last one of these articles, including this one, should be <b>deleted</b>, <b>transwikied to Wikimon</b> (or something) or else <b>merged</b> into one or a few summary articles about Digimon. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:48, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Most of these Digimon articles resemble utter gibberish ("Drambuiemon is a mutant digimon who is derived from the Great Volovoron. His powers were granted by Drabblemon. He fights little pink newts. Attacks: Lice, Peanuts. He lifts in baby form.") and it's hard to tell which ones are notable. Indeed, it would be hard to know if there weren't someone generating hoax Digimon articles. (Pop quiz: Without checking, are you able to tell whether the example that I gave is a hoax?) As it is, these articles are fiction masquerading as fact. I've added {{cleanup-context}} to several as I have seen them added, in the hope that at least it would nudge the Digimon-Dumpers into <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#Check_your_fiction" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">checking their fiction</a>, but that hasn't happened.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't like it, but Digimon are notable. Hordes of kids are obsessed about them. However, a seperate wiki or notability standards would really help.

They seem to have the taxobox thing down. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:19, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That may be true, but nobody is proposing that <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digimon.html" title="Digimon">Digimon</a> be deleted. It seems a logical fallacy to conclude from the fact that Digimon is notable and merits an article that every single aspect of Digimon, including all the separate characters, is notable and merits its own article. Just because the Digimon company keeps churning out characters so that they can sell comic books, TV episodes, trading cards, and action figures, doesn't mean that Wikipedia needs an article on each one of them. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:07, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seems like a vanity article, the place doesn't even offer their own courses, they re-sell other college's courses. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinboy_5d8c.html" title="User:Spinboy">Spinboy</a> 04:37, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It <i>was</i> created under inauspicious circumstances, at "Internatonal" Biblical Online Leadership Training (!), and I noticed it after the creator salted an entirely inappropriate wikilink at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distance_education.html" title="Distance education">distance education</a>. However, it checked out as legitimate and notable and I wrote out the adspeak and added what little I quickly picked up. They appear to offer not Vanguard courses, but their own courses for credit through Vanguard. The limited set, in Canada, of small quasi-universities that teach towards a larger uni's post-secondary degree are all absolutely notable. That it's new and, rarely for Canada, private, religious and distance learning makes it more notable. I'd like to dig again and take part in expanding this article over time. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 04:59, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Btw Spinboy, you added to the article that they are "for-profit". In the Canadian context, that would add even more notability, but I can't confirm it elsewhere. (.com means nothing, and "Inc." is a corporate title for non-profits too.) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 05:05, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. No evidence of notability, and it probably isn't. How many Vanguard graduates have these courses on their transcripts? For that matter, how notable is Vanguard?

<li>At the very least, the information should merge/redirect to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanguard_College_8717.html" title="Vanguard College">Vanguard College</a>, but at this moment that's one of the last post-secondary institutions in Canada that hasn't been created. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 17:39, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think it is a bad idea for Wikipedia, to include some information about every passage of the gospel. A lot of (Christian) people might very well be interested in such articles, and if Wikipedia can provide good, neutral information about every passage, then I think it is only positive. Also, the article is in my opinion not a low quality article, and include some good references. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStereotek_fc8d.html" title="User:Stereotek">Stereotek</a> 08:24, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Besides, if someone wants to read the Bible, but doesn't have their own copy, wouldn't it be good for them to have a resource that they can refer to that has commentary built in? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalefries_e401.html" title="User:Stalefries">Stale Fries</a> 15:41, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is a worthy project, but not appropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Comedy_c383.html" title="Divine Comedy">Divine Comedy</a> is a good example of a work that is Encyclopedic in scope, where one can literally write pages of material for every passage. Indeed, there is a 6 volume encyclopedia that does just that. But if someone where to try and do that on Wikipedia, it likely would not be accepted. In the same sense, The Bible is certainly the greatest literature in the world, but I don't see Wikipedia as a "bible encyclopedia" (they do exist). There are many specialized encyclopedias in the world. I would say keep if this was a "notable" passage. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 09:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, there certainly aren't any references, or any names that the article mentions that make these claims.

<li>Hi OldakQuill, you mentioned that there is no reason why not every verse shouldn't have an article. But don't you think it belongs somewhere else, like Wikibooks as suggested above? Since for one thing we wouldn't even include the full text of the Bible here, let alone commentary... -- <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittySaturn_4d7a.html" title="User:KittySaturn">KittySaturn</a> 10:14, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, there is no reason why every single verse cannot have an article if they are well written, factually accurate, and varifiable. I do not think it should be on Wikibooks as these would be essentially encyclopaedic articles - Wikibooks serves to hold coherent projects on non-encyclopaedic isseus (such as WikiJuniors and language learning). A full text of the bible is located at Wikisources - we could add anchors to the text at each verse and link straight to them. Verses are so short, in general, that their full text may be included in the encyclopaedic articles about them. Nothing in the Wikipedia deletion policy justified the deletion of this article. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 10:41, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have studied the Bible at University - not some trailer a Fundamentalist has set up in his backyard, but a well respected secular University in Australia. The Bible is both historical and literary. The level of detail that Biblical scholars (from all theological persuasions) have worked on in the past 4-500 years is almost unmatched in any other area of human scholastic endeavour. We're not talking about "Crackerbarrel theology", we're talking about the study of divinity. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 05:48, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Imagine that there is a Wikipedia entry for every verse of the Bible.

By starting at the <a href="../../../1/_/_/Genesis_1%7E1.html" title="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</a> link, and following the Next Verse links, it would be possible to read the entire Bible in Wikipedia, in several different translations at once, but with an enormous amount of redundant summarizing.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Dare I call it bible-cruft? It is unencyclopedic to have articles on specific Bible passages, and I'm appalled at the idea that someone is going to start writing articles on every passage in the Bible. If someone argues that if it is unencyclopedic to have an article about every Bible passage then it is unencyclopedic to have one on every Star Trek episode: Yes, true, that is what the despised deletionists have been trying to tell you. A general encyclopedia gives an overview and summary of every topic of note within human knowledge. But general encyclopedias are just one kind of book in the library; they don't aim to *be* the library. Wikipedia does not replace the Internet or the Library of Congress. Among the other books in the library besides general encyclopedias are "encyclopedias" on specific topics, the "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction", the "Encyclopedia of Jazz", or the "Encyclopedia of American High Schools", etc. Is Wikipedia a general encyclopedia? Or is it the "Encyclopedia of X for all X? The two are not the same, and the inability to decide is tearing the place apart. The "Encyclopedia of X, for all X" should be organized differently than a general encyclopedia, for one thing. Somehow this must be decided. Regarding this specific article: it is original research. Even if it were cleaned up, it shouldn't be an article. If this passage it is an especially notable passage, it should be covered in one of the serveral articles that we already have on Bible topics. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:31, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, as the creator I obviously want this to be kept. I am shocked that some see this as original research, since I am far from a Biblical scholar and am not even a believer and couldn't do such research if I wanted to. Almost all the information comes from the two sites I listed as references. While I would be delighted to see an article on every verse, I do not intend to create them any time soon as I do not have the expertise or the interest, but I hope that this pilot article encourages others to work in this area.

<li>I would have to say that the charges against this article are pretty much settled, based on what I have have seen. The author has just stated that almost none of the research is original, and that all of the third-party research can be found at the two links at the bottom. Also, about the dilemma of having an "article to discuss every Bible passage" has been at least been fixed by having larger portions of text for each page, essentially condensing the amount of "paper" used.

<li>Hesitant <b>keep</b> ONLY if this is considered a major verse (also isn't this the verse you see on billboards, etc?). There are tens of thousands of verses in the Bible and I do not support the idea of every one having an article. Being included in the Bible is not, IMO, necessarily a sole criteria for notability. Perhaps the creation of a Bible-Wiki should be considered if that's the case. But I'm OK with keeping articles on major verses, but I'm not well-versed enough with the Bible (no pun intended) to judge whether this is one or not. Also, interpretations of the Bible range so widely that I fear the more controversial ones would turn this place into a battleground. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:32, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Desperately needs merging as suggested above. Bible verses date from the 16th century and are not appropriate "units" for discussing Biblical text; they are useful as references, not as snippets misconstrued as being meaningful in isolation. As we says elsewhere, "the impulse of people to conceive of verses as units of syntactical meaning, though baseless, is strong... Interpretation of isolated verses often leads to imputed meanings that are at odds with those that would be derived from the same words in their Biblical context." If Wikipedia is to have useful articles concerning Biblical content, they can't be based on verses. Previous experiments along these lines have pretty effectively demonstrated this. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:09, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extreme Keep</b>. The Bible is one of the most widely read books in human history and its contents have been at the basis of many decisions made by leaders throughout this history. Sometimes these actions can depend upon the interpretation of a particular verse. Many of you do not realise that Bible commentaries come from a wide variety of commentators, from conservative evangelical to atheistic liberal. Every commentator seeks to explain what a verse is about and understand it from a linguistic, grammatical and historical perspective. I am one who will argue very strongly for Wikipedia articles that cover every verse in the Bible (which does not mean an article for every verse). Because Wikipedia is not a religious publishing company, these articles should (eventually) reflect every single point of view about the verse, along with refutations of every point of view. If you go to your local university library you will find many books from many different points of view that examine certain books and verses in the Bible, and what they mean. Go to <a href="../../../s/i/z/Wikipedia%7ESize_comparisons_8076.html" title="Wikipedia:Size comparisons">Wikipedia:Size_comparisons</a> - you will find that the 10,000 monographs on Chemical compounds are listed as a potential growth area in Wikipedia, along with each of the 20,000 human genes, 24,500 common law legal terms and so on. These should get a mention, why not Bible verses? There is a growing multitude of Christian theology-related articles and many of these articles refer back to Bible verses. Maintaining NPOV will be a problem, but even if an article on a verse is written badly, then the solution is a re-write, not a deletion. Ask this question - in ten years time when Wikipedia hits 100 million articles, do you expect that Bible verses be included in this? Please check my userpage for the many Christian theology related articles that I have been working on. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 05:37, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>differing POV's between Christians and other religions - which is something which <b>must</b> be discussed and above all accepted.</li>

<dd>What does that phrase even mean, "but which deserve equal respect?" Do you have any basis for asserting that this is the view of "most Christians," or are you prescribing what you would like it to be?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Significant Bible passages appear to be legitimate topics for articles (not necessarily every single verse, but in many cases individual verses are important). But an <i>emphatic no</i> to the template suggested by RHaworth. The articles should not represent "a consensus of what professing Christians believe"! There is no way that could be NPOV, and where does that leave Jewish interpretations of passages in the Hebrew Bible? The articles have to represent the views of academic Bible scholars and historians. <i>References</i> to reputable scholarly publications are essential here. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up land</a> 09:23, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I voted for delete above. However, I think the most notable verses of the Bible or comparable works do deserve an article (I wouldn't vote to delete John 3:16), but absolutely, absolutely not every verse - I don't see why an encyclopaedia would do something like that. If someone wants to do a project to explain every Bible verse, they should set up another wiki elsewhere on the web, and it will be a lot more effective because people wanting to know about Bible verses will go there, whereas people don't expect an encyclopaedia to have this sort of material. It is not a matter of Wiki is not paper; if appropriate an encyclopaedia will include it even if it is paper, just like volumes after volumes of the printed Oxford Dictionary. Anyway, instead, in my opinion, there can be articles that discuss more than one verse, or a chapter. However, I am still of the opinion that this kind of articles belongs to a more specialised site than one like Wikipedia. As an example, there seems to be an abundance of maths articles in Wikipedia, but people who want to know about this mathematical term or that mathematical object will tend to go to a site that is specifically mathematical like MathWorld, so those articles in Wikipedia seem actually somewhat useless. -- <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittySaturn_4d7a.html" title="User:KittySaturn">KittySaturn</a> 10:38, 2005 Feb 6 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b>. Strong delete. Whatever. Listen, we can make a WikiBible if you guys want. But the base nature of Wikipedia is that it's an <i>encyclopedia</i>, not a textual commentary. Furthermore, the WikiBible Project would be its own self-contained project about specific knowledge regarding a specific field. It is simply too big of a project to include a Bible commentary in the Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not meant to engulf PubMed, and it is not meant to engulf an ongoing Biblical commentary. We already have things like <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodom_and_Gomorrah_832d.html" title="Sodom and Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, et cetera. That is how the Wikipedia is meant to operate--with encyclopedia articles.

Among the top of the 74k+ hits for "Playmate of the Year" are reports from major news organizations about Ms. DeCesare's troubles.

<li>I think that there's a distinction to be drawn between what is gossip-worthy and what is <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">notable</a>. Most of this article is the sort of "She had a fight with another woman over her boyfriend." factual information that makes someone gossip-worthy but almost never encyclopaedia-worthy. (I'm sure that <i>thousands of millions</i> of women down the ages have had tussles with other women over their boyfriends. There's nothing at all special about this particular case.) The sole claim to notability here is the Playmate of The Year title. And that, because of the status of the magazine and the notability of the title itself, raises this woman above the notability bar, if only barely. <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playmate.html" title="Playmate">Playmate</a> or <b>Weak Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:00, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment. It is just manufactured pseudo-notability. Every year, Playboy declares one of the models to be the "Playmate of the Year". This gets their core readership all abuzz, I suppose, as to whether Miss April was really better-looking than Miss October, etc, and they all run out and buy the PotY issue. A year or two later, the PotY ends up getting publicity for being involved in a fight in a bar, which kind of tells you something if you are paying attention. It's just marketing, and the fact that you think the person who is selected by this pseudo-process is notable just makes you a victim of mass marketing. Nothing personal. On the other hand, Wikipedia doesn't need to let itself be a victim of mass marketing. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:47, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Notability in a way is a product of mass marketing - you cant be notable unless you have a product that can sell to the masses (eg. books, records, films, theories etc).

<li>Not really. If you want to be considered current in American Literature or Journalism, you can't really remain ignorant about the winners of the Pulitzer Prize. It is conceivable that there are circles where you have to be up on who won PotY three years ago, but I doubt it. If there are such circles, those people are probably not going to expect to get the information from an encyclopedia.

<li>I hope this isn't sounding prejudiced. But a book about homoeroticism (even in a historical context) is going to have a significant boost to its Google hits for no other reason than its got gay stuff in it. Gay people will push it, Homophobes will denounce it. I say 3,000 is really not enough to count as notability. Has it won prizes? That would up its notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is an article about a book. So the question is whether the book is notable. It does not seem to have been on any major bestseller lists when it was published a bit more than two years ago. Its current Sales Rank on Amazon is 45,000 or so. This means not very high sales, although they might have been higher in the past. The publisher is Haiduk press, which has published just two items. (The other one is "Lover's Legends Unbound", a CD collection of stories about male love, edited by Calimach and others.) We have an article about the author, although Wikipedia being what it is, this doesn't mean he is notable. The article doesn't mention that he has written anything else, other than the CD collection, which is based on this book. It says that he is an "independent scholar", meaning he does not have an academic appointment. The book was nominated for the Lambda Prize, which is awarded for gay and lesbian literature, indicating that the book might be notable within the gay and lesbian community, even though it doesn't seem to have achieved any kind of general notability. I don't know; it looks like we have three articles: one about the author of some underground chapbooks and basically one book (which might be self-published), an article about the book, and an article about a CD collection of readings based on the book. Sure doesn't have "notability" written all over it. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:40, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>For me, a commercial and/or critically successful work is actually <i>more</i> notable if it's self-published.

<dd>Well, you are right that self-published works (if that is what it was; I am only speculating) are not very often critical successes. But how do you know this book was a commercial and critical success? The Amazon sales rank doesn't suggest it was; but perhaps it sold a lot of copies at gay and lesbian book stores. As for critical success, are you going by the Lambda Prize? That seems to be the only indicator of critical success, and to be honest, I have no idea how prestigious that is. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:49, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I might be wrong, I suppose, but considering the massive number of books in print, I think a sales rank of 45,000 at Amazon is actually pretty darned significant for a self-published work of gay scholarship which hasn't exactly received <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah%27s_Book_Club_2e97.html" title="Oprah's Book Club">Oprah's Book Club</a> levels of publicity. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A good article might be written on relationships and/or similarities between Hinduism and Judaism, or failing that, an article might be written <i>about</i> claims that Judaism developed from Hinduism, if such claims have any following or currency among Hindu chauvinists, or New Age pseudohistorians, or whoever. This article, however, reads like an argumentative essay, lacks scholarly rigor, and cites no sources, not even for its quotations.

<dd><i>I call for deletion of this page on the grounds that it has no potential to expand into something encyclopedic. I suspect there is next to nothing known about this unfortunate kid except that he died in infancy. In those days even a lot of royal children died in infancy, do they all get an entry? It might be argued that this one was a bit exceptional since he was heir to the throne. However James IV had about 4 children who died in infancy, who were all heir during their lives of a few hours to a few months, James V had 2 sons who died in infancy, 1 of who was heir. Also, it misspells his name, it should be Stewart. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 11:58, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)</i>

<dd>I still fail to see why this information should be removed from the Wikipedia. Even if the child himself does not merit an article, any Wikipedian can perform a merge and redirect. Any Wikipedian can also move pages to correct spelling errors in titles. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 20:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The older twin of a 15th Century king of Scotland who died in infancy merits a mention in the article on that king, perhaps, but this article doesn't seem very expandable, and the subject well below the threshold of notability for biographies. Did this unfortunate infant become celebrated in any way at all? Seems like no more than a footnote in a (thick) history of Scotland rather than an article in a general encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:04, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Centauri, there are (literally) hundreds of millions of "documented" historical figures. All my great-grandparents were "documented", in that their birth, marriage, and death certificates are in the public records.

<dd>Please restrain your sarcasm. I strongly doubt your grandfather was the member of a royal family.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 00:06, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not being sarcastic. And which is your argument, that he's a "documented". Or that he was a member of royal family? "Documented" would mean that any person who is known from historical records and/or who receives the slightest mention in any historical book or article should have a Wikipedia article about them, even if all that is known about him or her can be captured in one sentence. For example, we should have an article on William Shakespeare's wife, since she is a historical figure who is documented and at least gets mentioned in any biography of Shakespeare. "Member of a royal family" means that there should be an article about every child (grandchild? great-grandchild?) of every monarch in the history of the world, even if he or she did absolutely nothing, and even (as in this case) if he or she died in infancy. If either those seem too extreme, feel free to come up with more reasons to keep this article. Maybe eventually you'll find one that makes some kind of sense. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:30, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My position has been stated above in a clear and concise manner. If you wish to discuss your opinions concerning the general notability of historical figures please post them to my talk page. Oh, and denying that you are being sarcastic and then ending your post with a sarcastic comment is a bit self-defeating. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 01:47, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Since you accused me of sarcasm when I hadn't been sarcastic, I decided I might as well let her rip, especially since you present such a juicy target. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:16, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Linguistically this is not the same as OSV word order as objects are not the only post-verbal elements that can be moved to the front of the sentence (the example in the existing stub for instance, which fronts a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prepositional_phrase.html" title="Prepositional phrase">prepositional phrase</a>). It is merely a linguistic device used in English and some other languages to put emphasis on that part of the sentence (e.g. "I can't see Jill." "And what about Bill?" "<i>Bill I can see</i>".) However in all my experience studying linguistics I've never heard it called "split order of a sentence" and indeed, Google only shows <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22split+order+of+a+sentence&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22split+order+of+a+sentence&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">two unique sentences</a> on the Net using the phrase.

More importantly, I think that <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_Subject_Verb_3d66.html" title="Object Subject Verb">Object Subject Verb</a> is the better target of the redirect than <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_grammar.html" title="English grammar">English grammar</a>. The latter is simply both too general and too specific. It's too general, in that the reader then has to follow further links to find information on sentence ordering since <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_grammar.html" title="English grammar">English grammar</a> has nothing specific (and, ironically, ends up at <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_Subject_Verb_3d66.html" title="Object Subject Verb">Object Subject Verb</a> anyway, passing through <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subject_Verb_Object_e71c.html" title="Subject Verb Object">Subject Verb Object</a> along the way). It's too specific, in that it describes <i>English</i> grammar, when "split order of a sentence" doesn't necessarily imply <i>English</i> at all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:46, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Google search indicates to me that this is terminology from someone's textbook, by the way. Depending from the popularity of the textbook, people may or may not be calling it that. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:46, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it was a particularly popular textbook and the term was widely used because of that I'm sure there would be more than two sentences on the Internet using it. Linguists usually just call the phenomenon of moving something to the beginning of a sentence "fronting" and use more specific terms like "object fronting" only when further specification is needed. And I'm still not convinced that <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_Subject_Verb_3d66.html" title="Object Subject Verb">Object Subject Verb</a> is the right place for this, since this kind of fronting can occur even in sentences with clear Subject Verb Object word order, for example "To John I threw a ball." Where "I" is the subject, "threw" is the verb, "a ball" is the object and "to John" has been fronted in the same way as the original example. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 19:54, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>I'm still not convinced that <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_Subject_Verb_3d66.html" title="Object Subject Verb">Object Subject Verb</a> is the right place for this</i> — It's better than <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_grammar.html" title="English grammar">English grammar</a>, though. If one starts at any of the alternatives suggested, and attempts to find articles that specifically address sentence ordering, and specifically <i>this particular</i> sentence ordering, that's where one eventually ends up. (And, indeed, there is where one finds the text that talks about the implication of non-normal word ordering in English.) <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_grammar.html" title="English grammar">English grammar</a> isn't even the next best candidate.

<li>Yes, you are right. <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_order.html" title="Word order">Word order</a> is a better place for this. Vote changed. I don't feel creating a fronting article should be done until more information can be gathered on it; for now it would be better to place what little information we have in the context of another article. Of course, the same phenomenon could be mentioned on <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_Subject_Verb_3d66.html" title="Object Subject Verb">Object Subject Verb</a> but it shouldn't be the main place for information on focus fronting. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 16:04, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I see. A cause for above results might be that in the demoscene, realnames are traditionally detached from scene names which means that demosceners seldom appear with their realnames mentioned, neither next to their productions, nor to any articles published about them - with the exception of user pages where the entry of a realname is mandatory. That means you will not find as many hits for a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Leonard+Ritter+paniq" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Leonard+Ritter+paniq" rel="nofollow">realname AND an artist name</a> as you will find for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+paniq" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+paniq" rel="nofollow">group and artist name</a>, where you wont find a lot about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+Leonard+Ritter" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+Leonard+Ritter" rel="nofollow">group and realname</a>. Additionally, collaborative releases are more common and informations about those often omit member names. Therefore searches for the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+demo" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+demo" rel="nofollow">group itself</a> are most fruitful. It is obvious from such results that, especially in the demoscene, a directory of artists associating them with their reallife identities is needed. There is virtually no place on the net where you can find out about those people. -- <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPaniq_4446.html" title="User:Paniq">Paniq</a> 22:20, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>For biographies, my opinion is that they should establish notability in a verifiable way so that a person reading them can determine whether the person is notable. The authors should be given some time to do this -- we shouldn't jump on an article and nominate it for VfD within minutes or hours of its creation. But it shouldn't be many days, either. It is not my responsibility when voting to go out and do research to determine whether the subject of an article is notable. If you are an expert on this, then edit the article to include verifiable information that paniq is one of the 4-5 most notable in the demoscene world, and I will reconsider my vote. Verifiable information means facts. It doesn't just mean your say-so. I don't trust your opinion, because (1) every editor on Wikipedia is a nameless nobody, including me, and in principle nobody's opinion here is to be taken on authority; and (2) given the tone of your comments, I particularly don't trust you. For example, if you are saying he is one of the demoscene people with the most radio-play, lets have some proof of that. As for the puffery comment, it is not the basis of my vote. It was an aside, and if the article is not deleted, I probably will try to edit it out, as I have in many other cases. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:08, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't imagine a single reason why anybody should be impressed with my opinions. I'm a nameless nobody. So are you. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia created by nameless nobodies. This is why opinions don't matter much here, only verifiable information. Nobody is expected to believe something just because "BM" said so. Who the heck is "BM"? Who the heck is anybody here? That is all beside the point, anyway. The issue is whether the subject of this article, who happens to be a relatively popular Wikipedia editor, is notable enough to have an article about him. You see, he doesn't get an article about himself just because he's a nice guy and we all hang out together on the Wikipedia. Maybe that is how other sites you hang out on work, but this is not just another site. We are trying to build an encyclopedia. I am asking for verifiable information as to notability within the demoscene community. If the demoscene community hasn't established any way for the world to determine who their notables are, that is not my fault. The world is not going to accept that they are all notables, and they have reason to be skeptical if someone from that scene is claimed to be notable.

<li>Its only partially about music. Where are the guidelines for manifolds and demosceners? I understand that maintaining a new kind of encyclopedia is a hard task, especially because it is not completely defined what it is. The net has opened new ways of understanding culture, and the demoscene is rather young, on its way to climb out of the pit of subcultures, in its own a redefinition of what art is about. While this is happening, the music industry is going down the drain and additively defaces itself as a pusher of taste, obfuscating the spectrum of musical quality with bruteforce marketing and top tens that are primarily constructed from sales results. It is indeed a controversial topic, so I understand that an article about me comes rather early. Your decision defines what this place is about.

<li>Notability is subjective, so I'd say: Democracy. This page decides this articles notability given the facts, opinions and informations that have been mentioned here. The fate of this article is actually telling me something about myself. High notability in the demoscene is usually accompanied by top placement in various competitions on large demoparties (placement is democratic as well, the audience votes the winner) and high activity over a longer period of time.

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Notability is subjective". Is it? Surely it is one of the few things which is not subjective? Agreed, one can be notable in a quasi-subjective sense: in that, for example, a small group of people may consider a person to be notable. But, ultimately, it must be objectivity which defines notability: if we remove the notion of objectivity from notability we are really talking about something else. My point being? You seem to think that people on here are subjectively deciding whether or not you are sufficiently notable. I disagree. People on here who are saying 'delete' or 'userfy' are saying so on the objective basis that you are not, in fact, notable regardless of what persuasive arguments or points may be raised. And it is on that, objective basis, that I still do not consider you to be "notable". (Seems terrible rude to say that, I'm sorry.

Even the article about <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28journalism%29.html" title="Objectivity (journalism)">objectivity</a> seems to be unable to define it sufficiently in an objective way, which is a rather amusing observation, contradicting your statement. "People say" is subjective judgement of notability at its best. I doubt that, unless one rests among the spirits and thus is above all material things, one is able to produce any "objective" results at all.<br />
Do I understand your point correctly as "People who disagree to keep the page have an objective basis"? Does that mean that solely people who vote for keeping the page are subjective? If yes, we should call this <i>Marcus' Law</i> and apply it to elections. I regard such an action to be of great fun for all parties. -- <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPaniq_4446.html" title="User:Paniq">Paniq</a> 02:20, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me introduce myself: I'm scamp/vacuum, active member of the demoscene, and I know Paniq for years now. I'm also the main organizer of the Breakpoint party where paniq won competitions at. I highly respect paniq for his work. That being said: I also respect Wikipedia, and I think it should be free from self promotion. This article clearly is. And sorry, "I did not put the article here, but I am updating it from time to time." is a blatant lie. The article was originally created from the IP 212.202.50.46 which resolves to port-212-202-50-46.dynamic.qsc.de and traces to Frankfurt/Germany, and paniq right now is online on IRC at 212.202.50.103, which resolves to port-212-202-50-103.dynamic.qsc.de. Also back in 2004 he told everyone on IRC how funny it was to create his own entry about himself on Wikipedia. While I really welcome recent efforts from RadMan1 and others to add articles about the demoscene to Wikipedia, I don't think it makes sense to now add each and every scener to Wikipedia - and well, the list of people more "important" (and therefore would need to be added first) to the scene than paniq is quite long (though that list for <a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> would be much, much longer&#160;;) - <b>Delete or Userfy</b> -- <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESKissel_90f7.html" title="User:SKissel">SKissel</a>

<li>The article had been here before as I was told later on, but got flagged for deletion. It is true that I reopened it. It is true that I posted the articles URL on IRC as I do with all stuff that is covering my lowness. It is not true that I "told everyone on IRC how funny it was", however I was surprised that the article remained, thus it seemed to own a certain right to be there. I agree with scamp that there are a lot of people who should be added here first. My lifeline is rather young, so there is not much to mention here yet.

<li>I think it's interesting how Paniq's being compared to Jason Kottke. It seems like those who voted Keep in the Kottke VfD discussion were being directed to this article. Is this normal Wikipedia practice for users to solicit practically everyone that might possibly support their position? Or is this just an attempt to make it seem that more people would be interested in having the article in the encyclopedia? That being said, by looking at the article, it seems that Paniq is notable in his field; however, the question is, is the field itself notable enough for his inclusion? Blogging is notable enough, IMHO, and Kottke is a top blogger. And that's why I voted Keep for Kottke. German demoscene? Personally, I'd classify it at about the same level as the Canadian trivia scene -- and I had an article about myself run through VfD and deleted. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 01:10, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You misunderstand what the "demoscene" is, its not a strictly german thing, or a swedish thing, or an american thing. It is a global computer hobby subculture, much as Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a fantasy hobby subculture, both involve some level of creativity and artistic talent. If it were strictly a cultural thing I would likely join you in a delete vote, but its not and I urge you to reconsider your vote. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a>™<a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 02:01, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

However, when even THAT doesn't establish that paniq has any individual importance, I'm going to remain unconvinced. The bare truth is that outside of Farbrausch, there has been no evidence presented that paniq has done anything to warrant a separate entry for himself. I'm sorry, it's nothing personal, but that's how it stands. Everyone knows Google hits can be manipulated either way to promote or upset popularity, but at the base level, on the most basic of searches, paniq turns up 3,200 hits from only 80 sites. In my mind, that's not diverse enough, especially for a topic based around computers. --<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawlore_968f.html" title="User:Lawlore">Lawlore</a> 11:01, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This has been one of the best debates on a VfD that i've seen in my brief time at Wikipedia. I've been re-reading it all, plus the new entries -- and I have been tempted to change my delete vote above, just based on the amount of discussion it has generated. Plus I've come to like <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paniq.html" title="Paniq">paniq</a>! Having spent more time checking out the Wiki entries around the subject and checking out a few web sites, however, I realise that my emotional side is predominating here, so I have to stay with my original vote <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 14:17, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. I don't HAVE to do that at all. When I think about many of the entries I have seen that I have not yet summoned up the energy to put up for VfD, this one has far more justification for being there. Maybe someone in 5 years will successfully VfD it because <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paniq.html" title="Paniq">paniq</a> sinks into obscurity without leaving a true heritage, (I hope not, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paniq.html" title="Paniq">paniq</a> ) but until then I'm going to change my vote to <b>Keep</b>, <b>Keep</b> (the two of them because I don't know how to strike thu my old vote, and don't have the time right now to find out, so one delete plus two keeps should equal a YES <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 14:21, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>That also isn't very flattering to paniq, is it: "OK, paniq, you're in. We decided you have to be more notable than Machinedramon". That seems like a race to the bottom. It is saying that since we don't seem to be able stop non-notable subjects from becoming Wikipedia articles as fast as they come in, we might as well give up. Let's put up a big sign: "Write an article on anything you want. Who are we to tell you what might be important? As long as your article is factual and not too opinionated and it looks like someone, somewhere, might want to read it, its fine by us. But if the subject is youself, get your friend to write it for you, pal, because we don't want vanity." --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:01, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I thought I was parodying it, guys. On Wikipedia, people can edit articles and if they write something that is not true, muddled, irrelevant, POV-pushing, etc, some other editor can delete or modify it. Within an article, the collective efforts of editors determine the final result, sometimes after a lot of wrangling. Above the level of an article, though, where you are deciding what articles should exist and how a large subject should be divided up between multiple articles, that changes dramatically. Anybody can create any article, and according to your logic, nobody else can question it, provided the new article doesn't fall into a small number of categories of recognized badness. If we allow anyone to edit at the infra-article level, why do we have such different rules to edit at the supra-article level? That is what VfD is basically about: editing the Wikipedia at the supra-article level. If I put a new section into an article about a sub-topic that the other editors think is irrelevant or not sigificant enough to take up the space, they will delete it. But if I put the material into a separate article, nobody can touch it. It can only be cleaned up. The more extreme inclusionists seem to be saying that nobody should try to edit at the supra-article level, that an article-creation decision should never be challenged and the structure of the Wikipedia should not be planned and should simply left to accretion, as article-creators come along at random and create new articles. By that view, except in the rare cases of vanity, original research, and patent nonsense, any attempt to undo an article-creation decision is "deletionism" and is beyond the pale. If that view prevails, the result will be that Wikipedia will have no coherent structure above the article level. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:19, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is no way this stub can be turned into an encyclopedic entry. The underground station in question is just a single island platform up an alley.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I normally don't vote when it's obvious. But the 'merge' votes above will be counted as 'keep' by the sysop, and since they count for double a 'delete' vote, this vote is on track to being ruled as "no consensus for deletion".

<li>How do you reason that BM? If its a merge vote the article up for VfD will become subsumed by the target article in the merger, and the VfD article either deleted or redirected. Voting delete for the sake of opposing a merge or keep vote without other reasons is puzzling. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 05:48, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here is how the sysops tally the votes, more or less. They count the votes. That is the denominator. Then they count the <i>Deletes</i>; that is the numerator. If the numerator divided by the denominator is not two-thirds or greater, the outcome is <i>no consensus to delete</i>, meaning the article is not deleted. If there is no consensus to delete, what happens next is entirely up to the admin to decide. In fact, any editor can redirect or merge, so the admin is not really doing anything that any other user couldn't do; the only thing that requires sysop powers is deleting the article. So a "Merge" vote is counted with the keeps, and blocks a consensus to delete. Since a two thirds consensus is required to delete, when someone votes Merge, the Delete side has to get two more votes just to stay even. The above is an oversimplification because people sometimes vote 'Abstain' or their vote can't be figured out, and is up to the sysop to decide whether to include the vote in the denominator (i.e. effectively, against deletion). Sometimes the nominator forgets to explicitly vote, and the sysop has to decide whether to count the nomination as a 'Delete'. People vote "Weak Keep" or "Weak Delete", and the sysop has to decide how to count those. Sometimes there are "sock-puppet" votes, and the sysop has to decide how much weight to give them. But the way most of the votes are processed, anything other than a straight Delete means Keep. A Merge vote does not mean, "Merge, but Delete rather than Keep", unless you explicitly say that and the sysop reads and honors what you say. There is an example on this VfD page right now, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Parallel_Path_4646.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Parallel Path">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Parallel Path</a>, which is an article written by someone on his idea for a perpetual motion machine. In the first VfD vote, 7 people voted Delete, 1 person voted Merge (to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_Motion_eba9.html" title="Perpetual Motion">Perpetual Motion</a>), 2 people voted Weak Keep, and 1 person voted Keep. The 1 outright Keep was the author of the article, who had never edited anything except the article and the VfD vote. The admin tallied this as 7 Deletes, 4 Keeps (including the Merge): No consensus to delete. She put a Merge tag on the article, which the author removed. The article is now up for VfD again. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:57, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I put a speedy notice on it originally, so I guess I'd better vote <b>delete</b>.

<li>You're joking, right? Give us a break.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I agree that this is not a speedy candidate. I wish that "no content that is not obvious from the title" had made it, but it didn't. This article has no real content. There have been several days for number-theoreticians to chime in with anything interesting about it and so far nobody has.

<li>But almost all the content is completely adventitious. None of it is really about 387 except for the factorization, and every number that isn't prime has a factorization, so even that isn't very notable.

<li><i>Comment:</i> The article itself did not establish notability. Establishing notability for an article that doesn't seem so is part of what VfD is <i>for</i>—if it wasn't, then everything would be handled by the speedy process. I <i>rescued it from speedy</i>, and you should note that I haven't actually voted in this VfD at all—the nomination was a simple statement of the facts. I'm happy to see keep votes from people who know more about the subject, but I don't appreciate baseless accusations of bad faith. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 23:53, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The 'first line of attack' was CSD, which <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> correctly rejected. The article itself is decidedly stubby, and I can see where the question of notability would arise for a nonexpert. I'm pleased to see that Gwalla is willing to seek community consensus through VfD rather than arbitrarily decide that something is 'obviously' notable or (worse) not. Plus, having it on VfD for a few days cuts down on the likelihood that someone else <i>will</i> speedy it inappropriately. That said, a bit more time with Google is always a good thing. <b>Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> 02:35, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Stubs are not justifiable deletion targets, and major art movements comprised of wildly famous artists don't require the approval of the community to establish their notability. A simple Google search (as per below) would have established that the speedy delete request was bogus, and the bogus notice could have been removed, end of story. Instead we have an extended song-and-dance routine that will take 100 times as much effort to arrive at the same outcome - ie the article is kept.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 02:44, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b>. The friendly fire incident was a major news story in Canada at the time, but I'm not sure that the individual victims names' all warrant an article. The story is already covered under the name of the pilot that bombed the Canadians, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Schmidt_1e40.html" title="Harry Schmidt">Harry Schmidt</a>. (Incidentally, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Umbach_c7e1.html" title="William Umbach">William Umbach</a> isn't really notable either, and could also be merged and redirected.) --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> 00:21, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I hope the soldiers receive fitting memorials for their sacrifice, but Wikipedia isn't the place for that. All of these articles should be deleted. As for the pilots, they aren't notable either in an encyclopdic sense. I don't think their names have stayed in the public mind. Those articles should be deleted also. The incident is notable, though, and a description of it should be incorporated into the appropriate article about the Iraq war. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:27, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This was an incident which received heavy coverage in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> media; its relative <i>lack</i> of coverage in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> media was part of the story. I wouldn't object to merging into a single article on the incident which contained information about all four -- but doing that within the pilot's article <i>isn't</i> sufficient, because the pilot can't be categorized as a Canadian-related topic. Short of that happening, however, these need to be kept; the incident was significant enough that it's absolutely essential to have <i>some</i> kind of article(s) on the topic. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:51, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with the idea of a single article on the topic; not so much because of classication but because it's the incident itself that's notable, not the individuals involved in it themselves. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 20:32, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You could be correct that there is some systemic bias that works against Canadians. If there were, I don't think the way it operates is that some American reads an article and thinks "Oh, it's about a Canadian; Canadians aren't notable; lets nominate on VfD", although it is possible I guess. I think it is more likely that one or both of the following is true: (1) a lot more articles about non-notable Americans slip in without anybody noticing than articles about Canadians, so there are always plenty of examples of articles about Americans that haven't received any VfD attention; or (2) the people who notice these marginal, or below-the-threshold articles are more likely to be Americans, and the names vaguely ring a bell, so they never stop to think whether the people are notable, or whether it is simply that the names are connected to some incident that was in the news and which has stuck in their minds. If they read the article, they remember the incident, and apparently the attitude of many people is that if an incident was notable the people involved in it were notable. Whereas with the Canadian articles there is a greater chance that someone reads the article and thinks "I never heard of this person", and moreover they have no idea that the incident related in the article is very notable in Canada. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:38, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
