<p>Though a winner, Maggie has done nothing else signifigent in her outside life. Drew Daniel, season 5 winner, was also deleted even though he has a small acting career and thus is tchnically more significient. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComedy240_93bd.html" title="User:Comedy240">Comedy240</a> 18:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> obviously. She was on a hit show with around 8 million viewers. She was on for the whole season. TV actors (or characters) with far less viewership/success get articles consistantly. The standard is to keep Big Brother winners, despite the odd inexplicable exception, here and there. This person easily meets the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, regarding independent coverage from multiple sources. Unfortunately, we seem to have a problem where certain genres of entertainment popular amongst Wikipedians (i.e. science fiction) get one easy standard , and genres unpopular in Wikipedia (though hugely popular outside) get a tougher standard. The notion of measuring her "outside life" is silly. We don't require an athlete be known outside sports, an actor outside acting, a politition outside politics. She's tops on a top show. That's enough. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:29, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: you're certainly right about the tons of sciencefictioncruft all over Wikipedia. Still, at times it is (I presume unintentionally) funny: "Wow, real human beans actually spend their times <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStar_Wars_locations_4e6d.html" title="Category:Star Wars locations">this stuff</a>?!" -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 14:39, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Winners of major reality shows seem worthy of inclusion, regardless of what one AfD previously said. AfD shies away from precedent and looks at each article's subject's credentials independently. That being said, I would have argued for a keep on Daniel, too. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">ahoy-hoy</a>)</small> 12:29, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, a reality game show winner is not worthy of an encyclopedia article, in my opinion. Once she has additional accomplishments, like substantial acting credits, she might be notable enough. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> reality show contestants/winners have posed notability problems for a while, and standards probably are needed. However, Rob's argument, Maggie is sufficienty notable due to winner BB6.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 16:27, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b>. I had contemplated putting an AfD on this one, but the fact that she won half a mill made me reconsider. However, how many lotto winners do we have listed in wiki? Thinking about it a bit more, I'm inclined to go for a delete as she was only part of a successful TV show, and <s>she was not the main winner of the round</s>. Her main field is an ER nurse and she's probably the only one without a huge mortgage. Not known outside BB. Her entry could be merged into BB6, along with the rest of them. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 22:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could you please clarify what you meant by "<i>she was not the main winner of the round</i>"? How are you using hte term "<i>round</i>" here? I think of a "round", as one of multiple parts in a competition (e.g. ten rounds in a boxing match). In Big Brother, a week or broadcast episode could be seen as a "round" (e.g. each opportunity for elimination). She surivived all the weeks/episodes/rounds up until the final one, which she was <i>the</i> winner (2nd prize being a tenth in size). At the end, there were only two contestants, which millions of people tuned to see. She wasn't just another part of the show. As for lotto winners, I suppose if a TV show was dedicated to a loto winner, giving them top prime time coverage, for an entire season of episodes, with millions of people following their every move, with lots of independent coverage, then maybe they should get an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:56, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I stand corrected about the "winner" part. I had misread the reference to $1m, thus thinking it was a second prize, although that was probably why I didn't nominate he when I first came across the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Definatly keep. Without biography pages, the reality show pages would get terribly unorganized and lengthy. As of now she has pleanty of links to websites about her and those would get lost if merged with Big Brother. Also, she has done/said pleanty of controversial things that wouldn't fit into the Big Brother article. <b>She is DEFFINATLY significant enough to have her own article.</b> Irkedpenguin 03:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
