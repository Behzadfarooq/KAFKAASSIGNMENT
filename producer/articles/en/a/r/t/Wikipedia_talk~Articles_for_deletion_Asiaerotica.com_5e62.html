	    <p>Wikipedia isn't about a popularity contest. As a producer that has sold tens of thousands of videos thru Sin City and Legend as well as in Europe I am not interested in having my fans flood the wiki with counter comments, (which I could and mayby I should to balance out and make sure that an emerging point of view gets consideration) This is about ideas. Wikipedia if it is to be a scholarly source is an ENCYCLOPEDIA NOT A POPULAR PORN GUY LIST. An Alexia ranking has no bearing on the ideas the site represents, and the validity of the expression of them . This is about introducing a new genre and approach to erotica and I believe it deserves to be noted, because it REJECTS the tired and thought less porn that many people are tired of and gets us to think about doing something different. Bang Buss and Sex pervs of Russia or whatever don't represent ideas about a different way of pursuing the art of porn. The fact that Asiaerotica has been on line since 1996 without any promotion or other tricks of the trade means that the intent with the project is to do something unique...which it has (and has been copied extensivly, we have been doing gonzo video in Asia since 1983) and not to win a mindless AVN award. This alone means that the efforts deserve academic note..which is the point here. Why is it that this section has been turned over to the complete control of the few who monitor this section's "favourite porno guys". Will your editorial criticisms and quick claims for deletion stand up to review by a higher level of authority in the wiki's food chain? Let's hope not or ... all someone who is interested in the history and state of this genere will learn about is what ever is popular at the moment. This is not the way knowledge is documented in an academic setting, but it is DEFINATELY the way a private club works. Since there appear to be no "experts " in this area where do you guys get off Squasing a significantly different approach to the field with the longest history to boot? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chinggism (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChinggism_1358.html" title="User talk:Chinggism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chinggism_145a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chinggism">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I wnat to see where any of the other entries meet this so called "standard".</p>
<p>Looking at the way this article and others I have submitted are deleted, and at the way the areas of Wikipedia I have submitted to seem to be the private preserve of a small bunch of commercial, main stream pornographers. It seems that these blatant commercial intrests are using wikipedia to stop any independent artist contributions, I believe the deletion is biased and political in nature. Since when is any of the "protected" listings that are allowed in these areas of wikipedia Just google Asiaerotica and get a reference or investigate the history of what Asiaerotica does and stands for. It is EXACTLY this type of censorship that will prevent this section from being any more than a protected advertisment for what are obviously vested and commercially related intrests. If the editors of Wikipedia do not respond to this challenge, then they are in collusion with comercial pornographers as opposed to widening ideas and sources of informattion and points of view. Far East Video (Asiaerotica) has made a significant contribution to this field as well as being the first production company to consistanly produce Gonzo erotica since 1983 in Asia. Asiaerotica has been on the web since Feb 1996 and is part of the Wayback machines archive, was Adult site of the day and recieved numerous notations from websites and writers who have long since vanished into the flotsam of the internet , where no doubt a lot of the examples proffered here will return. The productions have been written up in Penthouse, High Society, Hustler, The Boston Free Press, Screw Magazine and many other industry related publications. While its owner, Jean Marc Roc shuns the Los Angeles based porn industry, and does not seek to affiliate or be considered part of that ilk, Wikipedia should not be hijacked by those vested interests. Indeed, it would seem to me that an independant, iconoclastic, and eclectic producer with an intresting point of view that is novel and thought out should be of interest to those that seek knowledge and ideas. Ideas and a thoughtful point of view is EXACTLY what is lacking in each and every featured example in this section of the Wiki. If these facts and these efforts are continually "edited" out, then it is an example of partisan bias and it should be stopped. An enclycopedia is about knowledge often interesting and obscure, not just a private little world where those that have an obvious intrest in these porn merchants gets to tout their wares. Asiaerotica is not onscure, it is a statement that is kept on the sidelines of porn on purpose in an effort to make a new genre where it is most badly needed.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chinggism (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChinggism_1358.html" title="User talk:Chinggism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chinggism_145a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chinggism">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
