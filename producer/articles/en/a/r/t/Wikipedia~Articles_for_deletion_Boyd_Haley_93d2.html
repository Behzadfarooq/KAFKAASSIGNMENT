<dd>I guess it is very difficult for you to understand this concept, but here it is. Even if you disagree - and maybe especially if you disagree - with Boyd's point of view, it is critical that people who want to be educated on the controversy know something about the people who make them. If Boyd is deleted, then it is open season on all kinds of people. Of course, precedence means nothing here, only mob rule. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 13:13, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b>: <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">Common sense</a> indicates that the concerns expressed by an eminent researcher of Haley's stature should be taken seriously, given that the combined effects of neurotoxins upon humans, especially in utero, are unknown and of paramount importance considering the acute crisis of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> and rising prevalence of autoimmune diseases.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The top hit of those 30 000 (I have not checked all of them) is the famously unreliable Whale site, and the next few are rather similar. When you get down to <a href="http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/haley/" class="external free" title="http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/haley/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/haley/</a> which is what the Haley group says it is about, you find no note of toxicology, and no note of autism or mercury. But you don't find any note of any of that in the article. The problemisn't with the subject, who is as notable as many people are, it is with the article, which is not actually about him. SO yes, Prof Haley may well be worth biographising, but this is not his biography. It is eyt another of a string of articles pushing a very restricted POV of Ombudsman's att he expense of real information or an accurate view of the people whose names are used to cover them. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 19:03, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

If you look at Leifern's history, you will see that the first contact he had with me - triggered by Ombudsma - was a vitriolic attack on me, and an incoherent attack on a page I started called <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationist.html" title="Anti-vaccinationist">anti-vaccinationist</a> which he has sustained. If you look at other edits I've been involved in, you'll see they mostly go smoothly, despite being in subjects not always free of controversy. (Try fast breeder reactors, Exeter, Smallpox, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Jenner_379d.html" title="Edward Jenner">Edward Jenner</a> which is now a Good Article. If you have a look at <a href="http://ganfyd.org" class="external free" title="http://ganfyd.org" rel="nofollow">http://ganfyd.org</a> you'll see that I wrote the licence and was an instigator and am a sysadmin etc there and it works very well. Look at leifern's early edits and you'll see that one of the four subjects he is very obviously non-objective on is the presence of anti-vaccinationists in the world (I can understand the psychology of the other 3 but that one I'm unsure of - possibly it is the reaction of someone who makes his living from rationality finding that he is keeping company he cannot accpet as an organised group but must regard as coincidental agreement arrived at independently but this is a digression). I think this sustained pattern of behaviour against me is outside WP policies and norms and worthy of comment. It certainly is an ad hominem attack here. Would admins take note of this, please. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:09, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep this off the AfD boards guys, yeah? Leifern, your comment should have ended with the word "controversy" and you know it.

<dd>I would challenge anyone to find a clear example of my taking an extreme point of view on this issue, or any other - or that I have "lied" to anyone. All I have asked for is that a controversy be presented fairly and accurately. As for Midgley's sockpuppetry, impersonation, etc., it's a matter of record and not a personal attack. I think that anyone who stoops to such tactics deserves suspicion if not scorn. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 18:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to write an encyclopedia. I assume that Leifern posted in such fashion to make it appear that this is bad faith. In the end people have to make up their own minds, but should not be lied to. I agree that this is not a place for such an argument - Leifernstarted it and will not stop despite firm administrative guidance - I don't know what else to do about it, and as one might expect and I think is intended, it is upsetting. I note that other people have simply left WP in esponse to such tactics - I'm one of the ones you want to keep. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:25, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did not make this AFD, you did, so I'm not sure how my objection to it could be done in a way that makes the AFD look like bad faith. As for firm administrative guidance, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

<p>I would think better of this behaviour if it was <i>not</i> sober. I read the WP article on sockpuppets, and apart from WP:POINT which <i>I</i> shan't do again, but Leifern is continuing to commit, none of my use of the invisible Anon was harmful - no voting, just a demonstration that if one wants to be called {name} then following advice from several people to actually register {name} is sensible. Leifern's behaviour has been from the start unreasonable and obnoxious, as demonstrated here. Since he started editing WP he has been pushing a particular POV, forcefully, and in several instances by sustained rudeness and uncivil behaviour - see his history with <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">User:Geni</a> over Thimerosal, Mercury and autism.

<dd><b>comment</b>: As pointed out elsewhere, Haley is perhaps the foremost scientist investigating the neurotoxicity of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metals.html" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a>, an area of utmost importance with regard to the global epidemic of autoimmune disorders. His research and outspoken opposition to vested interests profiting immensely from contaminating the environment and poisoning medical patients is of extreme relevance to many significant health and safety debates, making this AfD one of the most ludicrous and preposterous examples of gaming the system yet perpetrated. The motivation for this AfD is beyond highly suspect, since it inherently relies upon both a lack of understanding of the issues by many or most Wiki editors and the built-in advantage of having the dubious wind of medical orthodoxy at its back. Haley's research isn't simply about the role of thimerosal in the <a href="../../../i/a/t/Iatrogenic.html" title="Iatrogenic">iatrogenic</a> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a>, it has ramifications with regard to the wisdom of the ADA's refusal to allow dentists to speak with patients about mercury poisoning caused by mercury-laden amalgams, upon the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, and upon the understanding of the etiology of autoimmune disorders. There are plenty of fictional characters and soap opera actor biographies to nominate for an AfD, rather than gaming the system to suppress important information of a highly regarded scientist who is serving a critical role by actively investigating the devastating effects of neurotoxins that have ravaged the health of millions. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 20:17, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The first inviting one in the .edu is <a href="http://www.iom.edu/?id=7465&amp;redirect=0" class="external text" title="http://www.iom.edu/?id=7465&amp;redirect=0" rel="nofollow">IOM meeting agenda</a>] with slides and audio.

<dd><b>Conclusion of comment</b> This does not to me make Dr Haley's reputation out as described above. It is a disservice to an academic or scientist to blow them up as something more than what they are - one of many - and the underlying reason tends to be that few scientists share the particualr point of view lauded. Actually, Haley has a reputation for doing competent and interesting work in fields having nothing to do with any of this, and that points up even more strongly that this is a non-<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> piece of an article about <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal_controversy.html" title="Thimerosal controversy">Thimerosal controversy</a>, not about Haley, and not an effort to biographise him.

If anything, Haley's research findings have nailed shut the coffin of medical orthodoxy's dead on arrival theories unconscionably proffered to excuse the unexcusable continuance of its idiotic insistence upon using thimerosal in vaccines and quicksilver amalgams for dental fillings. Haley's use of birth hair, blood and urine analyses, not to mention use of highly advanced biomarkers, are not mere theoretical indicators, these have been used to provide overwhelming and incontrovertible evidence of ongoing harm perpetrated by the medical industry. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 15:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to pick out one thing from that un<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> un<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> comment, amalgam is _dental_ amalgam, not a medical thing at all. And while Haley's work is interesting, there is a need for someone else to actually succeed in repeating it before it convinces everyone. Thimerosal is pretty much abandoned now, and it is time the incidence of autism was shown to have changed as a result, if the cae for a connection is to be made - it is very classic really: make a hypothesis that A causes B, stop A, observe B decrease. We might avoid the stage of restarting A and observing B rise again in challenge - if it happens. WP:RPA does seem a useful semi-convention, and actually once it is appleid, the content of comments gets easier to pick out. The character of the argument of course doesn't of itself demonstrate the falsity of the arguments, any more than the ad homenem and more precisely ad personam attacks demonstrate anything about the article, the AfD or the science, but they are quite characteristic of anti-vacinationist and the fringe medical campaigners and IMHO out of place in the construction of an encyclopaedia. Medical orthodoxy by the way, has been assembled from whatever came to hand and worked, which is why so much that isn't orthodox doesn't work. We have been doing free and open copying of knowledge for generations longer than WP has, and approving of it. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:39, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Man, lots of RPA links. Okay: I say, <b>keep.</b> Boyd Haley is notable as a professor; head of a department, with describable contributions. However, the POV edit war thing has got to be resolved somehow. AfD is <i>not</i> the way to do it: here, we should decide on the notability of the topic.
