<p>This chat forum gets thousands of hits per day and millions of hits per year. Many posters spend hours there every day. Two posters have dated after meeting on the forum, and one poster went to stay with another as an exchange student. It is much like a sitcom, but very real. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosecuervo_e087.html" title="User:Josecuervo">Josecuervo</a></p>
<p>This article has to stay. The bored is an important part of people's lives and it deserves recognition for the sheer comedy value. The characters on it should go more recognition and Wikipedia can provide that.CalebRalph</p>

<p>Capitalist do you have a life? seriously. Type Planet Rugby Forum into google and see how many hits that come up (over 2,000,000). New Zealand All Blacks Rugby coach Graham Henry has posted on the forum, legendary Australian coach Rod Macqueen, Brian Moore (BCM), Stephen Jones (Southern Softie), If those people aren't significant then I don't know who is.

<li>Those men are indeed significant.

<p>People criticising the site aren't getting their facts straight. Planet Rugby chat forum has 5816 users and over 700,000 posts. I take it that none of you have actually visited. I am also very interested in the Rowan Quinn biz. I take it you all are colleagues of hers <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuisling_664b.html" title="User:Quisling">Quisling</a></p>
<p>Honestly, what harm is there in this for one. Secondly what is the point in deleting something that nobody really checks on. Finally, it has its place. Wikpedia has become a social encylopedia where people search for things that are not only obscure and bizzare, but with the current trends and a history on something you will not find in your Britannica's and Funk n Wagnalls. It should stay for the fact that somebody has spent time to write it, have a laugh and allow people to voice an opinion, point of view, whatever. If you start silencing things as inane and trival such as this; when will it stop??? <small>(<b>Note:</b> this previously unsigned comment made by LachlanG on 13:54, 8 December 2005 and moved from top of page to here for readability by me.) <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 14:18, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Should be saved, it's a large forum which has grown loved by the people that frequent it, I ask you: how can musicianforums have an entry and not this?</p>
<p>It should certainly be indexed on Wikipedia. There are some very useful threads that run here too - there are enlightening law discussions following major games, and more often than not it is possible to follow a game in realtime because some dedicated individuals post regular updates as they happen. This is very useful to rugby devotees who live in countries with little or no rugby traditions, such as Thailand, China, and Australia. Steenbras</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> "Useful", "enlightening", "loved by the people that frequent it", "being able to follow games in almost-realtime" does not make it encyclopaedic. Yes, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, but it <i>is</i> an encyclopedia, and as such subjects have to satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">certain criteria</a> to merit articles, which this doesn't. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 13:30, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok why not clean it up to make it further encyclopedic? It should be kept, it can be useful for people since this is indeed the biggest rugby forum on the internet that doesn't contain one-eyed bias.Girvan Dempsey</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Zunaid - I appreciate the positive nature of your post. I would like to make the point that all of the new users that you list are genuine, unique posters on PR forum. I think that 'meatpuppets' refers to multiple personas from just one person? I would argue that the entry for the PR chat forum be retained as it is a very real entity and therefore its entry may be of some reference value to users of wikipedia. The arguments against retention appear to be more based in a general disdain for message boards in general. PR forum is quite obscure, I will certainly concede that much, but surely obscurity is the raison d'etre of an encyclopedia? Girvan The Swerve 14:34, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Planet Rugby itself doesn't have an article, or I might have suggested a paragraph be added to that article about the forum. and <b>Comment</b> for Girvan the Swerve: meatpuppets are a bit different from sockpuppets, at least in Wikipedia usage of the terms. Sockpuppets are alias accounts for the same person. Meatpuppets usually refers to real separate individuals who have been brought to Wikipedia solely to participate on one side of a discussion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> 14:55, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for that Carbon Copy. I realise now that I am guilty of meatpuppetry, but with the sincerest possible motives. I think the general concensus is to delete the entry for planet rugby chat forum and add a new entry for planet rugby with a reference to the chat forum. Girvan The Swerve 14:58, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Multiple personas from one person are <i>sock puppets</i>. From the sock puppet article:
<blockquote>
<p><i>A <b>meat puppet</b> is a variation of a sock puppet; a new internet community member account is created by another person at the request of a user solely for the purposes of influencing the community on a given issue or issues.</i></p>
</blockquote>
You have to concede that the current situation is almost <b>exactly</b> the definition of a meat puppet; it looks as if new members are being recruited on some sort of "save this article" campaign. Obscure does not = non-encyclopedic, but unimportant/unreferenced/non-notable does. The article isn't up for deletion because the topic is obscure, it's up for deletion because the article itself <b>fails to assert</b> the notability of the subject. This does not neccessarily mean that the subject isn't notable, just that the article doesn't provide <b>evidence</b> that it is. If you really want to save this article then take heed of the suggestions being made here: include <b>references</b> to the media, <b>provide evidence</b> that famous rugby players post there, demonstrate that the site has influenced some aspect of the game or society, show that the forum has been <b>cited</b> in a newspaper or other published medium. If the forum really has done that then I'm quite sure it <b>is</b> notable, but the article doesn't provide any <b>evidence</b> of this, see what I'm saying? Maybe the article doesn't do the topic justice. Heaven knows it's in a god-awful state at the moment. So rewrite the article, and maybe, just maybe, you can save it from deletion. What could then happen is that people here would re-read the improved article and hopefully change their votes because of the improvement. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 15:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC) <small>(That's enough rambling from me, I'm off home, will catch up on this tomorrow.)</small></li>

In addition, the planet rugby chat forum was recently mentioned in a letter to the Sunday Times (London) as a result of its campaign to remove rugby columnist Stephen Jones.

Can I just ask again how Musicianforums or Mx Forums has a Wikipedia entry? I'd be very surprised if it is half as influential as the world's prime rugby forum.Peter Stringer</p>

<li>No, it's an encyclopaedia. The concept is often an alien one to people used to discussion fora. Wikipedia is not a discussion forum. It is an encyclopaedia. On discussion fora, there is no requirement for providing the means for readers to check what one writes. Here, there is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">an absolute requirement</a>. If you want to provide an argument to keep this article, you <i>must</i> cite sources to demonstrate that this forum has come to the attention of the rest of the world enough that the rest of the world has published things about it. Point to the independently sourced "in depth" magazine articles, third-party guides and FAQs, significant press coverage, or books that have been written about it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:19, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe that everyone should be given a fair go and this includes Planet Rugby Chat Forum. You wikipedians are behaving like a bunch of stuck up, obnoxious imbeciles. Clearly seem them as a threat. As you know I have no time for dickheads and their ramblings on. Get back to your shitty. jobs. It is a free country, you know. I'm Sam Kekovich.</p>

<p><b>Comment:</b> The Planet Rugby page is almost an exact duplicate of the Planet Rugby Chat Forum article. A subversive attempt to keep the content alive? It certainly seems so. To Sam Kekovich, Wikipedia is not about giving everyone a "fair go". It is an <b>encyclopedia</b>. Read the criticisms people have been posting, you'll see they are mostly constructive and show a clear way in which this article can be saved. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 06:53, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Zunaid no kidding it is an encyclopedia you have mentioned this several times like a broken record your keyboard is. Everyone is entilted to publish their articles on here so go jump you flippin imbecile. You are what is bad with this world. You seem to place your views above everyone elses. How about you take a hike, the world could do without your types. Time for a beer. I'm Sam Kekovich.</p>
