<p>the general style of religious converts lists has always been "List of converts to X", because their conversion to X is what has been notable. a "List of people who left Islam" or "List of ex-A" is unnecessary and irrelevant because <b>a)</b> it falsely assumes ex-Y became so because of Y, and not because of their conviction in something else (i.e. religion X); <b>b)</b> it consists of unnecessary duplication, by "leaving Y" they have automatically become a "convert to X"'; <s><b>c)</b> there is no precedence for this as we do not have a "List of people who left Christianity", "List of people who left Hinduism", "List of people who left Athiesm", nor do we need it.</s> <b>d)</b> the focus is inappropriately on negation, the title and entire purpose of such a list is implicitly loaded with a negative connotation against religion Y, and under the false premise discussed in point a) serves as a vehicle for propaganda/advocacy.</p>

<dd>I find your arguments a little too strident and out of proportion to what you're responding to. The user was concerned for people's safety, but concerns with privacy or safety occur on many kinds of AfD debates not just this one. In addition I fear your statements indicate this list has a political purpose and if that's the case I will switch from weak to strong delete. Wikipedia lists are not the proper place to make "stands against terrorism" or push political agendas, even when they are agendas I agree with more or less. Perhaps these lists do provide valuable names when one is studying a valid cultural issue, but reasons like "the conversion lists stayed, so we need religion bashing lists for balance" or "we can't give in to terrorists/religious-zealots" strike me as invalid and prejudicial.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Dont use my statements to change your nomination. Make your own judgement. The primary purpose of these lists is to classify information in another way. The lists are not redundant. I could claim that these lists should be kept because they help save the lives of African elephants, but if you disliked elephants and said these lists should be deleted - well that would be a wrong reason for you to choose to delete the lists. The primary purpose as I said is: these lists are not redundant and there are no lists on the internet like these. If you say Apostasy lists have a negative agenda, then Conversion lists have a positive agenda, do they not? The point is to look at these lists objevtively. Are they useful information? Yes. Are they redundant in any way? No.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 20:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Lists are just ways of categorizing people. If they converted from one religion to another, they left the first and converted to the second. IMO, it's non-neutral to prefer only the "positive," lists of what they joined, rather than the "negative," lists of what they left, as one assumes someone left a religion for a negative reason, rather than joined another for a positive reason. Only a weak keep because it's rather a boring category, still, it is just a list. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 16:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There may be people who leave a religion and don't go to another one that is large enough for a list, or who become <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apatheism.html" title="Apatheism">apatheists</a> or whatever.

<dd>Its not redundant. People from different faiths join a certain faith. People from one faith can join many faiths. This is not being redundant. If you have one list, you should have the other one as well. When you have Lists of people who CONVERTED to Islam, WHAT is wrong with having List of people who LEFT Islam? Can you tell me? If you're saying they're redudant, tell me why the first should not be deleted and the second kept. How are these lists are redundant? Do you see Ibn Warraq in "List of people who converted to Islam"? Where should he be included? List of Athiests? My point is: <b>If CONVERSION is a serious enough issue that a list must be made for it, why is not APOSTASY?</b> Can you or anyone suggesting a <i>Delete</i> tell me that? As USUAL this AFD is yet another of the millions of attempts on Wikipedia to repeatedly censor <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a> and keep it under the carpet.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: it becomes extremely difficult to discuss with you if your interest is only in assuming bad faith: i think such accusations that other editors are attempting to "censor" material should be reserved for a medium other than wikipedia, '<a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=660210&amp;highlight=#660210" class="external text" title="http://www.faithfreedom.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=660210&amp;highlight=#660210" rel="nofollow">Brave Steed</a>'. you have not clarified my concerns above to a satisfactory degree. is pointing to the fact that there are 'lists of converts' the only justification you have for defending the lists in these noms? people don't bother with identification through negation, it's simply pointless. i don't see any encyclopaedic use for replicating names onto multiple lists when they provide no new information. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:46, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>But there is a problem in the definition the article may be using</b>. People who convert to another religion have obviously left their former one. People who become irreligious are less obvious. I think for such individual it would be necessary to have a source where they specifically say: I am no longer an X. (&amp; I believe there are some religions which consider you in their membership none the less) . In particular, there is the problem with people originally of religion X, where someone considered an authority says: So and so is no longer a X. Unless so and so aggrees and says so, how can we judge the validity of this? We could have another category for persons ejected from whatever--not just a religion--but that would be a particularly poor idea for something spiritual. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:27, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thats where references come in to prove how they left the religion. Also its probably obvious that if they're strongly critical of the religion, they have left it. For those who dont say it clearly, they are included in the Secular category for example Wafa Sultan (she's given conflicting statements about her being a Muslim, although is strongly critical and explicitly secular in her own words). People who are ejected would be a small quantity in number, these are generally few. Also people who are ejected also usually have left the religion already on their own will so they can still be included here. There could be a separate mention in this article for people who were also 'ejected'.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 14:27, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> While I recognise the possible repetition of information in these articles and agree with earlier comments that the title "List of people who left Islam" contains a subtle prejudice, I think the concept of these lists is useful. Consider someone doing research on, for example, Richard Dawkins book "The God Delusion". Such a person might wish to research people that became Atheists versus those that left Atheism for Agnosticism or even a full religion. Without a "list of ex-Athesits" such a researcher then has to carry out the research that has already gone into the production of this page and we're now discussing should be deleted. Ergo, pages of this type are in and of themselves useful. I think the title of this particular "Islam page" should be changed to move it in line with the other articles and it should be a <b>strong keep</b> -- as should its compatriots. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 04:41, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep and rename</b>. This article AfD is now being used to justify deleting all other similar purposed <i>ex-</i> articles. When people change their philosophical worldview and <i>leave</i> one particular religious belief then they don't always move straight into another but may contemplate for a while pending the establishment of their new identity. It may be an instantaneous conversion or a slow understanding of where they want to be next. Thus they may reside on one list and not be on another as a convert for many years, if at all as <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> applies and they have to have said in their own words what they are doing. The two mirror-lists (i.e. the ex- and the Converts to- ) allow us to capture what they have said on the exit and the arrival. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 05:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Muslims are more vocal, but I think "ex" lists are inherently focussed on the negative and can annoy any group being named. When I created <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ex-atheists.html" title="List of ex-atheists">List of ex-atheists</a> I did get an atheist who expressed annoyance. Several atheist sites that discuss atheists who convert to a theistic or deistic system go through efforts to say that the person is lying about ever being an atheist or when that fails they emphasize that the person in question had an "immature" or false atheism. Although in fairness I did come close to a point violation in creating it as most of the ex-lists struck me as religion bashing. (Back then they weren't so much about saying what a person later joined, the focus was almost solely on leaving a religion) Anyway in principle I think <a href="../../../f/o/r/Former_Latter-day_Saints_3c42.html" title="Former Latter-day Saints">Former Latter-day Saints</a> would also irritate LDSers, etc. Conversion lists I think are only irritating if you find the religion in question repellent. If you don't care then people converting or leaving it is likely disinteresting. Otherwise conversion lists are of interesting as conversions have effected entire nations. Leaving is only that significant when the person converts to something. (If Queen Christina of Sweden quit going to Lutheran services, but didn't go anywhere else, I doubt it would've been as significant)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Extremely strong keep</b> - the included information is encyclopedic, it's obviously not non-notable, it isn't offensive to any tradition, as nearly <i>all</i> denominations have a list, and it's not duplication, as someone that wants to know "who left this religion" would have to scour several articles to find (left X for Y), and in fact might not find them (is there an article List of converts to Buddhism?). the only way I can fathom this to be unencyclopedic is through verifiability: and the solution is not to wipe out the articles to never exist again, it's to find sources, add fact tags, or remove certain submissions.
