I'll paste the post of <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">User:Samuel Blanning</a> that best describes the reasons for deletion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There was a significant majority for deletion, and the keep proponents, on whom there is the burden to prove the article's worthiness for an encyclopaedia, did not demonstrate that this is a term <i><b>discussed</b></i> by reliable sources (rather than just used in passing). Reliable sources that discuss the term are required if we are to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article, as opposed to an article trying to cobble together a meaning from passing mentions (i.e. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research by synthesis</a>). The keep proponents refer only to a Google search (which is worthless, gfdgf, which I typed in by hitting my keyboard at random, turns up over 10,000 hits) and a BBC article which does not mention the word anywhere. Oh, and the famed 'there are other articles like this' argument, which should be cause for immediate speedy deletion until people stop using it. Nothing has apparently altered since the AfD, as the article itself currently only contains a reference to Google Groups, a supposed use by a journalist in his blog which I can't even find in the page linked to, and a use in the title of someone's book. Administrators do of course have discretion in closing AfDs, so I mean no disrespect to Deathphoenix, but deletion review has the discretion to overturn them, and I think we should in this case, even if the AfD is quite old. We could also relist, but in my opinion the old AfD and the non-negotiability of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is sufficient grounds to delete. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Attempting to establish verifibility in non-encyclopedic means, (citing Ghits in the article,) does not count and generally looks ugly.

<li><b>weak delete</b>. Hatefull? Yes. Ignorant of peoples pain? Yes. But... i am not supposed to care for that, only notability. I remember Problem-reaction-solution that had 20k google hits, going up to 30k after three month, but still geting deleted since i expanded it and thus drew attention to it. And it had even higher life span, used way back in 1998. It did not have a book title, but i have recently discovered that it was used in a swedish major news paper to derogatory "explore" my views. Anyway, i view that wikipedia could benefit from being more inclusive, but considering that it isnt so... i guess it's not.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 10:21, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Keep or merge</s></b>. I took a look at the article and added reliable sources for the origin of the term <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamikaze.html#Origins" title="Islamikaze">here</a>. According to Raphael Israeli, he coined the term in 1997 and has been using it in his work ever since. Since there are now reliable sources for the term's origin, it satisfies <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Alternately, we could merge this page and redirect to <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_attack.html" title="Suicide attack">Suicide attack</a>, where the term could be listed with the similar terms <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_attack.html#.22Homicide_bombing.22" title="Suicide attack">homicide bomber</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_attack.html#.22Homicide_bombing.22" title="Suicide attack">genocide bomber</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:25, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_attack.html" title="Suicide attack">Suicide attack</a>.</s> On reflection, the coinage of the term is verifiable, but I'm not sure it's notable enough for its own page.

<li>It's not really an internet term -- it's a term coined by one professor, Rafael Israeli. (Google scholar will get you 40 hits, but they're all to Israeli's books and articles, or to people discussing his works).

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> The standard on neologisms, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, says that we need reliable secondary sources <i>about</i> the term, not just ones that use the term.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm torn about how much work to do on the article, since it seems likely to be deleted. However, there are reliable secondary sources. E.g., Dale F. Eickelman, James Piscatori, Muslim Politics, Princeton University Press, July 26, 2004 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-691-12053-6</a>, p. ix ("Islamikaze, a term proposed by an Israeli colleague of Moroccan origin (Israeli 2003), is unlikely to catch on."). Sorry for not including it earlier - I read the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> section about reliable sources, but missed the primary/secondary distinction. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 13:15, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I apologize for changing my vote a second time, but I found some more sources. IMHO, most of the reasons stated above no longer apply, as follows.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Verifiability</i>. Per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, the origin of the term is now verified by reliable, secondary sources. As shown by the article, the term was coined by Professor Rafael Israeli in a 1997 article, and Israeli has been using it ever since. US Senator <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Nunn_1450.html" title="Sam Nunn">Sam Nunn</a> discusses the coinage of the term in one of his own scholarly articles and discusses whether the distinction between suicidal motives and military motives on the part of the bombers may be helpful in profiling possible bombers. The article also cites to two other scholarly articles attributing the creation of the term to Professor Israeli and discussing the term. In particular, the article as written today seems to address all of Sam Blanning's (and, by incorporation, Lid's) concerns in full.</li>
<li><i>Notability</i>: This is closer. Google scholar will get you about 40 hits, most of which are Israeli himself or citations to Israeli. Some people, such as Nunn, have used the term in passing, and Bat Ye'or uses the term repeatedly in her book <i>Eurabia.</i> I'm an inclusionist (plus I just did all that work), so I'd prefer to keep it.</li>
