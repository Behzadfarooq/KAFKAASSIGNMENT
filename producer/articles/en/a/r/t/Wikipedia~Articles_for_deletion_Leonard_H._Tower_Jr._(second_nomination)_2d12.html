<li><b>Keep</b> as a worthwhile stub. IMO, hits that "just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted" clause at WP:BIO. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:17, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An argument that WP:BIO shouldn't apply is always a weak argument, and indicates that the person probably does not warrant an encyclopaedia article. Any person who warrants a biographical article should easily be able to satisfy WP:BIO. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:41, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Can you tell us what you mean by that Jeff? I'm not seeing you demostrate any actual notability here so the argument you make reads to me like ruleslawyering. Surely that's not what you intended, is it? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:25, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I mean that WP:BIO is designed to set up a framework for notability, but even it realizes that not everyone who's "notable" is going to meet the standard. If you need to dismiss it as ruleslawyering, you'd be wrong and so be it, but I think his position in the FSF confers notability, and it should stay based on that. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:55, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, Jeff.... Go ahead. You have my blessing! Demonstrate that. Provide a cite that he has the position, and that it is notable enough in the history of the open software movement, or whatever else might help establish notabiilty. The keeps have been asked for this for some time, and I'm not seeing it. Hypothetical, or unsupported, assertions don't cut it for me. Until something changes in the article this is such an obvious delete that your claiming differently causes me to question your judgement about what's deletable. Providing a cite would be much more useful than the wikiwlawyering you seem to be engaged in. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:31, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you might want to lay off the accusations of wikilawyering. It's entirely unnecessary. If I find a cite between now and the end of this, I'll gladly add it - you can do so, too! But the accusations are tired and uncalled for. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You might be tired of them, yes, but they're not uncalled for in my view. Call a spade a spade and all that, your comments often look like that is what you are trying to do... If you have the cites needed to satisfy my standards here (which I think are more in tune with accepted practice than yours) I'll be falling over myself to change from delete to keep. As for adding cites, I looked. Didn't find any. Not sure I am convinced that adminning a mailing list, even for 10 years, quite counts. As I said, I have 2.5x ghits he does and I'm not notable. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:46, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, they are uncalled for. If my comments "often" look like that, you better have more than my belief that WP:BIO should be waived for this one if you're going to continue to go down that line of accusation. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:53, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So did you have any cites as to his notability, then? I have to wonder. I see a number of cites added that satisfy me that he's been part of FSF and LPF for a very long time. But they don't establish notability, to my view, just participation. I worked for IBM for 12 years, a much more notable org than FSF, but I'm not notable. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 00:22, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are arguing that someone forms part of the historical record, and <i>not</i> supported it by pointing to any such records.

<ul>
<li>Aha. Do you not have permission to disclose these primary sources to us? Because I suspect a lot of people around here know what primary sources are and how to get hold of them.

<ul>
<li>It is not a matter of permission, or me trying to hide anything... If I seemed to be doing so, it was simply because primary sources are not normally considered adequate verifiable material for encyclopedic content. I know of (some) early free software history (including GNU and FSF) mostly due to following the free software community and conversing with some of the people who have been actively involved in it from the start. I can't really tell you "go to this URL or read that book where a secondary source said this and that". Not that there necessarily isn't one; I just never really researched into it, as I didn't have to. If you look at RMS for example, there aren't that many sources either, outside of himself or the FSF, regarding many of the things we take as common knowledge, and mention in his article. <i>(added a posteriori: GRBerry makes some interesting comments below, which I think fall well into what I said here)</i> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 16:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> I searched for sources on Leonard Tower, and couldn't find any reliable ones. I think we can source that he was a director of the FSF, but as it stands, that isn't enough of a reason to have an article. He has done so well at not promoting himself, I can't find any good sources about him. However, if anyone can produce a source that says anything beyond the basics about him, I would support keeping. I don't mind having a stub if it can grow, and I think he's notable, if sources can be found. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 11:33, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is simple. It fails WP:BIO, and no reliable sources exist. Arguing to keep in the face of these facts is makes no sense. Sure the stub could be expanded. A stub about me could be expanded, but that wouldn't make me notable or magically produce reliable sources. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 13:56, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article does not verifiably demonstrate notability. There is no useful content in it that I can see.

None in the first few pages demonstrate anything other than that he posts to lists a lot. CERTAINLY no evidence of historical record or significance there. I personally got 26000 ghits last time I checked, and I <b>know</b> I am not notable. This person is not notable as far as I can see and the article is a non useful substub, and a violation of our vanity policy to boot. The arguments of the keep crowd are totally unconvincing (and those brought in to argue for keep from outside, especially so). <s><b>Delete</b></s>... there is nothing really to userify either. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:22, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Those postings to lists are primary sources for his contribution. His role for more than 10 years at the FSF was to do electronic administration for them, including handling mailing lists and usenet groups. See the citations recently introduced to the stub. As primary sources, we as Wikipedians should refrain from using them to evaluate just what his contribution was, but they are evidence of his contribution. (Also, he usually doesn't use his full name, and references to him usually don't use his full name, so that search underselects the available data. I know Len personally, but only learned his full name from Wikipedia.) Try searching for "Len Tower" plus "GNU" or "GCC" or "FSF" or "Free Software Foundation" or ...<br />

<li>Citing you from further up in this discussion, <i>His role for more than 10 years at the FSF was to do electronic administration for them, including handling mailing lists and usenet groups.</i> I wouldn't say that maintaining mailing lists is significant to the historical record. I'm pretty sure the passage from WP:BIO you cite above was not intended to mean that if you make a small contribution to chronicling, you are notable. The passage may need to be further disambiguated on that point. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 19:06, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The same source that gives this description describes Stallman's role as "Richard Stallman continues as a volunteer who does countless tasks, such as Emacs maintenance." (volume 1, #22). This is a transparently obvious understatement of the roles of the various individuals. It is, however, the only source we have found so far to use until someone competent (which isn't me), evaluates all the primary sources I was referring to above and publishes a secondary source that more accurately describes the roles of all the key players. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 12:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The fact that the cited volume only refers to Stallman's contribution to Emacs does not necessarily imply that there are contributions of LT's that are notable and omitted.

The beginnings of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software_movement.html" title="Free software movement">Free software movement</a> are important and should be documented. And part of that documentation includes the efforts and assistance offered by Len Tower in helping the FSF and Gnu Project to form and prosper. I recall first meeting Len at a <a href="../../../u/s/e/USENIX_082e.html" title="USENIX">USENIX</a> conference in 1990 and he was very active in promoting free software. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Stallman_a8be.html" title="Richard Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> (rms) wrote the code and Len helped get the word out. Richard was not that great with human interactions at that time (he is much better now!) and there really needed to be someone who believed in the cause and could communicate well with others. Len Tower was this person. There is no vanity in Len Tower.

<li><b>Strongest Possible Keep</b> This debate is completely nuts. Len has been the behind-the-scenes organizer, fund-raiser, administrator, and sanity checker for the very organization that laid the groundwork to make projects like Wikipedia possible.

He easily passes multiple <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability criteria per above. It is only his modesty through the years that keeps all the nay-sayers here from knowing just how notable he really is. Shame!

There are many more mentions of Tower in old newsgroups and mailing lists. What you have to note here is that several of the most notable events range back 20 years ago, in a time when things were much more informal. The WWW wasn't what it is today (in fact it <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html#Origins" title="World Wide Web">began</a> on 1990), and much was communicated through BBSes, Usenet and simply through personal contact at universities and user groups. Many informal references exist, some of them primary sources, some of them not. This isn't just true for Tower, it's true for most of the early hackers, including of course Stallman and others on whom we (rightfully) already have large articles (hacker here being used in the sense of computer wizard, those who advanced much of what we now take for granted). badlydrawnjeff above is right; this clearly falls under WP:BIO's "this is not an exclusionary list" explanation. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 23:18, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am quite familiar with Wikipedia's policies, but thank you nonetheless. Linking me to WP:V and WP:NOR seems to indicate that you chose to ignore the existance of references which I pointed out above as examples. Did you read the links I provided? It is unclear to me where WP:NOR comes into place in a discussion about notability, after sources showing notability have been produced. Are we arguing "letter of the law" now? Or are we trying to understand and follow the guidelines to create a better encyclopedia? WP:BIO is clear that people need not belong to that list to be notable - it would be a very limited encyclopedia otherwise, where you could only write about 10 or 12 different topics that someone thought up. Tower in fact even fits on that list, having made critical and recognized contributions which are part of the history of his specific field; this is sourced and cited above, on the sample of references which I posted.

<li>I was rebutting your arguments about BBS and direct contact, which, in addition to being OR in themselves, do not lead us to any reliable sources. Furthermore, I read the links, but neither attendance at conferences nor contribution to software development confer notability, in my opinion. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 15:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, these sources are reliable for what they prove (which is that Len Tower was on the board and participated in the project), but they don't justify anything further. This was the kind of source I was able to dig up myself, and after a bit of digging I gave up, because I could find nothing that profiles Tower, no interviews, no one discussing his contributions. Someday, maybe someone will write a book about the history of the FSF, and then we'll have the source we need. Until then, with the article being confined to either be original research or a permanent stub, I think we shouldn't have an article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:28, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed. How about putting the verifiable parts of the above into the FSF article, and leave a redirect from Leonard H. Tower to that article? would that do?

<ul>
<li>What possible relevance could that have? I breathe air too, but I'm not notable... that's called spurious reasoning&#160;:-) Did you redesign and rewrite, almost from scratch, what today could very easily be argued to be the most widely recognized and notable compiler worldwide, just to name one example? If you did, you would indeed be notable in your field. And that article would be about you. We have a huge article on Torvalds, who created a very widely recognized free kernel. That's great. We even have an article on a sysadmin whose sole contribution to mankind, from his article, was apparently creating a directory in an FTP server for Torvalds to put his kernel sources in. That's great too, if only a bit inconsistent given what we're arguing to delete here. Given the choice between outright deletion and a redirect, of course a redirect is the lesser evil. However, I still believe that there is no harm in leaving the article; we have information to cite, from official sources - GNU bulletin being one, the official AUTHORS file for GNU diff (only the program that allows version control systems such as Wikipedia to even work) being another, the GCC documentation being another, etc. Mangojuice noted that we don't seem to have a book telling the history of Len Tower yet; indeed, it would be nice for such a thing to exist, and we could definitely expand on the article if it did appear. Until then, though, why delete the article? As long as it doesn't have false information, or information that cannot be sourced, and given that he is notable in his field, why not keep the stub and let the natural process of Wikipedia evolve the article in its own speed? Surely you cannot expect an article to grow from a 2-line stub to a featured article over the course of 5 days or whatever, during an AfD. We have countless stubs that need enhancement, some more worthy than others (heck, some stubs are far more worthy than some articles I've seen). Why should this article not have the same chance? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 21:07, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dude... if you can provide a verifiable cite for "redesign and rewrite, almost from scratch, what today could very easily be argued to be the most widely recognized and notable compiler worldwide" as far as I am concerned, this discussion is over, Len is notable. But that's not what has been put forth so far, it has been about maintaining mailing lists and how much was posted in the old days of usenet. Provide a cite for the gcc assertion, a solid verifiable cite, and I'm on your side. But mostly what you have been doing is not that, it has been arguing against the guideline. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:24, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Lar, did you notice (and read) the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Leonard_H._Tower_Jr._%28second_nomination%29_2d12.html#Capi-refs" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Leonard H. Tower Jr. (second nomination)">references</a> I quoted above? In particular, the GNU bulletin vol 1, no 1. That bulletin establishes Tower as GNU's #2 (after Stallman) and clearly defines his role with GCC, in section "4. C compiler". GNU is the official organization which produces GCC, and that particular part was written by Stallman, the organization's founder and person who initially started GCC. Furthermore, the GNU bulletins are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/" class="external text" title="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/" rel="nofollow">official GNU publications</a>. Here is the link again, for convenience: <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/bull/01/bull01.txt" class="external text" title="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/bull/01/bull01.txt" rel="nofollow">GNU Bulletin Vol 1, no 1</a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 21:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What's more interesting is that the cited 1986 bulletin contradicts the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Compiler_Collection_cfca.html" title="GNU Compiler Collection">GNU Compiler Collection</a> article, which gives Stallman as the author with a date of 1987 (no inline source given). So either this part of history has been misrepresented by Stallman in the books given as references at the bottom of that article, or the article is not true to those sources either, or possibly LT bailed out of GCC development before 1987. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 01:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well noticed. GCC's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.misc/msg/32eda22392c20f98" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.misc/msg/32eda22392c20f98" rel="nofollow">first beta release</a> was indeed made on March 1987 (note the post was made by Len, quoting Stallman). <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html#historical" class="external text" title="http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html#historical" rel="nofollow">GCC Releases (Historical section)</a> confirms this. Now, for a beta release to have existed on March 1987, programming must have started earlier. I believe the problem is simply that the GCC article is ambiguous. It should be corrected to state something like "GCC was first released on 1987" or something equivalent. I wouldn't say the authorship of GCC is in dispute; to my knowledge, Stallman did indeed start work on GCC, and continue on with it. Tower made substantial contributions to GCC, though, being responsable for a thorough redesign in the early stages (to lose the Pastel dependency and rewrite the thing in C), and assorted work on the front end, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 10:58, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Some, <i>not all</i>, sources above are newsgroup postings. For the most part, newsgroup postings constitute self-published materials that lacked fact checking processes before publication, much they way that Wikipedia lacks a reliable pre-publication fact checking mechanism. Per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, the guideline on reliable sources, such publications, including both Wikipedia and newsgroup postings, are not reliable enough sources to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This can feel odd in comparison to how we handle websites on a case by case basis to those of us that remember the pre-web days of the net. I personally believe that the same skills needed to evaluate if a web page is a reliable source are the ones needed to evaluate if a newsgroup posting is a reliable source. But that isn't the community consensus. So I'll I'm adding to the article are the facts from items meeting WP:RS that I also am confident I can represent correctly. So far just the FSF and LPF's periodicals have met both tests for me. I'm quite sure the author's file portions of the software documentation is a reliable source per WP:RS, but I think it is a primary source that I personally am not qualified to interpret. So I'm now adding a fact here, a sentence there, as we identify more usable reliable sources.</li>
<li>With the sources identified to date, it is impossible to write a featured article, but that isn't a standard we even mention in most AfD discussions. Every fact in the article now is cited to a reliable source, except for Len's birthdate (which could readily be cited to one of the external links if we want to be that picky). With that level of citation, I feel that the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> concern about the present form of the article is a bit unreasonable. Concern about future versions should be addressed through the normal editing process. After all, WP:V is focused on defending specific facts and edits. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:34, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Then I vote to keep as per all the arguments in the previous discussion&#160;;-) Joking aside, though, I would say that cleary, there is at the very least a lack of consensus as to what "the right thing to do originally" was. You and others who wanted to delete argued in the DRV that the previous discussion should had been closed for deletion because there were 3 votes to delete in the last day; myself and others who wanted to keep argued that the discussion should had been closed for keeping because there were 6 votes to keep (and no delete votes whatsoever in the first 5 days).

<li>You're twisting things once again. It was ruled in DRV that the nomination should be relisted, which means including the previous votes and listing the AfD again to gather more views. However, in this instance, the old discussion was not relisted. Instead, a new discussion was started, so all the people who originally complained that process had not been followed were apparently happy with process not being followed second time round, presumably because the offense was in their favour. If you're going to be a process wonk, you had better be consistent.

<li>Twisting things once again, pushing POV, trying to gain unfair advantage, process wonk... Well, I'll <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> somehow, even though you don't really seem to. What I would like to know is how not listing the previous opinions is favoring the keep side... (or the delete side, for that matter.) Both in here and in the DRV (where at least it was on topic) you consistently mention the previous delete votes as though there were 50 regular users who argued to delete and everyone was conspiring to hide that fact. I have nothing against including the previous votes; they favored us anyway. In any case, "relist" to me implies "listing again", as in doing another vote, but hey if the normal procedure is to include previous votes then fine, message an admin and ask him to do it. My previous comment, that if we are here to relist and discuss deleting the article, then we should do it instead of playing with hidden implications of prejudice and cabal, still stands, though. Both sides feel that their point of view was the right one - that's called a <i>disagreement</i>.

<li>You need to familiarise yourself with policy before you make assertions about how things should be done around here. SPecifically, please look up the specific meaning of "relist".

<li>So let's include them, then. Either copy them in, or, make the link in the header loads more prominent. I think when we start process wonking we have to not pick and choose among processes.

<ul>
<li>Repeat something often enough and it becomes true... 1) [red herring] Someone has yet to show how not including the previous votes has skewed anything, especially when there were far more regular users arguing for keep than there were for delete. 2) [straw man] The point is moot anyway, because no one here is arguing against including the previous votes, so if anyone feels prejudiced against, by all means include them. 3) [red herring] It is hardly process wonking when we overturn an AfD that had at least 6 regular user arguments for keep over 5 days, and 3 arguments for delete in the last day, and got speedy-closed as delete (on WP:SNOW, on top of it, if anything SNOW would have meant it should be closed as keep). 4) Can we please do whatever to solve the issue of previous votes already, and go back to discussing keeping or deleting the article? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 14:31, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Meh. All your process points don't actually address the real issues here... this is a substub article (and therefore deletable in my view, as often NOTHING is better than a unsourced substub) about a person whose notability has not been established, and apparently, can't be. Were I the closing admin of this AfD or the first one (I am not and, as a participant, won't be...) I would say this is a clear delete. Numbers are irrelevant, who turned up when is irrelevant, that it was closed a bit early is irrelevant, what matters is the strength of the arguments, because AfD is not a vote, and the Delete argument is running away with this. All the keeps can do, seemingly, is raise process, which, frankly, isn't what this encyclopedia is about. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:25, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>We've seen no unequivocal evidence of the <b>notability</b> of Len's contribution to gcc. A lot of people have contributed to gcc over the years.

<li>Let me get this straight. The sources show that RMS decided to write the first version of the compiler in an rare extension of Pascal, resulting in a very nonportable design, and you don't think translating it into C and overhauling the parser, intermediate language, and VAX (most numerous platform of the time) target description as the second person to touch the code was a notable contribution? That is an opinion with which I not only disagree, but which I think is ridiculous, and worthly of very much ridicule, which should reflect on the quality of your education and educators.

<li>Are you suggesting that more software is compiled with Microsoft compilers than gcc? Please look again; you will find just the opposite. Just because a lot of people use Microsoft on their desktops doesn't mean that they use it at their bank, or their grocery store, or their gas station, or in their cars, or in their telephones, or at their factories, or airlines, or for their email and web software.

<li>Now let <i>me</i> get this straight. Since his notability now seems to hinge on whether or not he has made huge contributions to gcc, let's be very careful about this. The source says <i>is working on this</i>, not <i>has completed</i>. The source given does not indicate that Len significantly contributed to the completion of the transition from Pastel to C. Furthermore, the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Compiler_Collection_cfca.html" title="GNU Compiler Collection">gcc</a> does not mention Tower in spite of citing three sources, two of them by Stallman. It seems that at least one person is taking or being given more credit than he deserves. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 15:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I believe this can be explained by the fact that RMS depends on income from speaking fees, and Tower does not. However, I will take another look at the gcc article. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a> 15:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not wanting to involve myself too much in this line of discussion, I would just note that the Stallman sources cited in the GCC article do not go much toward authorship or development history; they are reference manuals, they discuss usage and technical characteristics. Regardless of this, I really don't think going down a path of "which one person wrote more lines of code" or "someone is lieing" is productive or even relevant. Stallman is generally recognized as the person who created GCC; he did not do so alone, naturally. Tower is one person who is cited officially as having been a very important contributor. He was the person resonsable for changing GCC from an initial design which was written in Pastel, non-portable, impractical and unmaintainable (keeping the compiler in that language would have meant a project within a project, as there was no other compiler which could compile Pastel in the first place) to something completely different and modular, written in C, a design which evolved into what we have now. We have an article on Torvalds, who created the Linux kernel, but we also have articles on a few important contributors; should we delete those, because "many people have contributed to Linux over the years"? Clearly not. Please do not reduce this to a matter of "who was the one guy who created GCC so that we can keep him and delete the other" or whatever; they are both important figures, in GCC and not only (sources have been listed for other projects besides GCC - e.g. GNU diff - and other things besides programming as well) along with the rest of the other hackers on whom we already have articles. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 15:53, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(edit conf) capi, we're trying to establish whether among all the hundreds of people who've contributed to gcc, Len Tower is sufficiently outstanding to be considered "notable". We simply can't afford to have an article on every contributor to gcc. Now, where's my vim?&#160;;) Also, can you guys get used to writing your comments once rather than keep amending them, because I'm getting very fed up with these edit conflicts. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 15:59, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps you already know this, but if you can improve the diff engine, then you can cut down on the number of edit conflicts that occur. But I digress.

(Tony Sidaway, for example, doesn't have an article). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:26, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>MediaWiki is just one of hundreds of programs which incorporate diff into their functions. Source code control systems, for example. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a> 06:59, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know, but that wasn't what you originally said&#160;:) I was just pointing out the fallacy of that particular argument. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:23, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> seems as notable as any other of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Category%7EFree_software_programmers_1494.html" title="Category:Free software programmers">free software hackers</a> at Wikipedia. Why the controversey (I don't have time to read this entire page)? P.S. I'm sure Len contributed to GNU diff, but probably not MediaWiki's implementation. It's probably true, just overstated. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshawley_269b.html" title="User:Ashawley">Ashawley</a> 17:17, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>GNU diff was translated to MediaWiki "verbatim" according to the PHP source. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a> 17:20, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The controversy originally arose because the user that goes by the nick Lentower started the article about the person he professes to be. &lt;/paranoia&gt; - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 19:55, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is not my area of expertise, but after my attention was called to this article, I found the stub to have enough content to be interesting. It also seemed as though there were enough citations. However, I did not check them. The one point that worried me was that the subject of the article appeared to have made edits to his own biography, which can be bad. <a href="../../../m/c/a/User%7EMCalamari_04d3.html" title="User:MCalamari">MCalamari</a> 18:01, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Admittedly, this isn't my field of expertise either. The article itself seems to speak of verifiable and significant achievements, and the version I read of it seemed adequately referenced with sources that are likely reliable for the facts cited from them. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of TlÃ¶n</a> 18:19, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, duh. Why is it that two-bit Linux dweebs whose notability comes from one blog posting last year are "notable", and a major figure in the founding of the FSF is controversial? Is everything to be wrapped around Pokemon-level superficiality now? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 18:28, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Who are these "two-bit Linux dweebs" and why haven't you nominated their article for deletion? Anyway, the problem here isn't so much notability AFAIC but reliable sources. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:24, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
