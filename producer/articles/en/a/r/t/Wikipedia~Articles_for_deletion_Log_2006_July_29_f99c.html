<li><b>Delete</b>. Currently, I don't see any reason why we need an article for each book. Perhaps if these can be expanded beyond "This book makes topic x easier to understand for the average person," they might be worth keeping.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> the "xth edition" ones, as they're monstrously unneccessary. <b>Delete</b> the others listed with a <b>redirect</b> to the series itself (that article could probably be expanded with a brief summary of what's in each book, but there's no need for separate articles on each). I'll admit, though, that the Koran one is written by at least one probably-notable author (Toropov), but that doesn't make the book itself notable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 01:55, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete the lot</b>. The books' existence is verifiable, but the articles make no assertion of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> as we delete these books, we are necessarily setting a precedent and bar for all books. Unless something is particularly notable about a book or an author, WP judges notability by sales volumes; these have relatively high sales volumes that few books will match or beat. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:27, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps a good rule to use would be, if a book comes in a series, is its sale volume notally better than that of its series overall? If a book sold very well, but the rest of the series sold equally well, it might well be better to cover the whole series in a single article. (The length of the series in question may also have some influence.) <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenelope_D_a4b7.html" title="User:Penelope D">Penelope D</a> 05:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're absolutely correct about a sophmoric nomination that was an ill-conceived attempt at humor. The reason why the article should be deleted is that while of his numerous accomplishments each comes close, he has not done any one thing that would qualify him under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. His basketball accomplishments were in Division II. Cofounding a company that is later sold for $1.2 billion is impressive, but $1 billion companies are fairly common these days. There are many other high-achievers who do not have articles here. As for his campaign for Senate (and I know we disagree on this), I think the 100 years test is appropriate. With few exceptions, no one in 100 years is going to care about a candidate for Senate unless he wins. The notablility of candiates is ephemeral.

The result was: I have <b>speedily deleted</b> this page. It was an empty page. A CSD tag was removed four days ago and replaced with {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}, but despite the promise to write "an explanation of the grounds for contesting the speedy deletion", neither such an explanation nor any attempt to add even a word's worth of content has been made in these last 4 days. The title appears to indicate <a href="http://film.virtual-history.com/film.php?filmid=2650" class="external text" title="http://film.virtual-history.com/film.php?filmid=2650" rel="nofollow">this German film</a>, but in a quick search I was unable to find any sources that may be used to write an article of encyclopedic value. Should the page's creator (or anyone else) be able to do so, they are welcome to try. In the meantime, however, the encyclopedia is under no obligation to hold non-encyclopedic article pages. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;">Encephalon</span></a> 04:52, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. On the one hand, Wikipedia isn't paper, and the idea that we would include an event only if someone died is appalling; lives surely were touched even if there were no deaths.

Where is that norm mentioned? Speaking of which, where is this article linked from? Nowhere.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> <i>Family Guy</i> episodes have already been AfD'd twice, and kept both times. This article, in particular, is certainly not a great article, but it's incredibly hard to have references and citations for a <i>synopsis of an episode of a television show</i>. I doubt there are many reliable sources that deal with individual TV episodes. The article is certainly incredibly notable (the premiere episode of one of the most well-known TV shows in the world), and whatever isn't up to par can be easily cleaned up. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 17:55, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh yeah... my memorey slips sometimes. I didn't think that debate worked out becuase I had someone keep telling me that the episode itself is a reliable source.

<li>Actually, that isn't original research. See <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It says "Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged." So using primary sources is fine. What you can't do is original analysis. SO you can source a plot summary to the episode itself. You just can't say, for instance, that an episode is a fan favorite without a source. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 00:45, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Howdy. I'll try to be brief, but such a comment usually means the opposite so...yeah. Ahem. Sourcing is good; We all know that. However, ultimately, the sources are also just as important. You cannot, for example, source a whole article with a fansite—unless the article is about the fansite, of course—and yes, the tree article would be original research unless you can prove your findings. You cannot just say "I've got wood". We'll need pictures and location varification. I digress. Sources, largely, are a form of media. Rarely Multi, but then again, look at <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shin_MegaMan_DS_b940.html" title="Shin MegaMan DS">Shin MegaMan DS</a>. Okay. Television is a source, as stated above. It's not infallible, but we're not talking about <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzyte.html" title="Enzyte">Natural male enhancement</a> or something. We're talking about a popular televised program. If we polled all the Family Guy fans on Wikipedia, they'd vouched for the factual accuracy of this article. That should say something. Futhermore, look at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics.html" title="Comics">comics</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_books.html" title="Comic books">comic books</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>: As Stephen Spender said, "Writing a poem and waiting for a response is like dropping a rose petal down a well and waiting for a splash." Poets don't get a lot of attention. That leaves us in really dire straits if we want to tell the famous from the vain, so the requirement of the article to offer verification is even more vital with poets. In this case, we can find no trace of author or book, and the title is such an obvious metaphor that the contents of the book aren't very promising. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:04, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That is not true. We have many, many articles on future events.

<li>Yes, but it's <i>wrong</i> to say that. An article on a future event like the 2008 election should and could only be about current campaigning for it (which is in-the-news and therefore not appropriate) or a line saying, "We in the US plan to have one" (which is empty). Otherwise, we ask authors to decide for themselves the difference between sure-things and possibles, and the youngster can swear that a mention on aint-it-cool-news.com of a Rug Rats IV movie is sufficient for a full article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was merely pointing out that we have hundreds if not thousands of articles on the issues surrounding future events. The topic is authorized by policy.

<li>I wasn't trying to pick a fight, and I'm sorry if I seemed belligerant. I won't make appeals to "I remember when we used to delete all these things" or anything like that, and I do bow to precedent when it's strong enough, but I think this one was wrongheaded. We can't blame authors for violating the crystal ball stricture when we allow so many things like this.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with your reasons to delete the page. For that reason I went through and drastically changed the site to include only names of candidates that ARE running for their party, or candidates that have viable sources for their rumor (they told so-and-so that they are considering). I removed anyone that I could not find a souce for. Including even Ralph Nader (I totally expect him to be back up later). Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, and it was getting to the point that anyone with a name could be added. The arguments here are right.

Just like Democrats and Republicans all third parties must go through a process where the main party elects one person to run. So the people are ACTUAL Primary candidates ... but only POSSIBLE U.S 2008 election candidates.

<li><b>Comment</b> This argument has been used before, that it's POV or "unfair" to only cover the parties and candidates that are well-known, but let's face it: Wikipedia is not the League of Women Voters candidate guide, and does not exist to publicize or promote unknown parties and candidates. Of the five parties listed, most people have only even heard of two, and very few have heard of the candidates even for those two. The independent candidates are even more obscure. This looks to me like a list of non-notable people, in addition to the crystalballism of guessing whether they'll matter at all. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Smith</a>'s book <i>Atheism: The Case Against God</i>, written in 1974 and pretty well known, shows that it's not a neologism. The paperback edition has a sales ranking of 11,150 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087975124X/ref=ed_oe_p/002-6258474-1448009?ie=UTF8" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087975124X/ref=ed_oe_p/002-6258474-1448009?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">at Amazon</a>; it's a reasonably common book.

<li><b>Comment</b> - agreed; for purposes of this AfD, the focus should be on whether or not the term exists, and it seems that it does so verifiably. Debate over any possible inherent fallacies in the term and its use should be saved for philosophy forums. If anything, more sources could be added, but I'd guess that some philosophy-oriented Wikipedians will have a pretty easy time coming up with some print sources. .

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not about agnostics, but about a particular sort of theist. I've encountered several people like this, who believe in God (and are therefore theists) but claim that it is impossible to know anything about God (agnostic). It is a peculiarly irrational viewpoint, but they do exist. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoatBringer_f2ea.html" title="User:StoatBringer">StoatBringer</a> 11:17, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The issue should not be about whether we think Agnostic theism is a "logical fallacy" or not. That is a POV, and if people nonetheless fit this description, it should not be discounted (I think many religious beliefs are a logical fallacy, but clearly that's not a reason to delete the articles!) The issue is notability and verifiability, of the term and/or the concept. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 11:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a>: Despite the fact that the term is used, it is used primarily as a species of agnosticism.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is interesting in itself, though somewhat confused in places. Agnostic Theism may or may not be an active and positive(?) philosophy, but it is a philosophical position that is not unsuited to a deeper level of description than might be provided on the Agnosticism article. (Incidentally, agnostic theism is not necessarily a "state of doubt". The two may coincide, but one can be an agnostic theist who is certain of God's existence while recognising that there is insufficient justification - certainty is a psychological state, knowledge is not) --<a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtob_3e39.html" title="User:Atob">Atob</a> 02:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I am leery of blanket claims like "All <i>x</i> are/are not notable", since that leads to lengthy arguments of the "Are not!" "Are too!" variety. Sticking to policy issues, the article fails to establish notability under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, for not having multiple non-trivial articles by third parties. The fact he had a case go to the State Supreme Court is not particularly notable since that happens a lot (it's why state supreme courts exist); and, at most, it makes him notable only in Wisconsin (not a bad thing, but the rulings obviously don't bother anyone outside of State lines). Congratulations on the "Case of the Month" award, but as I understand the nature of that award, it will always be awarded, so it's not exactly a particularly demanding criterion. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:48, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I suppose it's graceless of me to mention my law, so I won't, but I'm honored to be in such august company. Yes, it is humorous and empirical and a statement of correlation, but it's also predictive, because any article at a miniscule last name can't <i>stay there.</i> In other words, the least we can do is move the article to a proper spelling, so we'd pretty much <i>have to</i> motion for <b>merge and redirect to Roderick Cameron</b> (which doesn't exist yet). I think judges can be significant enough, and especially those who manage to get publicity through their rulings. This particular article does not offer verifiable evidence <i>yet</i> of such. Therefore, I move to delete <i>with absolutely no prejudice against a properly lodged and verifiably significant article at the proper location.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:29, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Sir, I respectfully request that the word Kuatagh will not be deleted. It's term firstly used to describe the alumni of MRSM Kuantan, an elite school in Malaysia but the term is also used as an adejective to decribe coolness of intellect.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The article is without context, so it could be speedied as incomprehensible due to lack of context, but that wouldn't be my argument. There is nothing in the article that suggests that the group is actually achieving anything, except growth. As <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Abbey_dfb4.html" title="Edward Abbey">Edward Abbey</a> said, "Growth for its own sake is the ideology of the cancer cell."

<p>The result was <b>speedy close</b>. Let me count the ways ...</p>
<ol>
<li>AfD is <i>not</i> the place to go if you want to propose a merge.</li>
<li>You can perform a merge yourself, anyway. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">Be bold</a>!</li>
<li>Once the article has been merged, <i>it cannot be deleted</i>. No, really, <b>it can't</b>.

<dd>One of the phrases we should <i>never</i> hear on AfD is "de-prodded without any explanation". It doesn't have any relevance to your rationale for deletion, and only serves to increase the perception in the minds of other Wikipedians that de-prodding articles is a Bad Thing, when in fact it's one of the cornerstones of the process. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 12:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, it will. For the person who thought the article wasn't worth deleting ... it won't be deleted (at least, not by PRODding).

<dd>While a lack of explanation is not reason enough to go ahead and delete something, I don't agree that it shouldn't even be mentioned. I see "failed prod" in AfD nominations on a regular basis. If an article was de-prodded, then I want to know why so I can take that into account when "voting" in the AfD. It's easier if the nominator gives me that info here so I don't have to dig through the history (which, depending on the article and the edit summaries, might take plenty of digging indeed). If an article is de-prodded for a stated reason, I'll include that in my AfD nomination, too. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 21:39, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, we see it in AfD nominations all the time — and that's a Bad Thing. The general atmosphere is not so much, "I think other AfDers would be interested to know why the PROD tag was removed, so they can share in the de-prodder's indignance", but more along the lines of, "some utter PRICK removed the tag, so I'm forced to waste all y'all's time with an AfD nomination. If we delete this article, we'll teach him a lesson!" I appreciate your bone fides here, and I agree with you that if the de-PRODder gave a reason for removing the tag it should be noted somewhere in the AfD discussion. However, if it's removed without discussion then it's not particularly relevant — and we see far too many annoyed nominations complaining about de-PRODders. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 08:06, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please don't use the phrase "process must be followed". It makes experienced Wikipedians' teeth itch. One of the things about process on Wikipedia is that, if there is a good reason to ignore process, then following process is actually the Wrong Thing. Let's not fetishise it, eh?

<li>I'll use it that phrase if I like, thanks very much. It's an entirely reasonable position. I'm a deletionist who tries to be fair, and upholding process is one of the things which keep the more strident aspects of my views and other different strident views of other people in check. I'm modestly experienced at Wikipedia, there's no need to condescend and dismiss me as a newbie either. My explanation of my reasons is good enough in this case, as the nomination clearly states that it is <i>specifically</i> about the grace period for translation. I don't know what you think the nomination is about. As for as I can tell, you're suggesting that for unexplained reasons, this untranslated page doesn't deserve the full amount of grace period suggested by guidelines, and so we should apply <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> arbitrarily. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:47, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've not suggested anything of the sort. All I've said is that "process must be followed" is the Wrong Thing to say: it's anti-Wikipedia and anti-common sense and profoundly silly. That doesn't mean I disagree with your view, that the article should not have been nominated so early. It just means that I think a better argument than "Process says X, and I am a fan of process" should have been provided. Process is good only when there is a good reason to follow it; in such cases (and I don't make a claim either way as to whether or not this is such a case), it's better to state that reason rather than simply rely on the magic word "process", which, as I said, makes people's teeth itch. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 08:10, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>An article on this topic (with, of course, the spelling corrected) would undoubtedly be useful. However, it would need to be a) far, <i>far</i> less biased towards the USA; b) more general — discussing the concept and its remifications rather than the current, almost list-like format we see now.

<li><b>Delete</b> the article is little more than a series of forks from various other controversies. WP needs a Rights of the fetus article, but this is not the kernel of it. It is missing the most fundamental piece: there is no coverage of how the laws of various countries treat whether a fetus is a person, just a few examples without discussion of whether these examples are the norm or the outliers. Best as I can discern from a quick snoop over the internet, which is always <i>caveat lector</i>: in some jurisdictions, a fetus is treated as a person for inheritance if its dad dies, it shares with the already born children; it's not a person for driving in a high-occupancy vehicle lane; it's a person if the mother is killed; it's not a person if the mother aborts it if abortion is legal; it's not counted in a census and is therefore not "represented" in the Anglo-American governmental sense; it is a person for tax purposes (so it pays the same death duties as the living siblings if dad dies leaving an estate); etc....This is the stuff we need in this sort of an article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:51, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> or <b>merge.</b> Evidently, I did not give sufficient explanation in my original post.

The numbered citations were deadlinks and the "External links" section was assumed to be just that — an <i>external links</i> section — not a "Reference" or "Source" list.

<p>For one thing, this is a pretty subjective list and possibly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>. For another, there's not a page on comedy songs, and it's generally considered bad form to have a "list of..." page when there's no subject page to reference. Third, even if this isn't considered subjective or OR, a category would work just as well here, if not better. I'll admit this isn't one of my more certain nominations, but it really doesn't seem to fit WP.

<li><b>Keep</b>, there are articles on parody (which most of these songs are) and on comedy.

<li><b>Delete</b> How does one define a comedy song? Does it differ from a parody? How about a novelty song? Whereas those two terms are fairly well-defined, a "comedy song" is not really an established term. If it is a catch-all for anything that is supposed to be humourous, then the natural question is, how much of it is supposed to be humourous? What about normal songs that with obvious puns and jokes included? As there's no generally accepted definition for "comedy song," this list cannot be NPOV. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGassyGuy_6931.html" title="User:GassyGuy">GassyGuy</a> 07:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Couldn't merge them all in, in my opinion.

<li><b>Delete</b> Next time, make it an article on "comedy songs" including a section on "song parodies" as well as "comedy dialect songs" such as "I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas." These date back to the very first records by Edison. As a raw list it is not compelling. It does not even give the year, and how many are from the 1950's or earlier? Most of the songs are unfamiliar and the titles themselves are not generally funny.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Incomplete nomination, I am completing nomination now. I will also remove the prod &amp; prod2a tags from the page as an AFD nomination trumps a prod (per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>). Prod concern was "Article content is already in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_Conflict_bb05.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict</a> page". My prod 2a concern was "Title also represents a POV fork problem. This whole situation is too recent and should be confined to a minimal number of comprehensive articles until some persepctive is possible." The title issue has been fixed by moving, but if this page goes the redirect at <a href="../../../a/y/t/Ayta_al-Sha%60b_incident_f6fb.html" title="Ayta al-Sha`b incident">Ayta al-Sha`b incident</a> needs to be attended to and the half dozen pages that point at it (including a template) also need attending to. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 05:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A little known production company which has very little history (founded in 2004). The article lists movies prior to that which are acually produced by Bigel/Mailer Films. Note that each of these almost unquestionnably falls in the B-movie class and none of them have any independent notability. Furthermore, the article was created by Jordanbigel (<a href="../../../j/o/r/User_talk%7EJordanbigel_248d.html" title="User talk:Jordanbigel">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jordanbigel_e770.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jordanbigel">contribs</a>) which raises suspicion of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>. As a company I think it's safe to say it fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and the google test returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22bigel+entertainment%22&amp;btnG=Rechercher&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22bigel+entertainment%22&amp;btnG=Rechercher&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">306 hits</a>, although only 93 unique hits which is not a whole lot for a Hollywood based production company. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 06:12, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>What can I say?</b> The production company is new but in the film industry the banner you work under is less important then the credits you have to your name. In this case Daniel has produced 10 full length feature films and has just become a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (a fact which I do intend to add to the article). The fact that I am related to Daniel should in no way bear on the decision to remove the article.</p>
<p>If the requirements for inclusion in Wikipedia rests on some evaluation of the quality of the films then I would refer to Daniel's most recent release, the <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Bacon_2862.html" title="Kevin Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a> film <a href="../../../l/o/v/Loverboy_%28film%29.html" title="Loverboy (film)">Loverboy</a> which is also Mr. Bacon's directorial debut. This film as well as several other films produced by Daniel Bigel already have entries in Wikipedia. For example <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Man_88e2.html" title="Harvard Man">Harvard Man</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_%282002_film%29.html" title="Empire (2002 film)">Empire</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_and_White_%281999_film%29_c11c.html" title="Black and White (1999 film)">Black and White (1999 film)</a></i> are all included in Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jordanbigel (<a href="../../../j/o/r/User_talk%7EJordanbigel_248d.html" title="User talk:Jordanbigel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jordanbigel_e770.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jordanbigel">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> The requirements are not really on the quality of the films although that would not hurt. Of course a production company with a long history of films would be notable enough but in the case such as this one where the company is very young (even including the Bigel/Mailer era) then the quality, impact and success of the movies <i>is</i> important. <i>Loverboy</i> has gotten mostly bad reviews <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1162110-loverboy/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1162110-loverboy/" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> and has been a commercial flop. The same can be said of Empire <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1118698-empire/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1118698-empire/" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> and Harvard man <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harvard_man/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harvard_man/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> (which went essentially straight to DVD).</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The page does read like blog-promotion. But the fact that major old-media outlets (NYT etc) turned to a personal blog as a source in a time of major national crisis is kind of significant to the history of media -- just because it was probably one of the first times that had happened. However, merging the info into a section on "Media coverage" (which I'm surprised to see doesn't exist yet) on the <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> page would be fine--or maybe put it in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> article. Minus the puff-quotes of course. <a href="../../../d/y/b/User%7EDybryd_6f7d.html" title="User:Dybryd">Dybryd</a> 20:14, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems Mr. Loy is also featured in Spike Lee's new movie about Hurricane Katrina.<a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/im-a-movie-star.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/im-a-movie-star.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> -- 137.53.94.17 00:34, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No opinion</b> As the subject of the article, I'm not qualified to express an opinion on whether it should be deleted or not. However, I just want to say that it is NOT a "vanity page," if I understand the definition of that term correctly. I did not create the article, and I have no idea who did. Nor have I participated in the revert wars that have happened in recent months; I've watched them with some amusement, but have remained on the sidelines. Anyway, if the Wikipedia community thinks it's not sufficiently notable to be included, that's fine, but I would appreciate it if people wouldn't imply that I created an article about myself when in fact I did nothing of the sort. -- Brendan Loy, Aug. 18, 2006, 11:14 PM EDT</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems from the coverage that this blog was never used as a source for any news; just in the scores of articles about Katrina a couple noted his coverage of it. And nothing of any note has happened since then, nor does his blog have enough readers to meet the standards of notability. Not to mention that he has now made an entry on his blog about how his entry is up for deletion--insisting that it is not "meatpuppetry," naturally, but simply informing his readers (who are, as far as I can tell, his parents and a few college friends) of the "interesting" fact that it's up for a vote.

<li>This would be the most I would agree with. The only arguable notability of the blog was a few puff pieces related to Katrina a year ago. The only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage, and it was not enough attention that an account of Katrina would mention Brendan Loy other than perhaps as a minor footnote. Wikipedia should reflect that. I still think he's not worth a mention at all, but if he merits any Wikipedia mention it should be as a minor footnote to Hurricane Katrina, not an entry of his own.

<ul>
<li><small>Okay, look. I again reiterate that I am expressing <b>no opinion</b> about whether the article is notable. That's a decision for y'all, not me, to make. But I'm not going to let blatant untruths and character assassination go unchallenged. First of all, the implication that I'm engaging in meatpuppetry, despite my <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/wiki-wars.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/wiki-wars.html" rel="nofollow">repeated, straightforward, honest statements to the contrary</a>, is a flagrant violation of "assume good faith." Secondly, the assertion that my readers are my "parents and a few college friends" is laughably false. Really, I'm flattered by the assertion that I have thousands of "college friends," but it's just not true; I wasn't <i>that</i> popular in college!&#160;:) Before Katrina, my blog averaged around 1,250 unique hits per day; during and in the immedate aftermath of Katrina, that shot up to 7,500+ per day, and as many as 20,000-33,000 on some days; and since November of last year, after Katrina, it's hovered around 2,000 per day (see for yourself <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=36" class="external text" title="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=36" rel="nofollow">here</a>), with occasional higher bursts (last week, for example, I received a <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=35" class="external text" title="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=35" rel="nofollow">ton of traffic</a> because of widespread blogospheric discusison of my commentary on the Lieberman-Lamont election (and, to a lesser extent, the London terror plot). That leads to my final point: "the only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage" is simply, flatly, verifiably untrue. See, for example, <a href="http://instapundit.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=brendanloy.com+OR+66.237.232.84&amp;ResultDisplay=ascend" class="external text" title="http://instapundit.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=brendanloy.com+OR+66.237.232.84&amp;ResultDisplay=ascend" rel="nofollow">this list of 69 links from InstaPundit</a> since February 2003 -- only about 20 of them related to Katrina. Other topics covered on my blog that have received significant attention from multiple prominent bloggers: my coverage of the Bush-Lieberman "kiss" (try googling "bush lieberman kiss," without quotes, and see what comes up); my commentary on John Kerry's deficiencies during the 2004 election; my coverage of the <i>South Park</i> controversy back in March (check the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Wars_Part_II_7677.html" title="Cartoon Wars Part II">Wikipedia entry</a> and the link to "Internet clip" in paragraph 4 of "Real-life censorship controversy"); the Lieberman-Lamont election and the London plot, as I mentioned (see for example <a href="http://technorati.com/search/www.brendanloy.com" class="external text" title="http://technorati.com/search/www.brendanloy.com" rel="nofollow">Technorati</a>); and there's plenty more. Technorati notes I have recevied 737 links from 310 blogs, by the way. Also getting plenty of attention: my coverage of USC and Notre Dame football generally, and specifically my videos of the USC-Notre Dame game last fall, taken from the ND student section, which have gotten repeatedly linked by fan sites for both teams. Oh, and if you want non-blogospheric sources of "attention" ... I was on the <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008818.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008818.html" rel="nofollow">front page of the <i>Albuquerque Journal</i></a> and <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008821.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008821.html" rel="nofollow">mentioned on Fox News</a> nearly two years before Katrina because of a <i>Lord of the Rings</i>-related story. And, two months before Katrina, I was in the <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2005/07/018363.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2005/07/018363.html" rel="nofollow"><i>South Bend Tribune</i></a> just for my blog generally, not for any specific topic. Now, AGAIN: I am <b>not</b> asserting that this level of "attention" makes me "notable" -- that's for you all to decide, not me. I'm simply refuting the false statement that "the only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage." My intention here is to correct the factual record, and nothing more. Whatever you decide, I simply hope you'll base your decision on verifiable facts, not unverified and untrue assertions. I also hope you'll assume good faith and not attack me for leaving this comment here. The mere fact that I don't appreciate being the subject of factual untruths and character assassination doesn't make the article a "vanity entry." (And, if I were into sockpuppetry, wouldn't I leave this comment under someone else's name?) -- Brendan Loy, Aug. 19, 2006, 3:48 PM EDT</small>

<li>Ok, wow. Please make sure you understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_assassination" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_assassination" rel="nofollow">the terms you are using</a> before reacting so vehemently to a discussion. I reiterate that I just don't think this person or blog meets any of the guidelines of notability, either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" rel="nofollow">people</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28web%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28web%29" rel="nofollow">websites</a>. Instapundit is a good comparison: that's a website that has attained enough of a readership and notoriety on its own to merit an entry. Having been linked from it does not make a blog of the same stature. Nautikale 20:52, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My "character assassination" reference was to your unsupported, false, assuming-bad-faith allegation (at 05:17 today) that I was engaging in meatpuppetry. If you'll withdraw the allegation, I'll withdraw my use of the term "character assassination." As for your reiterating that you "just don't think" the subject of the article is notable, that's fine, and for the umpteenth time I am <i>not expressing an opinion</i> about that conclusion -- I'm just saying that you need to stick to <b>facts</b> and not state things which are <b>blatantly and demonstrably false</b>, like that my blog's readership is limited to friends and family, or that "the only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage." Those are both <b>factually incorrect assertions</b>, as I've demonstrated above, and if you're not going to either acknowledge their falsity and retract them, or else attempt to refute or somehow explain away the factual citations above which discredit your unsupported statements to the contrary, I don't see why anyone should take your contribution to this discussion seriously. My response is "vehement" only because you are assuming bad faith and making false assertions of fact about me, neither of which have any place in Wikipedia. --Brendan Loy, Aug. 19, 2006, 6:00 PM EDT</li>

<li>This is a pure vanity page as evidenced by the fact that the subject has updated it himself and constantly posts here vigorously defending his honor against 'character assassination'.

<li>Delete--Loy's constant presence in this discussion is rather indicative of his personal investment in this vanity page staying up.

<li>My presence in this discussion is indicative of no such thing, as I've repeatedly made explicitly clear. My only "investment" is in correcting the factual record and preventing untruths from being passed off as truths. Do what you want with the damn article, but if you say things that are demonstrably false, I am going to correct them. If that's wrong, then I don't want to be right. Your assumption of bad faith on my part is indicative that you don't seem to have any respect for Wikipedia's most basic principles. The same goes for everyone who insists on ignoring the verifiable facts I've presented and focusing only on the ulterior motives that you ascribe to me, notwithstanding that my actions are perfectly reasonable and justifiable without any ulterior motive (and thus assuming good faith is dictated).

<li><b>Merge</b> While Loy may deny his personal investment in keeping this page up through words, his incessant replies to almost every entry seem to indicate otherwise. His rebuttal to "blatant untruths and character assassination" reads as a veiled attempt at advertising and making the case to keep. This page has been nothing but a pissing match between Loy's supporters and his detractors. To merge as part of a wider look at blogs or Hurricane Katrina would be acceptable.

<li><b>Delete:</b> A review of the subject page, coupled with comments by both Loy and his college friends ( I believe user Scientizzle is a close personal friend) reveals that the blog is, in fact not designed to inform per Wikipedia's standards, and, in fact, is being used by Loy and his friends to publicize his blog. In addition, it is worth noting that the entry has been subject to frequent edit wars, which indicate that it is being used as a forum for his friends and detractors to air personal grievances.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am friends with Brendan. That does not change the fact that almost none of the anonymous IPs (and new accounts) that have commented here have presented a valid, detailed argument against keeping (by addressing the relevant policies and guidelines). <i>You</i> may not think the subject is notable, but Wikipedia has two established notability guidelines (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> &amp; <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>); I have detailed above 4 criteria from these two guidelines that the article appears to meet. I believe I've objectively come to my "keep" vote and properly supported my conclusion. Additionally, while Brendan Loy has been (in my opinion) overly zealous in defending his honor here, there have been several specious and demonstrably false claims made in support of deletion. I honestly wonder where all these anon IPs and new accounts with no Wikipedia edit history are coming from. Please stick to the facts, make sounds arguments, and avoid <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 18:56, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate your contributions to the discussion and your evident hard work on the entry, although I still disagree with your conclusions. But I disagree with any characterization of the previous discussions, including my own, as "demonstrably false claims" or personal attacks. You will notice that I qualified the statements I made with things like "as far as I can tell" and "seems like." This is because I am not friends with Brendan Loy and know only what I read online. For example, I said it seems like the only attention his blog got from outside sources was connected to Katrina--and I stand by that, qualified by the "seems." It's great that Mr. Loy can give an exhaustive account of every time his blog has been linked by another blog, and I wish him the best in expanding his readership, but the average user on Wikipedia who does not read his blog regularly would not know or care about a two-day spike in traffic to his website last month. Nor would they particularly care that a fake South Park video clip linked to by another Wikipedia entry happens to be hosted on his blog in one of the two places it is linked to on the page. The only larger significance that the blog seems to have achieved was in relation to Katrina. This is not a claim that nobody has ever linked to the blog in relation to another topic, or that I'm committing character assassination on Mr. Loy by failing to recognize his achievements in other areas. I just don't think, as a casual reader and relatively new acquaintance of the blog, that it has significance of the type generally required by Wikipedia. I have referred to Wikipedia's guidelines previously, but to repeat: Brendan Loy does not meet the guidelines of Notability (people)(<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). He has not made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his field. He is not a published author with multiple independent reviews of or awards for his work. He has not achieved renown or notoriety for his involvement in in newsworthy events. At best, he has achieved minor note for assembling information on Hurricane Katrina, so at most I think it it would be accurate, if generous, to mention his blog as related to media coverage of the hurricane. He has not been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. Brendan Loy does not meet the guidelines of Notability (web)(<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). I do not consider the handful of what I would call puff pieces on Brendan Loy multiple non-trivial published works. No disrespect meant, but I do not believe articles headlined "Weather nerd" are non-trivial pieces. His website has not won a well-known and independent award, nor is it published by any site independent of Mr. Loy himself. Nautikale 20:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Was prodded as crystal balling (since nothing has been officially announced, and even <a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekken_6.html" title="Tekken 6">Tekken 6</a> isn't completed yet), was deprodded without addressing the issues raised in the prod, and has since only had the assertion that "a friend of a friend of a friend knows this is going to be made" added since. While I'm sure there will eventually be a Tekken 7, this article does not belong on Wikipedia just yet, especially in its current form which reads entirely as a hoax (claiming it to be a dancing game in development by Nintendo for the Atari 2900, due out "tomorrow").

<li>Jones is already mentioned on at least one other Wikipedia page, and the fact that he has testified before Congress on several occasions makes him a notable public figure.

(ObDisclosure: I work with Jones. However, you can certainly verify what I'm saying just by Googling for "Doug Jones" and "electronic voting". Please note that one of the hits comes from Professor Ron Rivest's homepage, which links to Jones and describes him as an expert on electronic voting.) Rob 19:49, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only test he gets close to in the guideline is: <i>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field</i>, but I doubt the article qualifies under that as it stands.

<li><b>Comment</b> You refer to the "guideline" like it is a prescriptive policy. If something doesn't fit under it then you should not even refer to it. Make your own judgement based on the actual 5-6 real Wikipedia policies, like verifiability and neutrality. You did not refer to them at all, as if this is just a notability exercise. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - since non-notability was the reason for the nomination, I think it is reasonable to refer to the guidelines when suggesting improvements to get the article to a 'Keep' status. If you notice, I added 3 references <i>before</i> giving my opinion but, since these were essentially sources from the subject's website, I suggested adding the other references. I could have just as well referred to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> but felt this was redundant. I'm perfectly willing to change my opinion to keep if the policies are met, but don't want to see this get another AFD in a couple of months for the same reason. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 11:21, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>But we can fairly ask who this deletion is requested by. It seems to be by a political opponent called Martin Tiedemann, a former Labour Party councillor from the London Borough of Croydon.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to keep the article but to delete the more barbed comments in it, which no doubt were entered by another political opponent. Bridget Fox is still a leading London Liberal Democrat. <small>—The preceding comment was added by <a href="../../../x/n/4/User%7EXn4_4de2.html" title="User:Xn4">Xn4</a> (<a href="../../../x/n/4/User_talk%7EXn4_24c0.html" title="User talk:Xn4">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xn4_19f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xn4">contribs</a>) 31 July 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Firstly, I did not propose this AfD - <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> did. I just support it.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, evidence of POV outside Wikipedia is not evidence of POV inside; you'll have noticed from my profile and contributions pages about my extensive work creating, improving and categorising politicians from all parties in three countries. And no, I don't think it is legitimate to 'fairly ask' or make a judgement based on <b>who</b> proposes AFD, unless there is a history of abuse of process, etc, <b>inside</b> WP.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, I have frequently proposed and supported deletion about Labour councillor articles too (e.g <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Melanie_Smallman_3b8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Melanie Smallman">Melanie Smallman</a>, because I believe that being a councillor alone is not grounds for notability, nor being a run of the mill losing parliamentary candidate. If she had been Leader of the Council, or ALG Lib Dem group leader, I may have supported her retention. Having been a councillor myself for eight years only confirms non-notability for me. <a href="../../../m/t/i/User%7EMtiedemann_f8b2.html" title="User:Mtiedemann">Martín</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/t/i/User_talk%7EMtiedemann_7f87.html" title="User talk:Mtiedemann">saying</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mtiedemann_58d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mtiedemann">doing</a>)</small> 00:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I proposed this deletion along with several others as part of a process of clearing up articles on candidates. Numerous articles on people who've been election candidates/local councillors from all parties have been nominated for deletion for insufficient notability - you'll note that on the same day I nominated this article I also nominated past candidates/councillors from the Conservatives, Labour and Alliance, and I've also nominated Greens for deletion in the past. Many others have also nominated AFDs on candidate articles - indeed <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a> emerged precisely because of the deluge of candidate articles. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 13:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>As a candidate for Mayor of London, Cleverly is in the public eye and as such, an article on him will be of interest to a relatively large number of people. If anything, we should be expanding this article, not deleting it.</li>
<li>Cleverly is one of the very few non-white Tory politicians, surely adding to his notability.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> — I'm a little ambivalent. This is a weird usage.

So on the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> test. It does not introduces a theory or method of solution; It does not introduce original ideas (they can be found elsewhere); It does not define new terms (although it does define one I'd never heard before); It is not a new definition of pre-existing terms; It does not introduce an argument that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; It does not introduce an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source; It attributes the neologism to a <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">"reputable" source</a>. Granted it is front end material; there is always danger that putting front end material into WIkipedia will give it momentum; but if we worry too much about that we'll put nothing in Wikipedia at all.

<li><b>Delete</b> or... <b>Merge</b>. There <i>are</i> other Google hits for "Father Physics", even once you eliminate "father's physics lab/class/student/text/book", etc. And certainly more hits than for "Father Science" (though there was a "Father Science and Mother Art"&#160;:). There's even a soliloquy addressing the figure of Father Physics. But ... I just don't think it has near enough currency to have its own article. Moreover, nearly all the usages I found explicitly or implicitly link "Father Physics" with its mirror, "Mother Nature". I have to think that until there are enough usage/example references, apart from mere dicdef's, that this can be nothing more than a footnote to the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Nature_e5df.html" title="Mother Nature">Mother Nature</a> article.

<li><b>Clean up and Keep</b> Neo tech is certainly acceptable as a notable internet meme, there are quite a few adherents, websites, etc etc, which mention Neo-tech. It is appropiate for this reason, however, to keep a third party point of view regarding Neo-Tech and I suggest a strong clean-up. I can't vouch for Neo Tech being a mail order scam or not, but it is a succesful mail order scam if so, and historically relevant in that case, i.e. one of the first 'internet' marketed ideologies. Sometimes I can't tell if it's tongue in cheek or not, as some of their arguments lead to the quite rational and reasonable to the quite bizarre, but this is a personal assesment and my vote is not dependent upon mine or any personal view of what Neo Tech is.<a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a></li>

<li><b>Zap if no one cleans up.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Neotech is notable. By the way, it's not a scam. It's a philosophy. Some of the stuff may sound far out and the marketing techniques from the publisher sound scamish but that's intentional. They try to make the philosophy sound magical and mystical in order to lure in mystics looking for an authority to tell them how to have easy wealth and happiness. But what they are actually trying to do is transform them into non-mystics. They teach that the individual has to be his own authority and there is nothing that can get them wealth and happiness but hard work and making your own decisions instead of waiting for someone to show you the way. Or worse yet, waiting for death in order to have immortal life and bliss. That is the whole point of the philosophy, to eliminate mystics. From reading around on the net it looks like the publisher even buys mailing lists for subscribers to Christian magazines in order to turn them off to mysticism because they know they are an easy target as people looking for external guidance over their lives. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 20:25, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry... I must nominate this article, even though I love Eurovision to bits. This is non-notable, and not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopædia - at least, not as its own separate article.

<p>Utter lack of citations, no evidence for existence of creature given. The drawing is from 'a friend', and the statement that it is thought to survive on "axe handles that had been left unattended" is biologically infeasible.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, (formerly <s><b>Neutral</b></s>, see research below). I believe this to be a creature from american folklore, probably lumberjack folklore.

<li>Hmm. Very little luck. It's not in <i>Fearsome Creatures of the Lumberwoods</i>, it's not in <i>Mysterious Creatures</i>, and it's not in the index (volume 24) of <i>Man, Myth, and Magic</i> either. The only thing on Google is <a href="http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/canoe_routes/little_fork_ne.pdf" class="external text" title="http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/canoe_routes/little_fork_ne.pdf" rel="nofollow">a government site</a> stating that there's a place called Ax-Handle Hound campsite in Minnesota. That's all the research I can do without a trip to the library. I still think this is lumberjack folklore, although apparently fairly obscure.

<dd>mm Let's try again to edit this page and add my comment.</dd>
<dd>I wonder why the AmberNet page should be deleted if an EFnet, an undernet or an Afternet do can have there page on Wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>Is this because AmberNet is just a small network? And if so .. wow .. speak about discrimination.</dd>
<dd>Isn't wikipedia all about getting as much information to visitors? And why I removed the Prod tag? The second after I submitted the basic page you put that comment up. I was still working on the page!! --Alcately 18:38, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Look, it's nothing personnal and you should not feel attacked by this proposed deletion. Yes Wikipedia is open to a lot of content but it is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an Internet guide</a>.

<p>The only reference is to the Chapelle show and it's wrong, in that show the family's last name was "niggar" and they were white so it was "niggar rich" and not "nigger rich," which the article's title is so the Chapelle reference doesn't count.

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wiktionary. It certainly isn't a neologism. If it's anything, it's a paleologism. It's an obsolete, obviously racist epithet for someone who squanders money on flashy status symbols while remaining poor. I've heard that it dates to the Harlem Renaissance, not the Civil War, and was one of many <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>-X</i> compounds to come about during the early 20th century; to name a few, "nigger-flicker" (a bare blade wrapped with tape in lieu of a handle), "nigger-luck" (undeserved success), "nigger-steak" (offal), etc. As a piece of historical slang likely to be encountered in the literature of the period, it deserves to be listed on Wiktionary, but it certainly doesn't merit its own encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhumiya_8fee.html" title="User:Bhumiya">Bhumiya</a> (<a href="../../../b/h/u/User_talk%7EBhumiya_1af5.html" title="User talk:Bhumiya">said</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bhumiya_e6d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bhumiya">done</a>) 01:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> - it belongs in Wiktionary. Yes, this is a horrible term - but it's definitely real and therefore needs to be defined. I know it's neither pleasant nor informative to read or discuss this term - but if someone needs to know what it means, they ought to be able to find it - understand it's meaning - and find the history of the term. But I don't think it's an encyclopedia entry - Wiktionary would be a better place. I would prefer that people get a fair and unbiassed definition of the term and it's roots and typical usage than to come away with the idea that it's a neologism. The Chapelle show were using a pun on the term to describe a parody of a family - that's actually confirmation that the term is real - you can't make a pun on something that's not an actual term. It passes the 'Google-test' too. It's not a neologism because we know it dates back 100 or 150 years. And it has been used in print (not least in the novel "Growing Up Nigger Rich" by Gwendoline Y.

<dd><b>Strong Oppose</b>&#160;: (I have nothing to do with the ODE team - and my only contribution to the article was a bit of trivial Wikilinking about a month ago). Open Dynamics Engine is a well respected and widely used software library. It is at least as worthy of a Wikipedia entry as (for example) <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenGL_7607.html" title="OpenGL">OpenGL</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenAL_6eb4.html" title="OpenAL">OpenAL</a> - which are comparable libraries in related fields. OpenAL in particular is at a comparable level of development to ODE and is used about as widely - it's article is vigerous and useful - there is no reason to presume that <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Dynamics_Engine_413e.html" title="Open Dynamics Engine">Open Dynamics Engine</a> will not also become so once someone with the right knowledge takes an interest in developing it. It certainly isn't a 'company page' - ODE is an OpenSourced effort with no significant commercial ties. If everything in Wikipedia needed a newspaper article - we'd be down to a few thousand articles and this would be a much less useful service. The worst this article is guilty of is being a stub - but we don't go around deleting articles just because they are stubs. In fact there is actually some useful content here. This AdD needs to 'go away' - I move for a speedy dismissal. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 22:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument is well intended, but wrong. If an article is not properly sourced, then we should delete it. I see no reason to delete <i>this</i> public access show simply because you have issues imagining how we would deal with articles about <i>other</i> shows. Can we afford to list them? The simple answer is yes, if they are well sourced, verfied, and neutral.

In my eyes, this <i>is</i> one of the "other" shows. Well-sourced? The only source I see used is the group's own website -- the only claim to notability I can find in the article is itself an apparently unsourced statement. There's almost no content in this article, "this is a show, these are the five cast members' names. Trust me, it's notable. Here's some links!" Three sentences and a five-bullet list.

<dd>Speedy is part of the <i>speedy</i> deletion process, but not, actually, AFD. That's quite clear. There are many things that apply in Speedy but not AFD. That's why there are separate policies.

Almost anything can be neutral and verifiable (and no it wasn't neutral with statements like ...and Riley Swift - the dungeon master! it read exactly like a vanity page or ad. Which is what it is.). Neutral and verifiable are not the only criteria for inclusion. Some people feel that way, some people feel the other way and that is why were here. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure why "...and" is not neutral, but hey. It's odd that some people don't think that policy is important, but you're right, that's why we're here. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 06:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because its not the proper tone for an encyclopedia. It reads like an ad or sounds like someone announcing something flashy. And yes policy IS important. There are more policies than WP:V and WP:NPOV. You just took the time to quote WP:NOT by saying its not paper, read the whole policy. You can't use part of it to justify the existence of the article then turn around and ignore 2 other parts of the same policy that would say it doesn't belong here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vanity: the page author seems to be involved in the comic book, and it doesn't meet notability reqs. The movies aren't Buffy parodies (and the article even says that about one of them). Most of the text about the movies is cut&amp;pasted from the sources listed, so the article is mostly a copyvio. Pornspam, too, do we really care about the umpteen other "Buffy" movies that have nothing to do with the TV show? "Parody" means more than alluding to something in the title, and these movies aren't parodies. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 20:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Re:Vanity</b>: Please do not mislead voters Vivian:
<dl>
<dd>(<b>1</b>) I am the author of the article, and am not involved in the comic book, I simply named my login name after the comic.</dd>
<dd>(<b>2</b>) The comic, <i>Boffy the Vampire Layer</i> is an adult parody of <i>Buffy (TV series)</i>, and the movies <i>Buffy the Vampire Layer</i>, and <i>Muffy the Vampire Layer</i> are both parodies of <i>Buffy (TV series/movie)</i>. All of these three parodies contain young teenage slayers obviously parodying the character Buffy Summers. <i>Muffy the Vampire Slayer</i> is the only movie which in its content does not parody <i>Buffy</i> (TV/movie), simply it's title does.</dd>
<dd>(<b>3</b>) The text is not cut and pasted.. The sources listed were used for the story descriptions, but there was no copy &amp; paste involved and comparisons between the wiki-article and the sources will result in noticing there is complete rewording.</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is not exactly a re-nomination; in the previous case, people were expressing a desire that the individual film not have an article, but this was not created as a result of the debate, just during it. However, (1) I found very limited copyright problems, and fixed them, so that should no longer be an issue, but (2) this article is actually pretty <i>good,</i> and it's not cruft at all, but rather a fleshed-out list of examples of adult parodies of Buffy.

<dd>I'm not that interested in many of the science articles on Wikipedia, but I'm not gonna suggest the Science editors get their own Wiki instead. In its ambitious mission of documenting the sum of all human knowledge, what is 'not encyclopedic'? My understanding of Wiki is that non-encyclopdic articles are the ones that do not follow the 3 core policies (verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view), or articles that are listed on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">WP:Not</a>; the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> says as much: "<i>All text created in the Wikipedia main namespace is subject to several important rules covering criteria for articles (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>), encyclopedic quality (verifiability and original research), editorial approach (neutral point of view), as well as the Wikipedia copyright policy. Articles and text which are capable of meeting these should usually be remedied by editing</i>" and advises that articles that are not fulfilling these official policies are instead deleted. Also the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">deletion guidelines for admins</a> advises that "<i>the three key policies, which warrant that articles and information be verifiable, avoid being original research, and be written from a neutral point of view are held to be non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines</i>".</dd>

Wikipedia does not rely on peer-reviewing, and it is not made just for academics, that's why it can cover almost anything including popular culture and even pornography (in this case the article draws from both). That's why the front page can even feature an article about <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">a fictional food product made from alien worm-like creatures</a>. Yet so many continue to look down upon popular culture here trying to believe that Wikipedia is a professional encyclopedia that shouldn't be dealing with such matters of 'cruft'. However IMO part of the appeal of this encyclopedia is that it has the ability to overcome the idea that knowledge can be monopolised (by religious orders, governments, academia..). Having read the article and through the comments on this page, I see only 3 reasons people have voted 'delete': First, because they were influenced by the nominator's accusations before I responded to such accusations. Second, because the article references pornography. Third, because the article is not of interest to them because they are uninterested in <i>Buffy</i>. In conclusion, there is no real basis for the deletion. And IMHO it's actually better-cited and better-written than most articles here. -- <a href="../../../b/o/f/User%7EBoffy_Layer_70e8.html" title="User:Boffy Layer">Boffy Layer</a> 19:15, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. I read the Romanian article, and apparently the man is only "notable" for having *probably* been threatened with physical harm by the Romanian ambassador in Australia. The links for his novels don't appear to be functional anymore, the book relies on obscure references to "acclaim", and the man is likely to be ignored by all but five Romanians (as I am sure he is completely ignored by Americans, Chinese, etc.). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:59, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I have no way from reading this entry to see whether Cerin is notable. I would agree with one remark made above: Amazon rankings are a useless measure of whether a contemporary philosopher is significant. Virtually no contemporary philosopher has significant book sales.</dd>
<dd>The question is: what is the <i>positive</i> evidence of notability? Is he being taught in the curriculum of at least one major university? Is there a review of one of his books in some reputable publication, either a significant specialist publication (for example, one of the many listed at <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~worc0337/phil_journals_paper.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~worc0337/phil_journals_paper.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>) or a generalist publication (<i>New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, etc.) or even a review in a significant newspaper in almost any language? If not, can the person who suggests keeping this give some other evidence of notability beyond her personal opinion? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:13, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with that point. I did look at google first and while I didn't mention it in the prod summary, given a very small online footpoint (I can't even find a biography of the man anywhere, even from a website of his own), I doubtful of any material that would be useful for verfiability, not alone to argue notability. I think the fact that the website that was listed for him in this article consists of free webhosting service which has now cancelled the account speaks for itself. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 23:32, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>In fairness, I am adding the following, which was posted to my user talk page; I think, however, that the <i>Clujeanul</i> article cited above casts enormous doubt on this. Also, the idiosyncratic punctuation somewhat resembles that shared by "Alicia ,Yale University", so sockpuppetry is a possibility, though by no means a certainty.</p>
<p>Again, despite the <i>Clujeanul</i> article, if he is being taught in the curriculum of at least one major university, if there is a review of one of his books in some reputable publication, or even a review in a significant newspaper, I would consider.

<dd>Va scriem din partea unui grup de intelectuali romani din America de Nord si Europa care va multumesc.Am urmarit cu frenezie fenomenul Cerin .Era cat pe ce sa-i fie stearsa pagina din enciclopedia engleza daca nu a-ti fi intervenit dumneavoastra.Motivele invocate erau pe cat de puerile pe atat de banale.Numar de carti vandute ,etc.Mai trist este ca tocmai un roman a sarit sa afirme ca despre Cerin nu se afla in enciclopedia romaneasca decat episodul Australia.Daca noi ne batem joc in fata strainilor mintind numai de rau despre valorile noastre cine sa le apere,tot strainii?Mai ales ca un filozof nu este mare prin numarul de carti vandute cu toate ca Cerin a vandut destule in anii trecuti avand alte sales rankuri pe Amazon,[www.sorincerindestiny.go.ro]ci prin propria sa teorie unde introduce termenul de neo-ontologie.Putem fi contactati prin comunitatea romana din Sacramento California.R.Vidu <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.104.189.107 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.104.189.107.html" title="User talk:86.104.189.107">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.104.189.107_debc.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.104.189.107">contribs</a>) 30 July 2006.</small></dd>

<p>I'll do my best to translate the above. If I get anything wrong, someone can feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>Attempted translation:</p>
<p>Mr. or Madame Jmabel<br />
We write you on the part of a group of Romanian intelectuals in North America who thank you. We have finished with the wild phenomenon Cerin. The page in the English encyclopedia would have been <i>stearsa</i> [sorry, don't know this word &amp; cannot find it in the dictionary, I presume "erased"] if you had not intervened. The motives invoked were the most puerile and banal as well. The number of books sold , etc. The saddest is that a Romanian in particular has leapt to affirm that there is nothing about Cerin in the Romanian Encyclopedia other that the Australian episode. If we mock ourselves in fron to foreigners meaning only bad about our values, who <i>sa le apere</i> [again not sure of this "will appear" or some such?], all foreigners? [I may have misunderstood that; correction welcomed.] Besides that a philosopher is not big through the number of books he has sold, with all that Cerin has sold just in the last year having a high sales rank on Amazon, [www.sorincerindestiny.go.ro] but through his own his own theory where he introduces the term <i>neo-ontology</i>. We can be contacted through the Romanian community in Sacramento, California. R.Vidu</p>

<li><b>Delete/Stubify/Rebuild</b> As it stands, this is an outrageously bad article, with little concern for verification beyond the few fig-leaf book references and obscure web links (only related to a few items on the list) at the bottom. There is even less concern for context or sensitive treatment of a controversial subject.There are some descriptions which are just outright offensive and idiotic - the idea that "Most Africans have AIDS and will kill anyone for food" is not a stereotype in general circulation, but it seems, a vile expression of some random editor's own twistedness. It appears that the article creators/editors just find it amusing to list as many stereotypes as possible. This article as it stands is a threat to Wikipedia's reputation. The article could be rewritten encyclopedically, but more than a cleanup is required.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Pages like this, which presume to catalogue opinions and subjective impressions, are impossible not only in practice but in principle. Unlike facts, stereotypes are completely unverifiable, inherently subjective, and may differ dramatically from one person and one locality to another. Who is to decide whether a given stereotype is common, or merely a peculiarity of an individual? Certainly not the person presenting the opinion. We lack the ability to conduct scientific surveys and interviews, which would be original research anyway. Since we admit that most of the opinions currently listed on the page are unfalsifiable and unverifiable, we would be forced to accept any offered opinion, however factually groundless or bizarre. "Jews are made of chocolate? Hey, it may not be true, but if someone believes it..." Vandalism would be indistinguishable from earnest contribution. Bigotry is boundless: can you imagine how large this page would become? Moreover, even if it can somehow be reliably determined that a particular group of people has an established stereotype of another group of people, our policy of countering systemic bias will require that we also mention how <i>other</i> groups of people view the latter group, how the latter group views the former, etc. Accordingly, articles like this will never be anything more than a storehouse of often conflicting personal biases. This is true whether they reflect the view of <i>one</i> person or a thousand persons from all over the world. Because personal impressions don't reflect facts, they can never be formed into any kind of coherent article, especially if they are presented anonymously and out of the context in which they were acquired. A fact may be objectively reported, but an opinion cannot be regarded without a full knowledge of who holds it. Obviously, this is not the purpose of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhumiya_8fee.html" title="User:Bhumiya">Bhumiya</a> (<a href="../../../b/h/u/User_talk%7EBhumiya_1af5.html" title="User talk:Bhumiya">said</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bhumiya_e6d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bhumiya">done</a>) 15:57, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep-heavy editing</b> Tawker's orginal complaint that this article is <i>biased, ... and rather offensive</i> smacks heavily of censorship and conflicting bias. However this article does need some heavy editing, specifically regarding the previous comments that stereotypes are normally held by one group of people about another group of people. Therefore it must be stated, and cited, which people hold these opinions. In my not so humble opinion the content of this article has a much bigger impact on humanity that the vast majority of other wikipedia articles.--Ben 14:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see what the fuss is about. It's an intresting secret, and I think many sonic fans would be intrested. Who really cares if it's unverifiable It's just for reading and it's fairly unlikely anyone can or will attempt this. Except maybe people in the field of hacking. I didn't know this existed untill reading this article, that is why I love Wikipedia, it has the stuff few others have other than a few scatterd web-pages. People get to learn more cool secrets about their favorite mascot, just leave it, it's not like we are publishing Wiki Books for the mass patron to buy and put on their shelves. No one is going to flip out over a article about a ROM HACK Game. --ShortShadow 01:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, it's one of the more notable hacks/pirates, has had mentions on bigger sites, such as Sonic Cult, and anybody who says "It's just Sonic with Mario" doesn't know what they're talking about, seeing as it's also running on NES hardware. <b><a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadic_eb54.html" title="User:Shadic">Shadic</a></b> 14:58, 1 August 2006.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per consensus in 2004 deletion nomination, for same reasons- it's notable now, through emulation, it doesn't promote, describe, encourage, etc. illegal activities, it's an impressive programming feat, etc. And 225,000 hits on Google seems like it should be notable enough to warrant some mention on an infinitely large encyclopedia. Notability is carried way too far sometimes. But I digress. CrossEyed7 03:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Probably one of the most notable pirate games. Also, it was sold commercially (even if illegally,) and has recieved some media attention (as evidenced by the 225,000 google hits.) Were it one of those hack pirate games like the ones where only a character were replaced (I remember one pirate was a hack of some action game and they just changed the character graphic to Mario and called it "Super Mario Bros. 9" or something like that,) I would vote delete. <a href="../../../y/0/u/User%7EY0u_cdd9.html" title="User:Y0u">Y0u</a> | <a href="../../../y/0/u/User_talk%7EY0u_b9f5.html" title="User talk:Y0u">Y0ur talk page</a> 04:57, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of the most well known pirate cartridges, and isn't a simple sprite hack, as they ported Sonic onto the NES, with some pretty impressive results. I simply don't believe a 5 year old could reverse-engineer Sonic the Hedgehog and port it to a piece of hardware with worse system specifications.

<li>I am sorry if you take it that way, but I actually thought of the Jordanhill railway station (as another UK structure, and since I happened to look at it again the other day when reading <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060731fa_fact" class="external text" title="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060731fa_fact" rel="nofollow">this article</a>) as a useful comparison, without having looked at your userpage. If a railway station is inherently notable just for being a railway station, even one (as far as I understand) without any actual building, I don't see why a 300-year old manor couldn't be notable just for being an old manor.

<li>I've already warned one contributor about a personal attack and I don't want to warn a second. I don't know the first thing about architecture, but I saw an article, it looked in a delapidated state and didn't assert any notability. Now that the article has been improved, fair enough, turns out it is notable. And we now have a better article for all the debate. Tell me, whose time was I wasting? <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErath_3567.html" title="User:Erath">Erath</a> 21:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is not entirely necessary to accuse everyone of personal attacks, you know. Notwithstanding that there over 6,000 Grade I listed buildings (according to our article on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_buildings.html" title="Listed buildings">listed buildings</a>), this one <i>is</i> more notable than a minor railway station, irrespective of who wrote what, and it <i>would</i> have taken less time to wikify it than list it here.</li>
<li>I am rather surprised that you think an article on a substiantial country house could be a candidate for speedy deletion, as a vanity article.</li>
<li>Most articles have a habit of improving over time without being listed at AfD. In my experience, most manage to improve <i>without</i> being listed at AfD. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 22:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did not suggest it was a vanity article. I was suggesting that the article didn't assert its importance. Since it's not a band, group of people, or such, I didn't think the criteria applied - and I was right.

<dd>I am not having a go at you personally - I am commenting more generally. A7 refers to "Unremarkable people or groups/vanity pages" - I suppose an article describing the limited merits of my modest home would be vanity, but this is clearly nowhere near that.

<p><b>*Keep.</b> The article now clearly asserts the importance of the building by stating that it's a Grade 1 listed structure. This is the top listing classification used in England, and all Grade 1 buildings are notable for that reason alone.

<dd><b>Deletion would be inappropriate</b>. I'd invite the community to reconsider. Rev. Freeman is a notable minister and community activist responsible for work that has influenced thousands of lives. He is also a notable motivational speaker to include work with the South Carolina Black Family Caucus, the NFL Players Association, Keynote Speaker for Super Bowl XXXVIII pre-game worship service, etc. Perhaps his notablility needs to be more clearly stated for those who are not aware of his significant contributions to the community. I'd also suggest that we consider the guidelines for speedy deletion: "Only those articles where there is no remotely plausible assertion of notability should be considered for Wikipedia:Speedy deletion." In conclusion, I would suggest, if necessary, that the article be rewritten to avoid any "vain" intimations. --MINEJF1906 19:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In rebuttal: M Sarki's book ZIMBLE ZAMBLE ZUMBLE (ISBN: 0595250920) was published in a limited-edition-handmade edition by elimae books of Dallas, TX. A paperback trade edition was published by Author's Choice Press. Authors Choice Press offers an important service to writers whose books have gone out-of-print. They are a subsidy of I-Universe.</p>
<p>M Sarki's book LITTLE WAR MACHINE (ISBN: 0972332979) was published in a paperback trade edition by Ravenna Press out of Edmonds, Washington.</p>
<p>M Sarki's MEWL HOUSE (ISBN# 0-9770377-1-1) was published in a limited-handmade edition by Rogue Literary Society.</p>
<p>A poet cannot be listed in Poets and Writers if the journals and book publishers do not check out. M Sarki is listed in Poets and Writers. Perhaps this person accusing M Sarki of being a vanity writer has some bone to pick with the poet.</p>
<p>To say that M Sarki is not a notable poet would tell me that this person does not know poetry, nor the movers in it.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> we appreciate the referencing done in the article. Nobody is attacking the article, we're trying to come to an impartial conclusion on whether it is notable enough to be a Wikipedia entry. The books clearly exist but they all are with small publishers with limited distibution (out-of-print, paperback trade edition, limited-handmade edition). Nomination for a prize is some claim to notability - how prestigious is the prize and what's the status of the nominator? Nobody has bone to pick with Mr Sarki. I do have some reservations about this being a promotional campaign by Roguebooks. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></li>

<li>How can the M Sarki main page be misconstrued as "promotional" when all it states are the facts? If you research and read what many others have said about Sarki you could come to the conclusion that there is some merit here to the claims on the "articles for deletion" page that Sarki is in fact "notable". The mere fact that Lish is involved with the poet ought to tell you something, unless you are not familiar with <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Lish_6da6.html" title="Gordon Lish">Gordon Lish</a>, and then there is absolutely no reason for your remarks to be merited. There are many writers out there who wish not to be involved with big publishers. There are some writers who do not care about money, nor do they care about rubbing elbows with their ilk. This page on M Sarki is only offered as a link to persons interested in finding out more about the poet. It certainly is not about prestige. It is certainly not about self-promotion. For what? It is becoming all too clear that this Wikipedia is a community of something other than what it claims to be. Roguebooks 21:42, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thanks for that link. As I read it, any small press can make up to 6 nominations annually. For some small presses that'd be pretty much their annual output. Thousands of writers have received an award so I'm not sure that even receiving an award (let alone merely being nominated for one) would represent widespread notability. But it's certainly a step in that direction! Note that, as far as I can see, Sarki is an interesting poet and one who probably deserves wider recognition but the nature of Wikipedia is to record the already famous rather than the deserving. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></dd>

<li><b>More notes:</b> The critic B. Renner wrote this piece for <i>elimae</i> about M Sarki. On that page there is also a piece by <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Lish_6da6.html" title="Gordon Lish">Gordon Lish</a> about Sarki and how he compares him to the great American poet <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_Stevens_4848.html" title="Wallace Stevens">Wallace Stevens</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://elimae.com/books/sarki/praise.html" class="external text" title="http://elimae.com/books/sarki/praise.html" rel="nofollow">"If the poems in Zimble Zamble Zumble [elimae books, 2000</a> had been previously published in The Paris Review or The New Yorker, M Sarki would by now have been hailed as a marvelous home-grown successor to Charles Simic and the book itself offered by Knopf or Farrar Straus. But the poems have instead appeared mostly in online magazines, such as elimae and 5_Trope, and Sarki is virtually unknown. Which may be just as well, for the time being, because the comparison to Simic would be misleading and maybe even harmful. For one thing Sarki's poems owe more to the not quite Dadaist tendencies of Wallace Stevens than to European surrealism; for another, Simic would give his third eye to write poems as wonderful and delicious as the best of these. I frequently have no idea what Sarki is talking "about," but his language both astonishes and amuses me. Zimble Zamble Zumble gives more pleasure than the last dozen Pulitzer Prize winners all together."</p>

<p><b>One other thing:</b> The <b>Pushcart Prize</b> allows six nominees from each approved publication (journal), of which there can be as many as twelve issues or one per quarter. That means there can be as many as hundreds of pieces to choose from in each journal to literally thousands. (There was one poem nominated of Sarki's out of <i>who-knows-how-many</i> others.) Obviously this person discounting the Pushcart Prize nomination does not know what he/she is talking about. It is a fine, and very prestigious academy. It is a disservice to all writers to discount it. Roguebooks 18:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sarki once emailed me a quote that shifted something inside me, almost violently. I liked the feeling. I'd felt it before, and I hope I'll feel it again. I emailed back to him and said, “That's beautiful, Sark, but what the hell does it mean?” He emailed back and admitted he had no good idea what it meant, but he said he thought it had something to do with getting the words wrong. Which didn't actually clarify much for me, but made me love Sarki even more.&gt;&gt;&gt;The Danforth Review</li>
