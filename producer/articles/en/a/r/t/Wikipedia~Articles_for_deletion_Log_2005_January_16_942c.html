<li><b>KEEP</b> All of you should be ashamed of yourselves. This has nothing to do with vanity!!!!! NOTHING!!!! I worked on this article from scratch as the boy's leader. <b>He is a very notable</b> young man. Just because you have not heard of him <i>does not</i> mean he is not noteworthy. Who are you to decide? If this article is deleted, I will replace it. I do not appreciate these negative comments on this accomplished young man. His story is an encouragement to young people everywhere. I don't understand this site at all. You allow criminals like serial killers and rapists to be listed, disgracing the honor of the Eagle badge; but you want to take issue with the addition of articles about accomplished youths who are making a difference in this world and living up to the Eagle Scout honor! <b>HE IS NOTABLE!!!!!</b></li>

<dd>Notability is not an endorsement. It's recognition of the fact that someone has done something significant. Becoming an Eagle Scout is not, in itself, significant. If this article is deleted, it will stay deleted unless and until the individual concerned becomes notable. I had thought that being in the Scouts was about growing up. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 15:02, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree with you. This young man has done more than something significant, in addition to making Eagle. <b>And making Eagle alone is significant</b> You would know that if you have ever been in the scouts. As a veteran leader, I know what I am taking about. I have been involved in scout leading for over a decade! I support this article and will continue to support and edit it. And, for the record, these boys are more grown up than most youths will ever be! --Sistertina 15:10, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If he's done something significant, then what is it, and why isn't it on the page? As a matter of fact I was in the scouts in Britain for a time. According to <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Scout_489c.html" title="Eagle Scout">Eagle Scout</a>, 4% of Scouts become Eagle Scouts, and given that there are millions who join, that must still be a large number of people.

<li>Like many pages, one sentence is often hijacked between two people for a laugh. Have you not heard of the time the host on screensavers defaced wikipedia to show how easy it is to spread false content? Defacement is nothing new, and the wiki crowd has taken it upon themselves to correct that defaced sentence. The proof of Shaun Goldstein is located at www.sodomy.org, as noted in Shaun's wikipage. Our savior <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> would have us forgive such people who deface pages, as he said to "forgive your enemy."

<p>Not notable or encyclopedic. Apparently autobiographical article (the IP seems to give it away) by a 20-year old <a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EAron_Bostr%C3%B6m_46f7.html" title="User:Aron Bostr√∂m">Wikipedia user</a> and engineering student at <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lund_University_2678.html" title="Lund University">Lund University</a> who is also the leader of a very minor regional political party, <i>Sk√•nefederalisterna</i>. The goals of the 2-year old party, which claims to have 50 members, is to give <a href="../../../s/k/%C3%A5/Sk%C3%A5ne.html" title="Sk√•ne">Scania</a> more independence within a federation with the rest of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and to change the official spelling of the name of the city of <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristianstad.html" title="Kristianstad">Kristianstad</a> to <i><b>Ch</b>ristianstad</i>.

<li>Indeed. I get the feeling that the article was created by someone other than the subject - possibly a close friend or family member.

<li>Does one TV news broadcast and a few press clippings make you notable? No. <b>Delete</b>.

<p>With humble apology to the many excellent contributors to this article, I would like to strongly suggest that the content all be moved to the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Programming:C" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Programming:C" rel="nofollow">Wikibook on C</a>. This request may generate some controversy, and I can't seem to find a suitable clause in the deletion policy, but I think it's the only suitable solution for both projects.</p>
<p>What makes this article more appropriate for Wikibooks?</p>
<ol>
<li>It's extremely detailed ‚Äî well beyond the level someone interested in "general knowledge" might expect or desire.</li>
<li>It doesn't stand on its own. It has the feel of a section in a much larger work describing libraries, semantics, common practices, history, and other details. If we embedded all this into the encyclopedia, we would have a book.</li>
<li>The C Wikibook needs a good section on syntax like this one (compare the minimal <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:C_syntax" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:C_syntax" rel="nofollow">syntax chapter</a>), and forking is undesirable.</li>
</ol>
<p>One objection I expect is: why not copy the content, but leave this article in place, cutting it down to more of a summary? I think this is fine, but I think such a summary would become so short that it might as well be merged back into the section in <a href="../../../c/_/p/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C programming language</a> whence this article originally emerged. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 10:33, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Keep. A discussion about this was started on the article's <a href="../../../c/_/s/Talk%7EC_syntax_6cae.html" title="Talk:C syntax">talk page</a>, some time ago.

<li><b>KEEP</b> I remembered in one of his articles he stated that "two insane could establish a culture of their own."-- something like that.. it is about an insane mother who reared her child and until now they have their own set of "insane" cultures.

<li><b>KEEP</b> In addition, he stated the "impermanence of sexual phenotypes" because of the "environment". Environment is of two types there... In other words there is no such thing as a real "he" or "she". Environment oh environment. So to look at it closely, culture has a role, etc etc (whatever environments .. could be placental) in life to shoot to that type of sexual orientation. He also stated (in his web) about the compromising brain which could direct to the type of sexual orientation ( as an example--- it is my example) as what the case is. Compromising brain could have a therapeutic role then.

</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Yes, It was just one line(in his personal web) but it gives a lot of lessons... He meant, when he discussed it "Your Genes are Your genes and That is What you are Forever" Which means that changing a part of our bio system-- nose, eye lens, bust etc. means continous maintenance because it is not a part of our genetic system. Thats a problem with people from less developed countries who went to the usa to have a part of their bio-system changed ... they needed to go back to the usa for maintenance , check or change for new. Our own genes could not repair that new material added.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> By the way, I would suggest that individuals who would like to read his overpowering articles must have enormous background in molecular and cell biology for great understanding. Thumbs up for him and his articles!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Whatever material whether cheap or expensive as long as you know the "central dogma" , you will later realize the importance of this article. The above users who commented look only at the "COVER" of the "Books" not the content. And if they look at the content, they thought its a comic book because they can't integrate it molecularly and cellularly in their brains!! POOR GUYS! Better brush up. Enrol at Harvard!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> he has done something in the world in establishing a society. That's good work!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> It's the golden rule: Don't do it to others if you don't want others to do it unto you. I like his articles and his numerous scientific talents.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> I find him intellectually enchanting!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Great!!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Though the users (i see a lot of them) are anon deep in their hearts they really mean it. But I want to have a user numerics, pls Thryd give me one. I find something new in the understanding of my life by reading his articles. He also have some publications on lichens (Biologybrowser). He seems to have just so many. Thryd assign the above anon with user numbers, they must be treated as living individuals.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> If Some Science has to change completely or be modified, He is the FIRST to do it. Look for literatures if there are more basic ones than what he has written.</li>

<dd>I'm deleting all compressed revisions of this as a developer, assuming that there is actual harassment happening. The reason for inability to delete some articles is not buggy software: it's a mixture of two new features, selective undeletion and multiple revision compression for article history. The selective undeletion wasn't written to work with the new compression of article history, so to be safe deletion (and hence undeletion) was turned off until the necessary work to make it compatible had been done. We needed the compression without waiting for that work, as part of the continual race with growth. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 03:51, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not sure if I have enough contributions to vote but nonetheless I will add my opinion. ANUS has been around since 1987 and publishes all sorts of written literary and philosophical work. I don't think its fair that Gay Nigger Association of America gets put up for VfD 5 times and wins each time and then someone comes here and complains about something of a similar (but obviously different) vein. I think the attention that ANUS members have received on the Internet through its websites (more than one), contributions to Metal, and insights into the philosophy of nihilism make it noteworthy. Also, the article is hardly vanity any more than the entry about <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> is vanity. It also smacks of ignorance to say that ANUS is just a website when it is far more that, ANUS exists outside of its web presence and the website exists only as an extention of what they do. Just becuase it has a funny name doesn't mean it deserves to be deleted. Also, I would like to note that on many VfDs of past, I have seen votes for keep removed because they were "sockpuppets" or people who haven't contributed enough or whatever but votes for delete never received such scruitiny. Just something to keep in mind if you really are interested in being objective. -[[User::Dmdx86|dmdx86]] 19:05, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yet another user whose only contributes have been to ANUS, aside from voting in the GNAA VFD months ago.

I do think that if kept, it should be cleaned up: philosophical and musical interests should be retained, but trolling and IRC activities should be removed as unworthy of encyclopedic mention.

<li>I am roughly in agreement about IRC; to me, it's a means to an end. Trolling will be explained in a future article about what happens when discourse dies (rest assured it will cite the use of the term "sock puppet" by paranoid Wikipedians); as a nihilist, I don't believe in "good" and "evil" or other philosophical Absolutes (non-philosophical absolute: I enjoy candycanes), thus I can't say I'm against trolling as a means, especially when the audience is as ill-informed as most are in the current time. Because of that, however, it's important that we as nihilists uphold the value of trolling, since discourse is dead. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">Prozak</a> 03:18, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This may be a misunderstanding. I'm not saying anything about trolling or IRC on any moral grounds. It's the non-encyclopedic quality of it that concerns me. As I said below, Wikipedia is essentially a huge online reference book.

<li>Yes, and there's also a middle ground between IRC and Tom Green; I'm not really sure anyone will care about those two even in fifty years, seeing how Martin Luther King plagiarized everything he ever "wrote" and Tom Green is, well, mediocre as well. ANUS has, as you said, been around for a long time and raising more hell than not. If WikiPedia cannot recognize that, I suggest it is the vanity of WikiPedians speaking. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">Prozak</a> 04:29, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Trolling is talked about in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>'s entry as well as the Gay Nigger Association of America's entry. GNAA has survived VfD 5 times, so I think it was been pretty well established that talking about trolling is acceptable. Also, it is totally unfair that a newish article in progress gets put up for VfD before it has a chance to be improved. --dmdx86 Dmdx86 19:32, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that is precisely the problem. If trolling is a major part of this org's activities, then the org itself likely isn't important enough to be on WP. Both of the above are bad examples: Slashdot is obviously notable for much more than anything related to trolling, and the fact that GNAA has been up for VfD 5 times should clue you in that many of us here at WP don't consider trolling groups encyclopedic (and besides, GNAA would seem to be more famous than ANUS anyway). Think of it this way: this is an encyclopedia, a research tool for the ages. When somebody accesses WP twenty or thirty years from now, do you really think they'll give a crap what someone said on some forum or IRC channel? Of course not. Now, if ANUS really supports musical and philosophical interests, and has made contributions to those fields, tell us more about them in the article, and the less (if anything) said about trolling, the better, so as to keep it encyclopedic. As it stands my vote is leaning toward deletion unless additional evidence is provided as above. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:04, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't seem to remember that GNAA won each and every one of its VfDs. Just because a vocal hypocritical minority doesnt like something does not indicate lack of encyclopedic value. May I note that what Wikipedia considers "encyclopedic" differs quite alot from what a printed encyclopedia would consider to fit that definition and not print even half of the stuff Wikipedia lists. I see all sorts of obscure social and cultural things on Wikipedia but when someone posts something that totally contradicts what most of you accept as the norm in society, you all go nuts. How can ANUS describe its philosophical and metal contributions (which are on the webiste which you obviously did NOT visit) if the page is going to get delted anyway?

<li><b>Keep.</b> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">Prozak</a>) The site has been around since early 1995; before that, it was a directory on the old paranoia.com (you DO remember that, don't you? if not, I suspect a newbie, no offense). Previous to that, it was represented by an FTP space for the undiscovered country ezine, one of the first ezines and arguably the first in literature. Previous to that, it was represented well on a series of bulletin boards, most notably the Apocalyptic Funhouse, which if you called Houston in the 1980s you will remember. Here's our old text file archive on textfiles.com, a site you also hopefully mention: <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ANUS/" class="external free" title="http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ANUS/" rel="nofollow">http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ANUS/</a> And regarding incoming links, your Google syntax is broken; try this: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=link%3A*anus.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=link%3A*anus.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=link%3A*anus.com&amp;btnG=Search</a> which will yield you "about 2,240 English pages" linking to anus.com or subdivisions thereof.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is where I draw the line. I realize we set a precedent with the GNAA, but Wikipedia is not consistent. The article as it stands gives no independent sources, it lists only activities established by the ANUS itself, and there is a strong reason to suspect that all of the factual content has been supplied by ANUS members. This makes the article unverifiable. As an inclusionist, I'm careful about judging notability, but I don't compromise on verifiability. The article waxes prolific on activities that have not been established to have been noticed by anyone outside of ANUS, other than those they have brought to attention themselves by self-admitted trolling. The GNAA was borderline. This, IMO, is on the wrong side of the border. The threshold for verifiability is far too low. Multiple independent references are needed, and they must be reasonably accessible. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a primary source, nor is it an index for any association of individuals who think they are notable (regardless of whether that association is formed to play chess or to promote nihilism). On those grounds, delete.<br />
Also, I'd like the supporters to take into consideration that <i>Keep</i> votes by new accounts are not helping your cause. We've seen this before, and it only convinces people that you're acting in bad faith, and that your articles should preferrably be deleted just to make sure you don't bother us. Don't do it. You're free to argue the article's merits for inclusion, but don't try to pretend your votes are accurate representations of members of the Wikipedia community (and we do rather want that, to make sure that you understand what we're trying to do here in the first place). We won't buy one-shot votes anyway, and it's just going to tempt people into voting on the authors and "what would happen" if we had such an article. Keep in mind that this vote will be tallied by a human being, who will take legitimacy of votes into account. Getting the most <i>Keep</i> votes in does not mean automatic victory. This is one discussion you cannot win by just opening a can of members and supporters, and pointing out how unfair they are being treated by us. You need facts, you need to exhibit an understanding of our policies, and you need to make a coherent argument. I have seen none of this. I wish you the best of luck with your organization, but I don't believe Wikipedia can have an article on it without compromising its integrity. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 02:52, 2005 Jan 17 (UTC)

<dd><b>Update</b>. Predictably, the article has been recreated, warranting its replacement by one of those nifty protected templates that pretend there's no article there. This is not a good day. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 03:37, 2005 Jan 17 (UTC)

<dd>For what it's worth, the new article is (was) not identical to the previously deleted one. (However, the subject matter is the same, whether it is claiming to be about the website or the society.)

<dd>Not necessary, though it's bordering on just SDing because you can somewhat make the argument and because it's the right thing to do for Wikipedia (which I will be the last to dispute). I think letting the VfD discussion run to its completion would have been more productive, if only to allow us to thoroughly refute the supporting arguments (or what little there were), as the previous VfD discussion had none to speak of. I am not so far gone that I'm going to waste admin time to make a fuss about it, though. I'll consider this a premature VfD, and to my opinion consensus among independent observers was sufficiently reached. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 03:55, 2005 Jan 17 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dave‚Äôs Gourmet hot sauces are the result of Dave owning and managing a small restaurant called Burrito Madness near the University of Maryland. Late at night a number of Dave‚Äôs patrons were usually drunk and troublesome. Quickly Dave discovered that if some of these drunks ate super hot hot sauce, then they either left or became extremely quiet. Since it worked out that the hotter the sauce, the faster drunk patrons left; Dave went on a mission to create the hottest sauce in the Universe. The end result of this mission was Insanity Sauce which Dave took to the National Fiery Foods Show in New Mexico. At the show the sauce made quite an impression and not just because of the straight jacket that Dave wore. In fact, Daves Insanity Sauce became the only product ever banned for being too hot. Since that day over 8 years ago: Burrito Madness was sold, Dave set up Dave‚Äôs Gourmet, Inc., and seventy other products have been added to Dave‚Äôs Gourmet‚Äôs offerings.</dd>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The decision was an overwhelming vote to delete the original version of the article. There were 5 credible votes to keep the rewritten article. There were, however, a supermajority of users who clearly voted to delete even after the rewrite. In addition, some of the users who voted delete early in the discussion have a strong history of returning to similar discussions and updating their votes as new evidence is presented. The fact that they chose not to change their votes is, I believe, indicative of an intent to vote to delete even the rewritten article. I conclude that there is a consensus to delete this article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 20:14, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
