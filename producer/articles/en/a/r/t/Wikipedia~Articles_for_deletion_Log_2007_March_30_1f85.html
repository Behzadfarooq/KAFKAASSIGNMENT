<dd>Yes, we know that the name of the state is Eagle.

<li><b>Delete</b> since there is a consensus that this is a hoax and false autobiography, and <b>block article creator</b>. The chance that someone who had "starred" (even in small roles) on "Charmed", "Lost", "Heroes", and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", all of which have significant fandoms, could have no acting credits listed at the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1852450/" class="external text" title="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1852450/" rel="nofollow">IMDb</a> is roughly zero.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's highly unlikely that someone with a speaking part in multiple high-profile films and television shows would not have these credits listed on IMDB or anywhere else online. Unverifiable and possibly hoax. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with everybody on the hoax idea. All of those TV shows and Movies are highly popular among the same group. Teenagers. The chances of one actor being in many highly popular teenage shows, yet no data to support it, is very low indeed. Also, if he has "starred" in so many TV shows and films, then why isn't there data on exactly what parts he plays? No citations, stub, and it seems this guy only exists as an old boxer. Delete indeed. @ YechielMan: This has been through that many deletion stages?

<li><b>Neutral</b>: From <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: "Has won or placed in a major music competition." People are asserting here that performing in this "East Coast Music Awards" deal and winning this "Battle of the Bands" thing qualify. Could we have from someone knowledgeable some reason to believe that these are in fact "major" music competitions? There are a lot of blind assumptions flying about, the more so in that this is the band's sole claim to notability, so far. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't count as neutral, but I did look at the West49 contest info, what I could find, and I thought it looked sort of lame. The contest consisted of a series of podcasts, where people were supposed to vote on the best band of each set, and then there was a champions podcast to pick the overall winner. The problem was, it looks like the contest was supposed to last a year, but ended up dragging on for about 2 years. And finding info about it on the web was not that easy; it doesn't seem to have gotten very much publicity. I can't really say how much publicity it got in Canada, not being in Canada myself, but it didn't look like a lot. And it hasn't gotten them signed. On the whole, it was certainly something, but I think it was decidedly less than a "major award". <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is not connections with other WP articles that is primarily needed, though that is desirable. What is primarily needed is references from <i>third-party independent published sources</i> discussing the work of the organization. For articles like this, relevant professional magazines, online or print , do nicely, as do statements in official university or government sources--but not from the U. of the Aegean, and not blogs. Your fourth external link is a good one, from <a href="http://www.chiosnews.com" class="external free" title="http://www.chiosnews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiosnews.com</a>, a local news source.

<dd>OK, thanx a lot for your details, I think I am getting somehow on the idea... I will try to translate some references on the above article... And I will try to put some more info... Well most of our references are from local media, usually newspapers, but since it was not in English, I thought it wouldn't be good to mention it. Is is good to submit references on specific efforts and/or events that we have done and they have been published as a reference on several news papers? As an example, we have taken some interviews from several people, that we have also sent on local media to re-publish as well, or use it as they want. On the other hand, there are some newspapers that have no web presence, or send their issues by mail in PDF format. Can I upload a specific page, of reference, or screenshots of them? Thank you again and I'm looking forward for a responce! Yannisap 03:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hello again friends. With all my due respect too, I must notice that is not an "intranet" article. I don't know how to express it as the culture here in Greece may somehow differ; our effort/initiative, has been a scheme that refers to the University, but its open way on contributing (anyone has the ability to register on it as a member) has given the opportunity on hight school students to learn more about student life on the Uni, to find some info about the classes, as well as we have started to develop ways on inter-action between other student communities around Greece, to achieve a huger network of people, that would be able to inform about the live and activities on Greek academic life... There are people from all around Greece (and alumni students from Aegean Uni, from around the world) that visit and participate. This idea hasn't been achieved in Greece in any other form, and the "connection" idea is even unique, not for University of the Aegean only but in general here. I don't know if I have helped in some way to express the feeling of this effort. People here are not very used to (student) communities and with our effort we try also to do our best, specially by motivating people that are less interested or less experienced in web and computer stuff! (unfortunately, there are many that are not interested or they're even against computers, as they can't find their way or understand the opportunities...)

<li>Dear friend RGTraynor, I am sorry for being such a "pain in the ass", but I assume that you haven't got the base idea for this effort. I understand why you say this is an intranet system, but I believe if you could read Greek and surf on it for a while, you could immediately understand that myAegean is <b>not only</b> this. It's <b>not even</b> this, as there are bulleting boards on the departments, based on Email posts mainingly, and the central one on: <a href="http://www.aegean.gr/aegean/greek/events/default.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aegean.gr/aegean/greek/events/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aegean.gr/aegean/greek/events/default.htm</a>. Almost every uni has one of these information systems, but, in fact, in Greece, this is <b>not</b> a default service/condition. So "my" is not a part of all these. And in addition, in myAegean, we are focusing on a community that drives a form of evolution, and tries, using the IT to develop actions, to inform, to bring ways and ideas into action and, in fact, bring a new situation here, as some things are not so known or "by default". Especially on Greek countryside... Sorry again for my flooding... Yours faithfully. 195.251.152.18 21:05, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, we will try to do our best even the article stays in Wikipedia or not. I promise you dear friend Pavel Vozenilek, with all my respect, that what I say is not "big words" or "generic phrases". Even if the article goes for deletion, we will not stop our efforts, because we have a vision and some principles that we are to defend. Maybe it's not the time so good now, because we are still on the beginning. If it wasn't a true effort, we wouldn't mind to be in Wikipedia. But we feel that we have a place here. I can't persuade you and I know it, because the matter is typical. We need references, but references that are somehow difficult to achieve, because it needs some hard work and time, specially time. I hope some day we will return here and have them all. Because our effort is not "big words", but big actions. I know this because we have worked hard without any great help from others. And we all feel an enthusiasm for all this. Thank you all in advance, I will not write again so much. I will stop here and just leave it to the evolution. I am just sad. Thank you all, all you that gave some of your precious time to take notice on this. Greetings from Greece! You are all welcome here any time! (and maybe we can show you more on what we do)</li>

<li>OK, so the text needs more development.. I understood that there is 1 major thing we need: references from outside the Uni, and references that shows sth worthy to mention. In addition, if there would be a part of a paper/essay, that refers to myAegean, this would also be good. Am I right on this? I am looking forward to get some more info and to submit it here too. There are also people that work on their diplomas on "Social Networks", that refer to "myAegean", I think. Well, thank you again and if there is sth that I didn't understand well, please let me know!

<p>Initially prodded for deletion as a non-notable club, the original concern was:<i>If there is a cite for actually being the first [organised personal computer user group in the world], then it should be kept</i>. An additional reference was added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_University_Computer_Club&amp;diff=118250417&amp;oldid=117912427" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_University_Computer_Club&amp;diff=118250417&amp;oldid=117912427" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the prod tag removed; however, I believe it is a primary source that really doesn't satisfy the original prod concern.

<li><b>Delete</b> for speciousness. <i>It claims to be the first organised personal computer user group in the world</i>, yet there is no verification given for this claim.

<li>DavydMadeley: I think the person <i>personal</i> is a misnomer. The club was founded in 1974, as its own records will attest. The first computer owned by the club was an Alpha Micro AM1000, but before that the club was formed to get time on the University's PDP-6 (the first PDP-6 sold outside of DEC: <a href="http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/pdp6-serials" class="external free" title="http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/pdp6-serials" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/pdp6-serials</a>). The club has had a long and rich history in Western Australian computing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.56.15.217_d4f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.56.15.217">203.56.15.217</a> (talk) 07:10, 31 March 2007</small>. <small>— 203.56.15.217 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.56.15.217_d4f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.56.15.217">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li>We haven't as yet found good sources to back the claim to be the first personal computer club in the world. However, we have evidence of the club's significant contribution to the Western Australian computing community from 1974 - extremely early for a computing club, and before computing facilities were available to the public - onwards. Our silver jubilee award and other documentation as to club projects on do exist and could be scanned to provide veracity as to the club's significance. After such efforts would the article be suited for inclusion, or should we just back this article up and move it to another site? I also take issue with the club history not being "credible", as it was prepared at the club's expense by an academic, albeit one with association to the club. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahame_c416.html" title="User:Grahame">Grahame</a> 17:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Grahame, unfortunately he is not independent in this matter, regardless of his credibility in his own field. It is primary sourced material which cannot lend weight to claims regarding notability. It would be original research to review sufficient Computer Club histories to categorically say, this one is the oldest one remaining in existence. If someone independent of this club does that research then we have independent works which establish notability.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 04:37, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I fail to see the POV of the title. Settlers and settlements do exist. And I do know that there is a series of decisions by the European Court of Human Rights vindicating Greek-Cypriot citizens having lost their property. And the fact that the government of the Republic of Cyprus accepts in the not-occupied territoty of Cyprus Turkish-Cypriots but not settlers who came to Cyprus later proves their existence.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 12:51, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And when there is a recommendation by the Parliamentary Assembly of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Europe_83e9.html" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a> named <b><a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/TA03/EREC1608.htm" class="external text" title="http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/TA03/EREC1608.htm" rel="nofollow">Colonisation by Turkish settlers of the occupied part of Cyprus</a></b> ... well ... I don't think that anybody here can question notability.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let's see some of what this Recommendation says: "It is a well-established fact that the demographic structure of the island has been continuously modified since its de facto partition in 1974, as a result of the deliberate policies of the Turkish Cypriot administration and Turkey. Despite the lack of consensus on the exact figures, all parties concerned admit that Turkish nationals have since been systematically arriving in the northern part of the island. According to reliable estimates, their number currently totals 115 000." "The settlers come mainly from the region of Anatolia, one of the least developed regions of Turkey. Their customs and traditions differ significantly from those present in Cyprus. These differences are the main cause of the tensions and dissatisfaction of the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population, who tend to view the settlers as a foreign element" "In particular, the Assembly expresses its concern at the continuous outflow of the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population from the northern part of the island. Their number decreased from 118 000 in 1974 to an estimated 87 600 in 2001. In consequence, the settlers outnumber the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population in the northern part." "In the light of the information available, the Assembly cannot accept the claims that the majority of arriving Turkish nationals are seasonal workers or former inhabitants who had left the island before 1974. Therefore it condemns the policy of “naturalisation” designed to encourage new arrivals which was introduced by the Turkish Cypriot administration with the full support of the Government of Turkey."

<dd>The article first makes the claim that "Turkish settlements are communities established by Turkey", as if Turkey is somehow the Ottoman Empire passing a decree to establish overseas colonies. The use of word colonisation again portrays Turkey as orchestrating the movement of Turkish migrants. Turkey does not decide who goes to Cyprus, many Turks go to work over summer in the tourist season and return. Those who do stay are required to have a work permit. But this article does not seem concerned with these details, only in portraying Turkey in a certain light. Furthermore, the article says "such settlements currently exist..." as if this is a common phenomena regarding Turkey, when in fact this an aspect specifically related to the Cyprus problem. These are problems within a few lines, I dont expect this article to get better as it grows in size, but rather become another ugly Cyprus article. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 17:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Responses to your arguments</b>:
<ul>
<li>The settlers are coming from Turkey. Tyrkey allows them to settle in Northern Cyprus by allowing them to go there. If Turkey wanted to impede this phainomenon, it would have done it. Therefore, Turkey may not be Ottoman Empire, but it is a sovereign state tolerating this situation, and showing no will to reverse it. I thus believe that the verb "established" pictures with characteristic accuracy the present situation. After all, if it was not Turkey that "established" the settlement, then why are the Parliamentary Assembly and the European Parliament asking Turkey, in particular, to resolve the problem. I'm afraid, Garnet, that once again your problem is not with the article, but with the clear and sound resolutions of European Organizations and with the publications of UN. And, unfortunately, I can't help with that problem.</li>
<li>The noun "colonisation" is again a NPOV term, also used by the Parliamentary Assembly of the COuncil of Europe. Unless you think, of course, that the great majority of this Parliament, and, therefore, the great majority of the population of Europe are biased against Turkey in this particular issue. But again this is your personal belief and impression. Official documents matter, and official documents of international organization are crystal clear about the ongoing colonisation of occupied Cyprus by Turkey.</li>
<li>I fail to understand your third point. It would be helpful if you could be a bit more clear and specific, so that I can give an accurate answer. Such settlements do exist in Northern Cyprus, their existence is confirmed by all the international organizations, and it is Turkey which is held responsible for their existence. What is exactly your problem here?--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 09:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The picture on the page was some mosque with a Turkish flag (in Cyprus). I thought it was related to settlements, maybe it's not. So, then what are these settlements? In those Balkan countries we might have some "ghetto"s where Turkish people live and have lived for many hundred years (by the way, are they still called settlers?) Are the Turkish settlements in Cyprus ghettos of people from Turkey? I would rather guess that they would blend in, spread kinda uniformly among the 'original' Turkish Cypriots, not build some ghettos. Are they house by house, like any house owned by a settler is a settlement? What about the students? I think the first sentence of the article might be wrong, it should read "after the invasion" not "established by Turkey". I don't think Turkey established any ghettos there. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 00:29, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Settlements aren't necessarily inhabited by "settlers" in the sense of migrants. I assume you live in a settlement, which the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> uses to refer to any inhabited place. See the long discussion at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28settlements%29_904f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)</a> and its talk page. Since "Turkish" is both a nationality (you can have a Turkish passport and be of e.g. Greek, Armenian, Arab, Jewish, or Kurdish ethnicity) and an ethnicity (you can be ethnically Turkish and hold e.g., a Bosnian, Russian, or US passport), the use of Turkish to modify settlement in the context of Cyprus could well mean settlements in Cyprus inhabited by people of Turkish ethnicity or with Turkish passports. Based on the sources, these groups largely overlap anyway. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:28, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The word <i>settlement</i> has two quite distinct meanings: (1) a community consisting of a number of dwellings; (2) the process of settling, as the result of migration. The title of the article is accordingly ambiguous. The disputed article as well as the present discussion appear to confuse the two meanings, whether accidentally or not. As defined in the lead of the article, the meaning is unambiguously (1), but in a curiously restricted sense. It is as if we were to have an article "Italian house" starting "An <b>Italian house</b> is a house built by Italians during World War I." Are settlements of Turks in Kos or Bulgaria then not Turkish settlements? Settlements of Turks on Cyprus have existed since the 16th century. In the remainder of the article, the meaning gradually shifts to (2). Although many Turks may have settled on the island after the partition, and the Republic of Turkey has not discouraged this, these migrants did not form <i>new</i> settlements, and no evidence is presented in the article that any communities were established by Turkey in Cyprus <i>after</i> the partition, nor do the cited sources support this contention. Thus, following the restricted definition of the lead, <b>there are no Turkish settlements</b>. The definition in the lead can be relaxed, of course, to refer to any Turkish communities, including those in existence on Cyprus at the time of the EOKA coup, but that defeats the whole purpose of the article, which would have to be completely rewritten to accommodate the new definition. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am not at all versed on this subject, but your comment that "these migrants did not form <i>new</i> settlements" seems to be contradicted by a letter printed in the IHT: <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/23/opinion/edlet.php" class="external text" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/23/opinion/edlet.php" rel="nofollow">"Hundreds of illegal settlements have been established in occupied areas"</a><a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:04, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Chesdovi, those are the letters of readers, you are aware of that, right? Please give the link to the article itself, if it is mentioned there. But you might be right a little bit, once I posted a comment on a Kurdish newspaper (?) website (I don't remember the website now, I found it through Yahoo! Alerts quite a while ago, it was the English version, I bookmarked it but then removed bookmark after like a week), they were bashing Erdoğan for a comment he made, in a few minutes the website was filled with anti-Turkish comments, I wrote something like Talabani said about the same thing, but my comment was not published, even though many other Turkey-bashing ones were published after that. So, having a comment there might reflect the opinion of the journalist as well, but that might be true only for that Kurdish website. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 15:21, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was merely pointing out that there is another opinion and of course the letter carries no weight! (Where is a list of "new" Turkish settlements on the web?

<dd>Indeed, as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> states: <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is <b>attributable</b> to a reliable published source, not whether it is true.</i> Where is the reliable source for the statements in the lead? &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:56, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Chesdovi, your opinion is more valuable to me than that reader's opinion is. I changed my vote to delete only, as the current lead claims things with no support and then the article deals with something else, apparently the article won't get better. I am worried it will be anything goes — anytime the editor feels like it. Now we even have the Turkish settle-ment, act of settling. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 21:47, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I recognize this, but it creates a problem in terms of the generation of linkspam. The only general solution I can think of is to list but not link.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. While the company has several clients which are notable in their own right, the article seems rely rather heavily on name-dropping.

<p>As much as I am an X-Men fan, this article is necessarily of too little notibility even to fans of the X-books to merit a full Wikipedia article.

<p><b>Nomination</b></p>
<ul>
<li><s>Listcruft</s> List more suited to a Wrestling fansite. The individual wrestler articles overwhelmingly have details of the subject's signature moves making collective lists redundant.<br />
Checking [[Category:Professional_wrestlers_by_nationality]] country by country gave a total of <b>714</b> articles (which doesn't take into account uncategorised biographies) and given that often wrestlers have more than one "finishing move" and that new wrestler articles are created all the time, this list is shown to be clearly unmaintainable. &lt;/If the list was now 100% complete there would be in excess of 1000 lines - far too collossal. There is also the issue of complete lack of references/citations or even appropriate internal links.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - per the fact that this is the only unnecessary wrestling moves article. There is no need for a repository of finishing moves, as the wrestler's individual articles store the names and descriptions.

<li><b>Comment</b> I realize the point of the nominator, as this is an endless list, but I feel the opening paragraph is a perfect definition of what a finishing maneuver is.

<li><b>KEEP</b> there are too many examples of rock bands inside of wikipedia so there is precedence. Kemper Crabb and Frank Hart are ICONS of independent Christian rock music. Atomic Opera often perfomed with the likes of Galactic Cowboys and King's X. Just because some people apparently don't like them is NOT a good reason to remove the information.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Just because they broke up once before does not make them a candidate for deletion. They did reconvene and are still an active band. I went through and removed the "red links" that were another person's argument for deletion. And what does "Delete as it's not yet a suitable subject for wikipedia." mean? Please be more specific than that, Mr. Berry. Also, the citing of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> in the original argument is bogus, due to "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does <b>not</b> mean an article must be deleted". Also, to Ward3001, the article isn't self-promotional, as I wrote most of the content originally, and am not affiliated with the band. Also, the article is no longer unsourced as multiple references have been included. Dlwhiteman 15:47, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Those reasons for deletion are pathetic. The band is still around and all the members are making music. Just because some people don't know that doesn't mean this should be deleted. -JJ <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_161.253.143.229_6c1f.html" title="Special:Contributions/161.253.143.229">161.253.143.229</a> (talk) 15:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— 161.253.143.229 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_161.253.143.229_6c1f.html" title="Special:Contributions/161.253.143.229">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This band has a long history, and it seems to be fairly notable - "Atomic Opera" and "Christian" generates 18,600 ghits, most of which seem to be the band.

<p>This article should be deleted because it is a non-notable vanity (and COI) article. Lewis wrote this article about himself, and has exaggerated his awards and accomplishments. The Day prize is the only one he won outright (and it was for a collaborative work); the Broken Frontier is a web community-based award with no official standing, and Cinescape chooses multiple winners, hence "<i>a</i> winner" (their usage - Lewis skips that bit). The first hit for Lewis on Google is his own company, and there is no way to verify easily that he was ever more than a student contributor to the IJOCA. He's also not an "educator" but, given his current education level (self-stated PhD student), perhaps a teaching assistant. The sources on the article are <i>his</i> company site and <i>his</i> blog, and thus fail <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>List with many problems: It includes any film that has won a "widely-recognized" award (including a Razzie). "Widely-recognized" is inherently subjective. I know about films but I haven't heard of some of these awards. Annual box office receipts also appear to be a factor here.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> states that <i>unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material... (including) interpretations, definitions, and arguments published by Wikipedia must already have been published by a reliable publication.</i> So unless these films have specifically been listed in this order, for this reason, by a reliable publication before, the list is OR.</p>
<p>Also problems with the title; "notable" just doesn't work in Wikipedia articles because, by definition, <i>every</i> science fiction film with an article is <i>notable</i>. I have proposed a rename (renaming it to anything else descriptive), but that was before I actually looked at the list properly and realised it shouldn't even be on here.

<li><b>Comment</b>, you're right about the problems in this article... but I'm not sure that it should be deleted for them. <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films considered the greatest ever">Films considered the greatest ever</a> had many of these problems at one point but it's better (not great) now and seems to be accepted as an article that won't be deleted.

<li>I don't believe the problems here are the type that can be solved by cleaning it up. <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films considered the greatest ever">Films considered the greatest ever</a> is different because it's a list of superlatives, so most of the films on that list have ranked higher or won more awards in a particular field than any other.

<li><b>Delete</b> - any film with a Wikipedia article is supposed to be notable by definition and this is redundant to the far more comprehensive category system for science fiction films. If the award the films won is sufficiently notable then lists of the films that won those awards might be acceptable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as well as the previous reasons this list is too loosely connected. If it was <i>just</i> sci-fi films that have won an Oscar, OK. If it was highest-grossing sci-fi films ever, fine. But where's the strong connection between a Golden Globe, a "Hugo", and a Razzie? There isn't one. There's a related AFD discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Road_to_the_76th_Academy_Awards_a7ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Road to the 76th Academy Awards">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Road to the 76th Academy Awards</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 04:20, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Split</b> into separate lists about the winners of the listed awards for those lists that don't already exist. A list of all notable SF films would be unmaintainable. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:10, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I concur with <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> in saying that as "notability" is a criterion for inclusion in Wikipedia, by default a list of "notable" films is redundant to the existing category system. The article attempts to create a more narrow definition of "notability" but in doing so has injected a POV bias as to what constitutes a "widely-recognized" award. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:30, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Possibly notable pioneer, article sources lost during page moves.</p>
<p>Partly procedural: At first glance, the subject of this article would seem important as an early pioneer of the European settlement of the area. However, the sources for this page were lost along with the early page history during some rather unclear page moves. The article obviously cannot stay without them, and I myself have no information on the subject. I ask some admin who knows how to retrieve the sources, so the article can be properly restored and discussed. . -- or perhaps the orig. ed who added the article still has the information. We have been discussing similar bios, &amp; it would be a good time to clear the status of this one if possible. I cannot say which way it should go without knowing the sources. If restoring them is for some reason impossible, then of course it should be deleted. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:06, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the note left on my talk page, the ref referred to is <a href="http://home.golden.net/~jjdm/Moore%20Family%20Page/D1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.golden.net/~jjdm/Moore%20Family%20Page/D1.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> (he's no. 160). which must obviously have been compiled from other sources. I am not in the least disputing about this article, just discussing it-- I have been puzzled by it, because it was obviously written from sources along with a number of other bios on Moores by User:Podiatrist, and I cant figure out where. (How the history got to be under Inky Moore is something I never did understand, but no matter), So i'd like to ask in public, and have it settled. If I ever have the time in some future year, I may try to find the real sources myself &amp; either add or recreate depending on what the status of this article is by then. because it does seem obvious that a leader of an obviously historical rebellion should be notable and must have sources somewhere beyond the link above.

<li><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">non-notable</a> even given the era of his life. He's <a href="http://home.golden.net/~jjdm/Moore%20Family%20Page/D1.htm#i276" class="external text" title="http://home.golden.net/~jjdm/Moore%20Family%20Page/D1.htm#i276" rel="nofollow">#55</a> in the page DGG linked to, not #160. (The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> pundits won't like it that the page is hosted on some ISP's personal web server and is likely to be self-published, but that is another matter for another time.) The writer of that page appears to have done much research, but assuming everything on the page is accurate, nowhere is he claimed to have been a "leader of the rebels" in <i>any</i> battle. So that info is unsourced. Under "notable events: military" his only notable event was "his service in the 1812-14 War with the Americans" and allegedly getting land in return for said service. Thus his best reliable claim to notability is only an unspecified role in another battle, which is not close to notability even in that era. Other things he did include being jailed, sentenced to death, moving residence several times, and owning about 500 acres of land, none of which are notable activities in themselves. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 04:13, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Of course, but once notable, they remain so. If he was a notable revolutionary in the 19th century, he remains so. I think getting sentenced to death for treason is generally notable, even if not executed.

<dl>
<dd>non-notable wrestler; if for some reason this does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion (I think it does), could somebody please put it up for afd as a procedural nomination for failing notability requirements and being unreferenced, and perhaps even being spam? I can't because I don't have an account and don't wish to make an account at this time.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He was in multiple televized wrestling matches for notable wrestling organizations and has a comic book character based on his wrestling persona. Don't see how that is not notable. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:15, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, there are more assertions of notability than in the majority of wrestling biography articles. The article is comprehensively referenced and relatively well written. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 12:25, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, In agreeing with the other users, there seems to be more than enough notability especially compared to MANY other wrestling biography articles on wiki. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERingWars2007_12ee.html" title="User:RingWars2007">RingWars2007</a> 14:04, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I realize that as the original creator of this article, my opinion is technically "biased" in favor of keeping the article, but I felt the fact that he has appeared in a range of media sources was enough to qualify him under the notability factor. I have noticed in my work on the to do list for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Professional_wrestling_ab8a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Professional wrestling">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling</a>, that many other wrestling-related wiki articles are either not sourced, poorly sourced, or seem non-notable (and not necessary). I had hoped this article was a step above those, and am still hoping! —<a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYeLLeY511_6694.html" title="User:YeLLeY511">YeLLeY511</a> 17:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is supposed to be the sum total of human knowledge, cover everything we can find sources for. I was surprised to see so many sources on the wrestler, who I have never heard of before seeing the article being worked on in recent edits. Probably the anon who suggested it for speedy deletion hadn't heard of him either. Deletionism is so against the spirit of Wikipedia that it sickens me. Speedy keep I say, pretty much everyone is agreeing on this. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">KV</a>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Vegita_7857.html" title="User talk:King Vegita">Talk</a>) 21:14, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Just because you don't follow NASCAR and haven't heard of his blog does not mean it should be deleted. He has a growing viewership because of his southern roots and knowledge of the sport.

<p>I am currently trying to write an entry for every first class cricketer who has played for Yorkshire CCC. By definition a first class cricketer is a notable person. The entry will be expanded and properly presented soon but I can't do everything at once. The sources for the statistics, Cricket Archive, will be given.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says "competitors who have played in a fully professional league" are by definition considered sufficiently notable for an article.

<p>The article has references to Wood's statistics on cricinfo and cricket archive and is linked to the Yorkshire Cricketers category. I agree the title is clumsy, but that was the link from the 'Yorkshire CCC players' page which I'm working my way through. If someone could change the title that would be great but I wouldn't presume to do that myself. This article is as complete and well sourced as a thousand others on similar first class cricketers and I'm not sure why it's still up for possible deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> any useful comparison content might be worth having in the Citizendum article though I doubt there is much to say about a project that is in its infancy it is crystal ball to suggest that this is a genuine alternative to wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 10:33, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - this isn't a real article, it's a thinly veiled claim that Citizendium is better than Wikipedia. As for George Leung's concern - Citizendium's claims under those circumstances would be unsound: if delete, we are deleting a flamebait, inherently POV article, not being an evil cabal. If keep, we would be allowing that article to grow - something I find inappropriate given that the article on <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> will, or should be the location of any comparison of WP and CZ since CZ is arguably a fork or offshoot of Wikipedia. Let the standards existing in our AfD processes rule, and any challenge from an opportunistic CZ'er is baseless - we will have followed Wikipedia's standards and reached a reasonable conclusion via consensus. For the record, in this comment I do not imply that WP either is or is not better than CZ - I just can't see this article as anywhere near appropriate. <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihiltres_9c42.html" title="User:Nihiltres">Nihiltres</a> 13:44, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If and when the topic of Wikipedia vs Citizendium comparisons becomes too uweildy for the Citizendium article - properly backed up by reliable secondary sources of course - then perhaps a more comprehensive article can be written.

<li>To be perfectly frank, that's probably best left in the Citizendium article itself - this would be based off of a precedent set by articles for <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a> and, by a long shot, <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dictionary_cc65.html" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban Dictionary</a> (which, in its current state, I don't believe has such a comparison - but you get the idea). --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 16:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is clearly going nowhere. Yanksox is right, it's waiting for some sort of altercation.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Simple paraphrasing of a <i>single</i> source does not constitute an encyclopedia article on a topic.

<li>Seriously, the culture of Wikipedia is scary. There is alreadly enough coverage. I'll let you in on a secret though: not many people give a damn about Wikipedia. Hence, the press really doesn't care about something as minute as deleting a barely one paragraph article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 19:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, they don't care about Wikipedia when something good is happening, but as soon as a hint of bad stuff happen, they will flock to it like bees to honey.

<li>No, it doesn't happen at the hint of anything slightly bad. I've been here for a year and known about Wiki's existance before that. For the most part the press is somewhat lackadasical about Wiki, they only care in gigantic situations like Essjay and Schelgr., but the press doesn't monitor Wiki, it takes alot of people to jump up and down. This is a simple and small page, stop spitting so much into it, George. You and Quack need to relax. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 22:44, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Alert</b> That's what they said about Essjay in the beginning. Relax? or better yet procede with extreme caution. The votes for delete are a logical fallicy arguement.

<li>QG, what in blazes does Essjay have to do with this? Don't bring Essjay into the mess.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm not even sure what this article is supposed to be? Is it about a controversy? If so, which one - I don't know of any, and the article doesn't bring any forward. Is it supposed to be a comparison of Wikipedia and Citizendium? Then it's not an encyclopedic topic, AFAIK - and it surely could be covered on the page about Citizendium, or Wikipedia themselves. I mean, a "differences" page should only be created when there is substantial and informative material to be collected which could not be produced on the pages about the two items being compared. In this case, it is all of one line on either to summarize the comparisons - it doesn't need it's own article. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 02:49, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me expand on this, so it doesn't seem too terse - Citizendium is created as a <i>response</i> to Wikipedia. This article is their meta-namespace, to talk about what Citizendium is, and is not. It's not a mainspace article, and they don't appear to <i>have</i> an article on this in their mainspace either.

<p>Vanity/promotion page about an educator whose importance is still pretty unclear after reading the article. This page was previously deleted; see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stephen_Heppell_133d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stephen Heppell">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stephen Heppell</a> for the first debate. The entirety of sourcing available at this time consists of a couple of short bullet points in a "profile" on a news site <a href="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/U/unteachables/free1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/U/unteachables/free1.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. There is also <a href="http://www.steppingstones.org.uk/news/stephen_heppell_rts_judges_award" class="external text" title="http://www.steppingstones.org.uk/news/stephen_heppell_rts_judges_award" rel="nofollow">this</a>, brought up in the previous debate as an award he won that (1) isn't an independent source, (2) reads like a press release, and (3) doesn't give any idea what the RTS Judges award is, or if it has any prestige, who awards it, et cetera. Given the shabby state of the article, the creation of it and some recent editing by User:Stephenheppell, and the borderline level of notability here, I say we <b>delete.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 03:57, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>, unfortunately. The article's a mess. All of the Keep votes noted that the article needs major work, generally pruning. There were some comments suggesting a split (of the potheads) or a merge, but not significant support for those solutions. I will now proceed to prune the article with a vengeance, as everyone agrees that that is a condition of it being kept. No prejudice against a renomination if the article doesn't soon figure out what it wants to be and moves in that direction. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:51, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>== This article is a total disaster. == This article has got to the point where any celebrity who has been photographed smoking is included. "Tony Yayo"?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_smokers.html" title="List of famous smokers">List of famous smokers</a>. The list does need major clean-up, but I don't think that is a sufficient reason to delete. The list need to be sourced because right now it is a magnet for all sorts of dubious claims (pictures "surfaced" of someone smoking a joint, so-and-so is "said" to have smoked pot everyday, and numerous references to people being marijuana smokers because they simply sang a SONG about smoking marijuana). The list should be reoriented to the original purpose of <i>iconic</i> smokers, not just anybody who was ever seen with a cigarette. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 04:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li>How about we turn this in a list of famous people who advertised smoking and a list of people who are known primarily for their smoking (<a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette_Smoking_Man_9bd7.html" title="Cigarette Smoking Man">Cigarette Smoking Man</a> comes to mind)? Although the second list may be controversial, the first is definitely useful and either one or both together could eliminate a lot of the dubious entries on the current list.

<li><b>Extinguish</b>. I find it <i>curious</i> that the purported definition as given by the lead section is "This is a list of famous people, for whom smoking is clearly a recognised part of their public image, or who are known for some unusual aspect of smoking", when the <i>very first</i> entry is for someone who "Was a closet cigarette smoker, a fact that came out shortly after her death". Despite the assertion by the lead section this is nothing more than an intersection between people who are famous and people who smoke - and given the popularity of smoking at one point in time the people who fit both those qualifiers will be <i>enormous</i>. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is of great interest to so many people, I don't know how some of you people can say otherwise. Brown pants, indeed! (Iridescenti, above) (For all we know, you "delete" voters could work in the tobacco industry and want a lower profile because of negative publicity. I've been a proud anti-tobacco campaigner for decades.) Some evidence for public interest are the campaigns to get celebrities to be better role models and the campaigns to reduce smoking in movies so that young people (the main movie theatre-goers) are less influenced to smoke. To participate for or against such campaigns, it helps to know about whom you are talking, so let's draw investigators to Wikipedia for that encyclopedic information! Many of the delete supporters are voting based on the quality of the article now, instead of how good it can be after we work on it more. We don't delete an article because it is unfinished and needs references. We should keep out the word "iconic" (too limited and trendy) in the criteria. Arkyan (above) has a good point--probably a great majority of entertainers in Western culture in the 1940s smoked. But because almost everyone believed the world was flat long ago doesn't mean that today's flat-worlders are not notable. <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorky_Day_88d3.html" title="User:Korky Day">Korky Day</a> 01:21, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

That was before I knew about the older article (because the latter was hard to find!). Then I realised that the two articles are not exact duplicates. The chewers, etc. are added in mine. But more importantly, I have a section for ex-users. This is of great interest, for instance, Fidel Castro quit smoking, which greatly interests people and is an argument for admirers of Fidel to quit smoking. So I'd like to see the two articles merged, with all the features of both. <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorky_Day_88d3.html" title="User:Korky Day">Korky Day</a> 01:21, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Does <i>not</i> making the Olympics confer notability? Her team finished 16th in the European trails... where's the cutoff? 20th? 50th? Irish triple jump champion yes.

<li>I am sorry but to include her on the basis of her triple jump record is really plain silly. She to the best of my knowledge never competed in any of the following for Ireland- European championship either indoor or out, World or Olympic championship. I am not even sure that she competed in the Europa cup. The standard in the Europa cup and European indoor championship is quite low journeymen or journey women national champions normally get an outing in one or the other. There are also countless living Irish people who have won multiple track and field national titles- it is not for wikipedia to list them all. She triple jumped when the event was just introduced in senior competitions and won national titles. someone had to. Her performances compare very badly to standards in England, France, Germay or America at the time she jumped no where near the marks recorded by athletes in those countries at the time. As an aside she is not the Irish national triple jump record holder either- the long time record holder is also off the pace so to speak compared to other international athletes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.112.142.244_b557.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.112.142.244">84.112.142.244</a> (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.112.142.244.html" title="User talk:84.112.142.244">talk</a>) 09:25, 1 April 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— 84.112.142.244 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.112.142.244.html" title="User talk:84.112.142.244">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.112.142.244_b557.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.112.142.244">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><s><b>Strong delete</b></s>. Being a national champion in a sport is in itself far from notable, even in a large sport such as athletics. I'm a national champion in an athletics event, so if Canley's argument was true I would benefit from that in a way. On the other hand, our goal should be to build a high-quality encyclopedia, not an indiscriminate collection of information. Moreover a set of guidelines known as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> cover this type of articles, and none of the criteria outlined there are met in this case. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 20:16, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Bobslieghers who nearly qualified for the Olympics how many other people around the world meet this criteria. It to my mind lacks notability.

<li>I would say the exact opposite - for the same reason: An encyclopedia, Wikipedia should not and does not cover everything. The fact that Hoey hardly excelled in triple jump (look at her results) is another discussion.

<li>Still a strong delete. The Triple Jump point has surely been addressed at this point. Neither of the two ladies has any releveance at all outside of Ireland as Triple Jumpers. The fact that they made national headlines for a short period in Ireland when doing another sport in and itself does not merit inclusion in Wikipedia. There is an inference here that they should be included because they are plucky Irish girls competing in a sport not normally associated with that country and they nearly made the Olympics. That is an extremely weak argument for inclusion. They got some publicity as at the time it was a good colour story. But the reality is they are unknown in Ireland. Bad Triple Jumpers, better but not notable bob sleighers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.112.142.244_b557.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.112.142.244">84.112.142.244</a> (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.112.142.244.html" title="User talk:84.112.142.244">talk</a>) 20:49, 2 April 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— 84.112.142.244 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.112.142.244.html" title="User talk:84.112.142.244">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.112.142.244_b557.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.112.142.244">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>There's a reason the primary criterion for notability is "multiple, non-trivial secondary sources" – whilst I'm sure many who participate in the AfD process would love to have a manual for biographies, and sportspersons in particular, which spelt out what was "notable" in black-and-white, this will never happen: Wikipedians would never satisfactorily agree on the thousands of arbitrary limits and rules required. The Hoey sisters meet the primary notability criterion, with multiple non-trivial references in Irish and UK media and sources over five years – whether this is due to their athletic achievements (which the press seem to have a fairly high opinion of) or because they're "plucky Irish girls" aiming for Olympic glory is irrelevant. You appear to be arguing that it is a bad precedent to include apparently lacklustre athletes, I would argue that it is a far more dangerous precedent to discard the primary notability criterion and instead rely on subjective opinions or "gut feelings" of athletic prowess. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 00:10, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Still a strong delete. They lack notability. The two are absolutely unheard of in the UK- do not accept there were multiple non trivial references there- they made some press for colour reasons whilst Olympic winter sports were in peoples minds. I travel between the two countries. If you want to put it in those terms they really are lacklustre athletes. Utterly irrelevant as Triple Jumpers and no relevance in winter sports. It is a dangerous precedent to keep these ladies here. Being Irish claiming to have no access to funds and nearly doing something seems to allow you to have these girls punch above their weight. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.112.142.244 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.112.142.244.html" title="User talk:84.112.142.244">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.112.142.244_b557.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.112.142.244">contribs</a>).</small><small>— 84.112.142.244 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.112.142.244.html" title="User talk:84.112.142.244">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.112.142.244_b557.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.112.142.244">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Attacking this person because they haven't signed up to an account is changing the goal posts. I have just googled Siobhan Hoey. As a track and field athlete she seems to have a long jump best of 6.02m and a triple jump best of around 12.38m. The Olympic standard for 2008 in each event is 6.72m and 14.2 m respectively. Therefore her p.b is 70cm shy in one case and 1.8m shy in the other. This discrepency strikes me as indicating an athlete who shouldn't be on wikipedia. The marks just referred to are the minimum required to get to the Olympics- to progress it would be normal to exceed what is asked of you in qualifying once you get there. I know little about the bob sleigh but I doubt that someone so average in one event suddenly becomes an Olympic standard athlete when they change to winter sports. And the fact is she didn't qualify in that either. Taking her argument at its height its basically she should be here because she came 16th in olympic qualifying when 15 were to go. She still missed it and we have no objective information on the difference between 15th and 16th place. The Irish Sports Council guy is spinning the story. Unless more bona fide objective information is given she really doesn't deserve to be here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.202.154.56 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.202.154.56_7736.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.202.154.56">contribs</a>).</small><small>— 213.202.154.56 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.202.154.56_7736.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.202.154.56">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>I'm not attacking them at all, and I'm very sorry if it comes across that way. They are of course welcome to continue to post and edit anonymously (as are you), there's nothing wrong with that at all. I just think that if one is going to issue dire warnings of dangerous inclusion precedents on AfD and talk pages, then one tends to have a little more credibility if one has a user account and signs their posts. Whatever... the standards the two of you are drawing are subjective and in opposition to Wikipedia's primary notability policy, that's all I'm saying. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 12:18, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree. Objectively one can say she jumped certain distances in the long jump and triple jump, that are quite average, and did not qualify for either the 2002 or 2006 winter Olympics. In track and field her performances were 10-13% shy of the present Olympic 'A' standards. A man at the same standard who ran the 1500 metres would be running 4 minutes 15 seconds or so instead of the required time of around 3 minutes 37 seconds. Someone of that calibre evidently lacks notability and shouldn't get on wikipedia because they missed qualifying for the Olympics in winter sports also.</li>

<li>There is a big difference between Hoey and Edwards the latter qualified for an Olympics as did the Jamaican team. Edwards was also extremely well known in the UK for some time in the late 1980s and there was a movie made about the Jamaican team. You keep deciding without any basis in fact that I am being arbitrary and subjective. I am not factually Hoey did not qualify for the Olympics either at track and field or winter sports. In the former situation she compted in any event that women had not done before. Whilst Triple Jump has been around for men since 1896 it was only introduced for women in the early 1990s. The standard in Irish athletics varies from year to year and event to event. Someone has to win the national championship each year. Jumping 12.4 metres or thereabouts really does not merit further comment. There are 25 perhaps more unmemorable Irish athletes who have won 5-10-15 multiple national titles because they were competing in a small country at a time when the standard of competition was low and have little relevance for an encylopedia like wikipedia. Hoey is one of them. On its own it is also irrelevant to be told Hoey finished 16th when 15 qualified for the Olympics bob sleigh. She could have been 16th by the proverbial mile. We just don't know from the information given. The google rating is relevant in one way- it indicates some validity to the statement that was made earlier that she is unknown. Google hits on Siobhan Hoey 26, Eddie Edwards 80,000, Jamaican team 3,00/, Cool runnings 1/2 million. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.202.149.105 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.202.149.105_6800.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.202.149.105">contribs</a>).</small><small>— 213.190.141.210 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.190.141.210_13bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.190.141.210">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>I see that Siobhan Hoey did not win a medal in the America's cup event her sister and another women are said to have done. I tried to find these results online and can't. Does anyone have a link to this bronze medal win other than a provincial Irish newspaper. Other results for the Hoey's show them coming 17th/19 teams and 22/23 teams etc so this entry seems most odd.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am not convinced that this list is unmaintainable. Although there are many Australian scientists, there is not so many notable enough to have articles that the list becomes an unmaintainable one. As for redundancy with the categorization scheme... well I'll agree that the list could be sorted by something else than the alphabet, chronologically by birth might be a better idea, but since each entry has a note of <i>what</i> science the person worked with, and <i>when</i> the person lived, I will call the list <i>annotated</i>, and as such <i>not</i> redundant. I feel that the list passes two criteria on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> guideline, it is informative by virtue of the annotations, and it serves a purpose as a navigational aid. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:55, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. As I mentioned previously on my talk page, I never "re added" any sources nor was I informed prior to RobJ's removal that there was a problem with any of the sources I added. I assume the change took place during an edit conflict, however the "fansite" is actually an <i>official</i> website of prominant independent wrestler Nikita Allanov. The second link, Midwest Independent Pro Wrestling Discussion, is a longrunning messageboard which has been active for over seven years and, while is usally unconventional, I used to support the introductory statement concerning his notority among wrestling fans in the Cincinatti-area. I believe I am allowed to improve the article anyway I'm able and, if others feel the sources are useless, then they are free to take that into consideration when they vote. The other references were used both to support statments already made in the article (such as notable opponents, title changes and events) as well as to support the claim that New Era Wrestling itself is a notable independent promotion as it is covered by website's such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Meltzer_f6dc.html" title="Dave Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a>'s Wrestling Observer.</dd>
<dd>Also, I've reverted RobJ's prior changes due to portions of text which were removed from the article and placed an unreferenced tag due to his concerns. As I have explained my reasons for adding those specific references, I don't think unwarrented accusations are nessessary. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 22:53, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>New Era Wrestling is not a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> promotion. The coverage in the Wrestling Observer is as follows:</dd>

<li>That specific link is meant to cite <i>the opponent and event</i> as well as the promotion's notability.

As opposed to a one time appearance, the promotion is listed frequently on WrestlingObserver.com as well as other mainstream wrestling websites such as Lords of Wrestling and PWTorch.

<p>I'm not sure what kind of sources you expect for an independent wrestler, however I've already stated my reasons for adding those specific sources. I have also established that NEW is a notable promotion (one of its champions being <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shane_Douglas_49ee.html" title="Shane Douglas">Shane Douglas</a>), second that he has face at least one notable opponent Nikita Allanov (whose notability I have established despite its nomination for deletion) and third that he has held championship titles in NEW and at least two other independent promotions (Intense Wrestling Incorporated being a feature story on Everybody's News as well as <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Snow_b97c.html" title="Al Snow">Al Snow</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jack_beab.html" title="New Jack">New Jack</a> having previously competed in the promotion). Also the "geocites website" is an <b>archive page</b> of Allanov's official website <a href="http://www.nikitaallanov.vze.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nikitaallanov.vze.com/" rel="nofollow">NikitaAllanov.vze.com</a>. The messageboard, a current and longrunning messageboard which specifically coveres in the Mid-West independent scene, shows Nevada is known in <i>at least</i> to wrestling fans in the area. Not the best of sources, but it does support that he is notable beyond the World Wrestling Coalition. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 02:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Far stronger arguments favoured the deletion of this article. Articles based on a series of news reports about a single incident or short series of incidents are far from encyclopedic content, though they are well covered at Wikinews. This does not strike me as an incident of <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, simply an example of a non-notable business. It exists and was in the news for a bit but as argued below, that does not make the company notable. There may be room for a discussion of the effect of people being paid to edit articles at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Wikipedia_565c.html" title="Criticisms of Wikipedia">Criticisms of Wikipedia</a> but not for detailed coverage of a single such business. There is an urge to create articles when an incident receives a large amount of press attention but I think the important distinction between an encyclopedia and a newspaper needs to be born in mind- lets leave the reporting to Wikinews. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 23:06, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Deleted by first afd, second was no consensus. I speedied it as G4 yesterday, my bad, I didn't notice the second AfD. Sources: an article about paid editing of Wikipedia, which has a bit about Gregory Kohs (article deleted and endorsed), slightly less about MyWikiBiz, and some about Microsoft. Second source: a press release. Not independent. Third and fourth sources: the Wikipedia Signpost, completely inappropriate self-reference. Kohs is not notable, by consensus, he is, however, banned. Quite why his one-man company which is never known to have traded more than a tiny amount, would be considered notable, is beyond me. Navel gazing, I guess. List it in project space in a long term abuse page, I suppose, but the company itself, if it still exists as a separate entity (debatable) is not in any way notable other than internally. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 06:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Well, somebody did, but both articles focus on the matter of Wikipedia versus paid writers with COI and mention the subject of <i>this</i> article only as a matter of context and introduction. Greg is ‘sure their lawyers would love to hear them described as trivial’, so: both sources’ coverage with respect to the subject of the article is trivial in the sense of our definition of notability.

To get it out of the way, <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> is an irrelevant argument, it refers to project pages and general mass hysteria over vandal activity.

Even if a second source <i>were</i> found, I would still call this non-notable since anything related to the internet tends to inflate the number of sources, not due to notability, but due to easier access for journalists.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think this is very much a case of COI -- it's COI of the editors on WP against a serious attempt to undermine the basis of WP. I share this COI--I think that the commercial writing of articles is a disgrace, and engaging in it appropriate for a community ban. But it's real, it's sourced, and it's notable. The prevention against such inherent COI is to recognize it and keep the articles that the COI would encourage us to delete. If we want to give ammunition to the enemies of WP, then deleting this article would be a good way to do it. It almost matches the attempt to deny the N of the Essjay controversy. .<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:26, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No apology needed. When the Essjay article first appeared my opinion on the deletion discussion went from <i>neutral, but strongly endorse letting the discussion run its course</i> to <i>this has become international news in dozens of separate outlets - if Essjay were unrelated to Wikipedia we'd have an unambiguous keep</i>. This time I'm an involved party - or at least Mr. Kohs insists I am - because I stepped forward and investigated when his sockpuppet demanded an investigation. My take on this page is that he's a public relations professional who's had more than half a year to astroturf this story and doesn't have much to show for it, but I'll restrict my participation at this discussion to comments. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 01:46, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll list them again: there are three reliable sources in the article, from the Associated Press, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and Die Welt.

<ul>
<li>FWIW, the Chronicle of Higher Education appears to be a news aggregation blog, which takes news stories from various sources, writes a summary, and links to the original article. In this case (<a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/1831/wikipedia-blocks-a-pay-for-play-scheme" class="external autonumber" title="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/1831/wikipedia-blocks-a-pay-for-play-scheme" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>), the Associated Press story is explicitly credited and linked to, and much or all of the summary is based on it. I'm not sure it would be fair to call this an independent report. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 05:45, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Strong Keep</b>. I wrote this article -- in part because New Mexico was the only state with none of its malls listed on Wikipedia, and in part because I felt the mall was notable. I haven't been able to find any <i>solid</i> sources that prove the mall's the biggest in the state (strangely, their website makes no mention of it), but really, could so many independent sources <i>all</i> be wrong?

<li><b>Delete</b> The apparent justification for this article is the New Mexico has no other article about any of its malls. This has also been phrased more conventionally as "The biggest mall in New Mexico." Further, "When Cottonwood Mall opened in 1996, it was the first mall to open in Albuquerque in thirty years.[4][5] To this day, it is the newest shopping mall in New Mexico." Does the newest mall in a state automatically get an article?

<dd><b>Comment</b> The fact that New Mexico has no other mall articles <i>was</i> a justification, but it wasn't my <i>only</i> justification. I figured that it's notable since it's the biggest in New Mexico, AND the newest in the same, AND home to a co-op bookstore, AND on land once owned by King Philip IV. I've noticed that importance is quite often questioned with the mall articles, but being the inclusionist that I am, I'll give <i>most</i> malls the benefit of the doubt, this one being no exception. Maybe it's not important to the whole <i>world</i>, but one could argue the point that not even <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a> is necessarily important to the whole damn world. I don't create pages on Wikipedia just to create them (at least, not anymore) -- I actually put considerable thought into a subject's notability first. I'm aware that notability is, at least sometimes, a matter of opinion; however, I hope that by stating my own opinion, that others may see my side of the issue. They may still vote for deletion, but if they do, <i>c'est la vie</i>. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenPoundHammer_e96f.html" title="User:TenPoundHammer">TenPoundHammer</a> 02:45, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> If it is correct that the whole state was included in the land grant, that argument doesn't help, and not all coop bookstores are N, though in an ideal world they would be. And, there were 29 other malls joining in the court case mentioned above. I am certainly not implying the article wasn't created in a reasonable way. for the largest mall in a state to have an article is not absurdly wrong, though I don't think it's right. I too will go by the consensus. (By the way, any info. on relative amounts of business in the various malls in the state? That might help show N more than square footage). <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know where people are getting the idea that this is a "super mall" or a "superregional mall" – where did that standard come from? This is only an average sized mall, which can be verified by perusing through entries in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shopping_malls_in_the_United_States_42bf.html" title="List of shopping malls in the United States">List of shopping malls in the United States</a>. I guess the real question is, "Is a mall notable just because it’s a mall?" That same list has many entries with less content and notability, but they're not up for deletion. Has this question come up before? I haven't seen any Wikipedia policies or guidelines on the subject of mall notability. Also, several of the people who have said "Keep" insist that the information is all verifiable - that has never been questioned. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJaksmata_9204.html" title="User:Jaksmata">Jaksmata</a> 04:14, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Just to add, for whatever it's worth, that the third nomination was terminated prematurely and in a disputed manner. I don't believe this article has <b>ever</b> had a valid AfD discussion, and now, because some people see this as a "fourth" nomination and oppose it on that basis, this one is tainted as well. Everything about this article, or associated with it, is now inherently corrupted and I don't think there is any way to fix it. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 14:09, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Huge amount of references backing up the statements, so the nominator will need to point out some examples as to why <i>everything</i> is SYNT or OR. If there is <i>some</i> SYNT or OR, we solve that by editing the article, not deleting it. Let's face it, the term "Israeli apartheid" is common, whether we like it or not, and whether we agree with the term or not. A quick search from my country of Norway produced <a href="http://www.dagsavisen.no/utenriks/article2605541.ece" class="external text" title="http://www.dagsavisen.no/utenriks/article2605541.ece" rel="nofollow">this article</a> (UN accuses Israel of Apartheid) from a mainstream newspaper (albeit one with a pro-Labor Party point of view). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:04, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Sjakkalle in this, its fourth nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b> I find allegations of bad faith on my part rather disgusting considering I have never been involved with this article in any way before.

<li><b>Delete</b> but not per the above nom; rather per all of the many comments I have made on the talk page over the past year. I hesitate to participate in this AfD because it is clear that the <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">snow</a> is falling and, as I mentioned in a comment above, I think this process is inherently corrupted by the three "previous" AfD's that should not "count" because they were bogus. I also think it's interesting that of the "four" AfD's, none have been nominated by anyone who was really involved with the article, except for the first one which was basically a forgery by the person who started the article, using a sockpuppet. On the other hand, there is no way around the fact that I have said on the talk page, about 50 times, that the article should not exist, so in order to be consistent I must, again, support deletion. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 03:33, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. I find the SYNT/OR arguments compelling because of the wide variety of contexts in which "apartheid" is used within this article. While some of the sections feature well-sourced material, there is no evidence of any sources implying any <i>connection</i> or <i>equivalency</i> between many of the various sections. Setting up this equivalency is therefore novel synthesis. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 13:34, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete, sandbox the salvageable material and merge to many articles</b> What happened was this.
<ol>
<li>Now banned User:Homeontherange and other leftist editors created <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>, a page that was reliant on a neologism to dissect an issue that was already well covered elsewhere. The article seems in my mind to be a violation of WP:POINT, inherently POV and an unhelpful propagandistic use of the term apartheid. Though the editors have done their best to neutralise it since.</li>
<li>Naturally, Israeli focussed editors were unimpressed, and scoured the net for other uses of the term in relation to other nations. And found them. Hence the creation of Allegations of apartheid by Israeli focussed editors, which placed Israel merely as one of many nations attacked by the pejorative. One of the countries most linked to the term was Cuba due to its tourist policies of the 90s (exclusive hotels etc), which also happened to be one of Homeontherange's preferred nations.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_5243.html" title="Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba">Allegations of tourist apartheid in Cuba</a> was carefully created by Israeli focussed editors, essentially as response to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>. This naturally ticked off unrelated Cuba focussed editors who believed that it was a violation of WP:POINT and the material should be merged into <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Cuba_c390.html" title="Tourism in Cuba">Tourism in Cuba</a>. A merge resisted by the Israeli editors for reasons that are best explained in point 2.</li>
<li>Seeing as it had seemingly become acceptable standard practice to throw accusations around on article mainspace providing they were sourced, Cuba related editors went over to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America_9a2f.html" title="Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America">Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America</a> and added a whole load of verifiable accusations to that page. And the knock on effect was that U.S. focussed editors have repeatedly demanded its removal in turn. Which they shouldn't be able to do because the standard had already been set by previous articles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, either we end this nonsense and merge <i>all</i> of these articles into neutrally titled pages that cover these issues in an encyclopedic manner, or we keep all of them them. At present I vote for unilateral disarmament, and call for editors to get back to creating good articles of the kind one would expect to find in an encyclopedia. Here are the related articles/forks.

<li>No, the article is <b>not</b> referenced. It merely contains a list of 14 New York Times articles, unavailable to most readers, and with no link between statements in the text and the relevant articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although inline citations are a much preferred referencing format, they are not the only method of referencing. This article is not just referenced but referenced with a highly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> (which I have reformatted for higher transparency). I agree to some extent with the nominator, in that a reference section at the end of an article really doesn't adequately show where each piece of information comes from, but in the absence of expressly changing policy, there is no deletion issue here.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 12:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>But although you have given the URLs (thank you), the articles still cost $4.95 each, and there is no indication which relates to what statement. So to check and follow up something in the article could cost $70! This is simply not acceptable, and without accessible references the article is not worth keeping. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 12:53, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. That argument has no traction whatever and is not reflected in any policy that I know of. Books are less accessible than newspaper sources and are not deprecated because article readers must either purchase the book or visit a library (and not incidentally, any reputable library, at least in the U.S., has the New York Times on file). By your argument, the best sources are online and free only. We go by reliability of sources, not access of readers to those sources. I’m not saying that being easily accessible isn’t a good thing for sources, just that it can’t form an essential consideration for citation because many of the best sources are not online. Once again though, I agree with you that references are much better when they are systematically placed so any reader can see just which statements come from which references. That is not a topic that can be given its due discussion here.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 19:37, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Fuhghettaboutit; the citations are from a reliable source and nothing to suggest inaccuracy or POV.

<dd>I'd be happy to discuss inline citations if people will do the simple courtesy of providing constructive feedback about what might be disputed or where specifically they are needed. I've already asked for that on the talk page and would love to discuss improvements to the article there. So far the effort has been directed more toward undermining and even, as here, deleting the content. It should not be surprising that this is not a productive approach. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I did glance at the talk page and didn't happen to catch a mention of in-line citations there, but I'll now admit my look was a very quick one so I might well have missed it. Apologies, if so. In any event, while I cannot speak for other editors, for my part, I'm not claiming that <i>anything</i> is "disputed", necessarily. It simply is very helpful for the reader to be able to tie which statement of fact in the article is tied to which source. As I indicated, I don't think the article needs to be deleted, regardless, but I do feel that if it is not too much trouble for you, in-line citations would substantially improve the article's quality. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 19:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You probably didn't miss it, but I think you were looking for something different than I meant. I'm referring to the discussion about references, where I asked what if anything was being disputed (constructive feedback on that topic, rather than inline citations per se, is the relevant antecedent in my comment above). I'm sure improvement is possible - I'd actually value having additional reliable sources much more highly than inlining the ones already there - but it's not like I'm pushing for featured article status, and it's certainly not seriously deficient in the way the "unreferenced" mantra suggests. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> References are provided. It is a great help if the creator of an article uses inline references to show which reference (and on what page) is the source for what part of the article, but lack of inline references per se is not a valid reason for deletion. Complaints about the cost of NY Times archives are completely invalid as a basis for deletion. I could just as well complain about the expense of travelling tyo some other city to consult an actual out of print print book, or the cost of buying a book. There is more to the world of scholarship than free online sources. Many public libraries allow full text access to the NY Times and other periodicals through Proquest. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The question how how references should best be expressed in a matter for the article talk page, not here. WP has 3 current systems for citations, and all of them are acceptable--even though some (i.e. DGG) think they each have major disadvantages. The only fixed rule is to have them consistent within an article. Changing from one form to another is probably almost never worth the trouble--readers of WP will adjust to each of them. The rest of the world uses an even greater variety. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:23, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And Noam Chomsky is cited for more enlightenment. There's a well-respected moral force if ever there was one. If the editors in Fidel's propaganda department want to take a break from their dirty work, they can create articles on allegations against the United States from Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Imperial Japan and (this should be a fun one) Idi Amin's Uganda. These would meet the editors' standards of reliability just as well as the ones they're using for this article.</dd>

<li><b>Response</b> Sarcasm is a singularly appropriate response to editors who have created a travesty of an article by doing the exact opposite of what Wikipedia was created for. Instead of trying to inform people with an honest attempt at the truth, editors have taken charges from some of the worst beasts on the planet to lie about the enemy of those beasts. When you carry water for criminal dictators with blood on their hands, sarcasm should be the mildest of the responses you should receive.

<ul>
<li><b>Final response on this topic</b> It depresses me when propaganda is pushed out into a Wikipedia article, and it alarms me when that is treated as if it were some sort of minor mishap. You may see something a little inappropriate in this kind of article. I see one of the worst possible things someone could do on Wikipedia: promote lies that end up promoting killers, which is what we all should know several of these regimes are. Some people can't get on with their lives because they've been killed. The regimes that kill them have a history of propagandizing in order to turn around charges of terrorism and human-rights violations on the countries properly accusing them. So there are more reasons for being responsible on Wikipedia than just avoiding libel or copyright suits. And I've been focusing on the article more than the editors.

<li>Then I get the <b>last word</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a>, I voted to <b>keep</b> this article. What are you insinuating? That I am pushing propoganda? I resent statements such as "Sorry to trouble you with the troubles of the world." I consider myself quite the cosmopolitan, not that it's your business. Furthermore, you speak with an arrogancy that implies you know what is lies and what isn't. There are reputable sources listed. I think this article merely suggests that the U.S. is not preacher-sheets-innocent, and to claim otherwise is naive. The article was appropriately changed to "Allegations of ____". There can be statements in favor and those opposed. We can have a civil discourse on the topic! The latin american section topics in particular are not merely out-from-left-field conspiracy theories. Shouldn't we strive not to, what's the phrase, whitewash our history? <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakerforever_a413.html" title="User:Jakerforever">Jakerforever</a> 01:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Move content, remove the article itself</b> For one I'm suprised there is no mention of the IRA here, but then the USA never acknowledged their terrorist behaviour (900+ UK military deaths aside) but that's just my POV and I only say it to demonstrate a potential problem with this article: I do worry if some <b>delete</b> votes are coming as a result of pro USA feelings and some <b>keep</b> votes coming from anti-american forgien policy people, I know this is a dangerous thing to say (and am prepared to take the flak for it, and im <b>not</b> personally attacking anyone let me make it clear) but this article, as it stands, is a fueling station for a giant tanker of wiki-conflict in its current form. I think it needs to be handled differently, why would these points not be in articles about the relations between the USA and the country in question? The inclusion of this and this incident over this and this is open to POV as well (not just the wiki users, but everyones) In my (humble) opinion, this current format is open to much to dammage. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 20:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> without such articles, WP will not be taken seriously outside of the United States. An honest discussion of the way one country is viewed by those elsewhere is appropriate, with respect to any country at all. They're difficult to write, but that is no reason to omit them. I agree with Noroton that the article is a POV disgrace at present.

The U.S. Federal Government deserves no more special treatment than any other. In short: I'm not a fascist, but I don't want the Fascism article to be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> - In any case the title is wrong (allegations issue mentioned earlier). Just because there have been many people who have accused the US doesn't mean much really, Goebbels said: "If you repeat it many times, people will believe it" - not to mention the criticism against Wikipedia that "if you can get enough people, you can change the truth" - I mean, what the hell is this "Pentagon damaged not by Flight 77 but a cruise missile" doing in there? Are we going to have a serious encyclopedia or invite people to dump all sorts of conspiracy theories? Quotes by Hugo Chavez, Noam Chomsky? Are these people reliable, neutral or represent scholarly mainstream academic opinion? Most of the stuff listed in the article, serious ones like Gladio et al, already have their own articles and can be covered in other articles like Foreign relations of the US or <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> or etc. Not to mention policy problems per undue weight, <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> and most common name. Labelling of most of the content listed as "state terrorism" does not reflect academic concensus: as such undue weight definitely applies. I <i>know</i> what Gladio was, however, on hindsight most historians do not label it as "state terrorism". Even though this might not be the case for most of the contributors of the article, I do think that the article is showing some signs of Anti-Americanism. And the argument that "some people consider as state terrorism" is not a valid argument either: it doesn't matter if half the world believes it. Heck, most people in the world do not believe in Evolution, but the article is still there.

<p><b>A CHALLENGE: <i>A call to put your effort where your mouths are</i></b> A significant number of the "Keep" proponents here say they don't want to delete the article because the subject deserves mention in the encyclopedia, but they say they think cleaning it of unreliable material is necessary. Despite the best intentions voiced in this discussion, the fact is, it's the FIFTH discussion on deleting this article and after the past four, the article is a mendacious mess and a perversion of Wikipedia principles. In the past (and currently in the case of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive.html" title="List of people who went to heaven alive">List of people who went to heaven alive</a>) I and other editors have achieved consensus in keeping articles by working on them to make them better. In the case of this article, doing so would probably involve facing down a number of editors who have made the article what it is today.</p>
<p>So here's a challenge. All of you who said the article should be changed, both among the "Keep" group and the "Delete" group, will you join me, for the seven days following the close of this discussion (if the conclusion is "Keep", and that's the way it looks like it's going for the fifth time) in doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support removing as <i>unreliable</i> sources any regimes commonly recognized by international organizations as <i>significant</i> human rights abusers. (parts in italics just added in. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:54, 1 April 2007 (UTC) )</li>
<li>Reviewing with an open mind any deletions or additions to the article and participating in a good number of discussions on the talk page that concern questions of fairness and reliable sourcing (relying your own best judgment, sense of fairness and what you believe to be Wikipedia rules in each case).</li>
<li>Removing material that you agree isn't reliably sourced after three days of having it identified with a <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag. I know it's a relatively short period, but editors interested in the article should have it on their watch list and should know the article is under the gun by now, and I'm not going to ask for a pledge of more than a week of attention, so we should act relatively fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll help out by doing some research, questioning some parts of the article and suggesting rewrites and additions to other parts. Obviously, anybody else who wants to should be working on the article as well. I won't be voicing my disgust in any discussions on the talk page and I'll work toward consensus and a neutral article. If I can do that, can any of you pledge to help, or are your opinions about keeping this malformed article (even if you don't mean them that way), simply supporting a biased article?</p>
<p>A list of those who said, essentially, "Keep" but reform the article in some way (and <b>I'm asking for every other contributor to this discussion to make the same pledge</b>):</p>

<li>Wandalstouring</li>
<li>Edison</li>
<li>DGG</li>
<li>NDCompuGeek</li>
<li>Vert et Noir</li>
</ul>
<p>If five of these nine editors (and I'll be adding more to the list as others join the discussion and make the same point) will tell me they'll help to improve it and will participate in helping to form a consensus if there's a dispute, then I'll change my vote to "Keep" and help work on the article for a week after the discussion is closed. If, after attempting to improve the article, it is <b>again</b> overrun within months by egregious non-NPOV and bad-sourcing edits and yet again becomes a mess, I'll be nominating it for deletion discussion Number 6 and contacting each and every optimist on the list above to solicit support for removal. And we'd all have a convincing argument for removal at that point. Is this proposal fair? Is it not in the best traditions of Wikipedia? Is it not an attempt to come to consensus after five deletion nominations? Is it, on its face at least, not a good-faith effort to do the right thing? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:31, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"The New York Times in July published a long interview with Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban-born, CIA-trained terrorist who had been convicted of bombing a Cuban airliner off Barbados in 1976 and had served nine years in a Venezuelan prison. In the interview he admitted to more recent attacks against Cuban property, claiming to have organized the 1997 bombings in Havana hotels and to have had his activities financed by the late Jorge Mas Canosa and other leaders of the Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF). The Interior Ministry announced that three Guatemalans and two Salvadoreans were to be put on trial for their part in the bombings. Described as mercenaries, they admitted to working under the direction of Carriles and Arnaldo Monzón Plasencia, also of CANF." (Encyclopedia Britannica)</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>The main difference is that the wiki article is framed as allegations from the Cuban government, due to the theme of the page being "allegations of..". These particular "allegations" are borne out by numerous verifiable sources, (CNN, NYTimes, BBC etc) admitted to by the perpetrators many times and regarded as fact by commentators and experts on the matter. So its difficult to see any problems there, if Britannica can report the claims, than so can we. Some of the later material in the article I'm not keen on, I don't think the quotes are necessary, nor the US's own definition. But other than that, notable allegations have been made in verifiable sources. That's pretty much the end of the issue. -- <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen"><font color="Firebrick">Z</font><font color="darkgreen">leitzen</font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/l/e/User_talk%7EZleitzen_2592.html" title="User talk:Zleitzen"><font color="Orange">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 14:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> – The very title gives away the inherent POV inasmuch as it <i>asserts</i> “guilty as charged”. If there was even a pretence of NPOV, the title would (still, as <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> points out) be prefixed by “Allegations of ...” I doubt many of those voting “Keep” (and not “Keep and rename”) have not bothered reading the articles on “<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>” and “<a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a>” or they’d know that there is no such thing as a broadly acceptable definition of what constitutes “state terrorism” — much less one accepted in international law — against which any party could be held accountable. Moreover, if there were, the target would necessarily have to be against governmental <i>regimes</i>, not the nations themselves. NPOV would then, at the very least, require a title like “Allegations of state terrorism by the government of the United States of America” (or possibly a particular administration of that government).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I’m afraid, though, that a simple article renaming won’t restore this article to credibility. The reason is because it must rely almost exclusively on biased sources – and biased to a single “side’s” perspective. Frankly, I’m surprised that anyone has voted “Keep” following <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern’s</a> perfect summary of the reason for his vote to “Delete - not because the alleged crimes, transgressions, and ethical lapses should be hidden or buried, but because the term ‘state terrorism’ is so problematic conceptually and burdened by shrill polemics. Ironically, this article actually discredits the POV it is trying to promote.” Since “state terrorism” has no useful, broadly acceptable definition, it can only be employed as a pejorative. Furthermore, without such a definition, there is no basis upon which to include or exclude any particular accusation. Therefore, this article can only stand to serve as a collection of allegations against which there may be no objective defense — which is "useful" only to those that have an agenda. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 00:28, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> (sorry for the long essay to follow) Thus far, most of the keeps are because (1) the article is well sourced, (2) US activities are occasionally called state terrorism, and (3) it is a useful collection of information. While these are all fine reasons to support an article, none are going to convince someone not to vote delete. Most of the delete votes are due to OR or NPOV. Baristarim's vote includes a mention of how this isn't "mainstream academic opinion." The OR issue is something that the article does need to get rid of, and it does hover on SYN as is. But to me, the NPOV/undue weight argument needs to be turned on its head, in this case. The people talking about US state terrorism are not going away, they are important in political affairs throughout the world. This article is about their platform. From <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> to the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_tax.html" title="Flat tax">flat tax</a>, articles in WP about non-mainstream ideas are capable of addressing the ideas in a serious way which is upfront about the relative discredit the ideas have in the mainstream, but that there is sizable group who share the idea. So to me, the article should embrace its NPOV-hood in a way that says, while this topic involves a certain POV, it is not mainstream POV in the US and much of the western academic world. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 04:36, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To address what I'm suggesting for this article, let me address Leifern's comment. Liefern is, in my mind, fundamentally correct. But, in this case, the polemic value of the term 'state terrorism' is part of the article. To me, this article is a collection of the scholarship of people like Blum, Chomsky, and Gareau, who use charged language in their discussions of US activities. This is also true of the charged language by leaders such as Castro and Chavez, who use their opposition to America as part of their platform. In both cases, the charged language is linked to how the events are organized. So to discuss their ideas, one must admit the application of non-neutral language on a certain set of events in US foreign policy. In the individual events, there are a great many people interested in understanding what role the US had and why they did what they did. But in collecting these events, the goal is to show a pattern of behavior that establishes the US as a pariah in the minds of some audience (voters in Columbia, readers in Cambridge, etc). So to me, the first task is to rewrite the lead to express that the accusations of state terrorism against the US is not a case of people trying to uncover the truth (this is very important in the individual events), but rather a certain way of collecting a certain set of US activities for certain purposes. Then the article becomes an outline of the events that are collected in this way, who is including them as instances of US state terrorism, and why they are included.</dd>

<dd>Norton, I'm thinking the first step in improving the article is to get some consensus on the direction (my idea is certainly not the only one) of the article on the talk page, and to start a {{todo}} list there.

<dd>If I'm Solomon, I have to have the sword ready. Norton is right when he says that he'd be ready to wade into the article, to bring it to NPOV, but it can't be done alone, and it will take some work (its a swordfight, not just a case of a baby cut in half). Certainly Solomon wouldn't have waited until the fifth nomination to act.

<dd><a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a>, your rationale above is a great outline of the reasons for having articles on "state terrorism" or "terrorism" or on American foreign policy issues — which no one has a problem with. The problem with this sort of article is twofold: First, it can only be built up from singularly biased sources (and few, if any, "neutral" ones), so it must be an <i>inherently POV</i> article; and second, since there is no consensus definition of what constitutes "state terrorism", and so the article's only purpose can be to list everything anybody who dislikes the "defendent" has ever used the term against the target. Moreover, this is true whether you have a list of accusations of "state terrorism" by the US, USSR, Cuba, Iran, Great Britain, Liechtenstein or whatever. This is true of accusations of "terrorism" as well, and currently usage of the term is deprecated as <i>inherently POV</i>; more neutral, but accurate terms (like "rebel", "insurgent") are employed instead — or one might cite a declaration by an entity to state that "So-and-so has declared that XYZ is a terrorist organization." Yet "terrorist" has a "firmer" definition than "state terrorism". Certainly if we consider a country to be a "living person", this would never get past <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 22:41, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What sets this article apart from something like the post-WWII discussion of interventionist cases in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_non-interventionism_e7d7.html" title="United States non-interventionism">United States non-interventionism</a> is the use of the term terrorism. The US State Department Counterterrorism Office <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> publishes lists of acts that it calls terrorism <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2003/33773.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2003/33773.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. We can thus feel pretty secure calling those events <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_attacks.html" title="Terrorist attacks">terrorist attacks</a>, and have articles about those, even though many would not call them terrorist attacks. My idea of this article is to show what has been said about US acts of terrorism. This is encyclopedic in my mind because some important people (from Chomsky to Chavez) have used this as a major part of their platform (be it to get elected or to get their message out). If <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot</a> ran for US president again, imagine how long and crazy the article on flat tax would be. I think of this kinda in those terms, this is a major platform for selling a personality. It can be fixed, but it needn't be deleted. Sorry if I've repeated myself, let me know exactly where we aren't connecting, and I'll try again, if you like.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm against deletions of any topic of substance, even if the article, like this one, is blatantly agenda-driven. I'm also a realist--no amount of clean-up will keep out the agenda bias, which will be re-worded and put back in. You need look no farther than most of the "reasoning" above for keeping. The comments about polemics and charged language just above are dead-on. Nevertheless, a cyberspace encyclopedia offers the means of inclusiveness that paper encyclopedias could not: greater detail, greater diversity. I personally find it appalling that articles on any Harry Potter novel have greater depth and quality, so to speak, than articles on <i>Oliver Twist</i>--but there is a place for both. Even without a means of effectively enforcing "encyclopedic tone", I still vote to keep.--Buckboard 10:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

And besides, some of these sources are the most credible sources possible under the circumstances. We can't rely on US gov't documents, because they would (of course) deny any terrorist action.

<li><b>Keep</b> Even if the article is determined to harbour POV, no matter to what extent, there is far too much raw information in there to sensibly advocate a complete scrap-and-start-again job. Far more sensible to work with the considerable resource already present, and for those who take issue to amend as they see fit. Surely it could be argued that any article at all in the State Terrorism series is guilty of POV to some extent? You've got to be sensible and realise that the judgment of what constitutes POV may have to relent in the slightest way as it is impossible to convey such a topic without managing to offend someone in one way or another. If a person can get shirty over a controversial topic, they shouldn't bother reading it. Objectivity can only go so far, and to ruthlessly edit this down or scrap it entirely is a pointless exercise because to maintain complete rigid objectivity would impoverise such a contentious, controversy-laden topic. It is by its very nature an instigator of debate, therefore the article must go to some lengths to explain why that is the case. Hence if this is not explained in the article, it is an article of poverty. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Geography_Elite_24d7.html" title="User:The Geography Elite">The Geography Elite</a> 07:22, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I've asked people if they'd be willing to at least support eliminating the bias and hardly anyone has taken me up on the offer. For all the editors like The Geography Elite who suggest keeping and working on it, who will actually lift a finger to do it or support those who do when the inevitable partisans push back? Does anyone else smell rank hypocrisy here? I'm not saying The Geography Elite or any other particular editor is a hypocrite, just that that smell is pretty thick around here. I guess I must be paranoid. Everyone here has the goal of informing Wikipedia's readers with an unbiased article, right? And, ah, how come there's more interest in preserving than reforming the article from people who admit it's a mess? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 14:12, 5 April 2007 (UTC) (self edit <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 14:18, 5 April 2007 (UTC))

<li>Given that your opening gambit was "Delete this crap", followed by various comments describing the universally reported claims as "the product of propaganda departments in dictatorships" and other such hyperbolic rhetoric, then it is hardly surprising that editors do not want to take up your offer of collaboration. The only hypocrisy I see stems from the demands here to delete <i>this</i> article about the U.S., but not the other numerous articles that carry similar claims against other nations sourced to the U.S. government. Virtually nothing you have argued above has any credibility at all and I doubt anyone got past your first couple of lines.

<p>This appears to be a POV fork of <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesarean_section.html" title="Cesarean section">cesarean section</a>, anging the drum on behalf of the natural birth people (who are probably right about a lot of it, by the way, but that's immaterial). It contains some speculation, and if pruned will be not significantly bigger than the section already in <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesarean_section.html" title="Cesarean section">cesarean section</a> (under Elective). Some of the text here is generic to cesarean sections anyway (infant mortality rates, for example). Might need merging or smerging back, but probably redundant. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:33, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> as POV fork. If not merged, it should definitely be moved to <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elective_caesarean_section.html" title="Elective caesarean section">Elective caesarean section</a>. The term "caesarean delivery on maternal request" does not appear at all in Google Books, and is outnumbered in Google Scholar by "elective caesarean section" by approximately 6,000 to 3. The use of such an extreme minority term for the title of the article is suggestive as to its POV-fork nature. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 17:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.<a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesarean_delivery_on_maternal_request.html" title="Cesarean delivery on maternal request">Cesarean delivery on maternal request</a> is specific medical term for a more and more recognized and requested indication for a <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesarean_section.html" title="Cesarean section">Cesarean section</a>. As stated, a possibly sizable percentage of women undergo CDMR. The article provides the reference support, including the fact that the <a href="../../../n/i/h/NIH_0352.html" title="NIH">NIH</a> brought together a consensus conference to wrestle with the matter. It is, of course, an elective CS, and people usually refer to it as such, but: not all elective sections are done on maternal request. The discussion in the <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesarean_section.html" title="Cesarean section">Cesarean section</a> article is witten with the distinct view that doctors like to do unnecessary CS for convenience and money. That may be the case in some situations, but that section needs more references and less POV, - further, this has really little to do with CDMR. So, <i>Cesarean delivery on maternal request</i> is a distinct medical term that actually avoids POV, makes it clear that this "elective CS" is not done because the physician or somebody else has an interest in it, and can be kept clear of the more murky <i>elective CS</i> discussion. Alternatively, it could be considered to move the "Elective CS" section out of the CS article, making it its own lemma, and within have two sections: CDMR and "elective CS for other reasons".<a href="../../../e/k/e/User%7EEkem_3ee4.html" title="User:Ekem">Ekem</a> 20:30, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - the article says "Caesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR)" is "also called an elective caesarean section." If it's really a "distinct medical term," the article should say so and point to reliable sources that demonstrate what the difference is. Based on a quick Google search using both terms, I can't find anyone who distinguishes between them. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 23:20, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly <b>Rename</b>. I see Ekem's point - many people point the fingers only at doctors, not at parents. I would however suggest this be changed to "parental request", since some anecdotal testimony implies that CDMRs may occur because the father pressures the mother to go through major, possibly life-threatening surgery so his pleasure is not theoretically infinitesimally reduced. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 22:55, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don;t think its really equiv. to "Elective Caesarian section, which I think includes ones possibly preferable for medical reasons but not absolutely required.

<p>As it says "little research has been conducted on erinacines to date". Most of it, apparently, by the author of this article, who has no other contributions. Some references, to be sure, but Google comes up close to blank and I don't see enough critical secondary review of this. Maybe it just needs aggressive cleanup, I don't know. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:54, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep as currently reduced.</b> I do not think he is necessarily a notable academic. He is about to be an associate professor, but not at a research university, and associate professors are not all notable--and not all of his work appears to be scholarly. But I think he is notable as an author and an activist. The number of books are sufficient, and none of them are self published. If he were not an academic, but merely a non-academic writer who had published as much and received as good reviews, he would be included without question. But I understand the feeling that it could be deleted. I and others have already cut down much of the self-praise and puffery that contaminated the article. There is, as noticed, a good way to go. I have just reduced the article to an appropriate size, somewhat longer than a stub, and citing each item only once. COI means the material should not necessarily be taken at face value, of course, and further editing should be done. I think it has now been down, and I urge those who saw it before to revisit it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:15, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow, it looks a lot better when I first saw it on COI/N. I still can't, however, vote keep. I remain unconvinced that the subject is currently notable and it still reads like a resume: the section titled "Biography" largely contains his various academic achievements and professorships; most of the information (as I understand), including the picture, is self-published on his website and the Gendercide website; in general, the subject is not noted, i.e. notable, but is instead self-published. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User_talk%7EIamunknown_bbeb.html" title="User talk:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 18:09, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jehochman, you and anyone else may key those book titles into an Amazon search engine, and come up with the relevant ISBN data and related information.

<p>Orphaned page for a year now.

<li><b>keep.</b> the material in the article shows it notable in New York State history. Naturally, not much will be found on line, but one totally reliable printed source is present.</li>
</ul>
<p>As March and Iridescenti observed, there should be more. Our reluctance to use non on-line sources is incompatible with producing a general encyclopedia.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The topic of this article is actually central to the formation of several New York State communities, and has roots extending throughout the foundation of the US. I have cleaned up the article, added several references and added several statements supporting the relevance of this article. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 16:43, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> But surely all drinking games are in the category of 'Here is something that someone just made up' as I have already stated, by there very nature they are made up by drunken people in pubs. You have to consider the value of the whole drinking game article. If you are going to attempt to document or describe a phenomena such as Pub sports you kind of have to accept that they are just made up by people and played. Now that seems to contravene <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> because it fits closely to the description but the sense of that article is more like 'Don't just include stuff that you have just made up to get it on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'. My guess is this game was made up and people played it long before Wikipedia or even the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_wide_web.html" title="World wide web">world wide web</a> existed and thus is a justifiable. --Montpelier42 19:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete this particular one</b> and keep any that are of actual notability -- and most of the ones that are, will have become so from their adaptation to other environs. I regret the characterization as being necessarily played or invented by the inebriated. Some of these very games will be played better by the relatively sober.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Montpelier 42 makes the only valid point. Remove all drinking games or accept that they are all developed and spread and modified and improved constantly by people in pubs.

<li>They're notable for the nature of their failure on the contest, kind of a Macedonian, oh, what's that engineering guy from Cal who sang so badly on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">Idol</a>? I've seen unkind references to them and comments about them over the years in places like Italian Vogue (maybe Spanish Cosmo?) and French newspapers--not sure, but European magazines. There might be more information in Macedonian. They're a bit of a European in-joke. I don't know anything about them, really, but they are the sort of small bit of information people should be able to come to an web encyclopedia to find out what folks are talking about, as they are still mentioned years later, when other losers are not remembered. I feel fairly certain that with some digging from a good editor a credible small article could be made up. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 16:22, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> First of all i have added a article from the world leading news site on eurovision about the gorup. and second none of yourr cliams make any sense.

<li><b>Keep</b> They're notable enough, if not for reasons they would like to be noted. Still, Guy's points on the attack portion must be heeded, and this must be removed until and unless there are credible sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> regarding the potential attack-status of the article, I've now cited John Kennedy O'Connor's book in which he makes the (tongue-in-cheek, I believe, given the way in which he talks about a number of other acts) suggestion that the dancing was worked on to the exclusion of the vocals.

<li><b>Keep</b>, while it really should have at least one reliable source to confirm its notability, there are loads of articles like this which are not nominated for deletion, probably because more US users are familiar with them.

Please, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">User:Mackan</a> start nominating "the loads of other articles just like this" if you feel they should be deleted, rather than voting to keep this one just because the others are not put up for deletion. This group should stay, because they do have an awkward sort of notoriety, mostly European, admitedly sad that Guy hasn't heard of them. But if there are articles more deserving of being deleted, please propose them for deletion instead of arguing because they exist other crap should be allowed to exist. Also, Matrix didn't canvas me, exactly who did he/she canvas? I notify folks if I know they are interested in an article, and the science folks have a bulletin board which announces science topics up for deletion. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:41, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and suggest closing</b>. The article is now completely sourced. Notability isn't an issue (producer of widely watch TV show, presenter of two other TV programmes). To the nominator, next time mark the article as {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, leave a message on the talk page and drop a message at a few of the article's main contributors to request sources. If no sources are added within a reasonable time frame (a week or so), then consider an AfD. Creating an AfD first is just extra work when the only complaint is the lack of sources, especially when they were as easy to find as they were for Bentley's article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Most of those articles seem unrelated to the steam tunnels (nor indicate their significance). I'm not worried about verifiability/original research - it's trivial to prove that the tunnels exist and provide steam heating. My concern is that the tunnels are not notable in any way. Why do the UW-Madison steam tunnels deserve a seperate article? Why do they stand out? Looking at the summaries Google provides, the search you linked to doesn't seem to give any articles on the steam tunnels. <b><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikm_d2c0.html" title="User:Mikm"><span style="color: #36393D;">mi</span></a><a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikm_27e1.html" title="User talk:Mikm"><span style="color:#B02B2C">km</span></a></b> 18:48, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really want get into subjective reasons like what I think this topic is important or unique "enough", I mean, that's not what inclusion is supposed to be about. Wikipedia is not paper, we have plenty of space for topics I personally find boring and unremarkable. The question is just whether enough reliable sources exist to write more than a directory-style entry, and that seems to be the case here (<a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/3486.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.wisc.edu/3486.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> if nothing else).

<li><b>Delete</b> I admit the Wikipedia definition of "non-trivial" source is vague, but I'd like to see proof that at least one of these articles is about the steam tunnel system or at least gives some kind of a hefty chunk of information about them. If we've just got articles that say it's just a place where some cyanide was stashed, I doubt it's notable enough, and it should be actually put in the article by someone.

The reference that W.marsh gave at link 14 above is the university's promo website, not an independent source. The first article in the search at link 13 is a news item about an event (cyanide found stored) that happened to be in the tunnels; it doesn't really indicate that the tunnels are themselves notable. I lived in Madison for a half-year without attending the university, and I never noticed them mentioned, let alone featured, in the newspapers or TV news.

I think a list of time-travel films is viable (and I disagree with some of Gwernol's rationale above. (How do we decide what a film is about? A synopsis of the film available either on Wiki or elseswhere covers that. And time travel is easily defined as ... time travel. Easy.) but in this case it really looks like a work-in-progress that got out into the wild prematurely. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:04, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but only if it gets a lot of work done. One, the list is horribly incomplete (and would be extrememly difficult to complete), and the page needs formatting and links. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUseight_439f.html" title="User:Useight">Useight</a> 20:51, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but <b>completely rewrite</b>. Add a couple templates to it which would make clear that the article must be improved. The topic, I think, is viable - but the article as it now stands has all kinds of problems. There is a category for time travel films (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Category%7ETime_travel_films_7493.html" title="Category:Time travel films">over here</a>), so there are plenty of candidates. The list would be usefull if it arranges all time travel films in a special table (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_computer-animated_films.html" title="List of computer-animated films">List of computer-animated films</a> for an example of what I mean) and adds "release date" and "country" fields (so that it would be possible to sort by release date and country, something which you can't currently do in the category). Also, it <i>absolutely</i> must be made international (not just American films) to avoid <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 01:29, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> In current form and title this article is ListCruft. <i>List of films featuring time machines</i> might just be acceptable as would <i>List of films in which time travel occurs</i> but the title (and therefore also the content) of this list is just too vague. <a href="../../../a/1/o/User%7EA1octopus_952d.html" title="User:A1octopus">A1octopus</a> 16:08, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this page as a source for anyone who wanted to be able to find USA made time travel films in one spot. I am new to trying to make a wiki page, so if you have any helpful information on how I can continue making this page (AND IT IS STILL UNFINISHED) please let me know. I would rather take the time to obey your rules then have this whole list deleted. I have been spending time trying to verify that my list will be complete and correct. The goal was to stop having to look at "Top 10 Time travel film" lists on google and actually have all of them in one place. Again, please tell me what to do to keep this page and follow any rules wikipedia has. Thank youChris F 19:16, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, it looks like the article can stay, but it needs claen-up. 1. It shouldn't be US-centric, Wikipedia is a world-wide site. 2. The "Films not included" part isn't of a standard article and needs to go. I can go ahead and start on some of it, and you can add the rest. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReywas92_4c7c.html" title="User:Reywas92"><font style="background:#7FFF00"><b>Reywas92</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/e/y/User_talk%7EReywas92_aaca.html" title="User talk:Reywas92"><font style="background:#00ff7f"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sup> 22:03, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Suggest that the article be moved to List of films using time travel as a plot device or something that carries this meaning but is less wordy; most films are not <i>about</i> time travel but rather <i>use</i> time travel as a plot device. The section <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel_in_fiction.html#Films" title="Time travel in fiction">Time_travel_in_fiction#Films</a> is already a list of such films, albeit incomplete and wordy - difficult to pull the title from the description. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 11:16, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article makes no assertion of notability. The one source referenced seems to say little aside from the fact that he intended to become a Communist, though I'm not certain how that makes someone notable - nor does dying of SARS. A Google search turns up at best a couple of obituaries, aside from Wiki mirrors and the like.

<dl>
<dd>I think it's conclusively been shown that his death is notable, the numerous articles written surrounding his death can attest to that. There was extensive discussion about this on <a href="../../../j/a/m/Talk%7EJames_Earl_Salisbury_b1ee.html" title="Talk:James Earl Salisbury">the talk page</a>. Becuase he didn't contribute substantially to his field, some have said that he isn't notable. I think that the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> page has changed, because I'm not seeing that on there anymore. What I am seeing is the primary notability criterion: "A person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent, and independent of the subject." Which his death certainly satisfies, so I think the real question should be should this be an article about him, or about his death? <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> under "general" has two criteria that seem to be met:
<ol>
<li>Wide name recognition</li>
<li>Multiple features in credible news media.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>His name is recognized all across the country, particularly around Utah where the news coverage was heavier, but I had friends all across the country ask me if I was related to the James Salisbury that died. The plethora of news stories around his death permeated the US, because SARS was a big topic at the time. So clearly this criteria is met. The question still remains as to whether or not there should be an article about him, or just about his death. This is where the communist party link comes in. He had at least two newsworthy events in his life (I'd like to go back to get some of the things that he did while he was in college that were notable, but that's going to take a lot more work, *I* know that he did some things, but I don't have newspaper clippings handy, so right now those things, which are not currently covered in the article, are just OR.) So beacuse there are multiple, non-trivial mentionings, I think it's abundantly clear that the article about him should stay. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:31, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for being up-front about your connection to the subject, that kind of disclosure is appreciated. In any case, I'm not sure that the additions do much to establish notability - the second and third sources mention him but aren't about him. The fourth is currently coming up with an error but I'd assume based on the title that again, the article isn't about him so much as it may mention him. Only the first article could qualify as potential proof of notability as he is the subject of the secondary source, the remainder are all incidental coverage. Whether it's enough to pass muster I leave up to consensus to determine, and I appreciate you work in trying to improve the article, but my opinion remains unchanged. I also agree with <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a> below, a more appropriate place for the info might be in another article. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:54, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are correct in that some of the sources are not about him, but in none of those cases are they a trivial mentioning. There are literally thousands of articles that mention him and his death, and I haven't even gone past the first page of google hits(google(James Salisbury SARS). If you'd like, I can bring up several newspaper articles which aren't available online that are about him specifically. I figure these sources are better than printed one because of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policy. I've added another few articles, if you still think that he's not notable enough.

<dd>Yes, but what about the other event in his life notable enough to be brought up to the news media? Also, while I understand your opinion, I don't see how we should look at the outbreak for this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Given the fact that you seem to be the lone proponent of keeping the article (at present), I would suggest that you disengage for a short time. The discussion will be ongoing for a week, during which time you can follow it's progress. By disengaging in this manner, you allow other potential supporters to step up and give their views. As it stands now, your continued advocacy seems to be campaigning. When this impression is combined with your admitted relation to the subject, a newcomer to the debate (such as myself) may begin to question your objectivity.

<li><b>Keep</b> Deaths from SARS are somewhat few in number, add to this that the subject is a Harvard-educated Mormon who wanted to join the ChiComms and this guys as unique as the come, and it's well referenced, establishing notability.

I do have to commend him for cleaning the article up and making it look less like a memorial page, good job.

(My favorite title: "Using stainless steel chopstick for self-performing urethral sounding in preventing recurrence of anterior urethral stricture.")

<li><b>keep</b>; "independent" sources is not required AFAIK (just 'original' sources), and fwiw if you look at the 'press' page on the website you'll see other sources that refer to it, review it, etc; I didn't feel it appropriate to add that (as the pages for other ling conferences I looked at don't have that), but I don't object to doing so if it's felt to be necessary. COI also is not AFAIK relevant for a VfD; sure I run it, and made a page for it, but how is that relevant to the quality of the article itself? Further, it is notable in that is the ONLY conference on constructed languages; this is equivalent to any other niche area of linguistics. --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaizai_eaca.html" title="User:Saizai">Sai Emrys</a> 06:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If I understand Wikipedia policy correctly, it needs to be _attributable_, and not being currently _attributed_ isn't justification for deletion. The notability is indeed attributable. You just need to go look up The Toronto Sun for August 12, 1999 and there's a big review of mathNews on Page 6. Just because there currently isn't a link on the Toronto Sun web site to that review doesn't mean it is not attributable. Also, if I understand Wikipedia policy correctly, a subject doesn't lose notability over time. If it isn't in the news _today_ doesn't mean that it isn't notable, and, as I understand it, Google News only has news articles that are current. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECas510_af82.html" title="User:Cas510">Cas510</a> 19:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

While the default for Google News is to show only about a month or so back, the Archive search goes back more than 200 years... in fact one of the results on the page I linked above is from 1915. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 22:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Google News search is limited to active web pages and is <b>not</b> an exhaustive general historical news index. Google News won't show any <i>Toronto Sun</i> articles dating from 1999 when using "Toronto Sun" and 1999 as search terms. The case of the article from 1915 was because that particular publisher was willing to post online archives for that year. Also, sources do not need to be on the Internet to be usable and reliable on WP e.g. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../d/l/2/User%7EDl2000_b92d.html" title="User:Dl2000">Dl2000</a> 04:37, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Don't get me wrong – MathNEWS is great – but I honestly don't think it's particularly notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A key to mathNEWS' notability is its profQUOTES feature which has had a minor, yet verifiably notable influence - it has resulted in the profquotes.com website <a href="http://www.profquotes.com/about.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.profquotes.com/about.php" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> that has been reviewed by international media such as the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>. Some secondary references for this are now included in the article. Also, Google shows 1070 outside instances of the mathNEWS website URL <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=mathnews.uwaterloo.ca+-site%3Auwaterloo.ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=mathnews.uwaterloo.ca+-site%3Auwaterloo.ca" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> which favourably compares to the 1120 outside references for the URL of the general student paper at UW (<a href="../../../i/m/p/Imprint_%28University_of_Waterloo_Student_Newspaper%29_1f67.html" title="Imprint (University of Waterloo Student Newspaper)">Imprint (University of Waterloo Student Newspaper)</a>) <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=imprint.uwaterloo.ca+-site%3Auwaterloo.ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=imprint.uwaterloo.ca+-site%3Auwaterloo.ca" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>.

<dd><b>follow-up comment</b> I tend to agree with Starblind and Tony Sidaway that this particular book's article has <i>potential</i> to be kept on account of notability. I intend to revisit it in a few days and before the discussion closes to see how the article has developed; in particular if editors research and add good sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Oh I knew there was something niggling me about this word. I just remembered what is was. When I was a young chap I used to like the works of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dali_16fc.html" title="Salvador Dali">Salvador Dali</a>, and as it happens one of my favorites was <a href="http://www.mcs.csuhayward.edu/~malek/Surrealism/Dali3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mcs.csuhayward.edu/~malek/Surrealism/Dali3.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> fetching nude titled "Young Virgin Autosodomized by Her Own Chastity." So it isn't such a neologism as one might think. However Dali was famous for his use of odd made-up words and quasi-joycean mixed-language sentences in his public utterances. Note here that the sense of autosodomy here is not that given in the article. The young lady here obviously has no penis with which to penetrate her rectum. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 03:31, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and salt</b> I don't know all the ins of this process and don't intend to learn them, but I think this article should be deleted for reasons given above, and I am tempted to begin excising references to it in other articles (such as in Sodomy) wether or not it's deleted. I just checked and have discovered that most of these references have already been deleted.</li>
<li>Well it's unreasonable to have an article for every definition on urbandictionary.com. I notice there is no article for thesbian (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=thesbian" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=thesbian" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=thesbian</a>) even though there are a lot more people who seem to think it means something than for autosodomy. So I suggest that before user DavidYork continues trying to inform wikipedia users about the marvels of autosodomy, he first begin with all the words at the Urban dictionary which have more up-thumbs than it does.</li>
<li>Also the suggestion that the practice is 'yogic' is absurd as I mentioned on the talk page; all suggestions that it is yogic within wikipedia were originated by DavidYork very recently. 142.151.162.247 16:26, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Kept twice, no consensus last time. What we have here is an article on a hypothetical sex act which has three references. Two of those are essentially the same. The first of those is an article mentioning in passing that the author has never heard of it actually happening, the second mentions in passing that the author has <i>still</i> not seen any evidence it has ever happened. The other reference is to a picture of Madonna in a yoga position which is <i>something like</i> what one might assume autocunnilingus might look like, but isn't actually autocunnilingus, and the article doesn't even mention it. In other words, <i>it is completely made up</i> and there are no actual references for its significance (or if there are, they are not in the article). Unlike <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a>, which is a documented reality, the top references for this appear to be Wikipedia and Urban Dictionary. Absent at least one credible academic reference, this needs to go. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Neologism coined about a month or so ago by a random blogger. Despite the claimed influence, this is nowhere near being on a par with Dawkins' concept yet. Most of the references are also evidently either bogus or misplaced (I'm not seeing the relevance in citing papers and books from the late 1950s to a word invented earlier this year for a concept which has emerged equally recently). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 20:57, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>A) Episodes are rarely planned out more than a week before it would air. This would include the introduction of any new characters or plot lines. B) Comedy Central, which you say you work for, has no creative input in South Park. CC does not see the episode until it is delivered to their office, generally early Wednesday morning.

<li>You lousy son-of-a-Bitch,I am a close personal friend of Matt Stones and I have heard absolutely nothing about this.This imformation is very obviously false,first,you dont say WHERE you found this out,what episode,why Trey and Matt planned this,WHAT exactly is your function with South Park,or if this is even true,plus this "episodes" plot sounds remarkably similar to <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooked_on_Monkey_Phonics_d634.html" title="Hooked on Monkey Phonics">Hooked on Monkey Phonics</a> and All about Mormons this type of episode isn't even South Park's style,maybe it was back in the pre-2000's Era but not now,plus even if it is true,there is no way you could have known such intricate details about such things as the dialogue,you even called Garrisson "Mr." and I had to change it to "Mrs.". and by the way,I do not know Stone I just claimed I did to teach you that Wikipedia is a web-option where any jackoff with a computer can post any crap they want,hell,this doesn't even fall under Wiki's non-crystal ball category,even that guy who said the Season Premiere last year would be about John Mark Karr had more sources than you did Ms.Fiction H. By the way this whole arcticle sounds too fan-fictiony to me,even your name implies you're a fan-fic writer,I wrote a fan-fic for school where the boys become the Fantastic Four,and since it was 2005 when I wrote it,I could have assumed T and P would do a parody episode,and posted a picture of Cartman as the Thing and said it would be an upcoming character,but did I? NO. besides Wikipedia hasn't announced new characters or changes or death ahead of time before,so why now?

<li>He wasn't familiar with South Park Studios until I mentioned it in one of my responses. He claims that he works for Comedy Central. Which brings up another question: He's said that where he lives, Kyle's colors are different (He's changed his story on this). If he does work for Comedy Central, then wouldn't he be living in the US where Comedy Central is located? Besides, I've seen episodes that air in other countries and the only difference is that the voices are dubbed.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree. I had wondered about "ctime" when I placed a disambiguation note on it a while back. Itd be a bitch to find sources for it, since ctime is by far and away mostly used to refer to either the c++ library, or perhaps some other functions (that I saw when i googled it) that are time related, but not used in-sentence or explained. The article has no sources, so find them or <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 00:04, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. The article states that "ctime" is a particular integer -- I've only known "ctime" to mean the C++ library, and the integer is actually called the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_time.html" title="Unix time">Unix time</a>. Since the article provides no sources for this usage of "ctime", I'm inclined to think it's incorrect. –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 00:12, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Yes, "ctime()" refers to the ISO C library function, which returns a string value, not an integer. The article discusses what is usually called the <i><a href="../../../s/y/s/System_time.html" title="System time">system time</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_time.html" title="Unix time">Unix time</a></i>, or <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_t.html" title="Time t">time_t</a></i>, all of which are covered in far better detail by their respective articles. The only other common meaning for "ctime" is the <i>i-node change time</i> in Unix-like filesystems. If this article were to be kept, that would probably be the only valid meaning of the term, making for a pretty trivial article. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 02:40, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>: "ctime" is the library call for formatting the current date as a string, and also the metadata change time from the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stat%282%29.html" title="Stat(2)">stat(2)</a> syscall — but as pointed out above, the article primarily describes it as <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_time.html" title="Unix time">Unix time</a> which is misleading. -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntgr_3172.html" title="User:Intgr">intgr</a> 07:18, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps disambig or redirect. I've heard no valid reason for deletion. Incorrect, misleading, or non-standard <i>contents</i> is not a valid reason to delete. That covers the first two "reasons" for deletion. That the information is presented elsewhere is also not a reason to delete, though it <i>may</i> be a reason to disambiguate or redirect. Note that a google search for ctime turns up more than <b>two million</b> hits. This article should not be deleted. –<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">RHolton</a><a href="../../../r/h/o/User_talk%7ERholton_ce4f.html" title="User talk:Rholton"><b><font size="3">≡</font></b></a>– 13:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, there are only about 770 Google hits, if you follow the search to the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ctime&amp;num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;start=800&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ctime&amp;num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;start=800&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">last page</a>. And it appears that all of the hits refer to the "ctime()" function. So, as I said above, if "ctime" were retained as its own separate article, it would be rather short. I think a <s>redirect</s> disambiguation page makes more sense. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 15:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. Past the fact that google hits mean almost nothing, ctime *does* exist, plentifully. The problem is that it is used to refer to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.h.html" title="Time.h">time.h</a>, not whatever the ctime article is about now. Obviously, if it were deleted, it would be a redirect to time.h, and if it were a disambiguation.. thats also a form of deletion - as in all the presumably incorrect information (all of it) on the page would be gone. Of course, a formal deletion isn't neccessary, just a change to a disambig or something. The history can be kept. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 23:18, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Alright, geez. I'm just not sure the current one-sentence definition, which is basically the title of the article in reverse ("the national team is the team from the nation"), is worth anything. Keep it if you want, I don't care, but at the very least this needs a stub tag. If they are in fact noteworthy, then maybe someone can write something informative <i>about</i> said national team, instead of just the fact that one exists.

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is as far from an useful article on <i>národní házenkářský tým</i> as it only could be. The "team logo" is an old, now unused logo of the umbrella organisation Czech Handball Federation (Cesky Hazenkarsky Svaz, <a href="http://www.chf.zdarsko.cz/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chf.zdarsko.cz/" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>), not national team logo (see <a href="http://www.hazena.pb.cz/galery1.php?skup=15&amp;img=014.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hazena.pb.cz/galery1.php?skup=15&amp;img=014.jpg" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> from 2007 World Championship). Rules of the CHF require only dark and light sides of the dress (but perhaps internationally it is more strict - <a href="http://www.hazena.pb.cz/galery1.php?skup=15&amp;img=005.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hazena.pb.cz/galery1.php?skup=15&amp;img=005.jpg" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> proof it is not from 2007 World Championship). The article name resembles way too much the Czech specific form of handball: "national handball" (narodni hazena, <a href="http://www.svaznarodnihazene.cz/text.asp?clanek=130" class="external text" title="http://www.svaznarodnihazene.cz/text.asp?clanek=130" rel="nofollow">umbrella organisation</a>) and nothing inside gives a clue about a possibility for confusion. Reading the CHF site it shows that nothing like a stable entity called national team exists and that for international competitions they pick an individuals from what is available two weeks before an event (handball is not wildly popular in the Czech Republic).</li>

<dd>You don't have any votes actually, as AfD is not a vote. This means that the number of people saying something is less important than the reasoning behind it.

<li><b>Comment</b> to Pavel: Would you be willing to add that information to the article? It's better for it to be there, and it will improve it greatly. More sources would also be nice (even if they're in Czech). The important thing is that this information is there for people looking for info on the Czech national handball team. If what you say is all true, perhaps the article would make better sense under another name, but there's no doubt that the information should be easy to find for the reader. Anyway, any vote on a renaming is probably best discussed on the talk page itself, rather than in an AFD (see also: <a href="../../../m/o/v/WP%7EMOVE_8a50.html" title="WP:MOVE">WP:MOVE</a>). <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 00:03, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seems like a pretty blatant neologism/thing made up one day (original "research" would be being kind, but the article engages in the "defence of necessity" that it "was introduced because the term double hat-trick was ambiguous"), but I'll refrain from speedying or PRODing this out of consideration of the possibility that this has become a notable term in the last four days -- despite no google news hits, and a mention in only one blog that I could find. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:04, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> judging from google, it seems to have been re-coined a few times rather than circulating as currency. <a href="../../../j/n/e/User%7EJnestorius_2da6.html" title="User:Jnestorius">jnestorius</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/n/e/User_talk%7EJnestorius_28b8.html" title="User talk:Jnestorius">talk</a>)</sup> 00:38, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The "references" seem simply to be copied from <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat-trick.html" title="Hat-trick">hat-trick</a>, where they were included to document use of "double hat-trick" for the same concept. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:03, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as a term without any currency at the moment (all the reports I've read about the match talk about a double hat-trick and don't care about the possible ambiguity). If it happens several more times, the term might enter the realms of notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:06, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article entry violates several Wikipedia guidelines involved autobiographies and notability.</p>
<p>1. To be sure that David Jones wrote this page, you'd only have to look at the page history and his Wikipedia user page. He makes no effort to hide the fact that he is the creator of his own Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>2. He commonly goes by "Choronzon Club" or variants on the Internet. This can be verified by Googling and viewing his MySpace page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/choronzon_club" class="external free" title="http://www.myspace.com/choronzon_club" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/choronzon_club</a></p>
<p>3. He seems to fancy these alleged "criticisms" in order to achieve some sort of Crowleyesque notoriety. This can be verified on his MySpace page, where he posts a link to said "Black Lodge" PDF.</p>
<p>4. His citations in other Wikipedia articles, such as on the OTO page were added by him!</p>
<p>5. Note the guideline listed on the Wikipedia page creation header: "Do not write articles about yourself, your company, or your best friend."</p>
<p>6. Please review <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest</a>, specifically sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8, and 2.2. Also, please review guidelines at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - His "noted scholar" link points to a self-written autobiography, which laughably includes "Doctorate in Divinity from the Universal Life Church".

I'm a "noted scholar" on strategy, noted by my own CounterStrike clan, with approximately the same number of members. I've written web pages, too, and I have friends who call me important for that.

<li><b>Delete</b> I do not think any of the books are published by other than the many non-notable organizations he has started or been involved in.
