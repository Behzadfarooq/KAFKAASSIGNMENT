<li><b>Keep</b> Templates don't always substitute lists, neither do categories. It's much better to have "List of foo game characters" article than a) a gigantic template message and b) a separate article for each minor character ever. It can also serve as a good <i>overview</i> to a much larger set of Stuff. Also, these lists <i>contain</i> the fancruft to specific articles, and that's a <i>good</i> thing. If you've got to have fancruft, at least do it this way! --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 09:08, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Not a speedy in my opinion, as president of organization is a claim to notability; just not one that is likely to gain consensus. Editor "deusyali" is advised that the purpose of a WP biographical article is <i>not</i> to serve as a portal to non-profit orgs whether notable or not. If evidence of notability is shown for this individual, article will need cleanup of non-encyclopedic resume material.

<li><i>Comment:</i> The fact that a tire suffered a blowout, costing Earnhardt (misspelled in the article) the race, was the most publicly discussed fact about the race, making it encyclopedic if the article is kept. "Boom!" and "blew up" are not encyclopedic, and need to be edited in the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a> article regardless of whether 1990's separate article is kept. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 03:08, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Non-notable film, vanity. Sure it's on IMDB, but as the AfD for the article's creator (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jason_Allentoff_b0d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jason Allentoff">here</a>) said, <i>this film is a textbook example of why existance of an IMDB entry alone doesn't establish notability</i>. I agree. The IMDB takes submissions from anyone. Even the rating there are suspect, there is a large group of people sounding suspiciously alike who just can't wait for the DVD release - and all of them have only one entry; yup, you guess it, for this movie. Seems like IMDB has sockpuppets too. Ifnord 01:25, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and re-nominate</b>. I'm pretty uneasy about a block-delete this large. I'm sure that Kahuroa knows more about all this stuff than I do, but it is against my nature to accept this many deletions on someone's say-so. I think before we can delete an article we need a specific problem. In this case, I'd like something like 'Ahoeitu' is not in the Oxford Dictionary of Polynesian Mythology, etc. But that's something that has to be done one entry at a time. (Is there a wiki-policy about multiple deletions? If not, should there be?) <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 02:03, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b>. The majority of these articles were added by user TUF-KAT over a day or two in late September 2002. He tells me that they derive from a dubious source - <a href="http://pantheon.org/" class="external text" title="http://pantheon.org/" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Mythica</a>. Some of these so-called gods are in fact the names of natural elements (like <a href="../../../u/a/_/Ua.html" title="Ua">Ua</a>, which means simply 'rain'. They often do not tell you which Polynesian culture the so-called god came from. There was no such thing as a unified 'Polynesian mythology' anyway - altho there were themes that were shared, each island, each tribe had its own tradition and its own stories and if the article does not tell you where the story came from it is meaningless. This causes confusion between the various cultures and languages - often the names in the story are obviously from different cultures yet they are presented as if they were a cohesive whole. Consider the article Kahomovailahi which purports to deal with a Samoan myth. This is impossible because there is no K or H in the Samoan language. Others purport to be Māori yet the names contain letters not found in that language. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 02:07, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Valid point - but nor should something be called Polynesian when it can only possibly occur in one Polynesian culture - Anderson maybe generalised where today we would be specific - sounds like he labels as Polynesian anything that occurs in any culture within Polynesia.

Whilst I agree that such a long list poses a dilemma, the fact is this is the kind of thing that gives WP a bad name, even as the effort by the nominators is itself (or should be) redemptive. The ones I looked into seem rife with inaccuracies (e.g. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paliuli.html" title="Paliuli">Paliuli</a> referenced above). Bottom line: the nominator has identified a corpus of material whose source is highly dubious, a point which I think has been fairly made above and which gives this mass nomination credibility. He's done his homework, seems knowledgeable about the subject and raised a serious set of issues about articles that have all been authored by a single source. That's yoeman work dammit and we should refrain from whingeing about process and instead be happy that someone has taken the time.

<li>Question: what <u>exactly</u> have you identified that is "inaccurate" about the entry for <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paliuli.html" title="Paliuli">Paliuli</a>? In my opinion it is oversimplified, perhaps, but not "purporting incorrectly to be an item from Polynesian mythology" or "not having a basis in real Polynesian folklore or myth."

<li>Please accept that I have exactly <u>NO</u> knowledge on this subject. But digging around, I found in <i>Kumulipo</i> (subtitled a Hawaiian Creation Chant) <a href="http://ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=p-0beckwit2-000Sec--11haw-50-20-frameset-book--1-010escapewin&amp;a=d&amp;toc=0&amp;d=D0&amp;cl=&amp;er=" class="external autonumber" title="http://ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=p-0beckwit2-000Sec--11haw-50-20-frameset-book--1-010escapewin&amp;a=d&amp;toc=0&amp;d=D0&amp;cl=&amp;er=" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Paliuli is a she, according to Bastian's <i>Die heilige Sage der Polynesier: Cosmogonie und Theogonie.</i> The garden of Eden discussed in the article seems to be a conflation of the reference that Paliuli herself makes to an <i>ever verdant land of the gods where abundant food grows without labor.</i> - that's from Bastian I think.) <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 09:37, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't have your Bastian source, but the linked creation chant has Paliuli as a place, not a person. I think you are being thrown off by the line: <i>"Paliuli names an ever verdant land of the gods where abundant food grows without labor. The name is given to fertile spots in deep mountain valleys where in old days children of high chiefs were taken to be reared."</i> It is an odd sentence construction. It doesn't mean someone named Paliuli gave a name to something, it means "Paluilui" is the name of something. If you keep reading, you get to the sentence, <i>"Some say that each district had its Paliuli. Perhaps the name was given to whatever secluded spot was chosen in the district for the rearing of taboo chiefs from infancy without any form of labor on their own part."</i> And then the translated chant itself: <i>"A sea of coral like the green heights of Paliuli . . ."</i>; and <i>"the impenetrable land of Kuaihealani in Paliuli . . ."</i> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 13:19, 28 March 2006 (UTC) Also, refer to the references in the article itself, including the recent U. of Hawaii Press dictionary of Hawaiian place names. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 14:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're quite right - I confess my ignorance.

<li><b>agree</b>. The issues are complex in some cases - and require an in depth understanding of Polynesian language, culture, and history, as well as of the mechanics of the oral transmission of traditions. Which is why someone can say 'Avaiki-Tautau is a Polynesian name for New Zealand' without realising why that is impossible given the geography involved and the nature of the oral tradition. And I don't think this kind of mass deletion was the right way to go. My main aim is to guard against Wikipedia becoming another source of 'tradition feedback' where incorrect printed information ends up being incorporated in the traditions of the peoples involved - like the 'Great Fleet' hypothesis - made up by European researchers in the case of us New Zealand Polynesians. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 06:55, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Agree</b> - merge is a terrible idea given that these articles are not merely stubs but have multiple levels of factual defects as well. The suggestion to <b>prod</b> the articles and allow thost that can be sourced to be rescued should also work in principle, however as there is no requirement that the "deprodding" editor actually improve the article, we'd just end up here anyway. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:31, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not so much vanity as perhaps stretching the importance of things a bit? I've done a ProQuest search and have found references in early 1990's issues of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and <i>Downbeat</i> to this guy being a studio musician (playing drums on an album for Keith Richards, for example) and being a record producer &amp; songwriter with Ron Nagle. (Apparently a song they wrote together was recorded by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tubes_675c.html" title="The Tubes">The Tubes</a>?) The March 21, 1993 issue of the <i>Chronicle</i> says he was one of the "busiest and most prolific musicians/producers in the Bay Area."

<li><b>Comment</b> by the way, in the unlikely event that people want to expand the article... this is just another way of spelling the word "woof". The term wasn't invented in 2000 as the article implies, I find useage of it as early as 1992 in a usenet search. This is just typical internet leetspeak, where o's in words are replaced with zeroes.

<li><b>Delete.</b> An alternate spelling of "woof" will never be a good article. This is the kind of thing that should have been quietly merged.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would just like to say that in this particular instance, how is this wiki any different from a common fansite? Really the only difference between this wiki and a fansite is the fact that it's a wiki. According to wikipedia policy, fansites should only be allowed if they actually had a change on the game. I think anyway, but i can't remember what page i got that from so i may be wrong. | <a href="../../../a/_/c/User%7EA_Clown_in_the_Dark_2f10.html" title="User:A Clown in the Dark">A Clown in the Dark</a> 22:25, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (Author of Article) The arguments for deleting this article are flawed. "RUOK IVR" is not a legitimate search term for the program described in the article. (Probably less than 5% of organizations that refer to this service use IVR. Many communities provide this through volunteer service). Using the Google search term "RUOK Program" returns 34,000 hits and all of the results viewed in the first 5 pages are related to the exact program referred to in this article. And these are only a subset of the actual number, many of whom do not have websites or do not have information about their RUOK program on the web. These include police departments, fire departments, social services, private organizations, etc. Discussion regarding other external linking was noted on another talk session with <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtea_ee58.html" title="User:Mrtea">Mrtea</a><small><a href="../../../m/r/t/User_talk%7EMrtea_12d6.html" title="User talk:Mrtea">(talk)</a></small>. If links provided on this article (list of providers and private funding sources) are objectionable, offensive or inappropriate, then they can be removed without detracting from the substance and value of the article. At a minimum, the list of providers should be retained and perhaps included in the body of the article. This list of providers contains organizations that are categorized by state. Most of the police and fire departments consented to be listed with contact information on how individuals in their communities can subscribe to this nearly universally free service as well as testimonials about the individual lives that have been saved using the service.Pgillman<small><a href="../../../p/g/i/User_talk%7EPgillman_5140.html" title="User talk:Pgillman">(talk)</a></small> pgaz 12:52, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

No evidence of genuine notability, and the article makes a subtle but unsuccessful attempt to couch an inflammatory statement about political corruption in just enough weasel words to make the statement seem more NPOV than it actually is.

<p>In the MOST recent edit to main <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan%2C_Ontario_c875.html" title="Vaughan, Ontario">Vaughan, Ontario</a> page, you included Vaughan Watch under the external links as, and I quote, "Vaughan Watchdog website, unofficial".

<p>If they are important enough to be on that page, and are notable enough to be referred to (and is in fact) the Watchdog of Vaughan Council, surely that is evidence of "genuine notability"?</p>
<p>They are the watchdogs of the most corrupt city council in Canada. That makes them worthy of an encyclopedia article.

<li>Actually, no, I'm saying it's <i>not</i> written with neutrality — Wikipedia has no business describing any city council as "the most corrupt city council in Canada".

<li><b>Delete</b> Vaughan Watch and Paul DeBuono each get 2 Lexis/Nexis hits in the last two years related to the government of Vaughan. "Paul DeBuono" also pulls up some hits as a former Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal adjudicator involved in a tenant eviction dispute.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Bearcat, Thatcher131. I'm thinking of two vaguely similar civic activist groups in Ontario communities which would absolutely merit Wikipedia articles: Citizens for Local Democracy in Toronto (defunct) and the Lanark Landowners Association in the Ottawa Valley (now the Ontario Landowners Association). How do they differ any from Vaughan Watch? Both of those had visible mass followings at regular meetings, organized large demonstrations, were led by or courted by prominent politicians, attracted persistent national media attention substantively discussing the organization, program and methods, etc. If Vaughan Watch has uncovered such corruption as claimed, I'm sure its time will come and an article can be recereated adding such history and sources. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 03:00, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Additional comment. This is an article with long edit history and multiple contributors. Wikipedia contains several articles of this type, see for example COW_programming_language, but Ook_programming_language seems to be the most detailed one among them. The article does not contain any incorrect or unverified information, and it is a good and amusing read. To those who want to merge, may I suggest a principle: if it is not broken, do not fix it. You cannot merge it with<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Morgan-Mar_dac8.html" title="David Morgan-Mar">David Morgan-Mar</a> (which is a shorter article than this one) without either loss of information, or having the combined article look ugly.

<li><b>Keep</b>: please stop renominating articles just because you have failed to have them deleted or because you don't understand the contents: repeated nominations have been in the past seen as disruption.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Dear Royboycrash I appreciate your trying to keep wikipedia as useful as possible i.e. We need more like you on the net! However, I added Sounergy because I thought it would be necessary to fully explain the wizor i.e. there is a link to it from the Wizor page I am working on. I respect you doing a google search and I to see that it comes up with limited results. However in the deletion policy it says articles have been kept with as little as 15 hits from google. I own a Wizor and am a big fan of the sound it gives my games, laptop etc... I could careless about Sounergy, Jebsen, or Rollei which are the only distributors of this product. (Also known as the Rollei Wizor). I do not work in the electronics industry I am a lawyer by trade. I hope you understand where I was coming from. Thanks Aaron.adams 08:10, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

Suggest redirecting Harel Malka to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonokol_Records_3fa5.html" title="Phonokol Records">Phonokol Records</a> and adding a small sentance stating he's an artist on the label. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 00:35, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Further up in the AFD it's stated that he co-founded "Egg Beats", a label which as far as I can tell has released <a href="http://www.eggbeats.com/ebmusic.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.eggbeats.com/ebmusic.htm" rel="nofollow">one record</a> since being formed in 2001. That record currently has a 112,471 rank among Amazon music items, meaning it's sold less copies than, say, a rare $33.00 Japanese import CD of Strawberry Switchblade's self-titled debut album, for example. As for Malka's involvement with Phonokol, it seems to be limited to one track on a verious-artists compilation titled "Morning In Space". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:56, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ahh yeah that would be my bad... I think AFD posters should link to a static revision they viewed... because comments dont always follow... I assumed you were talking about Phonokol.

<li>Notability isn't quite synonymous with popularity...but there has to be something other than the editor's opinion (see <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) to support the claim of its awesomeness. So like if it got some good write-ups in trade magazines or professional journals or something, it could still be somewhat notable, even if it never caught on. A large part of the concern with notability is actually derived from the fact that it's hard to find reliable information about stuff that isn't well-known or remarkable (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). Which, if there <i>are</i> some articles about it somewhere, references in the article would go a long way toward establishing its notability and thereby its keepability. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 16:19, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think that depends on how you define <i>serious</i>. There have been a number of scholars and one major magazine which have put forth arguments that his activities rise to the level of impeachable, and a very few Democrats in congress have publically stated that they feel that he should be.

<dd>The article doesn't claim it to be a single movement, it just shows reasons that some people believe George Bush should be impeached. Given that there are many people calling for his impeachment, including members of Congress, the idea is notable. Many people site these reasons, or some of them as reasons why they want Bush impeached. If the information presented is incorrect, it should be corrected, not deleted. If it is POV(and I definitly agree that it is), it should be made NPOV, not deleted. Also, though I'm not a contributer to this particular article, I do think it would be nice if you focused on describing why the article should be delted rather than assuming bad faith and making <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks on its editors. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 03:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, no member of Congress has called for the president's impeachment.

Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a>, only asserts that 31 members have called for an investigation into <i>possible grounds</i> for impeachment. Second, the POV nature of this article can not be cured by any editing. The very act of including an alleged misdeed under this heading is by definition POV (either of an editor or a partisan outside source) since no actual articles of impeachment have even been propsed in draft form. Note that all the alleged misdeeds cited in this article already have their own articles. If there is any basis at all for having this content in wikipedia, the article <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W.

<dd>Hold the phone! Several arguments are presented and none of them apply.
<dl>
<dd><b>1</b> Organizing the rationale that has been put forward by many, and certainly not limited to the fringe as can be seen by my explicit naming these, hardly constitutes an anti-Bush agenda.</dd>
<dd><b>2</b> Since I started the page I admit I have a POV (who doesn't) that is exactly why I said: <i>Feel free to improve that article.</i> To those of us that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> this evidently means, "if you find any incorrect information or the article is POV, please help by adding information to make the page NPOV". By asserting I only want this page to be POV indeed assumes bad faith and is a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>3</b> There is no suggestion in the article of impeachment proceedings being started. It is a collection of arguments used by several individuals and organisations of reasons they think suffice to start such proceedings. However, if that is not evident please help to rephrase it in a way that this is clear. And yes, congress members support investigating the possibility. To suggest that two geeks after a binge last friday night (metaphorically speaking), decided this would be a good prank is absolutely ridiculous.</dd>
<dd><b>4</b> Regarding the suggestion these things are already discussed this is incorrect. First, criticism is not equivalent to impeachable offenses. To discuss both in one article is unwarranted. Second, although it is possible to make a comment in every separate article this is of course a ludicrous idea. Somebody who would like to know what these offense are certainly won't find it. Making a comprehensive list only accomodates these users. Furthermore, what exactly is your problem with this article?

<dd>If I may interject, I thinkg the problem here is that the topic is just too large, empirically. That is, there are numerous substantial organizations approaching impeachment from significantly different angles. Also, there are numerous rationales for impeachment, that run the gamut from neglect of duty (Hurricane Katrina) to giving false information to the Senate (Iraq War), to breaking the laws passed by congress (FISA), to name a few. These things don't compress very well, so solid and bold editing really isn't going to make an article about the movement <i>and</i> the rationale a reasonable size. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a></sup> 23:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article is about a POV held by certain people. I'm sure this point of view can be reported on without having the article itself be POV. There are plenty of Wikipedia articles that are about certain POVs held by people in the world, such as the article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> or any other religion/lack there of. That doesn't make these articles themselves POV.

Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a>. The disagreement to me seems centered on whether it's notable to have a separate article for the rationale behind that movement, or whether they should be in the same article. As you can't really separate the movement from why they want to act, I think that a strong case should be made that they should be merged back again. If the article is too large and unwieldy right now... that is justification to apply editorial shrinkage to it, not to split it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 23:16, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The phrase that you're looking for, Georgewilliamherber, is <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>. However, I do not see anyway that that could apply here. Were you are were you not arguing that articles should be merged and then trimmed to fit the size constraints, as a matter of principle? That's how I read it. Though I concede that there is some interpretation there, so I might be wrong. The safest way is to go with a variation of <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>, and restate what you said with out alteration. However, to demonstrate how the argument would apply in what is theoretically an equivocable context, he choose a different example. This is a common and, in my opinion, fairly polite way to show someone their bias. But in good faith, perhaps you were misinterpreted. Perhaps your argument was more centered around "you can't really separate the movement from why they want to act". That would make your recent response make sense. The reason why I, and I would venture to say Nomen, didn't think that was the center, was because it is weak, perhaps the weakest part of the argument, and one usually picks the strongest part as the center. There are two reasons it is weak: 1. It is completely unsubstantiated. why can't you? what prevents you from doing so? 2. It is directly contradicted by the very existence of the thing that we are discussing: it IS separated. There can be no better proof that it indeed can be separated than it being separated. ... regarding retraction and apology, wikipedia has a strong policy on personal attacks, and i very much agree with it, but i don't see any personal attacks there. I don't see what he would apologize for. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a></sup> 18:20, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Sometimes, when an article gets long, a section of the article is made into its own article, and the handling of the subject in the main article is condensed to a brief summary. This is completely normal Wikipedia procedure; the new article is sometimes called a "spinout" or "spinoff" of the main article, see for example wikipedia:summary style, which explains the technique. Even if the subject of the new article is controversial, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork.

<dd>You may be correct, but this page is about voicing opinion. Most people base their opninion on arguments. When the logic used is flawed why should that not be pointed out? Furthermore it is interesting that you substitute <i>argument</i> with <i>argue</i>, whereas I would call it <i>ideas in a debate</i>.

<dd>What Nescio refers to as "logic" is, in his practice, fallacy and fanaticism. Red herrings, equivocation, argumentum ad nazium, we've probably seen it all.

<li>It may be much improved, it's still full of ridiculous lines like: <i>The alleged responsibility of the George W. Bush administration in the mishandling of Hurricane Katrina has been used by Ramsey Clark, PopMatters, Green Party of Humboldt County and the Sunday Independent to suggest failure by the administration to adequately provide for the need of its citizens</i>, or "<i>AlterNet, the St. Petersburg Times and the Santiago Times have claimed that Bush has exceeded constitutional or other legal limitations on such war powers.</i>". Rather than an encyclopedia article, this really looks to me like it wants to be a soapbox for the viewpoints of assorted partisan political agitators. Is anyone surprised that Clark, or Altnet or the Green party have cooked up some arguments to impeach Bush? And is there really any reason that anyone should care what Popmatters or the Santiago Times thinks about politics? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- O.E.R., as cited, not to mention 'life, the universe, and everything...'; words come into being because there are needs to discuss the underpinnings. The NOR guidelines are not written by all knowing and all powerful beings able to tell the future... The article itself has merit, however it evolves in the crucible of wiki merciless edits. If its missing, it can't evolve——merely remain a private toy.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article was better a couple of years back. What happened to it was that politically motivated Islamophobes succeeded in spamming the article and taking large amounts of well documented research out of the article. There is much material out there on this issue and the fact that some people, for whatever motive, wish to maintain that a very real social/political phenomenon doesn't actually exist is no good reason to delete the article. If anything social commentators are starting to view the term 'Islamophobia' as obsolete, as what we now witness is a full blown form of racism akin to anti-semitism. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Ball_5435.html" title="User:John Ball">John Ball</a> 28 March 2006 20:55</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as neologism.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>rewrite</b>. The term is in common use. But the article needs to make clearer the fact that many critics of the term believe it was brought into use by organizations such as <a href="../../../c/a/i/CAIR_c159.html" title="CAIR">CAIR</a> to label even thoughtful discussion of Islam and its doctrines as racism and xenophobia, thus silencing critics. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 21:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A search of <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> and other fulltext databases result in a number of hits on the term. A recent issue of <i>American Ethnologist</i> (Vol. 32, No. 3, Aug., 2005) includes two articles using the word "Islamophobia" in the title (and since the issue seems to be thematic, the others may include it elsewhere in the text - I can't check that). Although perhaps recent, there is no doubt that it is in use in academic discourse.

<li>The Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE) (copyrighted 2003), included on my Casio XD-H9200 electronic dictionary says: "<b>Islamophobia</b> &gt; <i>noun</i> [mass noun] a hatred or fear of Islam or Muslims, especially as a political force." - <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangotango_2487.html" title="User:Tangotango">Tangotango</a> 12:13, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tangotango, your comment above "WikiPedia is not a dictionary" is so true... that's why I have such concern to see the terms "Islamophobia" and "definition" come up as the #1 result on Google.com... for the <i>actual</i> word "Islamophobia" <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 14:19, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It, infamously and thankfully now, comes up first for <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;q=Jew+Definition&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;q=Jew+Definition&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Jew</a> too - thats not a valid reason to remove. Do you understand how Google works?--Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 14:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An impeccable example of <b>false logic</b> there Irishpunktom, as the term "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>" has been around for millenia while the term "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>" is still being defined. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 14:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or, you could say "<i>The word is a neologism that has yet to have one clear and explicit definition.</i>" - Like it does in the article. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 14:53, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Netscott, the point is that if you Google "Jew" and "definition", you don't necessarily get a definition of "Jew", you get pages that use the words "Jew" and "definition", including pages that discuss the definition of "Jew". Where the page comes on Google is irrelevant, as long as it the article itself is accurate and doesn't contain OR. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 16:11, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for that comment JPD, this bit of your statement, "<i>as long as it the article itself is accurate and doesn't contain OR</i>" is key... already some improvement in this direction has taken place... but IMHO, much much more needs to be done. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 16:13, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My only caveat to your last argument JPD however would be that the term "Islamophobia" doesn't appear to be <i>commonly</i> found in established and respectable dictionaries... and the term "Jew" <i>most certainly</i> is. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 16:31, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a fair point, and the article should definitely reflect that fact. However, it is a very widely used term, so there should be enough verifiable material to write a decent article on it. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 16:44, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article as it stands is quite POV; it should be discussed whether "Islamophobia" even exists in any meaningful sense, or whether (as many critics assert) the term has been coined to silence serious discussion of Islamic doctrines, terrorism, etc., by portraying this as racist. Some of the organizations promoting the term, notably CAIR, aren't squeaky-clean. I attended a (country's) government press conference in which foreign concern at a policy changed was described as "motivated by Islamophobia" when serious grounds for opposing it had been put forward. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 09:33, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>As for the dictionary debate (on the talk page and transcluded above), I've gone and looked at the individual sites to come up with the following:
<ol>
<li><b>Cambridge dictionary</b><br />
The online version uses the "Advanced Learner's Dictionary" (ALD). It used to use the full-blown edition, but this was retracted a few years back for a version suitable for ESL learners. As any comparison between a full dictionary and its "learner's" edition will tell you, a learner's edition has various words removed in favour of making the definitions of everyday words easier. It is reasonable to assume that the average ESL learner does not really need to learn the word <i>Islamophobia</i> in the process of learning the English language, hence its non-appearance in the ALD. The Dictionary of American English, also available on the site, is also targeted for ESL users. <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/cdae/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/cdae/" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></li>
<li><b>Merriam Webster's</b><br />
The version cited is from the special "online" dictionary. Collegiate and Unabridged versions are available to subscribers. If anyone does have a subscription, or is willing to try the 14-day trial, it would be interesting to see the results.</li>
<li><b>MSN Encarta</b><br />
I will admit that MSN Encarta uses a recent edition of its dictionary and it is not dumbed down. However, I will also argue that Encarta is also one of Wikipedia's main competitors, and it is rather ironic to quote it, especially when MSN has just launched a wiki-like editing system to its Encarta dictionary.</li>
<li><b>Newbury House of American English</b><br />
"Heinle's Newbury House Dictionaries/The #1 choice for English Language Learners" <a href="http://nhd.heinle.com/about_nhd.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://nhd.heinle.com/about_nhd.aspx" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></li>
<li><b>Infoplease</b><br />
"Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Copyright © 1997, by Random House, Inc., on Infoplease." Assuming that the word Islamophobia saw increased usage after the September 11 attacks, it is reasonable to assume that a dictionary published 4 years before the attacks would not have the word.</li>
<li><b>Factmonster</b><br />
"The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, published by Columbia University Press.; Infoplease Dictionary, based on the Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary" (See #5 for the latter; I could not find out the nature of the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia)</li>
<li><b>Britannica.com's</b> dictionary uses Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. (see #2)</li>
<li><b>Yahoo.com's</b> dictionary doesn't include the word either, but notice the copyright year: "The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition/Copyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company." <a href="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/search;_ylt=AisbkyWqWyrWb5r2Oiz_0JWqgMMF?p=islamophobia" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/search;_ylt=AisbkyWqWyrWb5r2Oiz_0JWqgMMF?p=islamophobia" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> - <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangotango_2487.html" title="User:Tangotango">Tangot</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETangotango_e3e5.html" title="User talk:Tangotango">ngo</a> 01:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I checked a few more dictionaries offline. Most of them weren't particularly surprising, given their pre-2001 publication date:
<ul>
<li>Webster's 9th New Collegiate: no. Unabridged was available, but even older.</li>
<li>Random House Unabridged, 2nd edition (1998): No.</li>
<li>American Heritage Dictionary, 4th edition (2000): No.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This one was, however, more surprising, especially in light of the neologism's apparent inclusion in the 2003 electronic Oxford dictionary Tangotango pointed out:
<ul>
<li>The Australian Oxford Dictionary, 2nd edition (2004): No. Nysin 03:08, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the interests of full verifiability, here's a screenshot of the dictionary open on the Islamophobia definition: (see the bottom of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Oxford_Dictionary_of_English_e404.html" title="New Oxford Dictionary of English">New Oxford Dictionary of English</a> for which dictionary I'm talking about)</li>

<dd><b>Answer</b> My mistake. I tagged it with {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-bio_82c9.html" title="Template:Nn-bio">nn-bio</a>}} earlier and noticed that it had gone from the CSD candidates page. From the page history, it looks like the tag was removed, hence the AfD nomination.

<p>He claims that Alex Jones could be an infiltrator. But if you claim something without evidence than you have a theory. Smith provides at least some serious information that supports his claim, and more pleasant information that we can all check. I don't say I like Alex or Daryl or somebody else, I simply listen to them what they have to say. Listening is one of the most important aspects of life. We can listen to different opions, Daryl attacks Alex, Wing.TV attacks Alex. Wing.TV attacks Daryl. Daryl attacks Wing.TV. But it happens all on a decent way.

<li><b>keep</b> Its maturing as we debate, links are being added, hurling only clubs are being deleted. It is not simply a list of towns in Ireland. Some city clubs have little to do with geography, alot of parishes have no teams, some parishes have teams with a name not the same as the parish itself and some places have joined with other areas to create a team. This is not a list of towns in Ireland. It will make a good list ...at least if i have anything to do with it&#160;:)<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleutherius_c8f6.html" title="User:Eleutherius">Eleutherius</a> 17:39, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and maintain. As Eleutherius says, the list is evolving, and the more information that is added, the better. Eleutherius, DarranC and KaptKos have explained that GAA clubs do not necessarily map 1:1 onto towns or parishes. A couple of other points: 1) In some parts of Ireland, only one of Gaelic football or hurling is played, and in some areas there will be separate clubs for the two games, but many GAA clubs will have both Gaelic football and hurling sections within the same club. I think there is an argument either for changing the name to List of GAA Clubs, indicating if necessary whether a particular club is hurling or football-only or dual, or alternatively for setting up a separate List of Hurling Clubs. 2) As far as links go, where the club is notable enough in its own right to merit a Wikipedia entry (e.g. <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossmaglen_Rangers_7fe4.html" title="Crossmaglen Rangers">Crossmaglen Rangers</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/_/Na_Fianna_CLG_f0fe.html" title="Na Fianna CLG">Na Fianna CLG</a>) then the link is straightforward. If the club doesn't have an article of its own, I see no harm in placing the link to the geographical area (parish, town, suburb) where it's located, especially if there's no club website currently available to be linked to (e.g. in the Leitrim listing, clubs like Allen Gaels (<a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumshanbo.html" title="Drumshanbo">Drumshanbo</a>) or Seán O'Heslins (<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballinamore.html" title="Ballinamore">Ballinamore</a>) are associated with particular towns or villages but those aren't indicated by the club names). 3) There are a set of articles for county GAA structures, e.g. <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longford_GAA_3920.html" title="Longford GAA">Longford GAA</a>. Links could be included to them from the county headings. (One long-term solution might be to move the county lists to the respective county GAA articles, but it's a decision that we could come to a consensus about at a later stage - but the list should not be deleted.)

<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="http://www.gaa.ie/page/organisation.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gaa.ie/page/organisation.html" rel="nofollow">Offical GAA web site</a> says "over 2,500 clubs in Ireland alone", can't find a reference for how many abroad. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_football_clubs_in_England_a0f1.html" title="List of football clubs in England">List of football clubs in England</a> is long, but not near as long as this, possibly because it doesn't try to list all the clubs, just those in the higher level leagues. Also, because it is limited to those in well defined leagues, it's easily verifable that all the clubs are there, is that going to be possible here also? My memory of playing club football in Ireland was that it was often knockout based, rather than league, so teams could easily join and leave, be created/merge, different team name in the same parish depending on age group, etc. so there was never a well defined list of clubs for any area. It's the lack of well defined listings that make the two lists so different for me. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 14:33, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Firstly, there is no need to be rude. Seeing your user talk space, it seems like it is a common tactic of yours. Secondly, just because a book has been reviewed by Time or indeed the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/06/17/reviews/010617.17deder.html&amp;ei=0qQpRJ7zNJ6OiALTpLX6CA&amp;sig2=GxKrQ7VXSocSnjuvDw1FjA" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/06/17/reviews/010617.17deder.html&amp;ei=0qQpRJ7zNJ6OiALTpLX6CA&amp;sig2=GxKrQ7VXSocSnjuvDw1FjA" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> does not make it notable. As I said, it is hardly a well-selling book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the subject of searching, I meant that if one googles 'lee hill' he is not a top search. I'm still not sure I'm convinced of his inclusion, when his books aren't high sellers. That said, I'll leave it to Wikipedians to decide. I wasn't sure that the guy was notable, so I stand by my original decision. <i><a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.kendall_09a4.html" title="User:James.kendall"><font color="green">James</font></a> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.kendall_09a4.html" title="User:James.kendall"><font color="purple">Kendall</font></a></i> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames.kendall_5f20.html" title="User talk:James.kendall">[talk]</a> 21:10, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>So the argument is that writing a biography of someone famous <i>a priori</i> makes the <i>biographer</i> notable. Interesting logic there: a new form of justification for reflected glory. Hint for Monicasdude: <i>Time</i> and <i>The New York Times</i> printed reviews of the book because of its subject, not its writer. For the moment, <b>delete</b>: I notice the other highpoint of Hill's career is editing a college radio station program guide.

<ul>
<li>No, the argument is that the creator of a notable work is also notable. And it really doesn't matter why a book is prominently reviewed in major publications (not that your claims are well-founded); the reviews/coverage amount to presumptive evidence of notability. Most (not all, but most) writers who satisfy Wikipedia's notability requirements do so because their work satisfies Wikipedia's notability requirements. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 05:28, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Film_Institute_c705.html" title="British Film Institute">British Film Institute</a> is clearly a highly important and prestigious organization. If they are putting out this kind of list, based on voting from experts, the world needs to take notice and we should be talking about it here. Otherwise, I can't see why we are helping to promote and persuade people by publishing 100s of lists such as <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture_46ad.html" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 15:46, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> We have loads of similar lists (for example, <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes_9f67.html" title="100 Greatest British Television Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a>) and they're generally kept. Not being a lawyer, I can't comment with authority on whether such lists are copyvios or not, but I don't see why they would be, any more than reporting the winners at each year's Oscar ceremony would be a copyvio of the awards broadcast. I certainly think that the authority of the BFI (and AFI, and similar articles) is vital to keeping these. I'd certainly not want to start seeing articles on the "Top 10 hottest asses as reported by someguysblog.com" and such.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - as the event itself is notable, and sponsored by the BFI, a major organisation, there's definitely an article here.

<li>If it is deleted then ok. I simply put it up as reference material for the people who ask me about it. I am quite big and very well known in certain areas of interest, and as such get asked for more information on myself a lot. If it gets in the way however, then please feel free to have it deleted asap. I would like to point out as well that it was in no way a "plug" of anything, just simply a biography - The company I work for is one of the biggest in the South West, not a "one-man company," and it is a part of my history.&#160;:o) --crewdy 15:26, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not a vanity neologism. It is certainly a neologism, how can it not be when it is describing a new process? This is a definition of a pre-existing term.

<li>I have read the policy and realise that neologisms are often (but not always) deleted. However, this subject matter is simply not properly definable without the use of appropriate neologisms. My argument is that this one should be an exception because it properly describes, using sound linguistic roots, a phenomenon which is not otherwise easily describable. --Djmac 17:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can see that the term isn't getting a great deal of support here, which is disappointing (but thanks to Ramanpotential for agreeing that it is a good neologism). I understand your reasons and see that it is certainly difficult to align this with Wikipedia policy. The argument about a 'failed' neologism is a strange one however. You can't argue that the term is a neologism (which by definition is new and not widely established yet) and then say that it has 'failed'. The idea behind the word is not new either. This is not original research. Just the application of a pre-existing term to an existing (but new) phenomenon. Thank you for your rigorous argument and an interesting introduction to Wikipedia! I'll continue using this word because I don't know of a better term for summing up this phenomenon. Others may feel the same. --Djmac 11:15, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Have today entered a new reference provided by James Greenwald which proves that this word was used in a biological context as early as the 19th century. Therefore 'extravolution' is conclusively not a neologism. It also puts all other reasons for deletion on very shaky ground. My personal philosophy is that deletion of valid and useful data is offensive and destructive. Think twice, or more, about your wanton recommendations to remove this valid article.</li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> The only notability I can find is the weak connection between one of the band's members to the band <a href="../../../i/n/s/Inside_Out_0dc7.html" title="Inside Out">Inside Out</a>, which used to feature <a href="../../../r/a/g/Rage_Against_the_Machine_f104.html" title="Rage Against the Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a>'s frontman. Other than that, this band doesn't really seem to possess any notability. The prod tag was removed by someone who claimed that the band played with a lot of notable bands, but I've seen some crappy bands open for some good headliners and I don't think that fact alone makes them notable ... but we'll see what you all think. <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:yellow; background-color:maroon; font-weight:bold">Aplomado</span> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">U</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" rel="nofollow">C</a> 15:28, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. I fully concede that this may be down to some atheistic bias on my part, but really, this is surely an irredeemably incoherent article. Could it POSSIBLY be cleaned up to standard?

<li><b>Keep</b> (almost strong). An utterly whacky concept, like most religious ideas. But an actual idea that seems to be part of the Marian movement. The article isn't very coherent, but the topic is legit. See, e.g. &lt;<a href="http://www.mariansolidarity.com/ladyofallnations/dopp02c.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mariansolidarity.com/ladyofallnations/dopp02c.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mariansolidarity.com/ladyofallnations/dopp02c.html</a>&gt;. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 20:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Article is a candidate for cleanup but 'Fifth Marian Dogma' refers to a large popular movement within the Catholic Church to recognize Mary as co-redeemer. Through the years Mary has already been proclaimed as Mother of God, as virgin, as immaculately conceived (in 1854), as assumed into heaven body and soul (1950), and co-redeemer would be the fifth dogmatic proclamation. Reportedly five million signatures have been gathered since 1993 to support this. --<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELockley_8593.html" title="User:Lockley">Lockley</a> 22:43, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>; the article gives a good description of the group's position and their reasons for existence. However, if the group was (a) only created a matter of weeks ago (i.e. is relatively new) and (b) the Yahoo! group has had no activity in the past week, this suggests that it has done nothing of note and is still at the formative stages.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is definitely a term used to describe music. Though Allmusic my like to list bands as what they aren't, the use of a term indicates that such a genre, or at least a "scene", exists. I have heard this term used before.

<dd>Considering that Metal isnt a form of rock music, without being harsh, your statement is pretty redundant and foolish. And um, the WikiProject <a href="../../../h/m/m/WP%7EHMM_ece8.html" title="WP:HMM">WP:HMM</a> is in the process of merging stubs into their core articles. And for a band to be 'metal' they have to have metal characteristics. Also this fails Notablity on all accounts, and as such is in violation of the notablity policy. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a> 01:53, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right, metal is not a subgenre of rock, and I do feel foolish for saying so. However, by the same token, funk metal is quite different from funk rock and merging the two would not make sense. If you want to merge it into metal, that would make more sense, but would probably make for a rather long article. The bands I mentioned do have metal characteristics; I can only assume you are unfamiliar with them. So do you list them as metal bands, funk bands, metal bands with funk characteristics, or what? Funk metal is a good way to describe them. As for notability, I got 25,000,000 hits on google for funk metal (not sure how many were unique). There were references to it on <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s website, amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com, and many others. And despite your dislike of allmusic.com, I consider it to be a good source (it's even quoted in the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal music</a> article), which makes this topic verifiable and notable. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a> 03:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do NOT delete as wikipedia offers information on all range of affairs and UBRUN is no different, there is nothing to be gained from its removal as this is an encyclopedia free to all and not solely a literary site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.141.170.173 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.141.170.173_0845.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.141.170.173">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Do NOT delete the Ubrun page. It shows great historical detail and cultural value. It is not just a fad but a serious organisation. How big does an organisation such as this have to become before it is allowed on this encyclopedia?! Is there a cut off point or something? It is clearly not your standard student drinking contest through the historical analysis. It is a nationwide organisation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.144.28.42 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.144.28.42_ff9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.144.28.42">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Non-notable band per <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, having only two albums (both of which are non-notable) and having no notable members.

<ul>
<li><b>Very weak keep</b> Having originally prodded the article, I undertook to read up on the band a bit after the tag was removed, and, though I think it's a close call, the band does seem fit the notability criteria of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Even as <a href="http://whymakeclocks.net/reviews.html" class="external text" title="http://whymakeclocks.net/reviews.html" rel="nofollow">the band's website</a> has yet to include any reviews from prominent publications and even as the band gets only 729 Ghits, the band's music is <a href="http://music.msn.com/playlist?playlist=fc001f00-32db-0000-0000-000000000000" class="external text" title="http://music.msn.com/playlist?playlist=fc001f00-32db-0000-0000-000000000000" rel="nofollow">available</a> on MSN Music and Rhapsody. It's a very close call for me, but, though the article needs a lot of work, it's a weak keep for me for now. (Btw, for those inclined to vote keep in view of the prospective notability of two blue-linked members, the articles to which "Boonie" and "Eric Kennedy" direct are not about the musicians, and so the "member of another notable music group" criterion wouldn't seem relevant). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:40, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Why Make Clocks meets notability criteria.</b> I posit, pursuant to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, Why Make Clocks is notable as a musical ensemble for having met the following criteria: 1) Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in notable and verifiable sources. See <a href="http://www.ethosmagazine.com/old/story.php?id=33" class="external text" title="http://www.ethosmagazine.com/old/story.php?id=33" rel="nofollow">Ethos Magazine</a>. 2) Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...). See <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_Magazine_9959.html" title="Billboard Magazine">Billboard Magazine</a> December 7th, 2002, See <a href="../../../c/m/j/CMJ_fe37.html" title="CMJ">CMJ</a> Jan/Feb, 2003.<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwiksell_bec7.html" title="User:Bwiksell">Brian Wiksell</a> 05:58, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Weak Keep.</b> I might just be voting to keep as a result of my guilt for my impropper handling of this article and my rudeness to its creator; however, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a paper encyclopedia, and I now believe, based upon the assertions by <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwiksell_bec7.html" title="User:Bwiksell">Brian Wiksell</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a>, that this group very marginally meets <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. I do, however, feel it somewhat inappropriate, though allowed under <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, that this article was primarily created by a member of the band. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 08:01, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> I did not consider <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> in my creation of this article. While I am not currently involved in the group, I was involved in the past, ergo a possible implication of bias. A potential remedy could be to remove any reference to myself in the article. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a>'s rudeness or guilt as a result should not imply additional justification for inclusion of this article.

This article is one of several (two of the others being <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_King_7380.html" title="Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_A._Bonacci_ef3e.html" title="Paul A. Bonacci">Paul A. Bonacci</a>) that figure in a complex and bizarre conspiracy theory involving alleged <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanic_ritual_abuse.html" title="Satanic ritual abuse">satanic ritual abuse</a> among prominent Nebraskans in the early 1990s. It is very hard to tell fact from invention in any of these. A while ago I cleaned up the King and Bonacci articles, trying to pare them down to what is verifiable. I had <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_of_Silence_5201.html" title="Conspiracy of Silence">Conspiracy of Silence</a> on my list as well, since it is still full of unsourced speculation, obvious POV, etc., but have not had a chance to clean it up. Despite the terrible state of the article, I do believe that the subject is notable, in that the documentary was produced by a major TV production company (<a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Television_c5f9.html" title="Yorkshire Television">Yorkshire Television</a>), and was scheduled to air on a major US cable channel (<a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Channel_ee82.html" title="Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a>), regarding an alleged conspiracy that received significant media attention at the time. I'll take a look at it and see if I can get it to at least minimally acceptable standards for now. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 04:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: OK, I rewrote it down to a plausible minimum. Take a look. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 05:30, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very weak keep</b> This is very weak keep for me inasmuch as I find the arguments on either side to be equally compelling and believe, consistent with policy, that one ought always to err on the side of keeping an article. Though MCB's very fine efforts surely improved the article and though he makes a good case above for notability, I think that, while the underlying story may well be notable, a documentary about that story likely would not be. In this case, though, the documentary appears inextricably interwoven with the story, as one genesis for the significant media attention received described by MCB. I imagine the best disposition of all of this would be an article written about the underlying story, with which article could be merged this article and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Franklin_Coverup_9b6d.html" title="The Franklin Coverup">The Franklin Coverup</a> (as well, perhaps, as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_A._Bonacci_ef3e.html" title="Paul A. Bonacci">Paul A. Bonacci</a>. In the meanwhile, I suppose it's appropriate that we keep the article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:50, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> This was a notable programme, especially since it was banned in the USA. Can anyone give any reasons why it should be deleted? (Other than opinions that the article is badly written)? Rapido 17:21, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> This is a notable program, and the conspiracy theory is also notable. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Pugs Malone (<a href="../../../p/u/g/User_talk%7EPugs_Malone_235e.html" title="User talk:Pugs Malone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pugs_Malone_44b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pugs Malone">contribs</a>) .</small> 04:02, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> This is very important. The fact that a documentary can be cancled like this by special interest groups because it reveals some very serious abuses should outrage all Americans (supposedly, this involved some very big figures, like a local reporter, and I is possible that one of the investigators and his son was murdered in their private jet!). Again, keep, this is important, I mean IMPORTANT stuff.... <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeArchos_b85c.html" title="User:IdeArchos">IdeArchos</a> 02:21, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can assure you that I've heard this from more than one source, and reading this article was the third time (at least). If it were really that obscure, I doubt that would have happened. The fact that this particular title choice isn't that common (fair enough) doesn't mean the joke/situation hasn't been described under other names.

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because its a humourous notion doesn't immediately make it somehow unworthy of a page in Wiki.
