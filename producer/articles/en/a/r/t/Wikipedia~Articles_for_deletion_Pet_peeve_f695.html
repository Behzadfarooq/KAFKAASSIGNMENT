<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> for now. Yes, I tend to agree the article is mainly a dictionary definition when you remove the wide generalizations. Then again, the article is better referenced than it was before this process. I guess my main problem with the article is that it is such a pedestrian topic that I would never touch it, or care whether or not it gets deleted (which is why I'm your guy to close this, I guess.)</p>
<p>As to the argument between Pan Dan and Mister.Manticore (the battle of the funky usernames) I generally think that a "pet peeve" is in the eye of the beholder. To me the term implies a very specific irritation that one person has, which is not likely to piss off many other people. I think Pan Dan thinks something similar, hence his disagreement with the sources' more general usages of the term. The subjective use of the term itself is probably the biggest problem with this article's continuing existence, but the references are the only thing we have to go off of as far as how the term is used. (Is the term used differently regionally? Put that in the article!) For the next debate, the subjective nature of the term itself should be considered more carefully. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="orange">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="black">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="orange">ka</font></a> 09:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That source falls into the "discusses its etymology" category (see my comment above). It's almost entirely a rather expansive discussion of the meaning and etymology of "peeve" (and we already have articles on <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a> in general and <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back-formation.html" title="Back-formation">back-formation</a> in particular). There's one sentence about when "pet peeve" first appeared in print. All of this is dictionary material. The final sentence speculating about why "pet peeve" became popular--whatever the merits of that explanation--is not substantive enough to justify an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, you agree it's a reliable source, right? But honeslty, I'm just not seeing why you have a problem with this entry. Could you explain why etymology isn't useful for Wikipedia? What would you ned to change your vote? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:46, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>First, this isn't a vote. It's not me you have to convince, it's the closing admin! But I suppose if there were reliable non-trivial sources that discuss either pet peeves themselves (like some of the sources for "road rage" at <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_rage.html" title="Road rage">Road rage</a> or some of the articles <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22road+rage%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22road+rage%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">here</a>), or that discuss the use of the term "pet peeve," then I would change my opinion. As to whether the Word Detective blurb is a reliable source: in my view its content can't justify keeping the article, so there's no point in me committing to an opinion on whether it's reliable. As for your comment on etymology, that's what dictionaries are for. I note that using your reasoning we could have a Wikipedia entry for every single word whose etymology is known. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but I can't talk with an admin who hasn't decided to act yet, but I can interact with you. Which might in turn influence that theoretical admin's action in the future. If you want to ask whether there are some non-trivial sources on pet peeves, well, I looked at scholar.google.com and I found a lot of articles that I would say are about pet peeves. Like <a href="http://apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed2.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which describes a study that set out to find student's pet peeves. (Or the one from an insurance company that's already on the page). Plus this page <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> indicates that the authors of that book did a study on it. And yes, where it is important or interesting, a given phrase or term might well deserve an entry with its etymology. In this case, it is more than just saying "Pet Peeve means a personal irritation" . Check the English-language idioms category for lots more similar articles. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>The references you link to are about <i>general</i> annoyances, not <i>pet</i> peeves, which by definition are peculiar to individuals.</b> The first ref misapplies the term "pet peeve," and the second doesn't use it at all (at least not in the title, which is all I can see). So the contents of both of these fine sources could not support <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_peeve.html" title="Pet peeve">Pet peeve</a> (but could go into Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> once it is shown that they got some <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> to show that they're not trivial or wacko). Now, if some psychologist dude, for example, conducted similar studies or analyses of actual <i>pet</i> peeves (with peer review), then that's the sort of thing you could build an encyclopedia article on. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 02:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The refences I cited specifically said they were looking for pet peeves, for example, the insurance company looked for people's pet peeves about driving, and the APA article also described their study that way. And the author of this <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300099711&amp;id=ING9Y81oJT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Pet+Peeves&amp;sig=Ex1Y_NBLnG3A_EpSjHenL5o78oI" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]who is actually a Ph. D. in Social Psychology. I don't know if she got any peer review, but it was published by the Yale Press, so I'm inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt. Sure, I'd love more context, but as I don't have the book at home, I'll just have to go with the page that google has, which says among other things "Because my students and I were interested in the actual content of people's pet peeves and because most....we conducted a study on pet peeves in close relationships. Now that you bring up <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> though, I don't see how that article is particularly different from this one. I could be convinced that these two should be combined.

<dd>"The references...specifically said...pet peeves"--My point above was that those folks are misapplying the term. They meant general annoyances, not pet peeves. As to the book you cited, again, I said above that there's no indication that it's about pet peeves. As to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> being problematic, yes, there is some stuff about etymology of the word "annoyance" in the first sentence of that article that perhaps doesn't belong, but most of that article is about the <i>concept</i> of annoyance in psychology--not the word. <s>And it's cited. That material certainly does belong in Wikipedia.</s> Taking a closer look at that article, I see that some of the material there is uncited and possibly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>, which, yes, is a problem. As to combining the two articles: <i>some</i> of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> is encyclopedic, but <i>nothing</i> in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_peeve.html" title="Pet peeve">Pet peeve</a> is, so there's nothing to combine. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 03:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You claim they are misapplying the term. Well, that's a matter of disagreement, but feel free to make an argument as to why, because I just don't understand what you're talking about. And the book doesn't have to be entirely about pet peeves to indicate that it treated the subject of pet peeves with specificity, as it does on that page which I found through google. It also mentioned some other books on that page. Yes, I suppose you could argue that Pet Peeves is part of the larger subject of <b>annoyances</b>, but even if we did, it is still a specific word with its own origins, which people might well search for. But hey, I could be amenable with treating the subject of pet peeves in the Annoyance article, if that's what you want to propose. But we'd still need to define pet peeve and link back to annoyance, if only because the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_Peeve_5bc9.html" title="Pet Peeve">Piers Anthony book</a> isn't going anywhere, and I really don't feel comfortable with that article not having a disambig. Personally, I think that it should be moved to a different namespace, but that's another issue. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have bolded my explanation above of the difference between pet peeves and annoyances. "[D]reary, monotone lecturing" (from your ref #1) and being "teased, nagged, betrayed, or lied to" (ref #2) are things that annoy lots of people--they're not <i>pet</i> peeves. (The authors wanted to use the term "pet peeves," I suppose, because of the nifty alliteration referred to at Word Detective--it gets the reader's attention.) An example of a true pet peeve, by contrast, would be "People who type 'what-up!'" at <a href="http://www.peevepile.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peevepile.com/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (a ref in the nominated article). Because pet peeves are peculiar to individuals, something people talk about to shoot the breeze at internet forums, I doubt that anyone of any importance has undertaken a serious study of them. So, again, I don't think there's any non-trivial, non-OR way to "treat the subject of pet peeves in the Annoyance article," as you suggest, or in the article under discussion. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:32, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but I'm afraid your differentiation isn't quite as solid as you think it is, as it seems to me, that many uses of pet peeve are not making that distiction. Uses that a bit more notable than you, such as an insurance research group and a scholar published by Yale. But if you think the point you make is well-supported by other sources, (or IOW, not OR on your part) it would seem to make for good content to add to the article. Perhaps it might qualify as a pet peeve itself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:55, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My distinction isn't OR, it's based on the definition of pet peeve. But even assuming that the distinction isn't there, your sources discuss examples of pet peeves, not the overall phenomenon itself, and as such are not particularly strong to build an article on (whether an article on pet peeves or one on annoyances--note that <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annoyance.html" title="Annoyance">Annoyance</a> mainly discusses the overall psychological phenomenon, not examples of annoyances). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:20, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it's based on what you feel the meaning of the word is, which may be true, perhaps, but if nobody has written about it, may make it OR. See <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimate.html" title="Decimate">Decimate</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catachresis.html" title="Catachresis">Catachresis</a> for more on that problem. At least some people have written about that. (In fact, it's a common pet peeve). Not as bad as when they use it as a <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropism</a> Still, if people are collating data on examples of pet peeves, writing news paper coloumns and even books on them, and otherwise talking about the issue, I think it makes it notable. Not that I think we should have List of Pet peeves mind you, as I agree, that would be ugly and unmaintainable. But sourcable material, that gets on CNN? Very much worth including. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) "pet peeves" are not a meme, unless you're using some kind of uselessly so-broad-it-includes-everything definition of meme 2) the "bonked" article you link to is primarily about a physiological condition and the slang sexual dicdef is only mentioned in passing.
