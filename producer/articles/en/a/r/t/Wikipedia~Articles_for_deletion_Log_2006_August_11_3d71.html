<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Userfying in this case isn't that great of in idea, since it was the creator's only edit. This was already deleted twice before, and both times it was created by a user with no other edits (not the same user that started this one). User pages are only useful for people who actually contribute here, they're not a web host for people. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 08:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Keep - Keep in mind that it is itself a news source and a syndicator of content... you may want to rethink your methods.. Using your exact UK Google index Google.co.uk I get 476,000 entries. Looking for websites alone that link just to the home page there are over 900 entries (<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link:1vCZqn5vnOUJ:www.allheadlinenews.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link:1vCZqn5vnOUJ:www.allheadlinenews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link:1vCZqn5vnOUJ:www.allheadlinenews.com/</a>) Using the "GOOGLE" tests you'll see that news.google.com lists them as a source.....

If you choose to delete it, that's fine, I'll trust your judgement. As long as it's not a personal bias that is responsible for the choice to delete it, then as long as you feel it is not notable enough, I will also agree to deletion of the page until such time as it becomes noteable enough to be deserving of a wiki page.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Do you have some verification of state recognition that you can provide for us?

<dd>Hmm. That's not really what I was hoping for. Anyone can readily establish themselves as such an association, I imagine, just from looking at the form. I was thinking more that you had documents that you'd been recognized as a religion by the state, which is a bit of a different thing from what I understand. Even if you had that, I'd be curious about third-party media coverage. In this case, unless there's evidence that this organization passes <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> (with which I generally agree), my vote will remain delete for the reason I stated. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 02:13, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While myself and others within the organization have indeed been interviewed in newspapers about religious and spiritual beliefs and within the role of religious leaders in our respective communities, that was long before the formation of the organization itself, which this article covers, and thus would not apply.</dd>
<dd>I do understand not including everything that pops up as an article on Wikipedia for the preservation of the integrity of the information, and so I have no problem with deleting it until such time as the organization has earned the notability required. --<a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkayne_Magii_7bd9.html" title="User:Arkayne Magii">Arkayne Magii</a> 02:34, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, It is an association, not a club, as there is no charge for membership and is open to anyone.

<li>Arkayne Magii, I agree that not everyone would agree that an article on G-Unit is worth reading I was using it as an example of a famous club. Anyway, it is unfair that you think you should be allowed to keep your article when my article on the Doctor Who Unofficial Fan Club was deleted for the same reason that yours is on AfD discussion. Notability. Elodrym is not notable, just like the Doctor Who Unofficial Fan Club. It is also Advertising your club to try to get more members. And more people would be interested in 50 cent's G-unit crew than your Elodrym. I have been through every search engine, Google, MSN but i still can't find a thing on Elodrym. And from what it says on your website it does sound like a load of rubbish to me.</li>
<li>"it does sound like a load of rubbish to me" Very childish to make things personal. Shall we move on to more relevant comments? - Prismaticscribe</li>
<li>Well, I'm certainly sorry that you feel that way. I did not put it up here for publicity, however. If I had, I would not have tried my best to keep it as neutral and specific as possible. There is a difference between advertising a thing and making information available about it.</li>

<dd>You said, "it is unfair that you think you should be allowed to keep your article when my article on the Doctor Who Unofficial Fan Club was deleted for the same reason that yours is on AfD discussion"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I already agreed that it is not yet notable enough based on the current guidelines, and as shown by others, and I still agree that it should be deleted. What I don't understand is why you feel it is "rubbish". I don't expect you to explain your opinion, as I understand not everyone sees things as I do. So I'll note your words, contemplate them, learn from the difference in perspective, and keep doing what I'm doing.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There has been one article in the Australian media about the basketball club namely a front page story in the <i>Adelaide Advertiser</i> which states "MVP Sports will look to press on with the formation of a second Adelaide license.MVP already has registered "Adelaide Sharks" as a potential franchise name after spending almost 18 months in the ultimately vain pursuit of securing the 36ers' license." The basketball team is a bit crystal-ballish at the moment. However, there was a soccer club of that name who seem notable. They played in the National League with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Lazaridis_0986.html" title="Stan Lazaridis">Stan Lazaridis</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kosmina_39fe.html" title="John Kosmina">John Kosmina</a> playing for them.

<dd>Thank you for removing the more blatant violations from the page, even though it essentially did the same thing as a delete, given that 90 percent of the article's contents was comprised of the violation material. Which brings to light another point- given that you created the article (and obviously have it on your watch list), why didn't you spot the insertion of roughly five paragraphs worth of plagarism from the Farley Mowat's homepage?

<dd>Why didn't I notice that contributions were made to the article which were copyright violations? That would require more interest and familiarity with the Sea Shepherd site than I bring to the table. It was my interest in nautical matters that lead me to start the article, not my interest in the Sea Shepherds. There was a reference to the vessel <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farley_Mowat_6ff7.html" title="Farley Mowat">Farley Mowat</a>, which linked to the author, not the vessel. I had never visited that second external link before the {afd}.</dd>

<dd>Not adverse to having the article show her whistle register completely, if a sourced trustworthy article mentions it. There are obvious problems with wikipedia's Original Research doctrine if we listen to something and decide to add it based on our pitch recognition.

Little reliable info on her right now, but appears from her website that she has a 5 octave vocal range and has definitely released album in 2003 in Taiwan and Mainland. Her album may have charted in Taiwan in the new artist category and won a best newcomer award in 2003. It seems the entry should be under Lin Bao per her <a href="http://yule.sohu.com/linbao/" class="external text" title="http://yule.sohu.com/linbao/" rel="nofollow">official website</a> (<i>in Chinese</i>).

<dd>1. A vendetta against a particular category of articles? I'm just cleaning up the wiki. There appear to be tons articles about non notable web games and wikis. Of all those I have had to afd only a couple were contested so apparantely a majority of wikipedians thinks it's right for them to be deleted.</dd>
<dd>2. A discussion on the talkpages? I always clearly state my reasons for deletion in the prod or afd.</dd>
<dd>3. Alexa ratings? Alexa ratings and google hits are used by many editors as an indication whether the subject has some notability. If I don't add them, usually an other editor does. By the way, I just add them as additional information. My main argument for deletion is always that the game isn't covered by any reliable sources.</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> 7,000 players is enough for borderline notability.

<li><b>Definite keep</b>. Games such as <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hattrick.html" title="Hattrick">Hattrick</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battrick.html" title="Battrick">Battrick</a> are pastimes like <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crosswords.html" title="Crosswords">crosswords</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudoku.html" title="Sudoku">sudoku</a>. They are tests of skill that require a great deal of application for players to be consistently successful. The fact they are web-based shouldn't make them worthy than pastimes that live only in newspapers. As was stated on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hattrick_aa07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hattrick">Hattrick deletion vote</a>, it has a community of over 800,000 players in over 100 countries. One point that wasn't mentioned was that the winner of the Polish Hattrick championship a year or so ago rated a mention on Polish TV news. It may have been a quirky end-of bulletin item but it surely was an indication of notability. Battrick is smaller, partly because the sport it is based on (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>) is not as large worldwide as <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> and partly because the game itself has only been going a couple of years, compared to Hattrick's ten years or so. Nevertheless, the people who run Hattrick were sufficiently impressed with Battrick to adopt it and allow it to run from their own servers. (And yes, if you're wondering, I am a player of both Hattrick and Battrick.) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrico_abba.html" title="User:Crico">Crico</a> 08:50, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't know what your problem is with it Dori...this is a large corporation for the Sonoma County area, and their company is largely growing. It is far from a brochure. If it was brochure site, I'd be trying to sell the product to you, not be talking about the company. Besides, the company is about dairy, so that's how I'm supposed to describe it as. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Kat_2996.html" title="User:Black Kat">Black Kat</a> 18:26, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>It sounds to me just like how you described it on the talk page: you read their website, took their description, reworded it somewhat, copied their logo, and then posted it all here. See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">WP:COPYVIO</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/g/WP%7ELOGOS_bfc2.html" title="WP:LOGOS">WP:LOGOS</a>, and probably a few others.</li>
<li>If you look at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, it doesn't appear to meet any of WP's notability requirements. Which do you think it meets, and how?</li>
<li>It's an orphaned article -- no WP articles link to it.</li>
<li>Searching Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22clover+stornetta+inc.%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22clover+stornetta+inc.%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">using the name of the article</a> results in four pages. Again, notability?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If you think it's a notable corporation, explain why -- I'm generally a WP inclusionist, but I don't see anything here, on the talk page, or most importantly, in the article itself that makes me see how it meets any of the criteria for corporations. Add the copyright questions, and this article really has a ways to go before it's encyclopedia quality. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoriSmith_8697.html" title="User:DoriSmith">Dori</a> 04:49, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The first part I wrote because it was very basic, and I tried to make it my own as much as possible, in hopes that it would be later changed by other people and myself to be more original, but this was all the reference I had for the moment.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Of course I took their logo. It's their logo...am I supposed to make one up at say it's theirs? I said it's THEIR logo. I would think that one is quite obvious.</dd>
<dd>You're wrong with the links...I had it link in the Petaluma article, and the Sonoma County article. If they aren't there now, someone erased it. I had it link to an article than mentioned Clo, as well, whether it was one of those two or one I forgot. I also gave it categories.</dd>
<dd>It's notable because it's a very well-known company in the area, and it's expanding throughout the state. It's very popular for it's health code and, considering it's becoming state wide and eventually possibly national, it's important enough. If there are documents at this site about episodes of cartoons, I would think information on a growing American corporation would be sensible. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Kat_2996.html" title="User:Black Kat">Black Kat</a> 19:59, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep.</b> I'm afraid I disagree that the listing is a "blatant advert" Adam.</li>
<li>I note too that the AfD guidelines state "Companies directly reported as significant players in major news events are generally notable is a reason for a listing in wikipedia."
<p>The Pink Pound Conference in June 2006 UK featured Out Now Consulting MD as the Keynote Speaker.</p>
<p>Time magazine today covers the organisation. This year has seen Out Now Consulting covered in other media and in fact over 15 years Out Now Consulting has been frequently covered in news media in relation to the company's leading role in what is a new development in marketing - developing strategies to target gay consumers.</p>
<p>Some of these publications include: The Independent (UK) The Times (UK) The Guardian (UK) The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) The Australian (Australia) Business Review Weekly (Australia) Het Financieele Dagblad (Netherlands) De Morgen (Belgium)</p>
<p>TV appearances by Out Now Consulting staff have been many and include: BBC TV (UK) Jim TV (Belgium) TCN 9 (Australia) Nederland 1 (Netherlands).</p>
<p>There has been much other media coverage of Out Now Consulting's role in this development during this period.</p>
<p>In each case, Out Now Consulting is reported upon as a "significant player" in the "major news event" of - the emergence of a visible gay and lesbian consumer market. Perhaps to you that isn't a major news event but today's issue of Time magazine obviously does as the story about the emergence of gay advertising in Europe quoting Out Now Consulting's work is the one item from the current issue that Time magazine has chosen to highlight at the top of their homepage <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/" class="external free" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/europe/</a> and see also the article at <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060807-1220477,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060807-1220477,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060807-1220477,00.html</a></p>
<p>Other media events include the coverage in much UK media of the revelation that 49% of lesbian and gay people feel unable to come out at work. <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/53693" class="external free" title="http://www.sundayherald.com/53693" rel="nofollow">http://www.sundayherald.com/53693</a> (Scotland) and <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article341714.ece" class="external free" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article341714.ece" rel="nofollow">http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article341714.ece</a> - again media coverage of gay community research that Out Now Consulting was the significant player in.</p>
<p>I again request undeletion of the Out Now Consulting page.</p>

<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I am a mrketing student in the Netherlands, and have found the article on Out Now Consulting to be most helpful and of exceptional interest on the gay marketing phenomenon.</p>
<p>It was quite hard for me as well as other students to find the information that we needed, though there was plenty to say on the subject.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The current version is a stub whose history suggests that a great deal of promotional cruft was stripped out of it, and which seems objective and verifiable enough. The niche market this business is in suggests that it may be unusual enough to be more interesting than other firms of similar size; whether being interesting is enough to pass an article that otherwise probably fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is not something I have strong opinions about. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have obviously followed the various input with great interest as the author of this article. Some observations. With respect to <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a>, Morgan it is not really so simple as your rule of thumb suggests. For example, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">if Out Now Consulting gets more Yahoo hits</a> than <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">you yourself do</a> and MSN search <a href="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" class="external text" title="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" rel="nofollow">which also has far more Out Now entries</a> than <a href="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" class="external text" title="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" rel="nofollow">Morgan Wick entries</a> verifies this, then that seems to refute your logic for justifying deletion. 'Ask.com' also yields similar results - showing far more listings for <a href="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" class="external text" title="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" rel="nofollow">Out Now Consulting</a> than for <a href="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" class="external text" title="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" rel="nofollow">Morgan Wick</a>. Dare I say it, but this would, on your logic therefore seem to turn your 'delete' into a 'keep'. Without being disrespectful Morgan, I suspect that if you try applying that logic to much of what is in Wikipedia you could delete tens of thousands of entries right now. Many of the Morgan Wick entries that do come up actually seem not to relate to you, whereas all of the "Out Now Consulting" ones do seem to relate directly to the subject of this article. Even allowing all the Morgan Wick entries in these three main search engines to tally up towards you - we are left with a tally of just 834 listings for "Morgan Wick" (many of which seem not to actually be you), compared to 1368 web search entries in the four main search engines for "Out Now Consulting". That is just using the US engines. If we play the same game with other countries you see even more marked differences where your entries are much less. For example, in the UK web on Ask, there are no entries for Morgan Wick and 43 entries for Out Now Consulting, including entries from many of Britain's leading publications. For the record and for <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> too, some media coverage that results in much coverage of any organisation results from media releases put out by the organisation, that is hardly news to anyone. But much of the items deleted by him/her this morning should not have been as they fail to recognise several things. Out Now Consulting was established by Ian Johnson who is also the founder of the parent company Significant Others in Australia. As the firm's <a href="http://www.outnowconsulting.com/who.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.outnowconsulting.com/who.htm" rel="nofollow">own website</a> makes clear, the organisations function in concert and Out Now is a continuation of Significant Others work in non-Australian markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that Out Now is the only gay marketing agency with offices in more than one country is a fact unique to the entity and increases the organisation's notability.</p>
<p>The deletions by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> did far more than remove entries related to one survey. S/he removed many third party media reports of Out Now Consulting covering a range of issues, some related to Out Now's many different reports, some where the journalist sought Out Now Consulting as a notable source of expertise in its specific area. Given the extent to which s/he removed items and the little time it took for this user to do so I am somewhat concerned that s/he did not have time read through all these removed references sufficiently to see that they were clearly not just "a loosely related collection of references to brief mentions of [a single] survey". 37 minutes were spent deleting over 35 separate news articles, third party references and other citations from a range of sources. The article as left by this user this morning leaves only a single reference - to UK research from 2005 and removed everything else. There was also other research included previously. there was much more than reporting on research. For example, there were third party publications such as the Belgium Marketing Foundation, the Pink Pound Conference (UK), the Dutch marketing textbook "Principes van Marketing" (Principles of Marketing) also removed by this user - none of which was related to the British Gay Times and Diva research as s/he seemed to contend when removing it. On that point, where an esteemed newspaper such as the Sunday Independent - a leading national UK newspaper, devotes a double page spread feature article based primarily on, and extensively quoting research by, Out Now Consulting discussing a major workplace discrimination issue, which is also supported by remarks from other industry groups in the UK unrelated to Out Now Consulting, all commenting on the work of Out Now Consulting - does that not as <a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a> says: show Out Now Consulting to be a "company with major-media news coverage and that stands out in its industry/segment"? That seems to fall squarely within the Wikipedia guidelines as to notability for article's on companies being included.</p>
<p>For that matter, why would <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,1220477,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,1220477,00.html" rel="nofollow">Time magazine this week</a> in Europe choose to quote Out Now Consulting's opinion about the state of gay advertising in Europe if the company is not notable for readers of Time? That seems to fall within Wikipedia guidelines. That comment had absolutely nothing to do with the British research mentioned above. We were relied upon by the journalist of Time as a notable authority in the area of gay marketing. The magazine includes a photo of Out Now Consulting's campaign for the German National Tourist Office in their print edition as an example of gay advertising.</p>
<p>I note also that the comment made by the student 86.87.154.90 talk is a relevant one. Each week we usually receive several inquiries from students wanting our help. I agree our article is not SPAM to these students. Just today we received the following email -</p>
<p>"My name is Katharina and I study in Germany and have to write en essay for my university on gay marketing.It would be really helpful for me if you could send me some information, because it is such a new and present topic and I could not find any books so far. I would be really pleased if you could help me. Thank you very much, Katharina"</p>
<p>That sort of thing is fairly common here - if any of the Wikipedia editors wishes to contact me direct I would welcome them doing so to obtain more information about the similar student emails we regularly receive requesting assistance from Out Now Consulting with research about the gay market and other gay social issues. There really is a uniqueness to what we do - which is why media, students and others contact us. It is also why we are noted in such a leading textbook as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kotler" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kotler" rel="nofollow">Kotler's</a> <a href="http://www.managementboek.nl/boekeninfo.asp?CODE=ochqcqmnqr&amp;ReferrerID=2" class="external text" title="http://www.managementboek.nl/boekeninfo.asp?CODE=ochqcqmnqr&amp;ReferrerID=2" rel="nofollow">Principles of Marketing</a> textbook in section 4 about niche marketing. That has nothing to do with our research - it features a full page discussion of advertising we created for Lufthansa and South African Tourism in the Dutch market. It also seems to fall squarely within Wikipedia guidelines for inclusion.</p>
<p>Any of the above factors taken alone should make you think our firm is notable but when taken in concert, - and in respect of so many third party citations about the company (removed today by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a>) I believe firmly that such a combination of factors renders this article well worth keeping and Out Now Consulting notable as per Wikipedia guidelines. To delete everything in the previous entries down to just what was left there this morning seems not in keeping with the Wikipedia principles. Finally, just in case you did not pick up on it above I am the author of the article and am the MD of the firm, so you might be tempted to discount all I say trying to believe that our article is SPAM however it is not just me saying it.</p>
<p>The search engines, the students such as 86.87.154.90, users such as <a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgeo020_177d.html" title="User:Ageo020">Ageo020</a> and many media publications around the world seem to concur that our business has a unique industry position in a major new development in marketing. I would much prefer that there be restored some of what was deleted this morning from the article with a NPOV, and where third party items where the work of Out Now Consulting is the major aspect of the citation.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - To meet the notability criteria the the company should have been the <b>subject</b> of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.

<dd><b>Delete</b>. The largest piece of the text is "specialised gay marketing services to large companies by researching gay lifestyles and using the information to develop strategies to target gay consumers", which strikes me as a rather obvious or self-affirming statement and sounds like it was lifted directly from a PR or ad copy. Some arguments for keeping an article on this specific company don't compel me: they often speak of interest first in <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_marketing.html" title="Gay marketing">gay marketing</a> not specifically in this company, just that they happen ask this company directly for info about the general field. I see the existing page on the topic does have a section for listing of the major companies (a common and reasonable thing to have in such articles) and that does link to Out Now. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 16:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Answer for RHaworth: The method section of circular breathing article descibes "allowing the cheeks to deflate"... this would make articulation of words nearly impossible... it's a whole different technique.

<li>Actually, it isn't. Like <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkalai</a>, I've actually used this technique when singing, in emergences, <i>long</i> before Jack Black thought up a comedy song about it. The problem with the concept isn't that it doesn't exist. It is that it hasn't been properly documented anywhere. We cannot have an article until this concept has been properly documented outside of Wikipedia <i>first</i>. The problem isn't silliness. It is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiability</a>. We cannot take Sugarboogy phalanx's, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkalai</a>'s, or my words that this technique exists. We don't accept personal testimony of Wikipedia editors.

<li><b>Delete</b> Okay now c'mon!! If somebody wrote the first ever article about "Who's on First",.. but they wrote in the same veign in which the skit/bit was delivered, as if the team actually exists (I know it sounds obtuse, but hell, that's the device that made it so funny). Even if you had an extreme stick up yout butt about the sanctity of WP's credibility,.... you'd probably swarm round the article and correct it's overall theme to be (accurately) a description of comic/artistic work. I didn't write that article to test the boundaries of latency of WP, but to both inform AND amuse. It's amazes me that so many folks have put so much energy into "talking" about how this article should be DELETED,... but not one person has suggested the one most appropriate thing and the easiest most frequent thing done on WP... correcting the article so that one of TD's more notable tracks has an "appropriate" entry in WP... really, have you ever heard a better tirade of disgust than the spitting-mad burst (sections 1 or 2 in the bit, before and after the phrase "you sit in your tower nap..") that JB unleashes in the track..? Jack black didn't REALLY fire Kyle for naysaying his revolutionary invention, Spinal Tap isn't a real band, and "Who" wasn't REALLY on first... but would it have killed ya to play along for the sake of an infotaining article? Couldn't we have invented an appropriate header statement to frame such a thing (like "the following is a tongue-in cheek description in the comic veign of the Abbot and Costello performance piece"). Sugarboogy phalanx 14:53, 12 August 2006 (UTC) &gt;&gt;&gt;Addendum: Would not such a header statement also make possible a separate article about Santa Clause so that parents could show their kids without ruining it for them?? You DO know that the US Postal Service has never once returned a santa letter to sender as undeliverable... right? So am I to believe that WP now takes iteself MORE seriously than the US Postal... what a bummer if that's the case. Sugarboogy phalanx 15:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> after recent rewrite. I admit I am not deep in american pop culture. Now I can understand that "I'll be back" uttered in Arnold's thick german tone might be a cultural phenomenon, so I changed my vote, because the recent rewrtite provided an objective reason of notability.

It is just because the previous version of the article really sucked.

<p>non-notable band, does not meet criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> - one independent release and a MySpace page. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 02:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- After reviewing more documentation on Wikipedia, I believe I may have been in error when I posted the article. While the band has a fan base in the Greater Toronto Area and on the Internet, they may not not have had enough commercial success to warrant a Wikipedia article as of yet. The question is however: how many independent releases does a band need before they are immortalized with a Wikipedia page. In the history of music, there have been many bands which were obscure at the time that they were regularly performing.</p>
<p>Perhaps articles on independant bands who have had some commericial success but are largely unknown would be better suited to the proposed WikiMusic <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiMusic" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiMusic" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> site.</p>
<p>I don't agree with the argument that a band with a MySpace profile is irrelevant. Many bands have profiles on the site because MySpace is inherently useful for promoting entertainers.</p>
<p>I don't have any control over whether my article stays or goes but I think it deserves posting in some sort of wiki-form somewhere. I posted the article because I know they had a large fan base and because I have heard instrumental tracks from their second album.</p>
<p>Thanks Stormie for opening my eyes a bit. I'm gonna read some more documentation before I do much else.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No harm done, Codus. I do not think that Stormie was saying that having a MySpace profile makes a band irrelevant. What Stormie was saying is that having a MySpace profile does not automatically make a band relevant. If this band all of a sudden becomes popular outside of one small area, by all means make a Wikipedia article about it. Until then, though I am going to have to maintain my vote of delete. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielrocks123_a894.html" title="User:Danielrocks123">דניאל</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanielrocks123_3980.html" title="User talk:Danielrocks123">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danielrocks123_5c74.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danielrocks123">contribs</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Danielrocks123_a345.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Danielrocks123">Email</a></sup> 03:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>There are a ton of irrelevant articles on people with little or no notability. Search "independent musician" for comprehensive list. Asserting the notability of independent musicians seems like an exercise in futility. Most independent musicians with limited success are known only in their community. I don't have anything to lose from the article's deletion (other than time wasted), nor do I have anything to gain from it's acceptance. I wrote the article because I know the band has a following both in the GTA and on the Internet and therefore the likelihood that someone might search for information on the band on Wikipedia was good. It really is too bad that Wikipedia does not aim to collect information on all subjects, regardless of their overall relevance to the global community. Despite committment to notability, many wikipedia articles exist which list information about very obscure people.</p>
<p>Open Wide Music, like many artists in Canada, have yet to find commericial success on the scale comparible with American market, but they are not obscure in the culture of their city. In fact most Canadians bands are not well known until they break into the American market. Their lack of popularity outside their primary geographic location doesn't make them any less relevant to their fans. The only reason I am arguing for my article to stay is because I believe the band will generate a lot more fans upon the release of their second album which is likely going to be released in 2006. Once the band has a second independent release will they qualify for notability? Thanks for the taking time to participate in the discussion. Codus 19:21, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Everyone except Danielrocks has barely commented other to say "Delete it". This isn't discussion. It's a witchhunt for pages that don't interest you. I'm starting to feel very unwelcome in the Wikipedian community since no one is taking the time to discuss the issues I've raised above. I came here to discuss the issue because this is a discussion page yet there is very little actual discussion going on. 21:23, 11 August 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Codus (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodus_7791.html" title="User talk:Codus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Codus_1a2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Codus">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Codus, nobody wants you to feel unwelcome. I believe that I speak on behalf of the entire Wikipedia community when I ask you to continue editing. However, Open Wide Music clearly does not merit a Wikipedia page. Generally, editors do not write long paragraphs on AfD discussions. Rather, they write whether they feel it should be kept or deleted and briefly explain their opinion. In addition, AfD is not a witchhunt for pages that do not interest us. This is how we decide what pages deserve Wikipedia articles. Don't be discouraged because this article will be deleted. Instead, try working on other articles. Once you get the hang of Wikipedia, you'll be less likely to make the same mistake. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielrocks123_a894.html" title="User:Danielrocks123">דניאל ~~ Danielrocks123</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanielrocks123_3980.html" title="User talk:Danielrocks123">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danielrocks123_5c74.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danielrocks123">contribs</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Danielrocks123_a345.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Danielrocks123">Email</a></sup> 21:50, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is the guideline for whether or not a band is notable enough to be in Wikipedia. Usually the most relevant parts of it for independent bands are nationwide touring, album release on notable indie or major labels, or being featured multiple times in the media. A lot of bands end up in AfD discussions, and most are deleted based on these guidelines. I haven't heard of any the bands so far that I have seen in AfD, yet I vote "keep" on any that meet any one guideline of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Recreate the article when the band does tour Canada or has two albums on a significant label, and I'll certainly support keeping it. And I agree with Danielrocks - hang in there and write about what you know. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a> 02:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It survived a prod in March when it was branded advertising. It's a stub, barely more than a dicdef, now and hasn't changed much since then. It was proposed for deletion but, since that was its second prod, it has to go to AfD instead. Dictionary definition bordering on neologism, no cited sources, nothing that couldn't be adequately covered by the article on mortgages. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 02:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the second AfD. I am not satisfied with the arguments made in favour of a keep. This is simply a part of a public park that has no notability other than having an internet ranking, which is hardly adequate. I believe it should go as we obviously should not have articles on every public playground in Ipswich, let alone Brisbane, Queensland, Australia or the world itself. There is nothing noteworthy about this place and thus nothing worthy of being kept. It has also required clean up for over a year without attracting any significant attention. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 02:13, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

"As we get older there's nothing surer/The rich get richer and the poor get poorer" is in a sixties <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Rome_ac56.html" title="Harold Rome">Harold Rome</a> song from <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Can_Get_It_for_You_Wholesale_4cee.html" title="I Can Get It for You Wholesale">I Can Get It for You Wholesale</a>. More significantly, the very famous 1921 song <i>Ain't We Got Fun</i> does a <b>takeoff</b> on the phrase, showing that the phrase itself was proverbial at the time: "In the winter, in the summer/Don't we have fun/Times are bum and getting bummer/Still we have fun/There's nothing surer/The rich get rich and the poor get... children."

I say oddly, because it is <b>perfectly</b> clear from the context<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200041.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200041.txt" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> that he is <i>quoting</i> the song... in other words, Fitzgerald's novel proves that the song was wildly popular, and the popularity of the song shows that the phrase was really proverbial. I really think there's enough here for a legitimate short article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:59, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I said it should be kept as a frequently alluded-to catchphrase, but now I'm going further. Although the present article reads as unsupported opinion, if you glance over the Google hits, I'm convinced that much of the <b>present</b> content <i>can</i> be properly supported by source citations. E.g. "So the old saying 'The rich get richer and the poor get poorer" is not some kind of ironic paradox but an economic law as trim and tidy as Newton's Third Law of Motion: the rich get richer <i>when</i> the poor get poorer, and vice versa", C. Donald Loomis, <i>Radical Democracy</i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801484510&amp;id=vN-Hw3rVZh4C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=%22Rich+get+richer%22+%22poor+get+poorer%22&amp;sig=_fv9wmFZD2wMqfTZxydh1nuK5iU" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801484510&amp;id=vN-Hw3rVZh4C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=%22Rich+get+richer%22+%22poor+get+poorer%22&amp;sig=_fv9wmFZD2wMqfTZxydh1nuK5iU" rel="nofollow">p. 71</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> However interesting and mind-blowing the topic might be, this is an essay rather than article, and I can't imagine how it could be anything else. One might write a Wikiquote entry on that, but I can hardly imagine anybody searching for that in an encyclopedia. Moreover, the article is currently linked from userpages and one talk page, not including pages related to this AfD, and I can't imagine any other legitimate Wikilinks that could logically be generated without pushing. Last but not least, this article is extremely prone to become POV-slanted and generate unending debates and conflicts, certainly not helping with the informative purposes of an encyclopedia. All, in all, I can't see how this can be developed into a proper encyclopedic entry<br />
Please note that my opinion is not based on the current contents of the article, but my thought on what it may be and might become. I have only taken a brief look at the current article and not read it thoroughly, as I believe all issues with the text that could be fixed do not merit a deletion - only when an entry cannot be improved to become a proper encyclopedic its article deletion is legitimate.

<li>If it changed my view of this article, it's only for the worse (which is why I chose not to delve into the contents before I decide). As I presumed, it is an essay, of a rather poor quality, trying to tie a few different quotes to a catchphrase referenced (imprecisely) from a song and discuss some economic and sociological issues more or less loosely related to it. It is constructed as an essay and not as an encyclopedic article, because it tries ot gather different things related to some elusive topic rather than describe all the facts pertaining to a well-defined subject. And, as I said, I can't imagine it ever developing into the latter (i.e. proper encyclopedic article), so it has no place in an encyclopedia.

<li>None of those are reasons to delete. The distinction between essays and articles, in Wikipedia terms, is our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, which is not, apparently, what you are implying at all. You are apparently merely criticising the writing style, which is a matter of cleanup, not deletion. That nothing links to an article is not a reason to delete it. Neither is the fact that an article is a magnet for editors that want Wikipedia to become a soapbox a reason to delete it. (We don't delete <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>, for example.) To argue that an article will only ever be a stub, one has to argue that it is a topic that has not already been discussed in the world at large (which <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a>'s citation of C. Donald Loomis above disproves) or that the discussion of the topic is so trivial and peripheral that it is not enough to actually fill an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think I managed to get my message accross - the topic of this article is a purported "catchphrase and proverb", but the article goes to mention some more or less irrelevant issues and develop into an essay loosely based on the title. This is NOT an encyclopedic articlein the first place. Secondly, I believe that it would not be possible to create an encyclopedic article based on that, because the connections between different instances of the use of the "catchphrase" in popular culture are weak. See <a href="../../../a/y/b/AYBABTU_f73d.html" title="AYBABTU">AYBABTU</a> for a good article on a catchphrase, which does not resemble an essay on ideology (mostly because there fortunately is no major ideology connected to that).

<li>My immediate reaction to the article, given above, was to remember "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everybody_Knows_bc9c.html" title="Everybody Knows">Everybody Knows</a>", the relevant lines of which are "Everybody knows the fight was fixed. The poor stay poor, the rich get rich.". My second reaction to this was that having an article about a topic in economic theory at this title was as bizarre an idea as having an article about <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Ali_9e91.html" title="Muhammad Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> at I am the greatest. Looking at the sources, however, it appears that Leonard Cohen was correct. <i>Everybody does "know" this.</i> And, moreover, they cite <i>this</i> as the name of the purported economic law, even if they call it a cliché when they do so. (See Dietz and Cypher.) The topic of this particular economic trend, <i>correct or not</i>, has been the subject of much published work. What swung it for me was the books and papers. Not only have Reiman and Hapgood written whole books on this subject, Hayes has a whole paper in <i>American Scientist</i> discussing the modelling of free market economic systems to determine whether this maxim is true or not. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I only understand what you mean until you mention Cohen. But if what you mean is that this is an article on an economic theory, then it should be one. And perhaps there is a much more precise name for that, one has to dig deeper into the history of economics to find one. You won't find <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economies_of_scale.html" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> under It's cheaper to produce more.

<li>It shouldn't be an article about economic theory. It should be an article <b>about a phrase</b> that is so proverbial that it will virtually always used be invoked in any discussion of economic inequality. Although not a very good article, a comparable example would be <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_sucking_sound.html" title="Giant sucking sound">Giant sucking sound</a>. The article describing NAFTA should not be entitled <i>giant sucking sound.</i> But <i>giant sucking sound</i> should not simply redirect to NAFTA or to <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot</a> because it is now an idiom that pops up in any discussion of jobs being lost to neighboring regions. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is my parting message for this Article: I'm going the same way as Kaustuv, he knew what he was doing when he jumped ship on this one... This list is a mess and doesn’t even begin to encompass all the good/bad character articles related to Warcraft. The only thing this will lead to is: At best, a purging of a <i>few</i> bad articles. At worst, a complete annihilation of a slew of good <i>and</i> bad articles. I started some heavy research into these articles; an Excel document where I tried to at least organize this heap of articles. Through this process I discovered at least twice again as many articles that fit into this category better than Medivh! One didn't even exist ("Blackhand")! Some of the propositions stated below are very intelligent and the sadly failed objective of this article (to set a standard for AfDs brought up by WP:FICT) was a noble cause, but this is <i>not</i> the place that that is going to happen. My advice is to scrap this page before someone gets hurt, and try again with a more specific organized and comprehensive list.

<p><b>Old discussion</b></p>
<p><s>This is a group nomination of a series of Warcraft character pages. My deletion rationale is as follows, in bulleted form but not necessarily in order of importance.</s></p>
<ul>
<li><s>None of the characters are <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">notable</a> outside the Warcraft fandom. None of the articles provide a clue how to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> why the nominated characters are notable except as elements of the Warcraft plot.</s></li>
<li><s>There is already a page, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Warcraft_characters_df5f.html" title="List of Warcraft characters">List of Warcraft characters</a>, that has encyclopedic summaries of all of these characters. One might argue that <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> recommends splitting off articles on major characters to keep the list sized properly, but that does not obviate the need for individual notability of such characters.</s></li>
<li><s>Many of the character articles have long and detailed plot and biographical exposition. They skirt the boundary of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">game guide</a> territory, although they are for the most part not instruction manuals (i.e., they do not say how to kill the mobs for phat loot). I think this amount of detail is wrongly placed in Wikipedia. The common epithet for such articles is <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">gamecruft</a>, i.e., information that is only of interest to fans of the game.</s></li>
</ul>
<p><s>The information in these articles is freely (in the GFDL sense) available in a much more comprehensive form in <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a>, which I have linked using the legend "ww" for comparison purposes. Many of WP's articles are word-for-word duplicates of their WoWWiki entries (eg. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Placeholder_29ba.html" title="Captain Placeholder">Captain Placeholder</a>), cite their counterpart on WoWWiki (eg. <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakkar_the_Soulflayer_0d5a.html" title="Hakkar the Soulflayer">Hakkar the Soulflayer</a>), or are completely unsourced (eg. <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grom_Hellscream_8165.html" title="Grom Hellscream">Grom Hellscream</a>). There is even a template, {{<a href="../../../w/o/w/Template%7EWowwiki_511a.html" title="Template:Wowwiki">wowwiki</a>}}, designed to help citations of WoWWiki easier. I should hardly have to point out that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Bulletin_boards.2C_wikis_and_posts_to_Usenet" title="WP:RS">wikis do not qualify as reliable primary or secondary sources</a>.</s></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Guess I'll be the first. First and foremost, wikipedia is not an indescriminant collection of information. It is not a game guide. Such things can be promoted and listed on other, more in depth websites, such as, in this case, <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a>. As its already word-for-word copies. Delete them all. We even have an interwiki link for it, <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/" class="extiw" title="wowwiki:">wowwiki:</a>. Add to that the nom's notes about verifiability. Is this interpreted material? If so its original research on wowwiki, and is not a good source for information here. Is it paraphrased from a game manual? Its copyvio then. I see so much wrong with this set of articles as a result. A list would be a much better place for this. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 02:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> individual articles, an annotated list might not be bad, but this level of detail is not necessary for a general encyclopedia and the distiction between cannon/OR and fan fic makes these kind of articles especaiily problematic for wikipedia.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 02:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Relist separately</b>: There are simply too many articles with too many different variables here for us to consider them all together. Some characters obviously need to be merged back to the list or another article (such as captain placeholder). Other characters are obvious keeps (such as Grom, Jaina, Uther Sargeras, etc).
<ul>
<li><strike><b>Comment</b> it would be better if you point out which characters are "obvious keeps" and why, so I can withdraw the nom for just them. I hardly think most, a majority, or even many of these characters are major characters. I personally have no taste for 49 separate AfDs on Warcraft characters. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 04:34, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</strike>
<ul>
<li>Separate AfD's runs the risk of inconsistent outcomes. Propose subsections for those articles where a special argument may be made. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 04:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here is a list. Many of these characters are mentioned in various print publications apart from the games: Archimonde, Arthas Menethil, Balnazzar, Grom Hellscream, Gul'dan, Illidan Stormrage, Jaina Proudmoore, Kel'Thuzad, Malfurion Stormrage, Mannoroth, Medivh, Orgrim Doomhammer, Prince Kael'thas, Sargeras, Sylvanas Windrunner, Tichondrius, Tyrande Whisperwind, Uther the Lightbringer. And yes, separate AfDs do run the risk of inconsistent outcomes, but if you want to make a policy page, go make one and debate it and achieve consensus. Otherwise, you should delete an article based on its own indivudal merits, not merely because of an attempt to establish some sort of policy/precedent. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 04:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>As I said before, these articles deserve <b>separate</b> nominations so that they can be deleted or kept on their own merit, and not because someone wants to establish some sort of precedent. Also, it should be noted that we don't delete articles simply because they don't cite their sources, many articles are kept so that we can take the time and effort necessary to source them properly. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 05:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><strike>I think you are misreading the nomination. That this AfD will be cited as precedent is a statement of what I expect will be the case, because of which I warn participants to carefully consider their votes. The reasons for the deletion were clearly specified in the nomination; nowhere have I listed establishing a precedent as a reason for deletion. As to unsourced articles, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) is a core policy here. The week long AfD process will give interested editors plenty of time to add support for the keep votes with proper sourcing, which will increase the objective quality of these articles independently of the outcome of this AfD. I suspect we have an irreconcilable difference of opinion on the means used in this AfD, so let us agree to disagree as long as you accept my reasons for what they plainly state, not as a cover for a hidden motive. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 05:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</strike></li>

Observe the amount of attention in the latter paid to citing a wide range of sources, and assertions of notability outside the Zelda fandom. I am willing to accept that some of the nominated (but not a majority or even a large portion of them) might meet the threshold of "major character", but short of becomming a seasoned Warcraft player overnight I have no way of verifying it. The articles certainly give me no clue how I might verify if some character is a major character or not.

<li><b>Comment</b> Umm... Archimonde is a major character.. And why do you AfD when you have no knowledge of the subject at hand? Shouldn't it be up to the editors who actually work on these articles to decide if they are verifiable or not? Deleting them won't give us any chance to state reliability, verifiability or even work with the articles. And yes, I do see it as a bad faith nomiation, because you state yourself that you have no knowledge of the subject. I have no knowledge about anything relating to LotR other then what I have seen in the movies, does that mean I can go and AfD every character bio on Wikipedia for that lore, stating "<i>I have no knowledge of this, so therfor it must be right of me to delete them.</i>" Hiding behind <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is all good, but not if you have no chance yourself to state WHY the characters are not major. From the list you compiled I see most of them as major characters in the lore of Warcraft, which is also the reason they have their own article, and deleting them would be foolish. What you could have done instead of this AfD was to go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Warcraft_4592.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Warcraft">Wikipedia:WikiProject Warcraft</a> and ask us to verify them before you nominate them, you could have started a dialoge with the community behind these article, and not just outright AfD them. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 07:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If these articles are deleted on the basis that <i>you</i> don't find them to be anything <i>major</i>, it so absolutly gives me the right to do so with other "lesser known" characters, places etc. from other lores. This AfD for me will set precedence for other articles of the same type. If the nominator can state "I have no idea what this is about, but I feel myself that X, Y, Z, is not a major character and should therefor be deleted from Wikipedia." why can't I do the same? It's all in the eye of the beholder, he dosn't see this as anything major, but it is for many of us, and AfDing it in my book is just disrespectful if you have no grasp on the subject matter. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 07:50, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

What, is owning the game and being immersed in the whole atmosphere a requirement now to edit and make informed decisions about the status of the articles? He should, as an outsider, be able to discern from the article why the subject of the article is notable, and if he can't, then it should either be reworked to make it notable or be deleted. He has chosen the latter path. Hbdragon88 08:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the fact that the articles are not currently sourced properly is no reason to delete them. The Warcraft universe is propably the most notable universe in computer gaming. Many published books have been written about this universe which could potentially be used as reliable sources. The nominator states that he has no knowledge of this topic and the thing to do here would have been to start a dialogue with the WikiProject, not dump everything in this AfD. This is just further evidence that there are many Wikipedians who look contemptuously at video game content and what they consider "fancruft". This is not fancruft, this is not "gameguide". If this had not been from a video game but from the Lord of the Rings or the Simpsons, this would never have been allowed to come this far: <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAjaxfan_0d97.html" title="User:Ajaxfan">Ajaxfan</a> 09:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You sir are wrong again, as per point 2 in WP:FICT, which I am asking you now to read. <b>"Non-notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice. The list(s) should contain all characters, races, places, etc. from the work of fiction, with links to those that have their own articles."</b> So in any case this should never have been put up for deletion as it should have been put up for merging if you feel they are non notable minor cahracters. This AfD should be closed, its breaking the very first two rules that deal with Fictional characters. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 10:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I personally think World of Warcraft is crap, but this kind of nomination is silly: deleting every article here would justify cleaning out tens of thousands of other fiction-related articles from TV series, movies, and the like simply because they "weren't notable enough in the real world." While one has to take notability into account when keeping or deleting articles, this kind of deletionism is not going to get Wikipedia anywhere.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Warcraft is not just "WoW". World of Warcraft is just a game based on the long established universe that is Warcraft. The legacy of Warcraft is akin to many other works, such as Tolkien's Middle Earth. Warcraft spawns books, video games, board games, clothing, and other things related to the fiction works. To say all the character profiles should be removed is ridiculous.--<a href="../../../n/d/r/User%7ENdrfx_766f.html" title="User:Ndrfx">Ndrfx</a> 05:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Should a bunch of these be merged together? Yes. Is that something for AfD? No. Nominating 30 articles at a time never works out well. There's no way to go through and say this one is notable, that one isn't, etc. Trying to set a precedent by nominating a mass of articles is almost <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> 15:08, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Once Kaustav's comments are gone, I don't see how this discussion could possibly have been considered to be "heading fairly close to a delete consensus". If these articles are simply deleted, then it opens the door to deleting pretty much every fictional character from wikipedia. This is a compilation of the major and supporting characters from an extremely notable video game series; the precedent this would set would be chilling. We might as well say goodbye to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_%28character%29_66bc.html" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry_Potter_(character)</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke_Skywalker</a>, if fictional characters are not worthy of the attention of wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is pretty clear - major characters get their own pages, and minor characters should be merged into a list. And yes, video games fall under those guidelines, unless we want to have a discussion on if video games are an inherently inferior medium. Even if some of the characters in this AFD are believed to be relatively minor, AFD is NOT the appropriate medium to debate their notability relative to one another in preparation for a merge. That can be done elsewhere. If the quality of the articles is a problem, then please, help fix them - but there's no reason to set a precedent of deleting every fictional character from wikipedia. JoshWook 17:48, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - many of the characters are also part of Wc3 which does not have its own wiki and therefore a delete would cause all information about these characters to be lost from people only interested in Wc3 and not WoW. <a href="../../../t/c/l/User%7ETclphz_3fbe.html" title="User:Tclphz">eventine</a> 17:57, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I feel that the fiction represented by these characters and the universe in which they reside is notable enough for them to merit their own articles.

<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I should say that I, a very long time ago, worked on several Starcraft-related pages which were later deleted. I wasn't too happy about that, but I completely understand that 'Starcraft battlecruiser' (for example) is probably comfortably in that obscurity/cruft zone. I cannot say the same for the character pages nominated here. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustinZ_c334.html" title="User:AustinZ">AustinZ</a> 03:05, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep with cleanup</b> - currently all the articles <i>appear</i> to be OR. They all need to be tagged for verification, and if reliable sources can't be found, then they should be deleted.

No, I'm not going to do that, because I resepct that people do find that interesting, and the whole point of an Encylopedia is to teach people new things, and if only one person learns something, or get's some re-newed knowledge about the subject, then it's all good.

<li>First of all, this is not a "vote". Secondly, whether or not my opinion is "void" is not at your discretion. In fact, you clearly missed my point: the examples you gave are more valid not because they are older but because they "have a much more established place in literature and culture as a whole". Yes, that established place in culture can come with age, but age was not my reason for deleting these articles. These are characters from video games, and nobody else is interested in them. Six million people (the supposed number of Warcraft players, according to your entry above) is a drop in the bucket compared to the readership of Lord of the Rings and Marvel comics. That's what makes this cruft. This is nothing personal; I vote the same way on articles about minor Star Wars characters, Dragon Ball Z characters, etc. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 13:36, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>These characters reaching 6 million people is more notable then the names of most towns we have articles on in Wikipedia oddly enough. Also you still have not shown that any of these characters are not known, some of them are main characters and as per WP:FICT specifically get their own articles when they do not fit in the main article. The minor characters get merged into one article, further making this the wrong place to seek merging and making deletion wrong all together.

<li><s><b>Reduce</b> Just some ideas. I think most of the characters on this list, in all actuality can be deleted. Most are just extra information that can be found on WoWWiki (as stated above). There are a few that, in my opinion, should be kept. Capt. Placeholder for example is a very unique character in WoW and borders on meme status. If only one out of the whole list was to be kept, he would be the one. Another possible criteria for deletion could be "stub status". Any of the above mentioned characters that are marked as stubs should be deleted, but the others left. Seeing as most of the articles on the list are stubs, this would reduce its numbers, but keep the prevalent articles. Finally, I think all city/race leaders’ articles can be kept as they are important characters not only to WoW, but to the entire Warcraft universe. Their individual histories are important to the canon of Warcraft. On top of that, they are not "enemies" and therefore would not merit sections based on strategies or loot tables. <a href="../../../o/r/c/User%7EOrcShaman42_2110.html" title="User:OrcShaman42">OrcShaman42</a> 13:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

My reason for the comparison is that while I think that these articles and the Snape article contain some OR and need cleanup, the existence of a Snape article is not a problem in and of itself.

<li>Believe me, I've read it. I've done a lot of work on fiction articles (and videogame articles, for that matter) and I'm well aware of the guideline.

<li>
<ul>
<li>Can you show me the policy that states fictional characters need to meet WP:V and notability independently from their own main article, even though they are being split because they size of the article not their own notability. See what you fail to understand is that WP:FICT states to give them their own articles, not because they are notable characters to the world, or that they deserve their own articles without an article on the main story but, because there is no room in the main article and we work with article size contraints. So notability and WP:V are not applicable here, these arent really articles on their own because they meet policy, they are articles on their own cause they do not fit in the main article. Which is why I keep telling you to read WP:FICT. Because it states you can off shoot articles for main characters when the main article gets too big, and states nothing of them needing to be article worthy on their own, because then there would be really no point to stating you can create seperate articles for them, cause that would be common sense if they were already notable to the world and verifiable outside of the media in which the fictional character exists. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 17:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I will say again, <b>there is no policy on notability</b>. There are guidelines. And what the guideline actually says is that characters can be broken off into their own articles <i>if</i> the information is <b>encyclopedic</b>. I contend that this is not encyclopedic, because in order for information to be encyclopedic at Wikipedia it must be notable, verifiable, and obtained from a trustworthy source. What the guideline recommends is combining them on one page, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_in_the_DiMeo_Crime_Family_bd4c.html" title="List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family">List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:59, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That is for minor characters, again read WP:FICT, this is my last reply to you as it seems you are just refusing to acknowledge WP:FICT at all which is odd since your example is a list of minor characters being put on a page as per WP:FICT. Again they are minor characters, which is point 2 of WP:FICT, now just acknowledge point 1 and we are all done. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 18:03, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I will say to you <i>again</i> that WP:FICT is not a policy. It's a suggestion. There are no hard and fast criteria to decide which characters are major and which are minor. Who decides that? Fans of the genre? Fans of that particular universe? Fans of that specific character? The Sopranos list came to mind because the Sopranos community had a problem with a fan who absolutely insisted that a certain character was "major". The line is not black and white as you are trying to make it seem. In cases such as that (and such as this), whether or not a character is "major" is subject to consensus, which is what we are trying to reach here. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:19, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

I just happened to agree with him, and I was willing to put up with many kilobytes more bullshit than he was. AfD is actually used for merging <i>quite often</i>. You'll know that after you spend a bit more time here. I do agree with you, though, that it's not for determining whether characters are minor or major. I think they're minor, therefore <b>cruft</b>, and that's really the end of it as far as my stance is concerned. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:45, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Comment</b> I hate to have to be the nanny, but can we keep stop the flaming/trolling and get back to the real issue please? Correct me if I'm wrong, but we are not debating definitions of article types or WP essays, we are debating <i>specific articles</i> on the AfD list. There is no reason to drag this page on and on with selfish and wasteful personal attacks. Let's just get this over with, I know there are other things we would all like to be doing (maybe).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:OrcShaman42 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EOrcShaman42_7b7f.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:OrcShaman42">contribs</a>).</small></s></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd recommend closing this AfD and <b>relisting</b> the less notable ones for deletion. Consensus seems to be that we can't categorically delete each of these entries, so far as I can tell. Especially since the relevant deletion arguments are "<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>," which certainly can't be covered for every article at once. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 20:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A little more support for this stance: "In cases such as that (and such as this), whether or not a character is "major" is subject to consensus, which is what we are trying to reach here" is Kafziel's (very reasonable) position, which is again better served through discussion on individual pages. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 20:04, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Completely agreed. Kaustauv was right in predicting a drawn-out, uncivil no consensus that would lead to nowhere. Any time more than a dozen articles of varying quality is put up for AFD, we're going to end up with nothing more than shouting matches. The reason for that is that trying to delete big portions of wikipedia en masse is an attempt to circumvent the policy-making procedure. If policy is to be changed, do it, because right now there is no policy that justifies deleting every one of these all at once simply because they are game characters. Otherwise look at each article one at a time and decide on its own merits. JoshWook 20:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Leave it alone</b> until someone decides they have time to merge it or care enough to merge the "minor" characters in to the main article they should be in. That entire "these other things have cultural importance, warcraft doesn't" seems a little weak. It's probably just that people have different levels of exposure to different sections of "culture". I think its better to leave this "cruft" if some people find it useful. <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cackalacky.html" title="Cackalacky">Cackalacky</a> is an example of this where Wikipedia having something minor was useful to me, even though some people on the discussion had never heard of it.<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustbobdanish_d593.html" title="User:Justbobdanish">Justbobdanish</a> 21:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Originally the article creator had a related article that <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Promethian_society_85c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Promethian society">went through AFD</a> and was merged back into the parent article. There was also Prometheanism (philosophy), which seems to have been the same author trying to create the article, until it was later changed to a redirect to the original article. Some editors have tried to revise the article to prevent it from being a copyvio of the website linked, but this seems to be difficult to do because the website linked is apparently the <i>only source on Prometheanism</i>. Hence the nn and vanity clause.

<dd>You nominate it and I'll give you my opinion at the AFD. There's at least a degree of difference between "I picked up a book and copied out what it says" lists, which are verifiable and sourceable by adding the book(s) the material was extracted from as reference(s) (i.e. there are two lists of High Kings of Ireland in Frank Byrne's <i>Irish Kings and High Kings</i>, albeit neither matches the main list in the article in question), and "who knows where this stuff came from&#160;?" ones like this. The fate of both articles should be to be reduced to verifiable, and thus shorter, lists. However, we're now at AFD for the Limbaugh list, so the time for eventualism is past. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the following reasons.
<ul>
<li>I am new to wikipedia, but if what I hear is really true--that, for example, lists and descriptions of each and every Simpsons episode reside here--then I don't see how Limbaugh jargon qualifies for deletion. "Unverified through anything other than listening to [or watching] the show" (quoting CrazyRussian above) &#160;? Check. "of limited interest to a circumscribed minority"? Check. Simpsons episodes and Limbaugh jargon must plead guilty to both charges.</li>
<li>As for a positive argument for "keep," I endorse what the "absolutely keep" entry said above: "Limbaugh jargon is used to parody and satirize the object of the jargon. It is a distinguishing feature of his program and therefore required for a encyclopedic entry."</li>
<li>As for the verifiability problem:
<ul>
<li>This can be fixed for most entries in this article. For example, a lexis-nexis search on " 'feminazi' AND 'limbaugh' " yielded 120 results in "major papers" and five in "magazines and journals." I am sure that among those is an article that could be cited where relevant information about "feminazi" could be mined.</li>
<li>For any entry that cannot be found in published articles, it would suffice to reference a date when the term was heard on Limbaugh's show, since audio archives of the show are available.</li>

<li>Yeah, I saw that. Also wanted to chime in and mention the Wikiquote option that we used on Levin, which helped win over those opposed to outright deletion of the list.

<li>Yes, there are many items in that list that should be pared. However, the list itself should stay.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b>. This was not normal weather...and of course it's a product of recentism. Why should we delete recent articles just because a similar cold wave 40 years ago would not have gotten an article? Honestly, it's outrageous that this should be considered for deletion at all. This killed, what 100+ people over there? And produced record cold and record snowfall in areas that don't normally see snowfall. If a similar event occurred in the United States, nobody would be freaking out over the inclusion of this article. This was a huge event in Europe; did anybody notice how much news coverage it got? However, I think that the snowstorm in Portugal article should be <b>merged</b> into 2006 European cold wave.

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. There is substantial support among established commenters that this word has now reached encyclopedic notability. The name "Santorum" will be redirected to the Senator, as I think consensus and common sense demand. There is widespread support for Santorum (neologism) as a renaming, but neologisms don't belong in Wikipedia: the result of this debate thus compels a different title. Santorum (sexual slang) is adopted as the most popular option consistent with WP:NOT. The question of how, exactly, to disambig. (a delicate matter, considering the Senator is deserving of personal respect, per BLP), I will leave to talk page discussion. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:28, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Change to <b>Keep and rename</b>, per various notes below. I agree it's notable; my complaint is really about the listing as a neologism when I don't see any usage evidence, only notability evidence. I also agree it probably deserves its own article now, rather than just a section in <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a>. Per Kaustuv Chaudhuri, I think <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> should go to the senator, and I also agree that the article should discuss the impact or political action; the coinage and its meaning should be given but not treated as being in current usage. (With reference to a couple of suppositions below, my objections to this are all about currency, not politics.) I'm also not sure what to call the article -- I suppose "Santorum (neologism)" is the best idea, though I'd really like to see something that doesn't imply the usage is widespread. Barring a better wording I'm happy with "Santorum (neologism)". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 00:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: with regard to the ADS citation, I contacted Jesse Sheidlower, who is a member of the ADS and was at the meeting at which the word was nominated. (Jesse is Editor-at-Large for the Oxford English Dictionary.) I'd like to introduce his comments into this debate, not as a final authority, but as informative. If they are relevant but regarded as needing verification I'll see what I can do about making them verifiable. Anyway, he said that the ADF listing "should not be cited as proof of currency", and went on to say with regard to selection for those categories that "the only criterion is that someone nominates it. Many of the words we select, esp. for categories such as 'most outrageous', are stunt words with no real currency. The nomination or election of a word in one of the ADS words-of-the-year categories has nothing to do with whether the word is truly current." Finally, I asked him if he personally thought the word had currency, and he said "I don't think it has any real currency". Personally I think the nomination supports the notability of the political act but does not support the currency of the term. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 14:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (italicized comments from the WP:NEO talk page) <i>In my opinion, an article about the political act is verifiable if there are news citations. The word 'santorum' is clearly an integral part of that act, and its usage and meaning within the context of the political action is verifiable from the news sources</i> [so within context it is a verifiable neologism]. <i>However, it would not be OK to go around adding santorum as a technical term within articles on, say, anal sex (although again mentioning it within the context of the political act would be ok).</i> Regarding whether it should be merged, an article for a political act by a notable person is distinct from other articles concerning the person, and I think that Santorum has a life separate from its genesis in Savage Love. The article, however, should focus on the act, and not just on a dicdef or it is inappropriate for WP.

<dd>I agree 100% that a reader curious about santorum-the-frothy-mix shouldn't need to know that it was coined by Dan Savage or that it appeared in Savage Love. However, we don't know what a user who types in "santorum" as a Go word is looking for. If a user searching for information on the Senator... particularly one of the Senator's supporters... types in "Santorum" as the "go" word, he or she should not be subjected to material which he or she might find offensive... should not, if you like, be subjected to symbolically being soiled with santorum! The obvious solution is for <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> to be, as before, a disambiguation page which a) makes clear that "santorum" is a sexually explicit neologism, b) makes it easy for the reader who wants to know what it means to find out, and c) also makes it easy for the reader who does <i>not</i> want to know what it means to remain ignorant of its meaning. It's not Wikipedia's job to force awareness of Savage's opinion on anyone. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:18, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a separate issue from having an article on the frothy-mix meaning. Your standard (which I agree with) would be met if <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> were a dab page, referring people to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Santorum_41a3.html" title="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum</a> and to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28neologism%29.html" title="Santorum (neologism)">Santorum (neologism)</a> without saying exactly what the neologism meant. Your standard would also be met if <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> redirected to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Santorum_41a3.html" title="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum</a>, and the latter had a note at the top along the lines of, "For the use of Rick Santorum's last name as sexual slang, see <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28neologism%29.html" title="Santorum (neologism)">Santorum (neologism)</a>." I'd be satisfied with either of those alternatives, but I think the latter is preferable, because most of those typing in "Santorum" will want the Senator's article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 15:16, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Both of these are perfectly fine with me.

It's tricky, though, because someone who types in the full term <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Santorum_41a3.html" title="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum</a> probably is <i>not</i> looking for the neologism. On the one hand, it doesn't seem right to have <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> be a dab page that seemingly gives equal weight to both disambiguations; on the other hand, it seems a little inappropriate to put a frothy mixture of you-know-what right at the top of the Rick Santorum article.</dd>

<dd>The other terms don't really belong on the dab page, because they are not commonly abbreviated to "Santorum," but I've always thought they added value to the page—someone typing in Santorum might well want an overview of all articles with Santorum-related content. And, quite frankly, I've thought they served a useful purpose in diluting the santorum, so to speak; the dab page is 75% devoted to material about the Senator and only 25% to the notable attack on the Senator.

<li>I think it's relevant that <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Dan Savage</a> asked his readers to Googlebomb the term, and deliberately move it up to the top of the list. <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=16305" class="external text" title="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=16305" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s the article where he does so.

<ul>
<li>That the first result is an effect of Googlebombing is certainly relevant. I disagree that we can't deduce anything from it, however. We can deduce something very simple: more people have linked "Santorum" to the "frothy mix" than to the Senator's home page. That's actually saying quite a lot, considering all the political websites (neutral and pro-) that must be linking to the Senator's page, and all the mainstream media sites that link to the Senator when they cover him, etc. There are so astoundingly many links to the Senator's home page as to have made it the number 2 result out of "about 4,580,000" yet all those links have been outvoted, plain and simple. — <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">Coelacan</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">talk</a> 23:09, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP: Defining Santorum thusly, as it is used on the street, is no different than using the term "Comstockery" which is now used in everyday parlance. In this instance, the name of a conservative prude had taken on negative connotations because of his condemnation of certain acts. It is no different, and I'm certain the Comstock family has long survived the realities of the polysemous nature of discourse.

<li>No, no, not better liked by any means. I mean more popular in the sense that santorum the excrement is more noteworthy than the senator.

<li>Because Google Web hits are easily manipulated, I'm going to try the same test on Google Groups (i.e. USENET) which theoretically is easily manipulated too, but people rarely bother, and Google Books, which is quite hard to manipulate (but due to the time it takes to write and publish books has a time lag). I don't know yet how these tests will come out.

A comment on the previous deletion feedback: I thought Wikipedia was not under the control of opinionated, hypocritical people who self-style themselves as critics and experts.

Over the years it has given his music room to breath. His music follows its own path with deep direction and soulful lyrics. Never losing touch with what commercial radio feels to be "listener-friendly."</p>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Discounting socks and newbies, the consensus seems fairly solid. As Jayjg points out, lists of this sort implicate fundamental questions of NPOV; at the very least, selectively permitted some "terrorist by nationality" lists and not others is problematic. As suggested also, imprecise definitions of "terrorist" and "Pakistani" call into question whether the list is meaningful and maintainable. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> This is not about Pakistani terrorists operating within Pakistan. This is about terrorist of Pakistani origin (most of them not Pakistani citizens), operating outside of Pakistan. <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viriditas.html" title="Viriditas">Viriditas</a> has been vandalizing the article, he has been removing the contents withought justification. This is an article containing a list and not a category. The information used for the article is widely published and readily available.

<ul>
<li>The list you created is original research which duplicates an already existing category. Your definition of who is or isn't Pakistani is subjective and open to interpretation, and in the case of Haq, you list him as a terrorist based on your beliefs and not on reliable sources. Furthermore he was US-born, so how does that make him a Pakistani terrorist? Ramzi Yousef's nationality is disputed, Hasib Hussain was born in the UK, as was Shehzad Tanweer, Mohammad Sidique Khan, and Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh. The article as it stands is not based on objective criteria and reads as original research. You've also added speculative content to the article; Wikipedia does not engage in forecasting the future, as the "Yet to be named" news section you've added implies. And, who are the "Murderers of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre", and if they can't be named, how do you know they are Pakistani terrorists? Also, the external links you provide do not seem to substantiate the article you created. Just because a UK-born terrorist might have a Pakistani father, does not imply that such a person is a "Pakistani terrorist"; that is your original research. More importantly, Wikipedia convention appears to categorize terrorists after their place of birth, not by the ethnicity or nationality of their mother or father as you are doing. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 06:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment: Question of nationality</b>&#160;;<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a>'s text justifies why the article is called "Terrorists of Pakistani origin" (and not "Pakistani terrorists").

<li>We use nationality for categorization for the sole reason that it is verifiable. How do you even begin to verify "descent"? This is completely absurd and serves no useful, informative, or encyclopedic purpose other than to push POV and original research. What does it mean to be of "Pakistani origin" and how do you verify it? We don't list occupations in this way for that reason. What's next, List of engineers of Indian origin? <a href="../../../i/n/d/Category%7EIndian_engineers_fc74.html" title="Category:Indian engineers">Category:Indian engineers</a> exists because it is verifiable and helps sort the engineer category.

<li><b>Keep</b> it is a notable list and one that shouldn't be hard to source. If it is not possible to source the ethnicity then it's OR and will have to go but otherwise there do not appear to be any reasons to delete.

(PC is itself a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in any case.)

The term Pakistani origin is v v much debatable, you can also say the person was from an Indian origin as Pakistan used to be part of India, you can also say British empire origin as India was a colony, you can also say more.

2. The article using only well known sources, articles with similar theme have been published in newspapers. The topic has also been addressed in books. It has been widely discussed that ethnic links are often used for recruiting.<br />
3. There is no crystal-ball gazing. Only facts that are reported by publications.<br />

<li>The article duplicates <a href="../../../p/a/k/Category%7EPakistani_terrorists_549d.html" title="Category:Pakistani terrorists">Category:Pakistani terrorists</a>, as we categorize terroists by nationality, not by ethnicity. It appears you created the article to attack Muslims and people of Pakistani descent, and this is not acceptable, nor encyclopedic. For the most part, the article consists of original research, since many of the terrorists you list cannot be accurately described as "Terrorists of Pakistani origin", either because their nationality is disputed, their ethnicity cannot be verified, or in some cases they may have dual nationalities and multiple ethnicities. You have engaged in crystal ball gazing many times, the most notable being your repeated inclusion of <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naveed_Afzal_Haq_168c.html" title="Naveed Afzal Haq">Naveed Afzal Haq</a> on the list, even after it was explained to you that he is not officially classified as a "terrorist".

Terrorism is not longer contained within the borders of individual nations. We are considering aspects of international terrorism here. Pakistanis in UK often marry their relatives from Pakistan, they visit Pakistan frequently (nothing wrong with those), but these ties are exploited by recruiters. Many UK Pakistanis also interact with militants in Pakistan when they are there.

<li>Er, did you even bother to look at the links? Just because Rob adds so-called refs, doesn't mean they support his case. Why don't you look at them? Rob claims that Pakistani ethnicity is an important component of terrorism, but this pet theory is <i>not</i> supported by any one reference he has posted, nor can those who have emigrated to other countries be accurately described as Pakistani in all cases. Since when has Wikipedia become a platform for Rob's pet theories? There are many things that have contributed to terrorism, and ethnicity does not happen to be one of them. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 20:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Badgering these users who want to keep is not going to help your cause to get the article deleted. Remember, <b>this is not a vote</b>. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunglecat_ec45.html" title="User:Junglecat"><font color="green">JungleCat</font></a> <small><a href="../../../j/u/n/User_talk%7EJunglecat_4799.html" title="User talk:Junglecat"><font color="blue">talk</font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Junglecat_98e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Junglecat"><font color="blue">contrib</font></a></small> 20:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>So, asking a relevant, topical question is now considered badgering? That's very interesting. Call it whatever you like. Nids explicitly offered more reasons for keeping this artice. I'm taking him up on his offer. Question for nids: Why should we keep articles composed of unverified original research related to racial "descent"? The page lists Hamid Hayat as a terrorist, although he's never been one. The page lists the Heathrow ammonium nitrate case, although this is a case of suspected terrorism, not actual, with the suspects coming from Muslim family originally from Pakistan. Ramzi Yousef says he was born in Kuwait, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed says he spent time in Kuwait as well, so why are they listed as Pakistani terrorists and not Kuwaiti? Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh was born in the UK, and details about his racial "descent" are not mentioned. How is an article composed of original research and unverified information useful to an encyclopedia? —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 20:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>viriditas, you are right in saying that unverified claims should not enter the articles. But are you also rejecting the verified claims. And what about the books mentioned above. Are you saying that all are racially motivated. I feel that reasons cited above are enough. If you can be particular that why are you against this page, that shall be helpful. Even i will support you if you say that no original research shall be there. but what about documented claims, and the books noted above.<a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidhishsinghal_5350.html" title="User:Nidhishsinghal">nids</a> 20:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Where does it say that Hamid Hayat was a terrorist? I don't see that. Perhaps you should read it again. In any case, this merely demonstrates the subjectivity of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Category%7ETerrorists_ec32.html" title="Category:Terrorists">Category:Terrorists</a> and the fluidity of the definition you are using. In other words, this is not objective by any stretch of the imagination. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 02:59, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Viriditas, you write <i>"Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh was born in the UK, and details about his racial "descent" are not mentioned"</i>. The linked Wikipedia article <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Omar_Saeed_Sheikh_3105.html" title="Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh">Ahmed_Omar_Saeed_Sheikh</a> mentions "is a British-born terrorist of Pakistani descent" right in the beginning. The BBC profile <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1804710.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1804710.stm" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> states "His father, Saeed Ahmed, was a Pakistani clothes merchant from Wanstead" in the second paragraph. In both cases his descent is prominently mentioned.

<ul>
<li>What is the nature of Sheikh's "descent" and how is it applicable? You are arguing that ethnicity is an important part of Terrorism, so surely you should be able to provide details, such as the name of his particular ethnic group and a citation showing a clear correlation. You can't and you haven't, except for posting a link to a book that mentions the word "Pakistan" once, and a link to an article in <i>The Guardian</i> about the relationship between ethnic groups and religion. You're very good at original research; perhaps you should publish your own article outside of Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 03:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is arguably an <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttack_page_c5ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Attack page">attack page</a>. NPOV and fact-research problems in an article are not usually grounds for deletion. You have grounds for deletion when these problems are intrinsic to the nature of the article. News reports on individual terrorists certainly do discuss their ethnic origins. However, have any reliable sources actually conducted an analysis of the relationship between Pakistani <i>origin</i> (as opposed to <i>nationality</i> or <i>social affiliation</i>) and terrorism? If not, this entire article is original research because it is the first to conclude that there is such a relationship. If there is a non-original argument for a relationship between descent and terrorism, counter-arguments should be presented as well under a neutral title. E.g. Ethnicity and terrorism, analogous to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_crime.html" title="Race and crime">Race and crime</a> (the latter is currently no NPOV-prizewinner, but it does have hope of becoming one). <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Clayoquot</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClayoquot_80b5.html" title="User talk:Clayoquot">Sound</a></sup> 06:44, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment: I have to say that Viriditas is skilled in arguing and sophistry. Let us look at what Viriditas has been trying to do</b>.
<ul>
<li>Right at the beginning (near the top of this page,) he argued: <i>"definition of who is or isn't Pakistani is subjective and open to interpretation"</i> . <b>cleverly conflating individual of "Pakistani origin" and those of "Pakistani citizenship" by using the term "Pakistani"</b>. Then he goes on to argue whether some of individuals can be called "Pakistani" because of their being born in UK etc. Note that the article is clearly named <b>Terrorists of Pakistani Origin</b>, it is not <b>Pakistani Terrorists</b>; and I had clearly referred to that right before his note.</li>
<li>Also note that he made a suggestion about the article which is incompatible with his objections. A classic technique <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch-22_%28logic%29.html" title="Catch-22 (logic)">Catch-22 (logic)</a>. He wants the article to be merged with the category "Category:Pakistani terrorists" ( see article with the tag he placed) and however then then goes on to argue that the people listed are not "Pakistani".</li>
<li>Note that I have added a couple more refereces. For those who have access to today's Wall Street Journal, read the detailed article "Terror plot exposes flaws in how UK tackles extremism", Aug. 18, 2006. It also includes a map of London area showing Walthamstow (see <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2318083,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2318083,00.html" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>).--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobcotton_e6ca.html" title="User:Robcotton">Robcotton</a> 20:20, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Tell us then, how you determine someone is of Pakistani origin and why it is an important part of terrorism? Take a look at <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups_in_Pakistan_fe8a.html" title="Ethnic groups in Pakistan">Ethnic groups in Pakistan</a>, too. The category mentioned above covers Pakistani terrorists, and guidelines specifically mention how to categorize people. Occupations such as "terrorist" are not categorized by ethnicity, but by nationality. You are trying to make the case that ethnicity is a notable part of terrorism, when in fact, there is no evidence that it is. You are doing this because you read the words "of Pakistani descent" in an article about a terrorist, not because there is any relationship between the two: that's where your original research comes in. If you want to make the case that there are Pakistani terrorist organizations, you can add them to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_organisations.html" title="List of terrorist organisations">List of terrorist organisations</a>, or you can describe the roots of the problem in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_Pakistan_98e9.html" title="Terrorism in Pakistan">Terrorism in Pakistan</a> and related articles. You cannot, however, create an article based on ethnicity and then claim there is a notable relationship. You have not posted one single, credible source that directly makes this claim about people of Pakistani origin. You have, however, added citations that describe the relationship between ethnicity and religion. Your thesis has nothing to do with people of Pakistani descent, and everything to do with Pakistani Muslims. Perhaps you should create an article entitled Pakistani Muslims as an offshoot of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_Pakistan_5b21.html" title="Islam in Pakistan">Islam in Pakistan</a>, or add referenced information to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom_642f.html" title="Islam in the United Kingdom">Islam in the United Kingdom</a>. There is no need for this article, but categories such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_Muslims_d736.html" title="Category:British Muslims">Category:British Muslims</a> could be expanded. If you know the particular Pakistani ethnic group that the person you are writing about belongs to, I don't see any reason why you can't add them to a subcat within <a href="../../../e/t/h/Category%7EEthnic_groups_in_Pakistan_922f.html" title="Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan">Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan</a>. As it stands, the term "Terrorist of Pakistani origin" is meaningless and uninformative. You need to quantify exactly what you mean by the term, and categorize accordingly. If you feel a list is needed or required by the list guidelines, then there is nothing stopping you from adding notable people of those particular ethnic groups to ethnic group lists if the category doesn't already suffice for your purpose. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 21:21, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> They recieved regular mentions from Shannon from Cockatoo on Adam and Will's popular Breakfast show on Triple J Radio, so much so that their name was mentioned in the weekly intro to Shannon's segment along with well known Australian Punk Band Frenzal Rhomb. They also regularly tour Australia and have played in every Australian State, and have supported popular international ska bands Reel Big Fish and Mad Caddies. They are quite popular and well respected in the Australian Underground music scene due to their unique blend of Ska, Regaee, Hardcore and Rock. <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Cool bananas2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cool_bananas2_423d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cool bananas2">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>This should not reflect in any way the college, its opinions or attitudes due to the uncontrollable renegade faction of banal-minded, unfunny stickheads that have propagated this self-fulfilling, bloated opinion within their own team.

<li><b>Reply:</b> Ormond College has a prestigious history of academic, cultural and sporting greatness. Whilst we admit that the OMHPC is no bigger than the college itself, we would argue against Mr. Duke's acusation of having "no claim to notability". The OMHPC is well known and respected within the University of Melbourne College community and in the 125th year of this college's history, is poised to win back to back premierships, a notable feat.
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Duke for his comments and for making himself known to us. We took great pleasure in reading his article detailing his own notable and varied achievements. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.17.189.2 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.17.189.2.html" title="User talk:203.17.189.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.17.189.2_5e5d.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.17.189.2">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Keep it</b> Ormond College is not an institution created for the history of its administration and its libraries, which is what its previous wikipedia entry seemed entirely composed of. It is a living and breathing community of vibrant, intelligent, and funny individuals. This article seems a more accurate representation of the sort of tongue-in-cheek spirit amongst residents of Ormond (past and present) which make that community so special. Regardless of whether they are truly serious of not, these are the sort of documents that will be included in histories of the college written in generations to come, as to reflect the attitudes and nature of those students in that time and place. The OMHPC is well known within its own community, and is undoubtedly useful for those who seek an example of college life at melbourne university. It is for all of these reasons that this article is notable and worthy of inclusion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.17.189.2 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.17.189.2.html" title="User talk:203.17.189.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.17.189.2_5e5d.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.17.189.2">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>Hmmm, two newly created users with their only contributions being to this one page... I went on a pub crawl with the TCD Food and Drink Society last September, should it get a page? After all, it's been going for longer than the Luas has. Nowhere near notable enough to get a page. Now, if you're going for ten years and you regularly cram up the Luas and get news coverage, then maybe. Also, Frank_Xerox, this page has nothing to do with drink-driving or promoting sensible drinking habits (as a matter of fact, isn't a pub crawl the opposite of sensible drinking?) <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupersheep_75b6.html" title="User:Supersheep">Supersheep</a> 13:26, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My dear mr. Sheep, if you are trying to imply that I simply created my account in order to post about a subject that I am interested in, then you'd be correct! I mean, I do look at Wikipedia a fair bit but I have far more fasciniating things to do with my time than to post my opinions on each and every subject that I happen to come across. Does this make my opinion about the DDLPC less valid than that of every randomer who has no interest in the subject whatsoever? In the future I'll be sure to nerd it up big time and post about every topic that has no relevance to me. Maybe then my opinions will be valid... As for creating a page for the TCD pub crawl, well why not! If you feel it was fun, then go ahead! It might be a good way to promote the pubcrawl... I find your criteria for what deserves a wikipedia article a little perculiar. Does something really need to be hugely successful and in the mainstream media to be considered a valid entity? Does the phrase "cult status" not mean anything to you? If you are unfamiliar with it, just look it up on Wikipedia. Doubtless there's an entry out there for it, just waiting to be commented on... The DDLPC is all about promoting both non sensible drinking and sensible non drink driving. I think at least one of those themes is valid and important to society and should not be suppressed... --Frank Xerox 19:20, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Humm.. if the criteria for an article to be listed on Wikipedia is that it refers to something that (a) has existed for 10 years, (b) regularly involves at least the number of people that would fit onto a modern, mid-sized metropolitan tram system and (c) gets a lot of main-stream media coverage, I fear that a lot of articles on Wikipedia must be scheduled for deletion. Actually, I have to wonder about the logistics of getting one LUAS full of people (358 including two wheelchairs on the green line according to the <a href="../../../l/u/a/LUAS_edcb.html" title="LUAS">LUAS</a> article) into the various pubs on the south side. It would take forever for them to all get their pints. One could only hope they were not doing rounds, 358 drinks in one night is more than anyone could advise. I am afraid I do not know anything about the TCD F&amp;D Soc pub-crawl, and so can't comment. I'd be interested in learning more about it, but doubt that I will be given the opportunity to do so from Wikipedia. If one of the officers of the society feels inclined to spend their time creating a page about it, I fear it will be deleted before I get a chance to see it. Sfegan 21:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I don't understand why some individuals want this page to be deleted. Since the DDL has a following, is non-commercial and has been on the go for two years (with this years event scheduled for Dec. 27 I gather), I don't see the problem nor do I agree that it can be considered a vanity article. As other people have pointed out, the Luas itself is a new system and therefore, by definition, pub crawls which avail of it are also new. In fact, if one puruses the other articles on pub crawls, I think most would agree that the DDL is one of the more interesting crawls.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> As an ex-pat living abroad, I find it hard to stay in touch with modern Irish transportation and social drinking trends. This article presents valuable information on both, exemplifies a popular Irish (international?) past-time and exhibits the creativity and wit with which Dubliners aproach the art of getting drunk. I have not participated in this particular pub crawl but, next December, when the Luas pulls into its stops, I'll be going out the front door with Daniel.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the present solution - a redirect with a short mention in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub_crawl.html" title="Pub crawl">Pub crawl</a> article is the best.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As an avid reader of Wikipedia and co-founder of the DDL, I thought that it would be appropriate to post an article about it here. Having not heard of most of the other pub crawls listed on the pub crawl page, I presumed that they, like the DDL, were not known about by the wider public. I am surprised to see that the DDL is the only one of them which has been singled out as not being notable enough. I agree that, since it is a young pub crawl, not many people have heard of it but, I don't think this makes it non-noteworthy. It is the only (that I know of) pub crawl on Dublin's Luas line, has a well-defined set of rules and, has a date on which it happens each year thus making it easily verifiable to any one who wishes to check.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unencyclopedic - an important chapter in MMA history, but I agree it'd be better placed on Sakuraba's article and in a stricter tone.

<dd>Brian- I appreciate the fact that your heart is in the right place, but I think you may be in a bit over your head. You make an exceptional amount of grammatical errors in just about every posting, and as such really shouldn't consider yourself an appropriate editor of others' work. For example, you misued the word 'There' in your above comment. That's ninth grade English stuff, buddy! On your personal wiki-page, you said <b>I am an Deletionist.</b> Read that sentence aloud to yourself, and then tell me if it makes sense as written. You start your entry off with the following statement: <b>I am have a college degree in Computer Network Administration.</b> That one is almost laughable! Read that aloud as well, and see what you think. I stopped reading after that one. If you want someone to take your thoughts seriously, take a little extra time to carefully write them out beforehand. You'll notice a world of change awaits you!</dd>
<dd>I suggest you brush up on your basic writing skills, take a month or so off from Wikipedia, and then come back fully recharged. You'll thank me for it later. Hang in there, pal; it'll get easier as time goes by! Don't think we don't appreciate your efforts! -DJ Sloofus

<li><b>Keep</b>: By all means, keep. The only thing I hate more then police brutality or fat free mayonnaise is unnecessary Wikipedia deletion. It's the book burning of the 21st Century. Though it lacks the huge pile of smoldering books and empty cans of kerosene found at most book burnings, it still involves the act of withholding information from others. Only a lot less smoke and your clothes don't stink so much afterwards. If we are to delete the entry for The Comic Book Haters, what's next? <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>? <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>? No thanks! I find the timing of all this to be more then a little ironic. I have recently gone back to school to earn my GED and I was thinking of writing a term paper on the history of The Comic Book Haters. I wanted to concentrate my paper on the early years. The only problem was where to turn to for my information? Ask Jeeves?

<ul>
<li>A few things to keep in mind:
<ol>
<li>We're not nuking <i>facts</i>, we're determining <i>whether or not the subject of the article is notable enough for inclusion in an article of its own</i>. Suppose I wrote a book about wikilawyering. I'm not notable enough for an article of its own. My book wouldn't be, probably. But an article about various aspects of wikicommunities might have a factoid that reads "Newbies often use repeated, outlandish proposals, often failing to convince the established members of the community. For example, User:Wwwwolf wrote a book "Wikilawyer for Hire" (2008, O'Ridley &amp; Patrons), where he states (pp. 42-43) that melodramatic polemic is 'the oldest trick ever in Wikipedia AfD debates' and won't win you any friends." See? Facts can exist even when they don't have articles of their own. Ergo, comparing this to book burning is slightly silly at least.</li>
<li>We're not a publisher of original information, it says so in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a>. We're not a free webhost either, so says the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">policy too</a>. If the history of the website in question is available <i>here</i> but not on the site in question (or some other website that has researched the background of the site), then that's kind of backwards. We're supposed to cite someone who can present us pre-chewed pieces of information, and condense that to something that tells the uninformed people with one glance on what this stuff is about.</li>
<li>A hint: teachers hate it when you only cite encyclopedias. (If they don't, change school ASAP.) You probably want to cite something else. Like the <i>actual website you're writing about</i>. We're not here to do anyone's school work for them, you know.</li>

<li>I realize you have better things to do such as constructing a bonfire of copies of <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, so I will try to be short. What you are trying to do is to stifle the flow of information. The very fact that you refer to the act as "<b>nuking</b>" tells me that you equate it to be on par with something overly masculine. That you will in a sense show how powerful you are by deleting a Wikipedia entry. I say don't do it. Instead, try to do something that would truly demonstrate your manliness. Go lift some weights. Attempt to kiss a pretty girl. Bend a piece of metal. Chop down a big tree. Do something - anything - instead of deleting a Wikipedia entry. Also, on a personal note. I have made it a point to never trust anyone that uses the word "ergo" in a sentence. It's up there with never trusting someone that wears plaid pants or someone that listens to jazz.

<li>Do we need the humor link again, Brian? I think we went there already. I think the self-appointed wikipedia "guardians" need to loosen their sphincters. Not too loose. Not enough to turtle-head or anything. Just enough to stop being so damn annoying. Are your day jobs so frustrating that you come here to unload? Try a bar. Or maybe a girl. Whatever.

<p>Reason the page should be deleted</p>
<p>Vanity article in breach of Wikipedia guidelines.</p>
<p>Subject of the article is a minor (local) politician in Northern Ireland. He is not a member of either the elected Northern Ireland Assembly or the UK Parliament but is rather merely a local councillor and a former failed student politician. Pondersomething 14:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> The subject of this biography may not be sufficiently notable for WP. The listed awards appear to be only scholarships and student awards. I could find no WP notability criteria for artists, but presumably they would include major shows reviewed by prominent art critics. Although "Odhiambo Siangla" produces a moderate number of google hits, most of these seem to be self-created or WP mirror sites. Possibly the page should not be deleted but instead converted to a user page. <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENesbit_c111.html" title="User:Nesbit">Nesbit</a> 14:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The talk page of the article tells us that Siangla presented his work alongside other artists at a museum show in 1996. The show was summarized in a book by other authors published in that year. I found the book, which is now apparently out-of-print, on Amazon. The article tell us that Siangla later authored and published a book <i>Conquering Space</i> which I have been unable to locate by web and database searches. As mentioned, the awards are student scholarships, which, though meritorious, are not really notable. Unless verified evidence is presented, it seems clear to me that the body of work has not received 'multiple independent reviews' nor is it 'widely recognized.' <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENesbit_c111.html" title="User:Nesbit">Nesbit</a> 16:49, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I suspect that he may not be notable enough either as an artist alone or as an academic alone; we do have guidelines for academic figures, and he doesn't seem to meet them. However, although he does seem to have a user account, and uploaded <a href="../../../l/i/q/Image%7ELiquid_Fire.jpg_f0bb.html" title="Image:Liquid Fire.jpg">the image</a> using it, the article was in fact created by someone else, or at least using another account. Not sure that making a user page is appropriate. This also suggests non-trivial interest by people other than the subject himself, and tips the scales in favour. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I see no references here, and as such none of the information in the article can be taken at face value. While there are a few awards attributed to him, there is no verification of those. I'd also submit that just because another account created the article, it wouldn't be the first time we've had sockpuppetry or a friend/relative create a vanity article about someone here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:21, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b> (userfy acceptable) AGF would suggest that I assume Jamarenyo &amp; Siangla are different people until proven otherwise, but it does require willful suspension of disbelief.

Moreover, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philica.html" title="Philica">Philica</a> has been mentioned by <i>Nature,</i> the magazine read or skimmed-through by virtually all scientists, so the Notability complaint doesn't compute. I would say the current stub categorization is not quite accurate, since Philica is not just an WWW-related article. In case I don't get time to check W for the next few days, I have removed, for the time being, the afd. But, feel free to continue the discussion -<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYosofun_9b47.html" title="User:Yosofun">Yosofun</a> 01:04, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Removing an AfD notice is not allowed, I have put it back.

<li>As I have mentioned earlier, recognition by the journal <i>Nature</i> is considered ubiquitous publicity, at least in the realm of published science--however brief the recognition may be.

<dd>The AfD page needs Cleanup or, at least, a brief outline of the steps involved in an AfD -- with moderator intervention explicitly stated, if such is the new word. It would be nice if certain users spend less of their time deleting valid articles, and more time on updating the policy pages into more concise versions. Sadly, I also suffer from promiscuous-deletion paranoia. A number of pages I've started were deleted without adequate reason, and I only retroactively discover the mal-deletion a couple of weeks later. Interestingly, some of the pages I've started were deleted, then recreated a short time later and have since not been recommended for deletion. Users who spend their time weeding out articles really ought to spend more effort in judging the validity of certain articles -- and whether the article meets the criteria for removal. <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYosofun_9b47.html" title="User:Yosofun">Yosofun</a> 22:28, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hence the Verifiability is not at all a question. PTI in India is like Reuters. Hence it is an authenticated source. The only question over here is Notability and if a breakaway fraction of a political party is notable, then this Jagran is notable. Also we have to keep in mind that Local Newspapers (in Bengali / Hindi etc) are not searchable in Google.

<dd>Verifiable in its existance and verifiably important are two different things.

<dd>There is no uniform system of translitteration of Indian language names into English, and therefor one has to be a bit flexible when seaching.

<p>This article was deleted after a prod, but later restored when contested on DRV. There is nothing in this article that couldn't be accomplished with a category. It's really needless listcreep. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was the one who prodded this, I thought it looked familiar. Anyway, here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Content_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67158352" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Content_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67158352" rel="nofollow">diff</a> of him requesting it be put back. I guess he just did it in the wrong place or something. It's probably better as a category, it's definitely POV (who decides whether they are being portrayed erotically or just portraying them nude?) and it's pretty arbitrary as well (why only males?). <i>Maybe</i> a category on Category:Photographers of nudes or something similarly named would be OK, but since its such a commonplace thing in fine art photography, I don't see it as being all that necessary. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 18:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry that I didn't find your name anywhere on the original Prod and that it was in the wrong place. I did post on the talk page of Kungfuadam, who in less than four days had elimnated the list and never replied. This list is not just about nude photography of men as some of the Calvin Klein and 2(x)ist underwear ads are without question "erotic" even if their genitals are covered. For many years erotic photography of the male was kept out of view and never as well know as the photography of women nude or partially clothed. Many of these photographers on the list were top professionals known for their commercial and high fashion work and this side of their art was known only to personal friends. Large quantities of this work was destroyed by the artists themselves before their deaths and I believe that it is an important part of history to have these names grouped together in some way. As you can see there are a number of links to this page from other photography pages. No, I did not start the page or do the principal edits, but I consider it important. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 18:49, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>If that is the case then the subject deserves a full article and is not well-served at all by a list of names without explanations (which will likely attract a large amount of spam and advertisement). <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 19:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would agree that much more is needed on this. So far, at least, it has not been spamed that much and I think the list has been kept under control better than many. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 19:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We're not talking about whether the subjects of the articles in this list are notable. We're talking about whether or not the list itself is needed. The entire article is nothing but an alphabetical list of bluelinked articles. It is serving the same function as a category. This is not a judgment on the usefulness or worthlessness of these people's work. This AFD is nothing more than a decision as to whether this list serves an encyclopedic purpose. As it is a subjective list and a list that serves the same function as a category, I do not believe that any encyclopedic purpose is served by having it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, I believe that grouping these name does indeed serve an encylopaedic purpose for anyone wishing to research those that have done photography in this area. I am perfectly open to the sugestion that it include a couple of paragraphs on the field at the top, or that it be changed to a category if that is the consensus view, as long as it limits the scope to this particular group of persons. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 23:21, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You haven't offered any reason for the list (as opposed to a category) to exist. If a list exactly duplicates the information that would be in a category, it serves no purpose. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:21, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have tried to state what I do consider important and have asked for input on which would be better. If there is consensus that this would be better served as a category, I don't have a problem with that and would create same before this history gets deleted again. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 01:32, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I read the discussion of the first AfD and I understand very little of the administrator's decision. There wasn't a single <b>keep</b> and yet the article was kept. There seemed to be some sort of consensus that giving this Simpsons quote its own article is a bit over the top. The page's content hasn't changed much one year later, so I hereby nominate it again. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedico80_be24.html" title="User:Medico80">Medico80</a> 16:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Article merger is an implied keep, because merger does not involve deletion at any stage.

<ul>
<li>Uh, if people agree to merge an article, that doesn't mean you close it as keep and do nothing. That means you close it as merge and merge it. That isn't what happened in the first one though, the closing admin said there was no consensus to either merge or delete (so he probably shoud have said "no consensus" instead of "keep" but same thing really). <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:40, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The line of succession on the British monarchy website only goes down to 39 places, I am not aware that any other authoritative reference work goes any further. Therefore any claims about someone's place in the line of succession beyond that is original research, not allowed on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Leave as separate entry</b>. As a standalone term in use, this does warrant it's own distinct encyclopedic entry. I agree on the desire to avoid duplication, but this article can have redirects within it to articles such as 'History of Ireland', 'History of Britain', etc... and thus would not create duplicate articles. The term's very existance is as a politically-neutral alternative to 'British Isles', so a redirect would be an insult to users of the term (such as myself). <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 15:03, 12 August 2006</li>

<dd>I don't believe any insult is intended, Pconlon! Redirects are a courtesy of Wikipedia in order to facilitate searching/finding pages and to avoid duplication of effort which requires updating of multiple articles with the same information. Perhaps a way to alleviate your concerns would be to address the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> article directly, more strongly emphasizing your concerns in the label at the top, or by discussion on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_51dc.html" title="Talk:British Isles">Talk:British Isles</a> talk page. I remain by my Redirect vote, however, but certainly with no insult intended or implied. After all, I created <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_Isles_0d4f.html" title="Anglo-Celtic Isles">Anglo-Celtic Isles</a> and believe it is a legitimate term, which is mentioned in the other article along with several other alternatives names for the Isles. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsoxyl_4f54.html" title="User:Isoxyl">Isoxyl</a> 14:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks Isoxyl, I appreciate that an insult wasn't intended, I just wanted to highlight that a 'redirect' would nonetheless be insulting (if unintentionally so)! My firm belief is that every term should have its own entry; when it is an alternative for another, more commonly used term, links within it to the lengthy text in the other article (to avoid unnecessary duplication) are reasonable enough. A 'redirect' effectively says: 'No, you're wrong to use this term - you should use this one instead'. Given the length and breadth of the discussion so far on the 'British Isles' naming controversy, you can see why this proposed redirect will only get some people's backs up. Could you reconsider your support of the redirect proposition? Respectfully, <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 16:27, 12 August 2006</dd>

<dd>I guess I don't look at redirects as telling anyone to use any particular term that they like, only that several terms are in use for the same thing. After all, no one seems to be arguing the Anglo-Celtic Isles are actually a different PLACE than the British Isles. It seems that if we redirect to one article of whatever name, and make note of all alternative nomenclature, and then explain what the Isles ARE, we are giving a good encyclopedia entry for the Islands themselves. I believe that British Isles is the most commonly used term, and therefore is a likely candidate for where the article should reside to serve the greatest number of people. But that does not mean that I don't agree that the term is vehemently opposed by some (including some in this debate). I still think that a well-written warning at the top of the article might satisfy those are insulted by this circumstance. Perhaps even list some of the alternative nomenclature right at the top? "British Isles, also known as the Islands of the North Atlantic, etc.etc."? I don't want to silence anyone... I think if the British Isles article contains the relevant FACTS about the Islands as well as an explanation for alternative terminology (it does, although perhaps these could be fleshed out), and there is a redirect from alternative nomenclature, then the encyclopedia works, and allows everyone's terminology to be useful. However, I do believe that IF there is enough in Anglo-Celtic Isles to warrant its OWN article then it should be left as such. At the moment, that doesn't appear to be the case... It appears to be an academic alternative term for BI, one in concurrent use with BII and IONA. Actually, <a href="../../../i/o/n/IONA_348f.html" title="IONA">IONA</a> is a good example of what I mean, because it is an article which seems to justify its own existence by having extra information about its use which is not needed on BI. ACI doesn't appear to be that way, its use is documented within the BI article. Despite this, I am willing to consider other alternatives, perhaps:

<li>My prime reaction is <b>Delete</b> unless the author can add some citations of its actual use. The British Isles is a well accepted term. This seems to me to be a 'political correctness' neologism. If the author can show that the term has significant use, a short article would be justified, but this should consist merely of an explanation of the term, and a series of internal cross-references (without the sub-category). The largest island is 'Great Britain', not merely 'Britain', which in turn implies that there must be other islands. Furthermore, the earliest record of the name is (I think) in the work of the geographer Ptolomy, who recorded a tribe called the 'Pritanni', who were (I think) in Irleand.</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The term "British Isles" is a product of British nationalism, dating no earlier than 1621. The term is one of their nationalist myths used to contextualise Ireland within the framework of their nascent British state, and thus make it easier to legitimise the conquest of Ireland. It is no more and no less than this. The very fact that British posters are so passionate about imposing this name, and Irish posters are so animated about resisting it, testifies to the inherent political nature of the phrase. Consequently, the attempt by British posters to tone down their irredentist nationalism by feebly claiming it is a "geographic" term is <i>persistently</i> insulting. There is no rational reason why the terminological creations to support that state's political claims to Ireland should subsume every other name for "this archipelago" (and as Mel Forbes has shown numerous times, there are many such alternative names). <i>There are many more views of the world, including the minor matter of what the natives in Ireland think</i>. Ireland is not a British Isle, and the Irish people do not perceive themselves to be British. Trying to eliminate the existence of Anglo-Celtic Isles and place it under British Isles is entirely about what Edward Said observed was the coloniser's central impulse to control the representation of the native. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 12:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And Mel - the relevance of whether this term is used is irrelevant.

I do not want the term to be excluded from Wikipedia - it has its place, as a paragraph in British Isles.

<dd><b>Strrong redirect</b> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. Not only does this article describe a term that already exists (British Isles), but its also very POV. The phrase is barely used, other than by a minority of paranoid people of a certain political persuasion, and does not describe the ethnic makeup of these islands very well at all - it makes assumptions based on popular myth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's an example of the aforementioned paranoia, coupled with ignorance: <i>"The term "British Isles" is a product of British nationalism"</i>. The term <i>British Isles</i> can actually be dated back to around 300 BC - much, much earlier than the start of the consolidation of the kingdoms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The very fact that <i><b>some</b></i> Irish editors are so passionate about imposing this name new invention testifies to the severe political brainwashing some people have been subjected to since the 18th century. The correct phrase (British Isles) is merely disliked (or detested) by some small-minded bigots who seethe and froth at any notion of a connection with 'Britishness' that they become too blind to see the term in its correct context. They confuse it with the modern national description, or citizenship.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are indeed other terms which people use to describe these islands collectively, and any that have notable usage should also be noted in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">article</a> itself. I don't see the point in creating individual articles for each alternative phrase that is, or has been, created, when an article exists which has the title, not only of the original milleniums-old description, but the most widely known description.</dd>

<dd>El Gringo on this issue reflects the views of the <i>vast</i> majority of Irish people who not merely do not regard themselves as British but take offence at anyone presuming they are. You are absolutely entitled to your opinion, just as French monarchists are demand a return of a king, and American anglophiles are entitled to regard themselves as British. But do not act as though you are anything more than a very small minority, not even a large minority, much less a majority.

<dd>I wouldn't say it was anywhere near a "vast majority" of Irish people that particularly share El Gringo's views on the matter. For a start, of a population of some 5.7 million, roughly 1 million could be considered at least nominally unionist. That's more than a sixth of the Irish population. Unionists are unlikely to take offence at the term. There are also, I would suggest, a large number of people who do not take any offence at the term simply because they really couldn't care less.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> Robdurbar, you still argue that you don’t understand why this article exists at all…well, if someone comes across the term ‘Anglo-Celtic Isles’, wants to find out what it means and types it into Wikipedia, they should expect to be taken to a page that explains it. Having a redirect will not do – the viewer would just be taken to the ‘British Isles’ page and will probably scratch their heads in bemusement. Reference to ACI in the BI article is deeply buried and they surely wouldn’t find it easily. If you want a redirect, you should have ACI clearly stated in the Introduction…as it once was. You wanted it removed from the Introduction and I relucantly accepted this modification (in the interests of consensus achievement and conciseness). <b>With a redirct I believe would come the requirement to have ACI referenced explicitly in the BI article introduction. Is that really what you want?</b></p>
<p>Also, just a correction for Mal who still, incredibly, believes that people who reject the term ‘British Isles’ and use ‘Anglo-Celtic isles’ instead are a ‘minority of paranoid people of a certain political persuasion’! Fact is that the clear majority of Irish people (inhabitants of the island of Ireland) reject usage of the term; I am not paranoid nor of a ‘certain political persuasion’ if that implies any sort of extremism. Argue against the scale of rejection of the BI term until you’re blue in the face and you won’t alter it. Being Northern Irish, you should welcome anything that removes the political divisions standing between you and your neighbours – ‘Anglo-Celtic Isles’ is wonderfully disconnected from political implication…and you can still have a UK passport if you want too! Reading your views is as depressing as listening to an Ian Paisley speech in the hope of hearing something reasonable, balanced, sensitively worded and free of hatred. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 18:20, 14 August 2006</p>

I'll have a think on that and get back at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_51dc.html" title="Talk:British Isles">Talk:British Isles</a>). Though I agree that some users would be confused to come to a differently titled article - this does happen already with other redirects from sub-issues to main articles. Put simply, Anglo-Celtic Isles is the same thing as British Isles. Wikipedia is not a dictionary and so only has articles about a word or phrase in itself if it is notable in a wider context. As Anglo-Celtic Isles is barely notable (a dozen or so google results, no web of knowledge results etc.), it certainly does not deserve its own entry. As great as our two countries our, I don't think their location deserves two articles. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:18, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a difference Rob. <i>Britain and Ireland</i>, etc is a generic term. <i>Anglo-Celtic Isles</i> is a formal title that is used. It exists as a term. I don't see the problem with an article on a term once it is not a duplication of <i>British Isles</i>, merely saying 'this term begun here, is used there, etc.' <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 19:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>but more than anything else - more than my belief that having an article entitled Anglo-Celtic Isles simply breaks policy, all political assertions aside - I simply don't see how an article on Anglo-Celtic Isles could ever expand beyond 2 paragraphs maximum, and that's with describing every single use of it. I do not deny that it exists as a term - and I did mention other terms such as 'Northern European Isles' or 'that part of the World that calls fries chips' - but it is in such minor use. As a university student I benefit from access to a number of journal databases, such as Web of Science and EBESCO, and making a number of searches with different combinations (w.g. isles or islands, with/without hyphen) <i>I have failed to find more than half a dozen uses outside of Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/</a></i> (whiich uses it just to mean the islands of the United Kingdom anyway). As a result, I think it can only ever exist as a page that replicates the content of British Isles and includes one further paragraph, which could easily and justifiably be included in the British Isles page. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 21:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> 'Not only does this article describe a term that already exists (British Isles), but its also very POV.'- Oh for the love of God will you give that pompous nonsense a rest? Please. You're- the lot of you- merciless. I cannot think of a more politically POV term than 'British Isles'. Apparently there is a very long history of the British looking down on the Irish as intellectually inferior- going right into very recent times, especially in the financial institutions. How apt that the same people who are pushing their British colonial nomenclature on top of us are also insulting our intelligence by claiming the entire thing is not representative of British rightwing/unionist prejudices. In this you are, collectively, pathetic. Britain has persistently produced the biggest tribal drumbeaters in all of Europe in the past 400 years. And trying to shove this "British Isles" non sequitur on top of Irish communal identity is more of it. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 20:29, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Can we try to look at this from both sides, and come to an agreeable middle ground? I would humbly ask all participants to come back to the discussion without venom or rancor.

The "vast majority" of people on the island of Ireland are well capable of recognising a geographical term as being just that and the term is very much in common usage in Ireland. No problem with the neologism 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' being mentioned in the main article with a redirect, but including it as an article in it's own right?

<p><b>Further reasons to Keep Article</b>. I'm all for focussing on the matter in hand. I have finally inserted into the article a nice (verified) reference I've had for a while. This is not a duplication of anything in the BI article. There are more (non-duplicate) additions to come. Isoxyl, I'm glad you agree with my point that, if a redirect route were followed, it should come with a clear reference to ACI in the BI article Introduction...something like: 'Alternative terms exist in limited use, such as 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' and 'British &amp; Irish Isles'. The trouble is that several users (most probably contributing to this page too!) strongly opposed this. They argued either that the term didn't really exist (clearly not so!) or that usage was so limited that they didn't think it deserved the prominance of an Introduction reference. As long as this ACI article exists, and as long as someone wanting to read about it can type the term into Wikipedia and be taken to THIS article, then I'm able to reluctantly accept keeping the BI article intro as it is. The additional, non-duplicate information in this ACI article shows that this is <b>not just a dictionary-type entry</b>. By the way Bastun, your view about the BI term being purely geographical and 'very much in common usage in Ireland' is far from correct - this is ground we've covered/fought over long ago!!

<dl>
<dd>We'll have to agree to disagree on that one, Pconlon - I'm pretty sure if I went out on to the street now (in Dublin) and did a vox pop asking "What do you call the big set of islands west of France?" it'd be pretty much 50-50 between "The British Isles" and "Ireland and Britain" (in whatever order). It's simply a geographical term, like the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Sea_b87a.html" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a> (not the Anglo-Celtic Sea...) or the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> (not the Franco/Anglo Channel). It's also the term in my daughter's (Irish) school atlas... <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 10:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, having actually read through "Foster's The Global Etiquette Guide to Europe, Everything You Need to Know for Business and Travel Success, Part One: Western Europe" (I presume this is the new reference you're referring to), it doesn't actually mention the 'Anglo-Celtic Isles', but rather "Be especially careful in the terms you use to refer to your colleagues from these Anglo-Celtic isles." From the context, it is clearly <b>not</b> intended as a replacement term for 'British Isles' and it is disingenuous to suggest that it is. I would have serious problems, in any case, using this as a verifiable source, as even a cursory read of the article shows many historical and cultural inaccuracies - the Celts only arriving in the islands circa 300BC, the Normans arriving <i>before</i> the Saxons, (Unionist) Northern Irishmen who would describe themselves as 'Britons' (rather than 'British') and 'casual Friday' not having reached these islands to name just a few. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 11:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The main question here is the extent to which there should be separate articles for the names of things, people, places, events rather than the things themselves. Encyclopaedias deal with things &amp;tc; dictionaries with words. The growth of articles around words and names has to be restricted as much as possible otherwise the encyclopaedia will become unusable with multiple articles about the same things. You don't have to look very far to see the amount of energy that some people will put into naming disputes to appreciate the problems that will arise if articles are allowed to blossom whenever there is more than one name for a single thing &amp;tc (see <a href="../../../r/%C3%AD/o/Talk%7ER%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata_name_9df9.html" title="Talk:Río de la Plata/name">Río de la Plata/River Plate</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/u/Talk%7EAluminium_Spelling_5b52.html" title="Talk:Aluminium/Spelling">aluminium/aluminum</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_%28soccer%29_c1f8.html" title="Talk:Football (soccer)">soccer/football</a> and almost anything else concerning any sort of football, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Talk%7EDerry_d5f7.html" title="Talk:Derry">Derry/Londonderry</a> &amp;tc &amp;tc &amp;tc). "Anglo-Celtic Isles"'s only purpose is to be a synonym for "British Isles", it has no life or history of its own independent of this, and the same material in the British Isles article could be exactly duplicated there. It is a terrible precedent. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 14:49, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Suggestion</b>. This discussion is so cluttered and convoluted as to be very difficult to follow at this point. (This may be against policy on an AfD page, but....) Here is my suggestion based on reading the work so far: Allow a little more time to improve the article by those interested in doing so. Is there some way to put a timer on this? If the article does not improve to where it justifies its own existence (ala <a href="../../../i/o/n/IONA_348f.html" title="IONA">IONA</a>, then we can merge/redirect to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> at some arbitrary later point? Agreed that we don't need a million articles documenting different names, but as long as it links to BI and provides good points for its unique existence, I'm willing to tolerate it. Thoughts on the suggestion?

<dd>The article contains much that is unverified or plainly inaccurate, e.g., "The Anglo-Celtic Isles is a term <b>increasingly</b> used..." - it's <b>lack</b> of use has been demonstrated in this debate. The "controversial term 'British Isles', due to the latter's unacceptability in Ireland and among some Scottish and Welsh nationalists.[1]" What Scottish and Welsh nationalists, exactly? We have one source for this... The only other 'source' for verification in the article - "The populations inhabiting the archipelago have been referred to collectively as 'Anglo-Celtic cultures' in mainstream literature.[2]" has been debunked both on the article's talk page and in this AFD. Lastly, "The term is used in particular in academia and has begun to be used, alongside, or as an alternative to, British Isles in many library referencing systems. Its usage however is relatively small to date." is self-contradictory and unverified - <b>what</b> library referencing systems? Remove all of the unsourced/inaccurate material and you're left with nothing to base an article on. Still in favour of a delete or redirect - but if the above concerns can be addressed then the article can always be re-created later, following existing Wiki protocols. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 00:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiment <i>"This is an encyclopedia, not somewhere to push a PoV"</i>. That is exactly what I am talking about. <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are not there to be interpreted as an vehicle to push pov either. The reasoning is that if a term is being used for cultural purposes, which <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_Isles_0d4f.html" title="Anglo-Celtic Isles">Anglo-Celtic Isles</a> is, if follows that it is a worthy entry.

<dd>I'm in agreement too of course on the encyclopedic (rather than POV-pushing) nature of Wikipedia. I accept some of the comments on wording inaccuracies in the article (e.g. 'many' vs. 'limited use to date') and will look at these in a moment. A thorough search for the best references to back up unverified points will take time and I'm alas only able to dedicate pieces of time to this (I'm not retired like some here are I imagine). Bastun, I assure you that there wouldn't be a 50/50 split between 'British Isles' and 'Britain &amp; Ireland' in a straw pool on the streets of Dublin. The points made about the 'Irish Sea' and other areas of water are interesting, but overlook the long, long period political/military turmoil that has affected life on British and Irish soil - which baggage the stretch of water between the two islands thankfully lacks.</dd>
<dd>The people presently working on this article are well aware of the existance of the 'British Isles' article and of the need to avoid duplication. I certainly have no plans for an alternative history of the archipelago or anything of that sort. <b>Can we please now remove this deletion/redirect tag and leave the article be?</b>, so those of us who use the term and want it properly and fairly (I stress this) represented can get on with improving it. Wikipedia is about sharing knowledge and should be an unrushed, even enjoyable, pursuit. We should somehow keep this discussion though - where would it be best placed in this case? I'm of course happy to wait until everyone has had a chance to read and comment on this. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 15:27, 16 August 2006</dd>

<dd>I think we should let this run and have the wider community have its say - I'm glad its attracted a few new faces to the issue. As I've said before, as a student, and a geography one at that, I have access to a number of academic databases and I have failed to find any more references than are already provided at <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> for the term. Thus to claims that this is widely use, I'm afraid I just don't believe that it is. On that basis, and on my understanding of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, I stand by my opinion that the article's content should be <b>delete</b>d and the page exist as a <b>redirect</b> to Brtish Isles. That said, if this debate comes out as 'no consensus' - as I suspect it might - then I'll be happy to leave the issue. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:29, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having looked further at the article following updates, I'm still very much unconvinced of the merits of it existing as an article in it's own right and even coming to the conclusion that it doesn't deserve a redirect. I've since removed some of the hyperbole and added back in the 'unverified' tag, but the only checkable reference to the use of the term leads to a website which quotes a ballad apparently written in 1914. Now, pretty much any song will be found in several places on the net, but that's the only place where that particular one can be found.

<p>On the issue of this article's existance, can we now finally agree that there is <b>no consensus</b> and lay this romp to rest? Let's leave the article be. All users are of course welcome to keep an eye on it to ensure that no inappropriate verifications are used - I would ask that contentious opinions regarding additions/removals be placed in discussion for a few days before actual article changes are made. I also thank Robdurbar for his fairness and open mindedness. Kind regards, <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 15:10, 18 August 2006</p>

<dd>Why not follow standard AfD process? At the moment it's looking like an 8 to 4 majority in favour of redirect/delete, as opposed to keep. A 2 to 1 majority <b>is</b> consensus (for AfD purposes, anyway - I've seen articles/templates deleted with far slimmer majorities) and the closing admin will also presumably take into account the arguments on <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 14:38, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually 66% is borderline. Most admins who close debates would judge a debate like this no consensus because of the strength of feeling and the narrowness of the numbers. Tighter numbers may result in deletions if the debate is pretty consensual and if a lot of the votes on one side are of the 'I'm not pushed either way but . ." tone. This debate here is too passionate for a decision in the 60s. It really would need to be in the 70s. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:38, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People, this is not an exercise in 'getting the vote out'!! It will be petty indeed if each side went about calling in 'numbers' to support its position...which is where this is going. No one is saying that this term is in widespread use, however it is verified and is used by some, myself included. This debate is about a term that is not just concidentally used in place of another - rather it is used intentionally as an alternative term on an extremely sensitive subject. A redirect would be an insult to those of us who so use it. A suitably worded reference to it specifically should I believe be placed in the British Isles article introduction...it would be essential in the case of a redirect in my view. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 23:52, 20 August 2006</p>

<dd>Nobody is denying that this term is used on occasion. I have yet to hear a convincing case that this means it should have its own entry. It is an alternative term for the archipelago, but there are many others - "these Islands", "IONA", "UK and Ireland", "northwest European archipelago", "West European Isles", "Britain and Ireland", "Western Lands", "British Isles and Ireland", even "England" to some dumb tourists. Should each of these have an entry? Or should there be one entry for the archipelago that discusses all the alternative names in a section within it? That is the question to be answered. If we go down the one entry route, as I and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> suggest, I would question the practicality of including each of these alternative names, and an explanation of their origin and use, in the intro--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 23:16, 20 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Um. Verified? According to the discussion that's been going on the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAnglo-Celtic_Isles_5ca8.html" title="Talk:Anglo-Celtic Isles">talk page</a>, it's not verified at all. Despite the extravagant claims of academic use, library use, and so on, none of these references have materialised. There is one ballad on a webpage, with no corresponding printed reference (and bear in mind that all of the searches I list below would return hits for this ballad, were there any to find); there is an academic text that uses the phrase "Anglo-Celtic isles" (small i); there is a tourist's guidebook that uses the phrases "Anglo-Celtic cultures" several times and "Anglo-Celtic isles" once (again, small i). Use of the adjective Anglo-Celtic cannot be considered substantiation of the proper noun "Anglo-Celtic Isles", even if the noun attached to the adjective happens to be "isles".</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hydro's Battle Net is small but not little. As Ford206 said this site is still going strong after more than an year, and it deserves to have a chance to get even better. It's not right to just delete something because it seems pointless with no results on Google. Chances are, the best option is to keep this page up for people to actually recognize HBN. - <b>Blaze-kun</b></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> two images at the bottom keep getting tagged as "non-commercial use only".

<li><b>Keep</b> - Like the two above me have said. I believe this page deserves a chance. It may not be on the top of Google's search list but it is a wonderful reference for those who wish to see it and know more of what it's about. A guide if you will for all of those new members that join the site. It gives a good description of the story line the characters that play an important role and build the site up. Besides. Who said Google and Yahoo were God? (Though no one mentioned Yahoo <i>I</i> at least use it) If that's all things are rated on of relevence then Jesus help us all. The site is going strong and is a place for people to gather in the world of RP. Wikipedia shouldn't dismiss this page because it gives Hydros Battle Net a chance to be recognized by the mass of the internet. - <b>Rae-chan</b></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sadly this site does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s criteria, which isn't just about search engine hits. It's also about material written by others about the site (of which the site has none), web awards and recognition (of which the site has none), or content being distributed by third party sources (of which the site has none). Google and Yahoo (which uses Google's search technology) are not "gods", but are decent guidelines when combined with other things when determining whether an article on a website satisfies <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guidelines</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't a free webhosting service</a> and the information would probably be better off on the Hydro Battle Net site. You also admit that you want people to recognize the site, which means the article is <a href="../../../a/d/s/WP%7EADS_2ee6.html" title="WP:ADS">advertising</a>, whether or not it's for profit (advertising is not solely done for profit - non-profit organizations can also advertise). On top of all this, none of the material can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> - this means by third parties. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 22:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- "keep this page up for people to actually recognize" gives it away.

The Article is not to "Advertise" The site as HBN is already an established site know by various members of the <a href="../../../m/e/g/MegaMan_1f78.html" title="MegaMan">MegaMan</a> Community. The Articles main objective was to give others information about the website itself no different from the articles of websites such as <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neopets.html" title="Neopets">Neopets</a>. Although obviously HBN is not in the same league as the two examples it still bears the same principles.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I fail to see personally how this fails to meet Wikipedia criteria. The information in the page is verifiable, as the link to the site is providied. The characters are all fan-made and are owned privately by the members of Hydro's Battle Net, who have agreed to let me make this page. Copyright is not an issue, even for the images, which have all been drawn by a HBN member, and used with permission.

<p>Page was originally an nonsense article marked for deletion. While reading the page, I researched the movies listed, and none of the movies list an "Amit Walia" on IMDB (the movies however were listed). The one common feature of the movies was the director Alejandro Agresti. Looking into this further, it appears the author simply copy and pasted the article for <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alejandro_Agresti_8af6.html" title="Alejandro Agresti">Alejandro Agresti</a> and changed the name. Delete and warn author. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 20:35, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, yep, it is a copy of Agresti's who directed the Lake House, and I have to keep monitoring that page since the movie came out for various folks putting in Amit Walia instead of Agresti.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Industrial music is a noted, popular and busy genre. I nearly went for a weak keep due to the lumping together with "electronic" which is pretty much a meaningless term and would, in strict application, exclude some of the acts listed. However, the fact that something needs work is not a criteria for deletion. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 21:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - not a list fan, especially when the only thing they add over a category is redlinks, but there are 226 different lists in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_musicians_2b0b.html" title="Category:Lists of musicians">Category:Lists of musicians</a> and this one is as valid and maintainable as most there.

<li>You have clearly not read <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_ad51.html" title="Violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> properly. Practically none of these massacres are covered correctly in this article which happens to be extremely biased and POV. I still don't understand why there can be articles on violence against Israelis and not one on violence caused by the Israeli army.</li>

<p>as it seems to me to be a needlessly POV redirect to an only partially related article (in that the article covers violence in the conflict in general not just against Israel).

Prod concern was "This article is an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a>." <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The following is the longer explanation from the talk page, by the prodder.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"the overall quality of this article is so low that if this article were deleted, the project wouldn't lose any usable content and we might be able to start over again on a better footing. An interesting point was made on the mailing list a few months ago that Wikipedia has proven to be an incredibly powerful engine for generating content—powerful enough that instead of holding onto crappy content and hoping to make something good out of it, perhaps it would be better to delete it, since keeping around poor content encourages more of the same.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>What makes this article a poor article?
<ul>
<li>Arbitrariness: This article goes into deep detail about a couple of small, arbitrary issues, with little concern for proportion. Maybe 1/5th of the article, for instance, covers the scholarship of Adam Possamai, who by all appearances is a promising young researcher, but his work seems to be given undue weight. Are there really no other researchers of this topic who are important enough to name? Are their findings so insignificant as to not merit inclusion at all, while Possamai's take up a fifth of the article?</li>
<li>Citations: This article is not properly cited, and at best gives inline external links to a couple of random web pages.</li>
<li>No summary or organization, just an arbitrary collection of facts.</li>

<ul>
<li>I have rewritten this article. It's very, very stubby, but I've tried to indicate that there is plenty of material out there which would make for an interesting article if only we let it grow. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 04:03, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: DJ Clayworth has attempted to rewrite the article, but all we have (in my judgment) is the old article with some neat section breaks, and the same undue weight and arbitrary thrown-togetherness of information. My vote remains unchanged.— <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 04:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Phil, that's how all articles start. If you go back and look you will find that once even <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a> was a stubby little article with terrible writing, back three or four years ago. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 04:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but that's not the problem here. It's easy to see how a poorly written <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a> article could be expanded into something that gave a full, balanced, neutral, and comprehensive accounting of the matter at hand. It's not so easy to see how the current revision of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_the_internet.html" title="Religion and the internet">Religion and the internet</a> can be so expanded. We would be best off starting totally from scratch, and I was hoping you would do so, blanking and re-stubbing the article while providing at least an outline for future expansion. Instead, we're stuck with the same shit, neatly organized under little section headings. If we delete the article, someone will come back later and write a completely different article, unencumbered by the cruft that's accumulated there now. That would be the optimal outcome. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 04:33, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mmm I see your point. I don't write most of what's there now, and it's pretty vague. I did cut out a lot of stuff. However if we are agreed that an article on this subject is deserved, then the logical thing is to vote <b>keep</b> and start the long process of arguing about what goes there. If we delete and re-start, the chances are that the same stuff will keep coming back.

<dd>It seemed to me that the article was a hodgepodge of speculation and POV. In retrospect, it probably would have been wiser to clean it up rather than afd it, as there is obviously some historical significance to the article. It should really read more like a history page though, because none of the theories are widely accepted.--<a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetNeo85_74d6.html" title="User:SweetNeo85">SweetNeo85</a> 05:05, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In "theory" what we want is an article that actually describes what the theories are:"so-and-so thinks the towers were demolished", "buddy thinks these guys have responsibility" etc, etc. Then it gets harder for people to agree whether the article is NPOV after the basis for the theories are added. I think that is the part where most of the disagreements come in. I'm not sure if it's a correctable problem or not. It should be moved back to the discussion page though. I think you are right that there is too much hodgepodge. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeenaR_f426.html" title="User:SkeenaR">SkeenaR</a> 05:25, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Deleting of this article would allow the 'conspiracy theorists' to add Wikepedia to their list of conspirators. I agree that much of the content comprises theories which, in principle, violate NPOV but, as briefly discussed by SkeenaR, any editing which endevours to specify that content xxx is theory would be, in itself, open to long argument as to the NPOV of the editing. Thus I suggest it is best to leave the article open to general editing so that Wikipedia [as a whole]is seen to be maintaining a NPOV.Geoffrey Wickham 06:10, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it does not violate NPOV to state a theory. But according to policy here, it would violate NPOV to state that a theory was verifiable fact, or that it had been proven false, without a reliable source. One thing that <i>should</i> be irrelevant with regard to editing, at least in my opinion, is whether or not external sources think Wikipedia is neutral based on their "feelings" toward the material. Verifiability is the key to an encyclopedia article, regardless of whose sensibilities may be offended. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeenaR_f426.html" title="User:SkeenaR">SkeenaR</a> 06:39, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
