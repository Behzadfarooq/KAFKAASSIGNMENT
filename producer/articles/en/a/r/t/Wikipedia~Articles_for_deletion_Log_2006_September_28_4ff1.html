<dd>The nominator DID check several spelling variations (and why aren't they redirects?) but since the existence or non-existence of an article of this type of TV show -- as the nominator clearly states in his clarification -- has bugger-all to do with the notability or non-notability of this subject, thought it was an utter waste of time to locate the EXACT spelling (assuming it existed), instead choosing to clarify what the damned things were. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 22:31, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The reason I pointed it out was because someone said "Oooh, red-link. That must mean non-notable," and I was pointing out the fallacy of the argument.

It is one of the main contemparary cuts.

<p>I am shocked that something that everybody seems to know about is not deemed to be common knowledge. I am also shocked that the very same information is already included in wikipedia in a number of articles without any controversy there: <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skateboarding.html" title="Skateboarding">Skateboarding</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_fashion.html" title="Hip hop fashion">Hip hop fashion</a> and others.<br />
Most of all I find it extremely disappointing that something that is so important, to the point of forming part of the core identity of many individuals involved in the alternative subcultures of skating and hip hop could be so disregarded. These individuals easily number in the hundreds of thousands in countries all over the globe. The fact that their important details would be erased from a "global body of knowledge" while some guy can list the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Zapptastic/created_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Zapptastic/created_articles" rel="nofollow">20 bus routes</a> that pass through his white middle class U S of A suburb without any objection is shocking.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Intel has successfully demonstrated hybrid InP-CMOS lasers, but we don't have an article on it. There's a notability line to be drawn, and this one falls way into the realm of "interesting research". If it ends up seeing major usage, maybe it will merit an article in a year or so. The fact is, 3D FET designs have been around for awhile, and this particular design was suggested around 5 years ago and demonstrated at least 3 years ago. However, it's still very much a developing device design and therefore, I think, fails to merit an encyclopedia article. I mean, I could pick one of a several interesting semiconductor research topics that I personally work on and write an article, but since they are all highly experimental and in their early stages of development, there isn't much to say that is appropriate for an encyclopedia rather than a formal research results publication. Again, we are still talking about a plain 'ol MOSFET, nothing else.

<p>I'm terribly sorry to put this ugly box here, but I really want to get people's attention to clarify a point. Some people have realized this but from the discussion it is clear that not all have. A number of people are suggesting that this article be changed into a category. I think that you should know that the reason that this list article is here at AfD in the first place is likely because I placed Category:Famous lefthanded people on CfD about 9½ hours to prior (or it could be just a coincidence). At any rate, it may be prudent to let the CfD run its course and then possibly re-list this AfD at that time (or at least be aware that the category may no longer be there by the time that the AfD is closed). --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 21:42, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is a major psychological irony here that should be noted. Left brained dominated people (a majority of right handed people) tend to think far more often in terms of ego/power/hierarchy and competition. Whereas left handers are mainly co-operative non-power seekers (Einstein, Gandhi, Bob Geldof etc.) Thus the right handed become aggravated and incensed in any possibility where their ego/power/hierarchy is threatened. This list is a good example. What this list does is proffer examples why the human species should think more in terms of the right brain/left hand. It is the higher genius element that we can all tap into. Repressing or deleting this information just continues the retrogressive and/or destructive trend of the "left brained dominated".<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Earthacademy (<a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarthacademy_c4cc.html" title="User talk:Earthacademy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Earthacademy_1470.html" title="Special:Contributions/Earthacademy">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> boy I sure hope that last entry was meant as a joke. Actually, I think one of the problems with the list is its inherent lack of objectivity. It's a pretty safe bet to assume the list is maintained by left-handed people who undoubtedly are in fact seeking something that ressembles a "list of left-handers that left-handers can be proud of", like Einstein, Gandhi and Bob Geldof. On the other hand, the list is fairly harmless and you do get to learn interesting things like how <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol_Pot_2322.html" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_the_Ripper_b953.html" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> are really co-operative non-power seekers (or so Earthacademy would want us to believe). <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

However, the phenomena that is the online Community which has sprung up around such notables as the Wheel of Time and Harry Potter for instance, should be acknolwedged as in existence, I thought that was what wiki was all about? I understand we can't use you to advertise our site, and that that would be wrong.

<dd>It doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> because there are no examples of outside press about the site listed. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is also a useful reference here. The Wikipedia is a tertiary source, taking information from secondary sources. Anything listed as an article on WP should have been written about by a non-trivial organization or the press. What's being asked is "who has written about this site?", since it is limited to 200 users, that's a fair question. Some small forums may have received press, for instance a particular magazine or paper found them interesting, or perhaps one of the forum users was of note which sparked some interest. If you (or indeed anyone else) has examples of the website receiving this kind of coverage, please supply them (as the lack of this is what has brought the article here to AFD). The Wikipedia is all about as much information being provided as possible in a balanced, neutral point-of-view and by showing the subject's 'notability'. Without asking for evidence of the subject receiving some relevant press, the WP would be massively bloated in a very short time. I haven't had a chance to have a proper look for some press for this site, yet, or a wheel-of-time wiki where this info could go, but I thought it better to at least try and answer your query. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 18:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a Wheel of Time Wiki right here <a href="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/A_beginning" class="external autonumber" title="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/A_beginning" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, who may be able to host this information, for a start. Google searching "Realm of Tar Valon" comes up with only 22 unique hits, none of which seem to be a secondary source that could be used to apply notability. The site has no Alexa rank, three sites link into the RoTV site - two are message board posts and one is a directory of WoT links. Basically, if WP was to host every website of this kind it would end up looking like a mirror for the whole interweb. The site and the WP article on it both look nicely written and I'm sure will be of interest to WoT fans, but we're looking for articles which could interest readers with no prior knowledge of the subject - an article about a small message board doesn't say much apart from that this site exists. I'm changing my vote because of the Wiki.

<p>The result was <b>Delete all</b>, on the balance of arguments, not the&#160;!vote tally. The main argument for keeping appears to be that adding this unencyclopaedic information to the main entries bloats them (a view to which there appears to be no significant dissent), therefore the unencyclopaedic information should be in a separate article. I find that extraordinarily unpersuasive. Lists of the films in which a particular weapon can be glimpsed are almost without exception original research, and there is no suggestion that these are the <i>subject</i> of the films. We don't have an article for, say, the Ford Crown Victoria in popular culture because every US cop show based in the last decade or so will <i>of course</i> have Crown Vics in it; similarly, every war film orr shoot-em-up based in the 39-45 period will <i>of course</i> have the Garand and various other weapons in it. The content is functionally equivalent to a list of popular culture references to combat based in the period <i>foo</i>, where <i>foo</i> is the period over which the weapon was used. A subsidiary argument for keeping is "I like it". <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> does not trump <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. We have no authorities for the vast majority of content here, and no authorities for the significance of the individual weapons within the pop culture item (film or whatever) nor of the significance of the film to the subject. The example of the F-14 and Top Gun cited in the debate is an excellent one; where a weapon is integral to the plot of a film that justifies a one-liner in the main article. Where it's a prop, it most surely does not. Finally, as per the nomination, if we have a reliable source for the ubiquity of the weapon in films of a period, then that, too, can go in the main article. We do not need a list of World War II films in every article on any weapon used in World War II. To pick an example not in this collection, the <a href="../../../m/3/_/M3_Half-track_9b54.html" title="M3 Half-track">M3 Half-track</a> was used as the generic half-track, on all sides, in almost every film, with very few notable exceptions. That doesn't take long to say and we sure as hell don't need a list. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:06, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Moreover, these articles incur severe <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problems. Visual confirmation is often insufficient; there is often debate over which model of M16 is represented; short of commentary from the prop staff, these lists violate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</p>

<p>While I cannot rule out the existence of an item of pop culture that prominently featured a firearm in the way that <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gun_ad49.html" title="Top Gun">Top Gun</a> featured the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a>, none of these rise to the occasion. Even if it were, it would deserve a 1-liner in the main article. A wholesale list of prop appearances is irrelevant and often speculative. What's next? Honda Accord in popular culture? Ikea furniture in popular culture? I am willing to accede that a reliable source may make a statement about the ubiquity of some firearm in a film; such a statement should go in the original article.</p>
<p>These are not articles. That much is clear. A comprehensive list is unmaintainable, difficult to verify, and ultimately original research unless the prop director can be quoted on the matter. Visual confirmation does not satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, as evidenced by the debates over what a weapon was. (is that a MAC-10 or a lookalike? Which Beretta did he carry? Who cares?)</p>
<p>Can they be converted to lists or categories? Given the severe verifiability problems and notability issues, I say not. Do we need a category for each prop?</p>

<li>I have created some of these articles, and my reason for doing so was to keep this kind of trivia out of the main firearm/weapon article. If any pop culture section is left in a firearm/weapon article it tends to grow out of control as every video-gamer wants to put their favourite game in, same thing with movies. If we just delete these references as and when they are put it in leads to revert wars and the whole thing just becomes a never ending maintenance issue on the articles. Some say "only leave in the references which are somehow iconic or significant", but of course that's entirely subjective as to which are iconic or significant. The solution which seemed to work best was to create the separate articles for pop culture refs, so that they could just grow and all the gamers and film buffs would be happy but the main article would be left alone. Not ideal - I agree that this stuff shouldn't be in at all, but it WILL keep being put back in the main articles unless you give them somewhere else to put it. So I say <s><b>Keep</b></s> unless someone has a better solution to the problem of pop culture cruft. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERiddley_ccb7.html" title="User:Riddley">Riddley</a> 03:10, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (Neutral)</b>. I agree that this is not encyclopedic, not notable, etc., and shouldn't be in a separate article. But I have seen similar things in other articles. The "Messiah" article once had a section on "Jewish Messiah Claimants" that eventually wound up taking up about 3/4 of the article with a list of nobodies. The result was that people stopped contribting useful information until the list was split into a separate article.

If there was some cultural or other significance <i>about the weapon's portrayal</i> in the movie, it may be worth mentioning, but <i>just having appeared</i> is not notable in itself. (Mentioning the weapon in the article about the film <i><a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_at_the_Gates_594b.html" title="Enemy at the Gates">Enemy at the Gates</a></i> is a different question, but I notice the model of rifle isn't even significant enough to mention there, except in passing in a trivial bullet-point about a poster-illustrator's mistake) &#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-10-01&#160;01:45&#160;Z</small></i>

<dd>Yes, my point was that this stuff should be kept off of the weapon pages, and the best way to do that is with the pop culture pages. Most movie pages are generally void of weapon mentions, except for action-centric movies like <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equilibrium_%282002_film%29.html" title="Equilibrium (2002 film)">Equilibrium</a>.

If three-minute web pages start to be considered suitable citations, then we have a problem with not only 50,000 items of trivia which can easily be deleted to improve the encyclopedia, but the icing on the cake would then be a constantly-growing web of tens of thousands of "authorities" which no one could ever fact-check.

It's the only pistol shaped like that, and according to the canon of the movie, they're fifty caliber (hence .50AE). It's verifiable, as anyone who watches the movie can say for certain that the screenshot is accurate. With those going for us, and the fact that the site is 3rd party (so <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is taken care of), does it really <i>need</i> to be a "reliable" source?

<dd>My point is that you are ignoring <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. I haven't seen the movie and I am no armourer, so I don't know if that is a screen shot from the movie or if those are indeed so plainly obviously and unambiguously Desert Eagles. I also have no way of knowing whether the editor who cited this "reference" and its anonymous author knew what they were talking about (nor do I know that the screenwriter who gave Agent Smecker his line knew what he was talking about). What you are advocating is choosing to ignore <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> when you feel that it's obvious to you, and to ignore <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> by making your own bogus "references". I agree that some things are so widely accepted that citing references to support them is not a high priority, but I completely disagree that what you're describing constitutes a reference at all. As an example of what a real problem this would be, I keep having to remove armour values from modern AFV articles: they are usually uncited, usually pasted from some mil-fan forum or other, and sometimes an editor will revert-war over them until I eventually track them to their source at an "armour estimates for wargamers" page—quite a lot of work removing false information because someone didn't take these Wikipedia guidelines seriously. &#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-10-01&#160;23:16&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but for different reasons.

<li>To quote Wikiproject aircraft as linked above: "This section should not be a compendium of every trivial appearance, but significant ones of relevance to the airframe.

Due to the large number of survey and arcade simulations, an effort should be made to avoid tallying every sim appearance unless there are very few of them. Fictional versions and speculation about fictional likenesses should not be included, as they constitute original research."

<li>Conversion to category seems to be the best option. I have fixed the spelling on some of the towns showing that we have articles on them so appropriate to categorise.

<li><b>Keep</b> , it can be annotated to include population numbers and such, providing additional info a category can't. I do agree the current empty sections aren't working though.

<li><b>Categorize</b>, pointless as a list. Probably too small to make a decent list even if expanded with population numbers and such, so should be merged to Gippsland if that was the case.

<li><b>convert to navbox</b>. A list or navbox is useful for showing articles that do not exist (yet), so cannot appear in a category. See for example {{<a href="../../../t/o/w/Template%7ETowns_of_the_Riverland_a25d.html" title="Template:Towns of the Riverland">Towns of the Riverland</a>}}.

<li><b>Delete</b> Since around the end of August, the list of town names has grown, but no information has been provided for any of the towns. Until we get more information on pages relating to the actual towns, the list is essentially valuless. The list creator hasn't even added any information and seemed to be creating the list out of a sense of "completeness". Although a couple other people may have been able to copy some names out of a phonebook, the page should be deleted, with the caveat that it can certainly be recreated once it can be something more than a valueless list of names. There is no point in making the list into a category. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanaticus_e704.html" title="User:Banaticus">Banaticus</a> 07:46, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Amazon advanced book search on title = "Hard Work: Success Made Easy" and author = "Michael Crews" yields "No results match your search in Books." To those familiar with Amazon search, it is a very, very loose search and is much more likely to yield false positives than to fail to find a real book. This almost certainly means that the book has no ISBN number. ISBN numbers cost about $250 for a block of ten directly from Bowker (and can be bought in smaller numbers from Lulu, etc.) This virtually certifies that this is a self-published or "vanity press" book (except that these days <i>most</i> self-publishers and vanity presses obtain ISBN numbers and <i>do</i> get Amazon listings). Will reconsider vote if someone provides the book's ISBN number and shows that the book can, in fact, be located on Amazon and does have a sales rank above 200,000. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:13, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>While I cannot rule out the existence of an item of pop culture that prominently featured a piece of hardware in the way that <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gun_ad49.html" title="Top Gun">Top Gun</a> featured the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a>, none of these listed here rise to the occasion. Even if it were, it would deserve a 1-liner in the main article. A wholesale list of prop appearances is irrelevant and often speculative. What's next? Honda Accord in popular culture? Ikea furniture in popular culture? I am willing to accede that a reliable source may make a statement about the ubiquity of some piece of hardware in culture; such a statement should go in the original article. However, a comprehensive list of such appearances is unencyclopedic.</p>
<p>These are not articles. That much is clear. A comprehensive list is unmaintainable, difficult to verify, and ultimately original research unless the prop director can be quoted on the matter. Can they be converted to lists or categories? Given the verifiability problems and notability issues, I say not. Do we need a category for each prop?</p>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Wikipedia is well known for its pop culture info. In fact, it is really only valuable as a pop culture encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Peta, the title obviously is within the guidelines now. Notably "The film has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the film and its creators/producers... This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms, such as articles in newspapers or magazines of importance, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations."

<li><b>Comment</b> - THB, I have offered several articles plus a television interview and a radio interview. How is this not notable? What does "of importance" mean to you? The publications I cited are indeed "of importance." For example, Creative Loafing has a circulation of 131,000 and is the second-most broadly distributed newspaper in Georgia; The Quad City Times has a circulation of 61,366; Columbus Alive distributes 55,000 copies weekly; and Film Threat was named "one of the top 5 movie web sites" by The Wall Street Journal. I'm sure these publications would be surprised to hear that they are not notable. --66.245.115.2 00:31, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Importance is not based solely on circulation. Only the Quad City Times qualifies as an important publication. Free classified ad papers like Creative Loafing and Columbus alive are NOT of importance. Quad City plus "Film Threat" equals two. More importantly, you're not supposed to create an article about yourself or your own film, or vote on it being notable. If it's not notable enough for someone unrelated to the topic to write an article, it's not notable. These are objective criteria and you shouldn't take it personally. -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 03:00, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> THB, I did not create the article. A festival-goer who saw the film created it and then relayed what he had done to me. I have monitored it periodically to make sure that the information remains correct. I do take it personally because you are not providing enough information for me to met your "objective criteria." Plus, why is an "alternative weekly" such as Creative Loafing or Columbus Alive not a notable publication just because they are free -- that is a very odd way of determining relevance when these publications have very large distribution. There is a page about alternative weeklies in Wikipedia <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_weekly.html" title="Alternative weekly">Alternative_weekly</a> so they must be of some importance. Also, what about the film's coverage on Fox 6 News in Birmingham -- that should equal three mentions of relevance in your standards. In my estimation, "three" equates to "multiple non-trivial published works". In fact, two equates to multiple. --66.245.115.2 03:13, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry for the multiple postings, but this lack of clarity is very annoying to me. I followed the link provided above to "reliable published sources" and the film has definitely met that: <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> If there is documented information on what is classified as "of importance" please provide a link.--66.245.115.2 03:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're confusing <i>reliable</i> sources for gathering and documenting encyclopaedic information and sources <i>of importance</i> for ascertaining a film's notability.
<p>Non-importance has nothing to do with cost--most respected newspapers are available free online.</p>
<p>You're missing the forest for the trees: What you're not grasping is that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, not an advertising medium for your marketing efforts. Is "The Lady from Sockholm" an encyclopaedic topic? No. Might it be at some point in the future? Yes, if you get enough real newspapers/national TV shows/syndicated radio broadcasts/film festivals/theatres/movie companies to give it attention.</p>
<p>Bottom line, Wikipedia is NOT the place for you to get attention for your film. It has nothing to do with your film, it has to do with Wikipedia. Familiarize yourself with Wikipedia in general and its policies and guidelines in particular and you'll better understand.</p>
<p>Maybe this will help: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> Look at "Rationales". You really shouldn't even be editing an article about your own film in the first place, nor commenting on it, especially anonymously, without registering, and without announcing your affiliation. Again, that's not personal, it's because Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>By way of proving my point, very few people care about the subject of the article enough to bother to vote on it. -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 03:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If this is an "encyclopedia" then the people who are considered experts on the topic should have something to contribute to the discussion. As I mentioned previously, I did not add the title to this catalogue and I do not know why it has been targeted for "deletion" when it obviously meets the criteria.--66.245.115.2 03:56, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you had nothing to do with the article, then why does it sound exactly like your press release??? <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/5/prweb241509.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/5/prweb241509.htm" rel="nofollow">pr web press release</a> -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 04:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have no idea who you are, but you obviously have something against this listing. I did not say that I never contributed to the listing. I said that someone who saw the film added the article and then told me what they did. Obviously they used information from the official website to create the listing. As a person who uses wikipedia for information, I know how things can get severely messed up. So, I have checked the listing periodically to make sure it remains correct -- and when THB marked it for deletion I added information to make sure that it remained on wikipedia. What's the problem??? --66.245.115.2 04:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Here's the problem: Wikipedia is not supposed to contain "listings" of your 71 minute sock-puppet film, it is supposed to contain encyclopaedia articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This will be my last word here. After doing research on some of the posters it looks like this "article" has gotten caught in a pissing match between two other wikipedians. One added a category to the page and low and behold a couple of hours later "The Lady from Sockholm" is listed as an AFD by someone the first person is in mediation with. This explains a lot because I couldn't understand why there seemed to be such a vehemence coming from one poster. In addition to listing the article for deletion they have been delisting links to the article that are completely valid (a link from the film's distributor and a link from the sock puppet page). I know this doesn't necessarily relate to whether the article is a keep or delete, but I wanted to bring this information to the surface as it relates to their being a certain amount of initial prejudice against the article. As previously stated, I believe the film meets at least one of the guidelines outlined at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> because of the amount of press it has received from all media outlets (print, tv, radio and web) and which are clearly linked from the article.

<p>World's First All-Sock Puppet Feature Film to Premiere</p>
<p>World's first all-sock puppet feature film to premiere in Atlanta. Amusing and acceptable for all ages, The Lady from Sockholm successfully blends comedy with classic film-noir themes of alienation, moral corruption and doomed love.</p>
<p>Atlanta, GA (PRWEB) May 19, 2005 -- The film noir-inspired comedy The Lady from Sockholm, the world's first all-sock puppet feature film makes its global premiere at 5:00 p.m. on June 12, 2005 at the 800 seat Rialto Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Set in 1943 during the height of Wool War II, the pun-filled story follows the exploits of Terrence M. Cotton, a knee-high in debt sock puppet gumshoe who is hired by wealthy socialite Heelda Brum to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of her husband, Darnell. The story uses puppets, humor and puns to make a contemporary statement about how prejudice can damage a society.</p>
<p>Amusing and acceptable for all ages, The Lady from Sockholm successfully blends comedy with classic film-noir themes of alienation, moral corruption and doomed love. Referencing The Lady from Sockholm's "gorgeous film noir style," the Atlanta Film Festival, the premiere's sponsor, deemed the project "one punny movie that's entertaining for kids, but chock full of witty humor for adults to enjoy all on their own."</p>
<p>The screenplay for the film has already won numerous accolades including an "Award of Excellence" (Top 10) from the prestigious Slamdance screenwriting competition.</p>
<p>The one show only June 12 screening will be attended by the film's cast and crew with a Q&amp;A session to follow. The film was shot in Atlanta under the direction of Emory University film instructors Eddy Von Mueller and Evan Lieberman. Lynn Lamousin, owner of the film's production company, KITTYBOY Creations, Inc., wrote and produced the project.</p>
<p>In a recent phone interview Terrence M. Cotton, the male sock lead, said, "When I moved from stage to screen and accepted the lead in The Lady from Sockholm I stepped into the role of a lifetime." The two-time Toeny Award winning sock added, "It’ll be great to see Eddy and Evan again — those guys keep me in stitches!"</p>
<p>Tickets for the world premiere of The Lady from Sockholm can be purchased in advance at <a href="http://www.atlantafilmfestival.com" class="external free" title="http://www.atlantafilmfestival.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlantafilmfestival.com</a> or in person at the Rialto on the day of the screening.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with much of what <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> says.

If 'the blue links lead to NN individuals', then that's a separate issue for those articles to be AFD'd. The big problem for this list is definitely the verifiability/notability. I'd be happy to see the list trimmed back to only blue-links, which would get rid of all the non-notable cruft.--<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 07:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I agree with the nominator. This is indeed listcruft, and the fact that most (if not all) of the artists only use pseudonyms makes this impossible to verify. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's been grafitti art appearing in books and on book covers (as per a recent AFD) meaning the artist who made them is arguably notable. Having a pseudonym doesn't neccesarily exclude one from being verifiable as <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemony_Snicket_97a1.html" title="Lemony Snicket">Lemony Snicket</a> should show. All in all, the concerns mentioned can be addressed by something as the Wikipedia:Cleanup Task Force instead of deletion.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: And a reminder, cruft isn't a reason for deletion as what is and isn't cruft is highly subjective. A single word 'non-notable' should similarly not be used as a reason without facts to back it up as per Stifles excellent essay <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_Don%27t_say_non-notable_21b9.html" title="User:Stifle/Don't say non-notable">User:Stifle/Don't say non-notable</a>.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <s>Changed to <b>No Vote</b></s>. Changed to <b>Delete</b>. I've removed the red names (but they keep coming back). Likewise I fear a good number of the remaining blue names refer to artists who have articles on Wikipedia but who are, nevertheless, unverifiable. We need to cover graffiti art; but it has to meet the same standards as other art movements/artists. This looks a vehicle for abuse. (By way of example; the first 'blue' name that I've looked up - Blade - appears to be more or less completely unverifiable and quite probably insufficiently notable to be here. (Check edit history of article Blade, for example)). Looks like there are quite a few more names to be deleted should someone have the time to look into this. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 22:01, 28 September 2006 (UTC) <small>re-edited own comments <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 14:11, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>Marcus22, good work on tidying up the names. If some articles aren't sourced etc, then they need their own AFD or improvement. Some of the graffiti artist articles are indeed verified, notable etc, and should remain. So in that case a list of those articles would be useful, which this is. Please don't throw the baby out with the bathwater here by deleting a list of names just because some names might not merit being on the list.--<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 17:33, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you mean, Duncan. And I'm all for graffiti art being covered properly on Wikipedia. But I'm not sure that this article serves much purpose and it is a vehicle for abuse. It would be better if such a list were trimmed down to the main artists and included as a section in a full article on graffiti art. (So that would be a tidy up and merge from me iff such an article already exists). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 09:16, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> This is a completely uninformative list of pseudonyms. Wikipedia doesn't need lists of anonymous people whose claim to fame is vandalism. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevanatha_69bd.html" title="User:Devanatha">Devanatha</a> 00:17, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Surely a list of graffiti artists can cut it alongside such lists as 'iranian philosophers', 'herbs and spices' and 'hobbies'. I fear that graffiti related pages are being unfairly culled due to the fact that for example someone from Canada can't Google a graffiti artist from Spain and therefore finds the artist to be not notable. Meanwhile the artist remains clearly visible (and therefore notable) to the thousands of people who bother to look up each day. Due to the illegal nature of their actions, prominent graffiti artists tend not to publish their identities without their consent and steer clear of such items as personal webpages or a 'myspace', as a result their identities often do not extend beyond their chosen psuedonyms, unless discovered or published by police.</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve this problem I suggest there be a seperate list of guidelines as to what makes a graffit artist notable, as the conventional wikipedia guidelines do not seem apply well to graffiti artists. Time and time again have I seen what I would think to be a notable graffiti artist removed from wikipedia by groups of people who don't seem prepared or are unable to gather their information from a source other than the internet, a domain in which graffiti artists and their indentities can rarely be found or verified. I also feel that due to the fact the graffiti is illegal in most places, people have an inherent negative attitude toward graffiti art, which they then associate with the article. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterPartyOn_f48c.html" title="User:PeterPartyOn">PeterPartyOn</a> 02:44, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree. If we allow separate criteria for what makes a graffiti artist notable, then we must allow separate criteria for what makes an environmental artist notable, for what makes a renaissance artist notable etc. etc. And then we end up in a mess. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 10:07, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested PROD. Orphaned list article covering languages that happen to be spoken on islands. This would make sense if there was some implied (non-OR) claim that languages on islands are somehow special (like that they develop differently from languages elsewhere, etc.) No such claim is made here, and to the best of my knowledge not in the linguistic literature either. Therefore, the subject of this list is not a coherent encyclopedic topic, it's listcruft. We could just as well have "languages spoken on mountains", "languages spoken in plains", "languages spoken in swamps", "languages spoken in deserts", "languages spoken near rivers"... <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 05:43, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless referenced. I find that "insular" is used frequently in ethnography e.g. about Polynesia, not so much about larger places like Indonesia. For languages, "insular language" most often is just a colloquialism. "Insular" occurs most often in terms of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_language.html" title="Celtic language">Celtic language</a> to distinguish the varieties on the Isles from the varieties on the Continent. But Google doesn't show that they're classified this way in any formal sense. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 11:51, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anyway, I don't think language isolates is what the author of this page was after. He really meant the geographical definition. The only remote chance for that criterion to make sense would be if it was restricted to languages that are the <i>only</i> language on the island where they are spoken, and thus in geographical isolation from language contact. That <i>might</i> conceivably influence their development (a claim that has been made with respect to Icelandic). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:21, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Withdraw nomination</b>. After considering the discussion below and considering recent changes made to the article by various editors including myself, I believe that there is enough notability and potential to warrant <b>keeping</b> the article. I still believe that the article needs expansion and that it needs to be reviewed to remove any hint of advertising and self-promotion but that can be addressed via the appropriate tags.</p>

<dd>NB: For those who might be unfamiliar with the AFD process, my withdrawal of nomination of this article for AFD does NOT end this AFD debate. I cannot close the debate once it has started. The debate continues until a consensus for <b>speedy keep</b> is reached OR an admin closes the debate.</dd>

<li>I disagree. Notability is relevant to all subjects although the criteria for notability may differ from subject to subject.
<p>However, I am on the brink of withdrawing my nomination after looking at the references which were added subsequent to the nomination. To pass criterion #1 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, some of the information in the references should be included in the article itself. Also important would be taking material from the references regarding the claims of unique pedagogical approach claimed by the school, thus satisfying criterion #4 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richardshusr</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichardshusr_7aa4.html" title="User talk:Richardshusr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Richardshusr_b77d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Richardshusr">contribs</a>) 2006-09-28 15:48:45 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>You are disagreing with a straw man, not with what I actually wrote. You are conflating notability with <i>assertions of</i> notability. There is a difference between an article on a subject that is not notable and an article that doesn't assert the notability of its subject. The latter <i>only</i> applies to the speedy deletions of certain, specific, classes of articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not interested in mincing words and getting into a wide-ranging policy debate about notability and criteria for deletion. The bottom line is that, if the article doesn't explain why the school is notable and therefore encyclopedic, I'm keeping my vote at "Delete". The information that would satisfy me is in the two articles that are referenced. Stop arguing with me and improve the article to meet Wikipedia standards and I'll change my vote. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 21:17, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yet more straw men. This is not a policy debate about notability. This is you using a rationale for deletion that is <i>not a reason for deletion</i>, and your error being explained to you. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:39, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, since you seem intent on educating me, please do so. Let me jumpstart the dialogue by providing the Wikipedia sources I am relying on and you can show me the error of my reasoning. Admittedly, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is not policy; it's only a guideline. However, if you read it, there is nothing in it that limits it to "certain, specific classes of articles" while excluding schools. Also, if you look at criterion #1 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, what it's getting at essentially is notability even if it doesn't say so explicitly. Or, perhaps you're getting hung up on "notability" per se. The core may be about <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. You've got marginally reliable sources. They are marginal, because the source articles still sound like regurgitated press releases with thinly veiled promotional intent. Now, all I'm asking is that you lift the points made in these marginally reliable sources and put them in the article. Why is this so hard? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:22, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Some apologies: On reflection, I understand <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a>'s point about "assertions of notability" vs. "notability". Apparently, some articles could be about notable subjects but still be candidates for speedy deletion if the article doesn't assert notability? Sounds crazy to me but that is apparently what the current policy means and what <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> has been trying to say. Note, however, that this is not a CSD debate but an AFD debate and, as I stated above, notability counts. I think Uncle G will agree with this. I am not convinced that this new school is notable or, skip "notable", the article does not pass <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> in its current form. Also, I still maintain that the article reads like an advertisement and therefore fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an advertising medium</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>.</li>

<p>I'm sure we could write an article on audit methodology for sustainable transport, but this would not be it. References to blogspot etc., and no actual substance (this is more like a meta-article describing what an article would include). The (here) link to TRL will probably never be filled since it's copyright, I usually pay around £25 for TRL reports. As far as I can see this is an attempt to create a Wiki version of a single TRL report.

<p>Original research, trivia, unencyclopaedic and verifiability. The only two relevant Google hits are Wikipedia, and the rest are law firms. <i>"Steel's law" Exposer</i> doesn't get any Google hits at all. The 'critic' doesn't have an article, so can't be <i>that</i> notable. I've seen many versions of this in magazines such as <i>Empire</i> and <i>Maxim</i>, or e-mail forwards, so Wikipedia attributing it to one person is misleading. The word "law" in the name suggests greater authority than this light entertainment deserves; it's not encyclopaedic. It doesn't belong in the criticism cats (not in the academic understanding of film criticism anyway -- as opposed to simply the journalistic one), and certainly not 'critical theory'.<br />
Also, not wishing to bite the newbies, creating this was the author's first edit: there have been allegations on the talk page of vanity. Which I think are legitimate. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 09:14, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Save</b> - I removed the critical theory category and put in just film theory; that seemed to be a large part of the problem. I don't know how many times I must repeat myself, though, this is not original resource. If you were to pick up a copy of <i>The Exposer</i> the August 30 issue, you'd find an article on this. If you think that attributing this to one person is wrong, or calling it a "law" is wrong, then make the changes yourself rather than just taking the easy way out by deleting the article. I find this to be very similar to <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a>, which was a mindset shared by many internet users but formulated into a pseudolaw by one person. I doubt it had much press when it was created in 1992, so if you just wait, Steel's law will also become a little more well-known.<a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJiberole_d9fd.html" title="User:Jiberole">Jiberole</a> 17:21, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is <i>not</i> film theory. It is light entertainment. Wikipedia does not include things which might become famous in the future. We include things which already are. It vey much seems that this article only exists to enhance the somewhat limited notability of whoever Steel is. I suspect he's a high school student in the San Franscisco area...? Oh, and I have made the changes needed: the article needs to be deleted, so I've nominated. As for Goodwin's Law, the chances are Goodwin's name was <i>already</i> attached to it by the time it was made a Wikipedia article. The magazine in which you say it will apparantly take of does not even seem to have a Wikipedia article. So you are asking us to include a non-notable person attempting to link their name to a piece of light entertainment, citing a non-notable magazine? And no-one else on the internet is talking about it. Repeat yourself as many times as you want: when Steel is indelibly associated with this and there are dozens of independent sources to verify it, then he can have his article. For the moment, this is going to the great encyclopedia in the sky. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 19:16, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Non-notable organization. Per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, organizations need to show at least two non-trivial instances of media coverage to establish notability, not counting self-published material, advertisements, press releases, etc. Google and some media searches didn't turn up anything of note other than Wikipedia &amp; its mirrors, and the article itself lists only the TBG's own publications and two entries in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> "Court and Social" page, which is apparently a page where people may <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/pressoffice/advertising/announce.xml&amp;site=24&amp;page=0" class="external text" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/pressoffice/advertising/announce.xml&amp;site=24&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">purchase advertisements</a>of marriages, dinners, and other social events. (2) Nothing on the page is verified, as far as I can see, (3) the page reads like an advertisement for the group. (4) Finally, given the lack of verifiable sources about the group, I don't see any way to fix any of the above. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 10:09, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The google test is very telling. 1,000 people on your mailing list does not make notability, nor does having your dinners in the Daily Telegraph.

<li><b>Comment</b>, in that case then you should delete the following articles, to be fair, you can't just delete one mod article and leave the rest. Deleting all of the mods from Wikipedia goes against the whole feel that has made Wikipedia so popular amongst internet communities, and is really a step in the wrong direction, IMHO, for the site. No one had a problem with mods being on Wikipedia until Whispering here went deletion happy.

<li><b>Comment</b> The article has already been editied to mention two magazines that the mod has been in. It will be included in a third magazine in the very near future. There are probably other small stints in magazines that we don't know about. With the Gamestar magazine it was distributed on their CD, meaning that the release was sent to 300,000 people. <a href="http://www.totalbf2.com/page.php?do=reviewprmm" class="external text" title="http://www.totalbf2.com/page.php?do=reviewprmm" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a review of the mod on TotalBF2, easily the largest BF2 news and fan site around. The mod has recieved <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/157236/150000/fileinfo/Battlefield-2---Project-Reality-v0.32" class="external text" title="http://www.fileplanet.com/157236/150000/fileinfo/Battlefield-2---Project-Reality-v0.32" rel="nofollow">36k</a> downloads on FilePlanet alone. Between the TotalBF2 downloads, torrent downloads, and other mod site downloads, the mod has easily grossed 100k downloads over its 4 major releases. The mod was also approached about doing a stint in <a href="http://www.soldiermagazine.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.soldiermagazine.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">"Soldier Magazine"</a>, the British Army's magazine. Surely this adds up to notability? This is not a small mod that no one has ever heard of and that never released anything, quite the opposite.--207.177.229.17 05:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is true that it has little to do with the students' union. The point is that the students' union must be a notable organisation for the BBC to be interested in what it has to say on the matter of the Mayor of London. SOAS Students' Union is also notable because it is the most radically left wing students' Union in the UK. It is know throughout the students' movement in that way. So if you have any students' unions on wiki then you should take note of ones who have left NUS (imperial) the oldest ones (KCL and UCL). In the students' union movement it is known because of this.<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExULstudent_219d.html" title="User:ExULstudent">ExULstudent</a> 7:30, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Being a radical students' union is notable because in the history of students' unions they all used to be far more left wing, as is mentioned on their wiki pages.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm afraid I really cannot take a stand one way or the other. I have just arrived at SOAS, and while I get the impression that they are the most left-wing student body in the UK, that does not unfortunately make them quite notable enough. I say merge most of this info into the main SOAS article, or add discussion of individual particular events in which the SOAS Union did something notable to the whole city, country or world. Have they led marches that made the news? Have they in any way truly affected policy? I honestly don't know... <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 11:44, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> both articles. This is a tricky issue. Prior to September 3, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> said that plot summaries were appropriate "as part of a series of articles per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">Wikipedia:Article series</a>". That phrase appears to have been deleted inadvertently during a series of edits and reversions, and I have added it back in. (See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Plot_summaries_as_part_of_article_series" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">here</a>). The upshot is that IMHO, both of the plot arc articles should be shortened as a style issue, but aren't properly a subject for deletion, as the overall plot allows readers to put the other articles in the Naruto series in context. (Although I agree that the articles are too long, that is a {{sofixit}} issue, not a reason for deletion). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> both articles, the plot summaries to many other shows, anime and not, are far greater than the Naruto articles put together. As was said above, plot summaries are allowed, and many people who can't read the manga or watch the anime can use these pages to catch up. We already limit speculative theories about characters and plots, and that should be enough. However if a merger is done and we must shorten the articles then it would be in everybody's best interest to eliminate trivia sections and the filler material, in fact the entire filler page could be done away with before any changes are made to these articles, as it does not harm the plot too much.67.85.70.232 18:48, 28 September 2006 (UTC) A fan of Naruto looking out for other fans' interests.

<li><b>Split</b> by arc. This page is much too large and already omits quite a bit of information (eg: the other fights during the Chunin Exam arc), and filler arcs are ignored altogether. This will leave a lot of small articles, but it will be a lot better than the massive, cramped page we have now. Fillers can be grouped by season (of course, keeping together arcs that have the season break between episodes).

<dd>What I see in your link is that Vuk Drašković (who is an centralist) accused Vojvodinian autonomists that they supoort independence. It is well known that pro-centralist politicians accuse autonomist politicians for separatism simply to derogate their popularity. But did you ever heard any autonomist politician including Nenad Čanak to support independence? I certainly did not heard. The web site of the LSV political party (led by Nenad Čanak) claim that autonomous republic of Vojvodina that they propagate would make Serbia stronger. So, yes, there are people who support "Republic of Vojvodina", but certainly not "Independent Republic of Vojvodina". The only possible way to have this article verified (the verification policy of Wikipedia - remember), is to rename it to "Republic of Vojvodina" and then it will present political program of LSV party about federalized Serbia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 17:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, if expanded, otherwise merge into Vojvodina</b>. In my opinion, the question is not how much support it has but whether one can write a long enough article about it as a proposed formation with references. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, of course, but it's not about the future but about a presently existing idea. Just look at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Category%7ENational_liberation_movements_fd33.html" title="Category:National liberation movements">National liberation movements</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Category%7ESecessionist_organizations_1d4f.html" title="Category:Secessionist organizations">Secessionist organizations</a> caterories: they contain hundreds of articles. The proposed states may be hypothetical but the ideas are real (and, after all, everything that exists on Earth was created from plans). Beyond doubt, it is a viable topic in Wikipedia as in any other encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 17:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It have nothing with "liberation movements". It is only dream of few local Hungarian and Croatian irredentists who still dream Greater Hungary and Greater Croatia. These irredentists are not even accepted among their own ethnic communities. József Kasza for example did not had very good opinion about "64 counties movement", and even they do not support independent Vojvodina openly. And the second problem is that idea is simply not openly or publicly supported by anybody relevant, instead by few local drunkards in the cafe. Should we create a Wikipedia article about every idea of every street drunkard? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 17:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Panonian, I'm afraid you're lost on this page. We are voting about a page called "<b>Independent</b> Republic of Vojvodina". How do you think a (proposed) independent state could be related to the Greater Hungary or the Greater Croatia concept? These latter deal with incorporating areas (making them <i>dependent</i>), rather than creating <i>independent</i> states. It would be useful to realize what other people talk about before you voice your opinion... <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 21:24, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the answer is very simple: we can take <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunTheGoaT_3edf.html" title="User:HunTheGoaT">User:HunTheGoaT</a> as a very good example of this what I speak. Since he created this article, we can assume that he support independent Vojvodina, but does he support it? If you see his user page you will notice that he has "No Trianon" tag there and now tell me how one can be for independent Vojvodina and against the Treaty of Trianon in the same time? It is simply impossible. The Treaty of Trianon was a condition that Vojvodina today exist at all, so if there is no Trianon, then there is no Vojvodina, there is no Croatia, there is no Slovakia, etc, and instead of them, there is only one thing - a Greater Hungary. So, if somebody is against Trianon that means that he is also against Vojvodina (dependent or independent no matter), and if such person tell that he support independent Vojvodina, the only way how it can be explained is that such person want to implement "divide and conquer" policy - to divide Serbs and to make Vojvodina easier target for Hungary than it is now. Just think why Albanians in Montenegro voted for Montenegrin independence...same performance, another actors... <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 02:42, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Independent Vojvodina and against the Treaty of Trianon in the same time is not impossible. I don't wan to restore of the Greater-Hungary! I say that the Treaty is not good. If Vojvodina will an independent state, this will change the borders of Trianon because Vojvodina has been given to Serbia and if it weren't Serbia anymore it meant the fall of the Trianon border.</dd>

<dd>But independent Vojvodina will not change Trianon border. If Vojvodina became independent border with Hungary still will be the same and the Trianon still will be valid. The point of Trianon was that Serbs and other Slavs of Vojvodina (who were majority in Vojvodina) live in their own Slavic state instead under Hungarian rule. The question whether name of this Slavic state is Yugoslavia, Serbia or Vojvodina is simply irrelevant - it is still Slavic state. So, you see, independent Vojvodina would be only a confirmation of the Trianon. And by the way, Vojvodina was not "given" to Serbia by the Trianon - it is Slavic citizens of Vojvodina that voted for it and Trianon recognized their right to self determination. Independent Vojvodina would be only another form of that right (if it is achieved by their own will), and it would retain everything what Trianon was. Regarding Kosovo, Kosovo is lost for Serbia (time will show whether it is bad or good), but that fact means that the relevant political factors in the World will give a compensation to Serbia. And do you know what that compensation is? The compensation is that they will not push Serbia further about its minorities and that Serbia will not lost any part of its current territory - in another words (this is a joke), but if all Serbs in Serbia become canibals and start to kill and eat its ethnic minorities, the World will not care (that is a compensation for Kosovo, my friend, so think about it).&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 13:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And by the way, in the time when the Treaty of Trianon was signed (in 1920), Serbia did not existed as a state, but the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Serbs%2C_Croats_and_Slovenes_fdc0.html" title="Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a>. So, by your own logic, the fact that Vojvodina is not part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes but part of Serbia would mean that Trianon borders are already changed, right? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 14:27, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We must stop our discussion about it. You know that Serbia is the succesor state of the SHS Kingdom. This is just philosophy. Why do you think that I am a supporter of this separatist idea. I just don't know why is Senta, Ada, Kanjiza and the other settlements with around 80% majority in Serbia. We can't speak Serbian enough good because here the 90% speaks Hungarian nearly perfect. Just those who came from Bosnia and Croatia can't stand Hungarians. I want just a better life for Hungarians. I think that the Trianon Treaty is bad, but to totaly restore the Greater-Hungary is also not good. I think there should be changes in borders in an other way. The propbleme is that neither Hungary neither Serbia don't care about us. But now we should end our talk. Bye!

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Jimbo deleted the article out of human dignity and it is covered in the controversy article, so I have speedy closed the nomination.

<p><b>No Deletion</b> I really don't think that this article stands to be deleted. Norman Coates is a legitimate entry to wikipedia. Granted, Norman's entry is not as full or info filled as i think it could be but i don't think that that alone merits deletion. Mr. Coates is a respected lighting designer that has lit broadway shows. Along with numerous tours and regional shows that i know are not listed here. If Norman's article is to be deleted then shouldnt the other lighting designers listed on wikipedia? If anyone has a problem with the addition please let me know. And if the amount of data is an issue, i will fill in the data. <b>Airbornecasualty 01:09, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You seem to have the impression that because one person has an entry on Wikipedia, everybody else in that profession should have an entry. This is not necessarily true. The main criteria for inclusion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">people</a> in Wikipedia is that they should be the subject of multiple independent third-party information sources. Maybe someone has written about him in newspapers or magazines?

<dd><b>Response</b> I have since compiled much data about Coates' work, and looking at all that i have compiled i feel that he does merit his page. He has made an impact in the North American theatre community. He has also influenced many learning designers in his work at The North Carolina School of the Arts. I plan to compile the information (and the sources that mention him) soon. <b>Airbornecasualty 21:10, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<li>This isn't an encyclopaedia article. It's an advertisement. The biggest clue is that four fifths of the article is devoted to listing the menu served by this restaurant, including the individual prices for many items. It's written in the first person, and the author's intention of writing the article, apparent from xyr edits to the external links section of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, is to give the restaurant itself a "boost". Wikipedia is neither a business directory nor an advertising billboard. Whether or not an encyclopaedia article can be written on this subject (and a quick search indicates that the WP:CORP criteria probably cannot be satisfied), this content must go. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:25, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>True I was surprised to see an article on my program here&#160;:). Now I finally get to feel what its like to be nominated for deletion&#160;:). The earlier program by Eddie Edwards has a bit history in the C2 wiki and such for being the first real wiki built on an actual server... different times then though.......... <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 11:17, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Not clear about the 'has no secondary sources'; of those 200 unique google hits, at least 54 are mentionning it in the context of actual use. Within the niche of wikiservers (self-containing wiki-engines) it is the most known example. Furthermore, it was the first wiki of this concept to ever be built; that alone makes it already notable enough to be mentionned. I agree that the article could be improved, but this could be remedied by declaring it a stub, which can be made better (adding a more elaborate history and making it less advertorial in tone, for instance).</li>
</ul>
<p>If one stays consistent, and being the first and oldest of a subgenre of wikisystems, and having 200 unique hits, is not enough, then roughly 40% of all wiki-systems mentionned on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software</a> should *certainly* be deleted too, since they have even far less to show for. Both actions; offering this article for deletion while leaving the others stand, as well as deleting all those wikisystems, would seem rather unreasonable. In my book, being the first of a genre (or subgenre) makes something already noteworthy.</p>

The so-called reference cites only five cases, all collected by one author, with no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the symptoms described were caused by the withdrawal of the SSRI. The study he reports is bad science.

<li><b>Delete - but merge.</b> It is the term "PANES" that is dubious, rather than the condition itself. This phenomenon is relatively rare, but it most certainly exists, usually in previous long-term users of SSRIs - there are a great many examples of these long-term after effects of SSRIs cited in medical literature (PubMed will throw up many cases). There are, however, no sources for anything called "PANES", since the term is not in common usage, and the website linked to here is insufficient. It is also bad practice to name a "syndrome" which is not fully understood, and which may not be properly defined as a syndrome at all (two different patients may exhibit symptoms which do not overlap, and could conceivably result from two entirely separate adverse reactions to discontinuation). The whole subject is wreathed in controversy - what seems clear is that it is entirely wrong to write off this information as "made-up FUD", but it's also entirely wrong to apply a spurious term to a phenomenon which has not been fully investigated (a term which is, in any case, not recognised by any prominent scientists). In my opinion, this page should be deleted, BUT the information (or a rewrite of the information acknowledging the conflicting opinions on this subject) should be merged into <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a>.

<li>At the risk of being pedantic, there are actually well over 100 reports of SSRI-related movement disorders listed in PubMed alone. WP's own page on tardive dyskinesia lists chronic SSRI use as a possible cause. An overview can be found at <a href="http://www.socialaudit.org.uk/58092-DH.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.socialaudit.org.uk/58092-DH.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialaudit.org.uk/58092-DH.htm</a> under the section heading "Therapeutic / Normal Dose Dependence". Another page containing pertinent information is here: <a href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/mar3/adrac/adrac.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/mar3/adrac/adrac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/mar3/adrac/adrac.html</a> ... I have never heard of neuropathic pain as a post-SSRI symptom, but all the other symptoms listed here have been reported from time to time and appear in online case histories. It is perhaps a good idea to add them to the section of <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a> mentioned above, albeit with a caveat stating that these symptoms are rare and there *may* not be a direct connection to discontinuation of SSRIs (although anyone with even a passing interest in psychiatry will appreciate that the concept of chronic use of psychotropic medicines producing adverse neurological effects is hardly outrageous). However, as I stated above, I agree that this page is essentially redundant and should be deleted. The information presented here does not qualify as OR (despite the lack of sources provided) but it is not presented in a suitable manner - chiefly because of the spurious use of the term "PANES".

<li>The spurious use of the term "PANES" as the title and subject of the article is itself more than enough reason to delete it once it's been proven that nobody in the medical community uses that term. My use of the phrase "made-up FUD" was in regards to the attempt by the article's creator to turn these symptoms into their own "disease", almost certainly for the purpose of scaring potential patients from considering the use of SSRIs whatsoever even if they could greatly benefit from them. I have no quarrel with anyone taking any legitimate parts from this article and putting them into <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a> along with any necessary disclaimers about conflicting opinions on the issue. There's no need to wait for this AfD to finish before doing that; I'd do it myself, but I'm not an MD or a pharmacologist. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:07, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a landscape architect and advocate of natural burials, he's notable. I added several references, including clippings from The Post-Standard and The Link. See the references section of the article. I agree that a candidate who has not held office is not normally considered notable, but because he is notable in his profession, his article should be kept. (We had a similar discussion recently about a city council candidate in Washington, D.C. who turned out to be a notable law professor.) --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 21:43, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Non-notable. Little support for the claims that he is the recognised authority on the field; the article claims he is "a recognised authority on the natural burial movement" which he co-founded <a href="http://www.forestofmemories.org/about/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forestofmemories.org/about/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. Links to pages that tells about his importance are genarally sites of societies etc. that he is involved with. Of the users who created the article, <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthartist_6241.html" title="User:Earthartist">User:Earthartist</a> is Mr Salisbury himself (compary userpage with <a href="http://www.earthartist.com/about/earthartist2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.earthartist.com/about/earthartist2.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>).

The user who started the article is most probably involved with Mr. Salisbury in one way or another, since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=XM4527965" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=XM4527965" rel="nofollow">his contribs1</a> show the same pattern. Obviously his name has been mentioned in the local press, which does not prove much notability. Article written in a style as to show importance; the title which the article describes Mr. Salisbury as "the author of" is a thesis <a href="http://www.forestofmemories.org/research/dissertations/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forestofmemories.org/research/dissertations/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> and since the article does not say he is a PhD, it is no doubt an undergrad thesis. // <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">habj</a> 09:26, 29 September 2006 (UTC) See also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Earthartist_b5fb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Earthartist">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Earthartist</a>. // <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">habj</a> 09:37, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the Wikitionary article on it does not have nearly the detail that the Wikipedia article goes into. For example, Wikitionary says it can be used as a verb, referring to a dance move. Wikipedia describes the dance move. Wikitionary says it refers to a promiscuous woman. Wikipedia goes into greater detail. The level of detail in the Wikipedia article would not be appropriate in Wikitionary, but someone who had been called a "skank" and wanted to know what it was might appreciate a greater level of detail. So I suppose my vote would have to be a <s><b>weak keep</b></s>. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 20:52, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia describes the dance move in <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skank_%28dance%29.html" title="Skank (dance)">Skank (dance)</a>. Remove that from this article (where it doesn't belong, per <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skank_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Skank (disambiguation)">skank (disambiguation)</a>) and all that we have left are statements that a skank is either a selfish female or a person who smells bad, along with a whole load of unsourced commentary and vague insinuation. The article is in two minds about what a skank actually <i>is</i>. In both cases, this is a silly title at which to have an encyclopaedia article on the subjects of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_hygiene.html" title="Personal hygiene">personal hygiene</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Promiscuity.html" title="Promiscuity">promiscuity</a>. If we are <i>not</i> having an article on those, then what is this article to be about (that isn't already covered by the other articles linked from <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skank_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Skank (disambiguation)">skank (disambiguation)</a>)? The territory in this article is already covered by the Wiktionary article and by other articles on the dance move, on hygeiene, and on promiscuity, and a disambiguation is sufficient for leading readers to each. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:56, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't even see the otheruses template; it was hidden by the AFD tag. If the dance move already has its own article then I'd agree that this is edging from a weak keep to a <b>neutral</b>, especially if some of the additional detail could be incorporated into the dictionary page.</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Wikipedia can go into greater details on the word usage than wiktionary would. It shouldn't be difficult to find sourced material differentiating skank from <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slut.html" title="Slut">slut</a> (read that article, please, to see how articles about words grow). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 19:05, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>False. Wiktionary can go into as much detail on word usage as editors are prepared to write. (Indeed, usages and etymologies are two of its primary functions.) <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:What_Wiktionary_is_not" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:What_Wiktionary_is_not">Wiktionary is not paper</a>.

<li>Not false, this subtle semantic schism about what wiktionary is for vs what wikipedia is for doesn't make sense to stub articles. As long as wiktionary is a separate project on a separate server it is a poor destination for wikipedia articles.

A search for literature guides in google will bring out BookRags in the top 20 results <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=literature+guides&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=literature+guides&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, and Alexa data suggests that BookRags is continuing to move up the rankings <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookrags.com%2F" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookrags.com%2F" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. Having said that reliable sources are required, and I need to work on that now (note I have been busy with other things, and when I have edited BookRags it has been to remove inappropriate comments). A criticism that has been leveled is that this is just a spammy site. I have seen no evidence of this, but even if this is the case, as long as the subject is notable then even if it does spam it should still have an article. Also note that one of the main reasons I became interested in BookRags is because it had easy and cheap paid access to published material, that I could not find elsewhere. I will add more soon.

<li>It has been deleted many times, perhaps not under this name but under bookrags.com or bookrags Inc. I remember that, and I see nothing had changed. I am not sure if the site is "spammy" but I do know it had to be removed several times from various other sections for spamming Wikipedia. The sources above are not notable and at least one of them, the webknowhow.net article, is a reprint of a press release. There is no evidence that educational institutions are using Bookrags, merely a directory-style link from an Indiana department of Education website. And there is an interview with the founder from 2000. Sorry, this clearly does not meet notability guidelines. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeizer000_e5d9.html" title="User talk:Seizer000">Seizer000</a> 11:16, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This article is certainly intended as spam on behalf of this company. This company is fairly unethical in its pay and its treatment of its workers; this is documented and was included in the entry, validating the page somewhat, and the fact that it was taken out confirms that the article only exists to promote BookRags. Hopefully, it will be deleted soon. IP - 24.71.104.147</dd>
<dd>I suggest Anon IP you read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> carefully - this article IS NOT intended as spam. I wrote the article in good faith, but I do understand that it may not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. How it treats it workers is irrelevant to whether it is notable enough. Note the reason why the info on it unethical pay was removed was because there was no source to back it up. Although this AFD may be closed with a delete, I suggest people disregard 24.71.104.147's comments, as they are clearly in bad faith.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree about bad faith of the article's originator, however in terms of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it seems pretty cut and dry-- it does not meet the guidelines for inclusion. Sites like these are on the very edge and personally I think <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the problem, not the site.

<li>Hello, I work for Murad and www.murad.com and we are trying to create an article that meets the standards of Wikipedia. We are not infringing on any copyrighted material as it is our copyright. Please instruct us on creating this in accordance to Wikipedia standards. We have followed the examples of Dell and other large companies. We are not spamvertising, we have a small number of informational links to support the article. Where is the spam? Each article we looked at on Wikipedia has the same. Please inform us how we are breaking any of Wikipedia's rules. We would like to represent our company and provide the public information on Dr. Murad and Murad, Inc. The accusations above are not based in fact. First, there was a mistake by someone flagging us for speedy deletion, based on a copy and paste copyright infringement. We can not infringe on our own copyright and revised some of the initial copy we wrote. We have met the criteria of WP:BIO. The information is factual and unbiased. We only state purely unopionated facts about Dr. Murad and his contribution to the Dermatology field. Instead of false accusations, please provide solutions to some real issues with the article so we can correct them. We have taken out anything that could be considered opinion and added a reference to www.acnecomplex.com.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.214.63.36 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.214.63.36.html" title="User talk:207.214.63.36">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.214.63.36_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.214.63.36">contribs</a>).</small>

By your admission above, this article violates all three policies. It is all but impossible for you, as an employee of Dr. Murad, to write a policy-conforming article, and a non-conforming article written by someone with a financial interest in the subject is, by Wikipedia's definition, spam. If and when Dr. Murad has enough written about him independent of his own advertising and press releases, someone else will create an article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 15:35, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um, never done one of these before and I'm kinda green, so I'm not really sure if it saves my info automatically or whether I need to fill it in. Who keeps putting notices about the subject's "importance" is that ponju? Alot of those notations have no meaning. The unverified link is sorta valid as there are alot of people that just come up an say stuff, but encyclopedic tone is irrelevent as it is written about ponju for ponju members, there are not many refernces to actually cite as it does not draw any outside info, and the importance is irrelevant as it is a fangroup type site and as such has no importance outside the site, unlike <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiromancy.html" title="Chiromancy">Chiromancy</a>. There's a link to the history of ponju in my account, if you want evidence. Though I'd rather the ponju section not be closed (anymore than Okashina Okashi) as it is a informational link. <a href="../../../b/u/l/User%7EBulmabriefs144_a3ac.html" title="User:Bulmabriefs144">User:bulmabriefs144</a>

<ul>
<li>The following is what constitutes indescriminant information:
<ul>
<li>"<b>Lists of Frequently Asked Questions.</b> Wikipedia articles should not list FAQs. Instead, format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s).</li>
<li><b>Travel guides.</b> An article on Paris should mention landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, but not the telephone number or street address of your favorite hotel or the price of a café au lait on the Champs-Élysées. Such details are, however, very welcome at Wikitravel, but note that due to license incompatibility you cannot copy content wholesale unless you are the copyright holder.</li>
<li><b>Memorials.</b> Wikipedia is not the place to honor departed friends and relatives. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered.</li>
<li><b>Instruction manuals.</b> While Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia. If you're interested in a how-to style manual, you may want to look at Wikihow or our sister project Wikibooks.</li>
<li><b>Internet guides.</b> Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See current events for examples.</li>
<li><b>Textbooks and annotated texts.</b> These belong on our sister project, Wikibooks.</li>
<li><b>Plot summaries</b>. Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article, or as part of a series of articles per Wikipedia:Article series."</li>

<p>pOnju does not contain any of the following things, aside from it being an internet guide.

<li>The problem here is not just a matter of "tone." It's a matter of no verifiable information from reputable third-party reliable sources that even mentions this trivial topic, let alone suggests it has any sort of notable "achievements, impact or historical significance." That is, this article does not, and appears to have no chance at this time, of meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.

<li>Actually, I'm pretty sure I can find a couple offline newspaper articles that mention pOnju. They were printed in a paper local to Worcester, MA. I just need to find time to sift through the old copies I still have lying around. While not a major media source, the paper is at least a reliable source. Also, take into account the Hamthology project: once it's complete, there will be secondary sources that review it and mention its source, making the forum worthy of inclusion. So, a couple articles now that can provide background and help take a little sting off the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> violations and the potential future articles mean this entry has hope of becoming encyclopedic. And an article that has the potential to be encyclopedic should not be deleted, just cleaned up. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 04:48, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>If anything the edits yesterday by User:POnju show how much original research is in the article, not to mention that seeing him edit implies that the article is Vanity. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadian-Bacon_27f4.html" title="User:Canadian-Bacon"><i><font color="red">Canadian</font></i>-<i><b><font color="black">Bacon</font></b></i></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadian-Bacon_224e.html" title="User talk:Canadian-Bacon"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Canadian-Bacon_a3bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Canadian-Bacon"><font color="black"><i>c</i></font></a> <font color="green"><i>e</i></font></sup> 05:55, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is unfortunately true: Henry's edits have made the article much more original research and POV than it was when the original team of editors (Pipian, Ed, myself, others) were constructing the page. I've tried my best to keep pOnju's continued insertion of unverfiable items in check. After his RFC is finished, though, he may be barred from editing Wiki, which will largely fix the current edit war problem the article is facing. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 18:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non notable forum. Has a brief mention of a person named 'pOnju' - might want to merge this to the appropriate article... or not. And why is this discussion so long?

<li><b>Delete</b>. To a few users like myself it is a notable forum. To the general world it's a minor footnote in a vast sea of webcomics and forums. It was fun seeing a Wiki article about pOnju, but it really doesn't merit a Wiki page. The only possible argument I can see for keeping the article is the 'long-tail' theory of Wikipedia: that it is more inclusive in knowledge than Britannia or other encyclopedia sources. It seems to be worthy of a speedy deletion IMHO since the article has turned into an edit war between the creater of the webpage and users who have been banned from the webpage, and thus any hope for NPOV is lost. 198.50.4.4 15:00, 5 October 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan888_e9d9.html" title="User:Jonathan888">Jonathan888</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonathan888_ae66.html" title="User talk:Jonathan888">(talk)</a> 15:03, 5 October 2006 (UTC) (signed in so my comments would be properly signed)
<ul>
<li><b>Restart</b>. What I would actually agree upon is a delete provided it could be started over from scratch with agreement of no interference from either Ponju himself, or the banned members. It might still degenerate into meaningless information, but maybe a new start telling the various basic points- who it was started by (maybe basic info too), the webcomics hosted there, the Ponju Anthology, and some of the traditions and history- would make it closer to objective form. Chance are even if it isn't in the local paper, someone would hear mention of it elsewhere online, and want to know about it (similar to how I first learned of Megatokyo). Not seeing any info would be a mark against Wiki's all-inclusive nature. I mean, just today I found out Wiki also has <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klaatu_barada_nikto.html" title="Klaatu barada nikto">Klaatu barada nikto</a> as a subject, as well as the <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami_Code_6533.html" title="Konami Code">Konami Code</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Verdict on that AfD was "no consensus." You can't really cite a "no consensus" AfD as evidence that an article should be kept, as <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus can change</a>. At any rate, regardless of your promises to expand the article, I remain dubious as to how the article can be expanded and <i>reliably sourced</i> to back up that expansion. Such an expansion runs a serious risk of presenting granularity not supported by this individual's notability, and most sources that could be used to expand the article are Alex Jones websites.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 15:18, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In my opinion, this page does not conform by any stretch of the imagination to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. All additions of shows, movies, etc. to the page are unreferenced, and the asserted connections made are not even stated. Any attempt to make this page properly referenced would need to provide a <i>list</i> of shows defined as connected from a <i>primary source</i> like a newspaper, and I know of no such source. "A link to someone's attempt to research this on their own" is not a source, and would also fall under WP:NOR. Although the article <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Westphall_8bd1.html" title="Tommy Westphall">Tommy Westphall</a> (Universe) might survive an AFD because its existence is discussed in primary sources, this is pure unreferenced speculation. I could add any show I wanted to this article, and declaratively add it to the 'Tommy Westphall Universe' by doing so. My belief is that unless someone has a statable plan to actually clean this article up, to have it conform to WP:NOR, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 21:18, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> into the main Tommy Westphal article. As for the question of verifiability, it is easy enough to link to one of the online episode guides and verify that said character appeared on said show on said date---thus proving a connection between one program and another. Certainly, no one involved with this AfD is actually going to argue with the fact that certain television shows are connected to certain other television shows because of the "cross-over" of certain characters, yes? The real source of the argument, it seems, is the rejection of the idea of the Tommy Westphal "Universe," which, though it is speculative, is certainly verifiable and has a presence outside of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> has, in addition to making this AfD nomination, deleted most of the examples of cross-overs from the main Westphal article, indicating (at least to me) a prejudice against the very concept. As I have said, the fact that a character from one series appeared on an episode of another series <b>can</b> be verified, so what exactly is the problem?</li>

<dd>Perhaps before I start, I should explain that my intent with this AFD is not to debate the viability of the Tommy Westphall Universe; I'm discussing appropriate material for Wikipedia by policy.</dd>

<dd>To begin: let's say that the real Shakespeare wrote two fictional plays about a man named Prince Hamlet of Denmark. Are they the same Prince Hamlet, or different ones? The only person that can answer that question authoritatively is Shakespeare. Cliffs notes (or even the plays themselves) do not allow a reader to authoritatively draw this conclusion because by definition, they are two seperate fictional works; the best one can do is infer. If the two written plays were called 'Hamlet I' and 'Hamlet II', that might provide a stronger factual base, but it is still provided by Shakespeare in the form of the titles, and not by his readers. <i>If it is provided by his readers, it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in the form of inference.</i></dd>
</dl>

<dl>

<dd>I do not believe it fair of us as encyclopaedians to assume conclusions about a person's writing <b>and present it as fact</b>, <i>even if it seems obvious to us</i>. Tom Fontana's interview in BBC News merely states that Mr. Fontana is aware of the existence of the Tommy Westphall Universe, not even that he endorses it, or to what extent. The quote was: "Someone did the math once ... and something like 90 per cent of all television took place in Tommy Westphall's mind. God love him."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> For the record, Wikipedia discourages treating "in universe" facts as real world fact: see <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>. <i>Wikipedia is an out-of-universe source, and all articles about fiction and elements of fiction should take an out-of-universe perspective.</i> Comparing in-universe facts - what an episode guide will have in it - and drawing out-of-universe factual conclusions based on it is not considered encyclopaedic by Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I removed most of the crossover content on <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Westphall_8bd1.html" title="Tommy Westphall">Tommy Westphall</a> and left one example where Fontana was involved with both series because I think Fontana's intent with <i>St. Elsewhere</i> and <i>Homicide: Life on the Street</i> <i>might</i> be citable. It merely provides a framework by which people put the Westphall universe together, without trying to draw its boundaries, which is what I believe this list article is attempting to do by inference. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 22:59, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Original research. There is a confusion that author brings claiming that "vibrola" means general pitch alteration device for guitars. "Vibrola" usually refers to specific device, not general device. "Tremolo" or "tremolo arm" is a wide-spread term for these devices. There is already a <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tremolo_arm.html" title="Tremolo arm">tremolo arm</a> article in Wikipedia for "general" term, and "vibrola" refers to vintage-style Gibson and, possibly, Rickenbacker tremolos. Using "vibrola" as a general term without any major references is an original research of the author. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyCat_699e.html" title="User:GreyCat">GreyCat</a> 22:37, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I placed an Original Research tag on this article very early this morning, and it was simply removed by the page creator. I hoped the placing of said tag would result in some positive changes to the article, the tone of which is entirely speculative. Indeed, the first paragraph is made up almost entirely of questions, rather than assertions of fact, and it is facts which are the basis of an encyclopaedia article. Hence, the tone is not encyclopaedic. This reads as a speculative essay, in which the author ventures a possibility, or states a hunch. No such discipline as "anthropogeology" exists in any university, and the links that he provides do not, in any way, support the contentions of the article. In fact, all of the references he provides are copied straight from one of those websites with no citation. To sum up, this is an essay, with no relevant references, and offers opinion and conjecture rather than fact. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 23:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term isn't widely used, but the concept of an overlap between anthropology and geology is recognized in a number of ways, as cited in the references. Clarion University uses the term "Anthropology, Geography, and Earth Science". Lucy A. Wilson has a Ph.D. in " "Anthropology and Geology". Indiana University has a department of "Geography, Geology and Anthropology". In short, I think the discipline exists, but it doesn't have a well-settled name yet. Anthropogeology is probably a better name for the time being than "what Lucy Wilson does".--<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 23:40, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Here's a quote extracted from the above webpage
<dl>
<dd>Broughton (1976) considers the English as used by speakers of Maltese as 'Maltese English'.</dd>
<dd>This form of speech is characterised by the influence of Maltese on English. If the influence of Maltese on English is minimal, the speech carries with it considerable esteem. If on the Other hand the influence of the mother tongue on English is great, the speech will be socially stigmatised (Borg 1986:12). Camilleri (1995a:88) remarks that "Maltese English is influenced by Maltese on all linguistic levels, namely phonology, grammar, semantics and discourse, but not on the lexical level…."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The other variety, namely Mixed Maltese English, is made up of lexical items from both languages and so involves various types of code-switching (Camilleri 1995a:88). The term 'Mixed Maltese English' was introduced by Borg (1980). Such an example of Mixed Maltese English would be the following instance of motherese:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>'Tiha [kis:] il-['mami], literally, "Give-her kiss the-mummy", for "Give mummy a kiss" (Borg 1986:12).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Aquilina (1960:5) had already noticed such a mixed variety of language in Malta. He called it 'Sliema jargon' and attributed it to the feminine gender. According to Aquilina, this mixed variety of speech "is no more than a pretentious hotch potch". Gullick (1976) considers this 'Sliema jargon' Maltese English and a middle status mixture. Today, this mixture can be attributed to both genders and is spreading to almost every locality. This is an alarming fact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Maltese are increasingly losing their linguistic competence in both Maltese and English and are relying on a 'hotch potch' of both. Sciriha (1994:322) argues that</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"If this situation persists, Malta will cease to be a bilingual nation, but will move toward monolingualism with the language spoken displaying features of both languages in contact. This will eventually give rise to some kind of Pidgin language."</dd>

<dd>Would we rename it to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_English_ea11.html" title="Maltese English">Maltese English</a>?

There's enough to demonstrate that this idea is not original research, and is accepted (albeit argued about) in the linguistic community. Clearly there should be an encyclopaedia article. The only real question is the title. But that's not for AFD to settle. AFD's rôle is to discuss whether this subject is unverifiable or original research. I merely point out that all of the aforementioned sources call it either <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_English_ea11.html" title="Maltese English">Maltese English</a> or Mixed Maltese English. None of them call it Minglish. The idea that we should be somehow consistent and use an uncommon informal name (based on an equally bizarre notion that doing otherwise magically makes it a "non-notable form of English") is at odds with our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>. <b>Keep</b> and leave the name discussion to the talk page. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps 12oz's hits should be noted? What is the argument that this is non-notable? Because its not important to you? Graffiti is regarded nation-wide as an important issue, and this site is a hub of the graffiti artists. Where else can you talk to graffiti writers?

NON-NOTABLE website, maybe in your community, but in the graffiti world, this is the ONLY website. Backed by some of the BIGGEST artists in the graffiti community. At least do a little research into things before you describe something as "non-notable". So the worlds biggest graffiti website, which used to be one of the worlds biggest graffiti magazines, which has published one of the greatest graffiti books, which is backed by some of the worlds most famous graffiti artists, isn't notable enough?

<li>Definitely keep, as mentioned 12ozprophet.com has been an ongoing effort of various minds throughout the world. These include some of the worlds most reknown graffiti artists and is a forum which allows participation from the inexperienced, to the masters of style. As far as not having any news mentions or no credibility as a source, the website in recent months has been highlighted by several news broadcasts. I will ad that with 55,000+ registered members, perhaps to you it is unoticeable, however to the community it is aimed for it is a premier source of information. yes artcrimes is the first website to feature graffiti as its central point, but why should 12oz prophet, a site which started 2 years after, be penalized and not be featured here?189.165.46.229 17:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Ginger Bread Man

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see what you don't understand about it, makes sense to me. Why should 12oz be penalized because it started two years after Artcrimes, which by the way, has little to no actual content, just alot of pictures and dead links. No thanks. As far as news articles, it seems weird that you would notice the wikipedia article being announced so more people could come on here and fix it, but not notice, <a href="http://www.10news.com/news/9858635/detail.html" class="external free" title="http://www.10news.com/news/9858635/detail.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.10news.com/news/9858635/detail.html</a> , apparently the news thinks 12oz is a popular site. But how reliable are they? Grits

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li>Okay. From the top:
<p>Of course Wikipedia is not a webhost. Clearly 12oz Prophet is strong enough to stand on its own. Yes, there is a link from the main page, so what? There are links to <i>many</i> other sites.</p>
<p>Yes, artcrimes would appear to be “<i>the</i> comprehensive source for graffiti information” with a cursory look. That is simply because it is the most well-known. I am having a hard time understanding this philosophy that 12oz doesn’t deserve its own article just because artcrimes doesn’t have one. That’s like saying Lili St. Cyr wouldn’t deserve an article if Bettie Paige didn’t have one. Also, if you go to the artcrimes page, and look at their list of best graffiti sites, guess who’s first? 12oz Prophet. Albeit, it is an alphabetical list, but the fact that 12oz is listed should say something.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you would consider 12oz a “reliable source”, the statistics kept as a function of the message board software should be sufficient enough. (Or, see for yourself on the main page of the forum.)</p>

<li>I'd also like to add that 12ozProphet has many more attributes that Art Crimes does not, simply due to the nature of it being a forum. Aside from the pictures, there are instructional threads and topics concerning safety, discussion of legal issues and individual rights, a political and current events forum, and a forum for non-graffiti-related art. I agree that the current article is a little lacking, but <b>I propose that Wiki give us a week to flesh it out a bit more and clean up a bit.</b>(did anyone read this?)

<dd>It will be at least 5 days before an admin decides whether the article should be deleted. If you think a clean-up will help, go for it.

<li>"This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books,..." I will end it right here. Since 12ozprophet, actually started out as a graffiti magazine (a well sought out one, in fact one of the most infamous at it's time) I will exclude that one, and just tell you that it's been in SEVERAL graffiti magazines over the years, not limited to casual passes or ads, but full articles dedicated to the history, present, and future of 12ozprophet. Not only that, but has been in books, including but not limited to Also Known As. One of the best graffiti books to come out in recent years. So if being in several well known magazines, and books, not to mention PUBLISHING books, isn't notable then what is? Ask anyone within the community that we are in, and 12oz is not only the most well known site, but also the best run. Delete it if you want, me or someone I know will have a new one up the same day. -Grits <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.119.195.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.119.195.76_71fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.119.195.76">contribs</a>) 2006-09-28 20:01:40 (UTC)</small>

<li>I have to admit when I read the article, I laughed. It's funny, and in a way, it's accurate. We do discuss a lot of things on there- at times, I share anecodes about my life and am 100% aware of the fact that I am leaving myself open to all kinds of responses as a result of putting myself out there in the public eye. However, based on the guidelines of Wikipedia, it's not a good article. I interpret those guidelines to be something along the lines of neutrality and/or unbiased reporting, and it fails on both counts. I don't think it should be deleted, though. If anything, it should be allowed to remain, and edited by some of the moderators to include the history of the site (what was mentioned was cursory at best), what the policies of the forum are and how those policies came about, future plans for the site, its intended purpose, etc. I've been posting on the board for almost four years, and am still a little unclear on some of these points.

<li><b>KEEP</b>- not only does it have a coprihensive archive of graffiti related topics, it is one of the most current archives out on the net, as people can continually add new information and photos. It can be viewed as a magazine, that has grown online and which continues to grow with up to date pictures, events, shows, information, stories and products etc. It is in a sense, the equivalent of Wikipedia but for the graffiti community all around the world. I dont even see what the big deal is with keeping it. Its not like the site needs exposure on here to get membership and interest. It is well known among those who are into this kind of thing, and having it on here merely recognizes the soceital shift into online information and on going growth of online communities, that were once non existant. It is not on here to advertise anything, and it is a documentation of an online resource for those in the graffiti community. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by LUMOS (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LUMOS_ceb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/LUMOS">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— LUMOS (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LUMOS_ceb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/LUMOS">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If at all possible, could you provide some links to the articles, or provide information on the readership of some magazines? I say this because an article that talks entirely about graffiti and has one sentence on the website is not as important as an article devoted entirely to the website. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> We've provided more than enough to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. We've provided the names of magazines that have whole articles on either 12ozprophet, 4thw, or AKA. We're not going to provide links to the articles, because they are in PAPER form. Back before the internet, we used paper goods to distribute information. These are not ONLINE magazines. We've provided WAY more than we had to. And you're continuing this because you lost the argument and don't want to admit it. There sources are easily varifiable. Go out and buy one of any of those magazines, And that's just within the last 18 months. Being the first to feature the Os Gemeos twins, should be BEYOND enough notability. As if changing how people look at graff zines wasn't enough. Give this up man, we've provided more than enough info for you, the article is changed.

<dd>Chill a bit. Relax. Edit some typos, do a little zen article-gardening. It's all cool: This isn't a vote that gets tallied numerically at the end. The arguments people make are what matters. Given evidence of notability, everyone who says (including myself, above) to delete for non-notability get ignored for being wrong when the final decision comes down. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:36, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's an excerpt for you, Graffiti Brasil p.18. "McGee told 12 Oz Prophet magazine editor Alen Benedikt/Raven about the Brazilian scene, and in 1997 he and Sonik travelled to Sao Paulo to visit Os Gemeos. The resulting 1998 issue of 12 Oz Prophet introduced the Brazilian scene to graffiti writers throughout North America and Europe, which catapulted Sao Paulo to the top of many writers' destination wish lists." Issue 6 is listed in the book's bibliography. This excerpt gives us a reliable verified source that mentions 12 Oz. And the quote itself also affirms just how notable it is; it was read across North America and Europe, and had widespread influence in making Brazil a desirable destination. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 07:03, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
