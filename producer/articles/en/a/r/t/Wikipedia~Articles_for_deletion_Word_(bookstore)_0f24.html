<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word.html" title="Word">Word</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/o/Koorong.html" title="Koorong">Koorong</a> dominate their market in Australia, to the extent that other chains and stores have been forced to close or (in the case of at least one formerly independent chain) effectively become agents of Koorong or Word. In fact, because Koorong and Word get very significant discounts by buying in large quantities, smaller retailers can purchase stock more cheaply through retail at Koorong or Word than wholesale. Koorong and Word are much more than "the largest in a sector made up of small companies" - they dominate the sector. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacknstock_1d12.html" title="User:Jacknstock">Jacknstock</a> 05:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per ScottDavis and since when has wikipedia discriminated against "minority interest". It is not like it is a small chain within its field. In Australian terms it is notable. Since the nomination only referenced the size of the store without referencing the overall market niche and they expect notability to be correlated with the total in numerical terms they seem to have missed what notability is about. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 13:42, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How well known would be enough in a niche market such as Christian books.

<li>Response - Scott Davis was making the assertion that Christian was not minority interest in Australia. I think notability in this case needs to stand on its own merits. The article does not justify notability and I haven't heard of them - the latter point doesn't mean necessarily a lot, it does mean though that I support a delete vote without any evidence to the contrary other than assertions from other voters it is not notable.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 05:19, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

The article definitely needs improvement, including citing of references. I certainly don't want to see Wikipedia used as an advertising site by the Koorong/Word duopoly, which I find distasteful.

<li>Thank you for the useful ref that tells me it is a Pty Ltd company - ie not listed. Under WP:Corp one of the criteria to apply is whether the business has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. I don't see that applies. I can see no other criterion this stub meets - other criteria for inclusion of articles on businesses refer to stock market listings. A family owned business that has been in existence for 60 years and is not mentioned in non-trivial published works, other than "new store opening" - just does not seem to warrant an encyclopaedia article. This stub has been around for a couple of months and a previous AfD debate prompted no augmentation. Is there anything to be said more about this business, is there anything that justifies not deleting this? The business exists ,but not only is Wikipedia not a medium for advertising, it is also not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:Not">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 06:42, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You have made a very good case for deletion. Of course, it has been a non-profit until yesterday (and still reports itself as a non-profit on its web site), therefore could not be listed regardless of size or significance.

<dd>I addressed User:Paul foord's suggestion that the contents of <i><a href="../../../b/o/o/Category%7EBookstores_of_Australia_7bc5.html" title="Category:Bookstores of Australia">Category:Bookstores of Australia</a> should also be deleted</i> - I agree with him bar two notable retailers, they should be kept both for their size and their longevity, pus A&amp;R is a notable publisher. Not also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Angus_%26_Robertson" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Angus_%26_Robertson" rel="nofollow">What links here for A&amp;R</a> plus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Dymocks_Booksellers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Dymocks_Booksellers" rel="nofollow">what links here for Dymocks</a> compared with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Word_%28bookstore%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Word_%28bookstore%29" rel="nofollow">What links here for the Word retailer</a> and similarly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Koorong" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Koorong" rel="nofollow">what links here for Koorong</a>--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 01:06, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>'<i>Abstain</i>. I abstain. --Jewbo Wales, LOL 07:15, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I have expanded the article with some history and current locations based on references raised here. This article is currently the largest in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Category%7EBookstores_of_Australia_7bc5.html" title="Category:Bookstores of Australia">Category:Bookstores of Australia</a>. I would love to be able to provide a reference that Word is a significant retailer. I note that since both <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_%26_Robertson_45e1.html" title="Angus &amp; Robertson">Angus &amp; Robertson</a> and <a href="../../../d/y/m/Dymocks_Booksellers_69b5.html" title="Dymocks Booksellers">Dymocks</a> are both franchises, it's possible that Word and Koorong are the biggest book retailers in Australia, but I cannot find any statistics about book sellers. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 09:03, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This would be quite frankly classified as a small business. In 2004 according to the ABS site (very cursory search) there were <i>1,660,000 operators of the 1,269,000 non-agricultural small businesses in Australia.</i> Of these admittedly 72.6% were small businesses with only one operator. There are though an awful lot of business with less than 100 employees (which this is likely to be, or at any rate not much bigger) - that is the market for Howard's workplace reforms. I really do not see that these businesses are going be notable. Of course they occupy a niche - that is what businesses do. If you want to include such businesses, address the policy at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECorp_f6b3.html" title="WP:Corp">WP:Corp</a>. The recent additions do not make this business notable. Turnover by the way is probably commercial in confidence - I doubt if it is published for non-public companies.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 11:34, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If someone added useful statistics about book retailing in Australia, comparing Word with other book retailers in Australia, or some interesting controversy (e.g., how a fairly large retailer managed to remain a tax-free "non-profit" despite ruthlessly driving competitors out of business), this article could be worth keeping. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacknstock_1d12.html" title="User:Jacknstock">Jacknstock</a> 14:45, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, notable enough. 16 bookstores + publishing covers a very large area —<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPengo_70fc.html" title="User:Pengo">Pengo</a> 06:45, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - as per Scott Davis &amp; Pengo. There's no reason to delete this - Word Bookstore is definitely notable among the Christian community (as is Koorong) which should qualify. A cleanup would be nice though. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 06:24, 6 July 2006 (UTC))</li>
