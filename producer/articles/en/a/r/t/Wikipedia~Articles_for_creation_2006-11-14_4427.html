<p>The term <b>man strength</b> is an Australian term, being defined as 'the strength automatically attained by a caucasian male upon reaching a weight of at least 100kgs' This so called 'man strength' implies that the male no longer has to endure physical activity to improve his physical strength and to maintain a healthy figure and lifestyle. Man strength can be achieved in various forms, but is most commonly attained by the indulgence in alcoholic beverages. This aformentioned indulgence in alcoholic beverages often leads to a healthy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_gut" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_gut" rel="nofollow">beer gut</a>' which is the most common form of man strength.</p>

<p>The 'Perret Theory' states that man strength is in fact true, however it has been widely scrutinized by health officials and body builders, who often argue that man strength is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit" rel="nofollow">bullshit</a> as it has no scientific proof.</p>
<p>Many argue that the only benefit of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_gut" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_gut" rel="nofollow">beer gut</a>is that it makes the individual heavier, and therefore more momentum, which is useful in activities such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Football_League" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Football_League" rel="nofollow">contact sports</a> and bar fights.</p>

<p>A male that has acquired man strength in the form of a beer gut often wears revealing clothing in order to demonstrate his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manliness" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manliness" rel="nofollow">manliness</a> in order to gain 'man cred' amongst his male companions and as quoted by Perret, his 'soon to be ex girlfriends'. Many describe the man strength attire to be of poor taste, and is often the fashion of a previous generation. It is often described as being scrubby and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan" rel="nofollow">bogan</a> like in appearance. The 'True Blue Guide to Australian Slang' Describes the term 'bogan' as being '1. A lout or hooligan or 2. Someone unstylish'<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is often noted that when a male has attained 'man strength' status, his vocabulary tends to decrease in size, often resorting to one word sentences which contain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt" rel="nofollow">profanities</a>. These are often sentence fragments, which are understood by other males of man strength status but is often understood as being pointless and random <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit" rel="nofollow">jibberish</a> by people with a basic comprehension of the English language.</p>

<p>Oscar Abreu was born in 1978 in San Juan de La Maguana in the Dominican Republic. Abreu began to study art at the age of nine in 1987 with the renowned Dominican sculptor José Nicolás Jimenez, at the Fine Arts School in San Juan de La Maguana. In 1989, Abreu’s family moved to Madrid, Spain where he continued his studies at the Muños Art Studios in Alcala de Henares.</p>
<p>Abreu moved to Chicago in 1994 at the age of 16. While attending Wells High School, he simultaneously attended after-school art courses at the Marwen Foundation and at the Saturday program of the School of The Art Institute of Chicago. It was at this time that Abreu began to develop his highly distinctive style of painting; what he calls “psycho-expressionism.” His work includes abstract-figurative painting, sculpture, and illustration. At age 18, Oscar had his first solo show in 1996 at the Riverside Art Center. From 1997 to 1999, Abreu continued to exhibit in Chicago and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2004, Abreu was involved in various cultural and publishing projects in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. In early 2006, Abreu opened Abreu Art Center in Santo Domingo. The art center, dedicated to the exhibition, promotion, and investigation of the visual arts, showcases local talent.</p>
<p>Abreu currently resides in New York, a biography of Oscar Abreu, written by the renowned Dominican critic Abil Peralta Agüero, is scheduled to be released in the fall of this year. Abreu’s work explores human vulnerability and the events that mankind are naturally destined to live through. When expressing an emotion or ideas, he refers to his own personal experiences. His work is concerned with the psychological effects of traumatic events and how these effects create different personality traits within an individual. He is not afraid to explore the personal motivations, emotions, and psychology of his own behaviors. “When I suffer life’s blows and shocks, I am more prolific as an artist. I understand that it is a matter of my pure need to purge the demons within me, to release and to interpret my vulnerability and my capacity to rationalize life’s different circumstances. Through my work I liberate myself,” says Abreu.</p>

<p>S.Venkateswaran is a great musician, but he shuns publicity. He is a vocalist in Carnatic music, which is the classical music of South India. He can adapt any song in any language to the style of Carnatic music. He has declined many awards. That is why you dont see his name anywhere.</p>

<p>Canada's longest running nightclub. Officially closed February 1, 2003 after 27 years. As iconic as the host city itself, Luvafair was the spot for alternative music in Vancouver. The most popular nights being Brit pop Thursdays and the always busy alternative Friday's and Saturday's. Such notable bands as Nine Inch nails and Skinny Puppy played in their early days. The City of Vancouver rezoned Richard's street to make way for more high rise condominiums in place of the once dense night club strip.</p>

<p>Gordon Hill Grahame born 1889 is best remembered for his capacity as a novelist. He was cousin to Kenneth Grahame, author of 'The Wind and the Willows'.</p>
<p>After beginning his childhood in Toronto, Grahame moved with his parents and sisters to Brooklyn, New York. In 1901 Grahame return to Canada to attend Trinity College School in Port Hope. Grahame spent three months, in 1904, in St. Louis as a result of President Theodore Roosevelt appointing his father, Laurance Grahame, Secretary - Treasurer to the National Commission of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held at the St. Louis World's Fair. Shortly after, Grahame's father was appointed Commissioner of the Interior in Puerto Rico, prompting them to relocate to San Juan for four years. There, Gordon landed a job as a civil engineer, a profession that would take him to the Domican Republic where he became a mercenary in the 1910 civil war. Later that year Gordon returned to Canada, joining his parents in Lakefield, Ontario.</p>
<p>In the several years that followed, Gordon became interested in physical fitness and accomplished feats such as completing a 160 mile walk from Lakefied to Brantford, Ontario in four days, circumventing Lake Ontario on foot, paddling a sixteen foot canoe from Cobourg, Ontario to Charlotte, New York, during which he claims to have crossed Lake Ontario at its widest point in twenty-four hours. He also records in his autobiography, that in 1912 he hiked from Lakefield to New York City in seventeen days surviving soley on fruits and vegetables he purchased along the way. In the years prior World War I, Gordon was a junior master at the Lakefield Preparatory School.</p>
<p>Gordon Grahame was sent off to war in 1914. On the battefields of France, he suffered a head trauma during combat.</p>
<p>In the years that followed the war Grahame worked mainly in advertising and became a writer. His more noted works include 'Larry' and 'The Bond Triumphant'. Grahame also authored his autobiograhpy entitled 'Short Days Ago'. He died in the early 1970's.</p>

<p>Brindisi Rosso is a DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata) wine from the Southern Italian province of Brindisi, in the region of Puglia (Apulia).</p>
<p>The official appellation was granted on 11/22/1979 with presidential decree (published in Gazzetta Ufficiale, April 23, 1980), under request from Pasquale Medico and Sons and other producers.</p>
<p><br />
In recent years the production of this variety of wine has declined considerably (up to 50%), due to the uprooting of vines as a result incentives from the EU, which favored other products.</p>
<p>The Brindisi region has a very old tradition for wine making, due to the fact that Brindisi was the Roman gateway to the East and thus provided its own wine to Rome along with salt and olive oil imported from the Mediterranean provinces.</p>

<p>Brindisi Rosso is produced in small quantities and exported all over the world.</p>
<p>Brindisi Rosso is made mainly from dark Negroamaro grapes (at least 70%) and Malvasia nera di Brindisi; it can also contain smaller quantities of Sussumaniello, Montepulciano and Sangiovese.</p>

<p>Brindisi Rosso wine appears intense ruby red, with light orange tones when aged; the taste is intense, dry, harmonious, with a lightly bitter aftertaste, velvety e justly tannic.</p>
<p>Minimum alcohol percentage by volume to qualify for the appellation is 12%. The best vintages, however, contain between 13 and 14% ABV. The best recent vintages are 2000 and 2003. The "Riserva" title for Brindisi Rosso can only be granted after three years of aging.</p>

THIS ARTICLE IS A STUB</p>
<p>The majority of the world's population lives in a house made of earth. The same can be said for the floors of those homes. Earthen floors are the original floors and over time many people discovered methods of sealing or treating the floor to reduce dusting and make it last much longer. Traditional methods of sealing the floor included treating it with fresh blood. As blood from an animal is left to sit for only a short time it will coagulate or clot. Earthen floors are, common in more modern times, treated with raw linseed oil cut with a citrus thinner or with olive oil soap as a sealer.</p>
<p>Earthen floors are often laid over the top of a subfloor of class 1 or class 5 tamped gravel and then a mixture of clay, sand and fiber are mixed and leveled onto the tamped subfloor. These layers can be 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch thick. The thinner layers will dry faster but require a better subfloor for strength or more layers. Earthen floors can be laid over the top of previously installed wood floors but, as always, weight can become an issue. Can your floor joists support an inch thick floor? If an earthen floor is laid on top of woodend joists it is usually the thinner 1/4 inch thick floor that is installed. After drying the sealing coats are applied. Very often with linseed oil multiple coats are applied with long drying times in between. While it is a cheap method of flooring your building it does take time.</p>
<p>Many people with modern earthen floors report that it feels like leather to walk upon.</p>

<p>In one form or another Wellingborough Rugby Football has been around for well over 100 years. According to the 1879 football year book there was a rugby team formed in Wellingborough that year. The team played in black and white and played at Midland Road, Wellingborough. However, the club seems to have been properly formed in 1899 when they began playing local teams on their pitch at Union Lane.</p>
<p>After the First World War the club lay dormant for a number of years. It was reformed on December the 7th 1922 after a meeting in the Hind Hotel. The club must have become quite successful as the committee minutes recorded that a proposed admission to the ground (of 4d.) was carried.</p>
<p>The club was again reformed after the Second World War. However, its future was in doubt for a long time. During August 1948 it was decided that the club should continue despite the lack of any rugby games at all. Thankfully the club did manage to get back on its feet and grew steadily during the fifties and sixties. Despite playing in a number of different locations around Wellingborough, the club finally managed to settle at its present home on Cut Throat Lane. The club continues to expand.</p>

<p>Kegunk</p>
<p>An onomatopoeic derivation and flexible verb meaning to hit so as to produce a ‘gunk’ sound eg the sound one may hear from an umbrella reverberating from a pole. Kegunk does not take cognizance of the fact that gunk is defined by Dictionary.com as any sticky or greasy residue or accumulation. It’s use in this context has entirely onomatopoeic origins. Kegunk can however be used outside of its strict definition in a variety of means. It is a product of popular culture and is believed to have derived from the ghetto of Churchtownia circa 2006. The verb can also be used to describe cases of one-upsmanship or where one opponent defeats another. It has also crept into the art of debating and a winning point will often be greeted by a cry of ‘Kegunk!’. Some commentators believe that Kegunk can be equalised by a cry of ‘Didoink’ however it is generally accepted that the former is nothing but a cheap and ill-fated version of Kegunk that will never find a place in the modern English lexicon. While the verb’s origins denote a violent act it is it’s flexibility that has endeared itself to English speakers. The verb can also be used to describe a particularly heavy night of drinking leading the sufferer to say ‘I was pretty Kegunked last night’ or indeed ‘I had such a large amount to drink last night I’m feeling Kegunked right now’. Thus for all your English speaking needs, Kegunk’s the verb for you. Whether you’ve an umbrella in your hand and you want to hit something, you’ve just scored your friends girlfriend or you have a nasty hangover, Kegunk your troubles away.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Dellas, UBS Financial Advisor, has achieved quite a lot as a young businessman. To date, his CV includes a meeting with the President by age 8 and a CFO title by age 25. Regarding the latter, he directed the finances of One Stop Steel Corporation in Saint Louis, MO, streamlining the buying and selling of corporate assets, and resulting in six figure increases to the company's bottom line during his tenure.</p>
<p>Since then, Jeremiah has built a successful practice as a financial advisor, first with NMFN and more recently with UBS Financial Services in Town &amp; Country, MO. His clients range from professional athletes and well-known musicians to small business owners and local banks. He often consults on executive benefits and deferred compensation arrangements. Mr. Dellas was featured this year in the April 24th 2006 issue of TIME Magazine where he was recognized in an ad as a standout among his peers at NNFN.</p>
<p>After successful collegiate volleyball career punctuated by MIVA-NAIA Academic All-Conference status and National Final Four appearance in 2000, he now pursues his volleyball interests in the sand. During the summer months, Jeremiah plays beach volleyball on the EVP Tour. May through September he travels and competes on the beach. He has coached a NJCAA collegiate volleyball program as well as a local CYC eighth-grade volleyball team.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jeremiah participates as a Director on the boards of The Michael Jones Foundation and The Epilepsy Foundation of the St. Louis Region, as well as being one of the youngest members of the Missouri Venture Forum. He is actively involved in these organizations and helps raise money and awareness for their causes.</p>
<p>As a child Jeremiah self-diagnosed his own epilepsy disorder after a presentation was made at his elementary school. Because of this, and as recognition for his spokesmanship for the United Way &amp; the Epilepsy Foundation of America, in 1983 Jeremiah had the opportunity to personally represent the EFA at the White House and visit with President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office. His meeting with President Reagan is documented in the Ronald Reagan National Library. Subsequently, he was interviewed on television and radio to comment on President Reagan's passing in 2004. That same year Jeremiah was honored by the Epilepsy Foundation with the prestigious Ben Froelichstein Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p>
<p>January 12, 2007, Jeremiah Dellas was selected to The St. Louis Business Journal's '40 Under 40' Class of 2007. This recognition is reserved for those individuals who are standouts both in their professional lives as well as in their community and are under the age of forty. More than 400 people were nominated this year. At 30, Jeremiah was one of the youngest to be selected for the '07 Class.</p>
<p>Jeremiah holds a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry from Lindenwood University, in St. Charles, MO and is pursuing an MBA and a CFP designation, as well. He currently resides in Chesterfield, MO. His future goals include political office or ambassadorship, starting a bank, writing a movie, and recording a CD.</p>

<p>The Joe Stoble Hockey League was founded in 1992 by Tony Stoble and Neil Leston, both of whom went on to play hockey together in high school, then went to their respective colleges to play D1 roller hockey. The JSHL was founded by 5 members of Middletown N.J. These members were Tony Stoble, Neil Leston, Adam Geverater, Matt Dunzello, and the John Caggiano.</p>
<p>The JSHL was played on a rink no bigger then 100X25, and usually consisted of teams that played 2 on 2. If a team decided to play with a goalie, which they rarely did, then it would be one skater and one goalie. The Main location of the two rinks were 4 Penelope Lane in Middletown, and also 26 Marlpit in Middletown. The JSHL truly set the foundation for Hockey In Middletown, and if it was not for the JSHL, Middletown South Ice Hockey may not be as thriving as it is now.</p>

<p>Bill Shankly rarely made mistakes. Yet when a fair-haired, 15-year-old schoolboy arrived at Anfield for a trial, he let a player who later was to turn Liverpool into a double-winning team slip through his fingers.</p>
<p>It was August, 1966. England had just won the World Cup and Shankly was cementing the dynasty that was to make Liverpool one of the most successful sides in British football history.</p>
<p>The youngster played one game, for the B team against Southport Reserves in the Lancashire League. Liverpool won 1-0, but the kid went home and heard nothing.</p>
<p>A few years later when Shankly saw the lad play he was furious, blaming others at the club for the astonishing miss. It was to be 11 years after that trial that the player joined Liverpool, but by then he was an established international and he cost Shankly's successor, Bob Paisley, a British record of £440,000.</p>
<p>The boy was Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish.</p>
<p>Dalglish grew up supporting Glasgow Rangers. Though born in Dalmarnock in the East End of Glasgow on March 4, 1951, he was brought up in the docklands of Govan, just a stone's thow from Ibrox.</p>
<p>He first made his mark at Milton Bank primary school - in goal! But by the time he was capped as an under-15 Scottish Schoolboy he had switched to right-half, scoring twice on his debut in a 4-3 victory over Northern Ireland Schoolboys.</p>
<p>His next schoolboy international appearance was in a 1-1 draw against England. The People newspaper covered the game, singling him out for praise as "a brilliant ball-player."</p>
<p>There was never any doubt that he was going to be a professional footballer. The question was for whom?</p>
<p>He wanted to join his idols at Rangers, but the call never came. He had another trial at West Ham, but that came to nothing, too. And so it was that Dalglish, the Protestant son of an engineer, found himself playing for the Catholic Glasgow Celtic.</p>
<p>His signing, on a provisional contract in July 1967, was not without amusement. Jock Stein, the legendary Celtic manager, had sent his assistant Sean Fallon to see Dalglish and his parents at their home.</p>
<p>Fallon drove there and left his wife Myra and their three children outside in the car while he went in, saying he wouldn't be long. It was three hours before Fallon emerged with Dalglish's signature and his wife was less than pleased. It wasn't just that the kids were hungry and restless after being couped up. It was the couple's wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>Dalglish was farmed out to a Celtic nursery side, Cumbernauld United, and he also worked as an apprentice joiner. By the following year he had turned professional and was a regular member of a Celtic reserve team so good it was known as the Quality Street Gang.</p>
<p>It took Dalglish three years to establish himself in the first team. At that time Celtic were not only top dogs in Glasgow, they had become the first British team to win the European Cup, beating the mighty Inter Milan.</p>
<p>Stein took a great interest in the lad, recognising his potentially outstanding talent. Eventually he gave him his chance in a benefit match. The result was Celtic 7 Kilmarnock 2. Nothing unusual about that in Scottish football - except that Dalglish scored six!</p>
<p>But 1971 was also the year that Dalglish witnessed the first of three tragedies which, ultimately, were to leave such a mark that he quit the game. It was the "Old Firm" match at Ibrox. Dalglish was not playing but was at the ground with the Celtic team.</p>
<p>Stairway 13 at the old stadium collapsed and 66 fans were killed.</p>
<p>By 1972-73 Dalglish, now playing up front, was Celtic's leading marksman with a seasonal tally of 41 goals in all competitions. And that Dalglish trademark of shielding the ball with his back to the goal had emerged.</p>
<p>Such was Dalglish's skill at holding on to the ball that, years later, the former Arsenal and Republic of Ireland defender David O'Leary would describe trying to rob him of possession as "impossible."</p>
<p>"He crouches over the ball, legs spread and elbows poking out," said O'Leary. "Whatever angle you come in from, you're liable to find his backside in your face."</p>
<p>Dalglish was made Celtic captain in 1975-76, but it was a miserable year. Stein was badly hurt in a car crash and missed most of the season. Celtic failed to win a trophy for the first time in 12 years.</p>
<p>The next season Stein was back and Celtic did the Cup and League double. Dalglish, however, had made up his mind to leave. Celtic had won the European Cup before he had arrived at the club and Dalglish wanted the chance not just to savour European football, but to be where there was a real chance of success.</p>
<p>"I had to know if I could make it somewhere else," he explained. "I did not want to go through the rest of my life wondering what might have been without putting myself to the test."</p>
<p>He had been a full Scotland international for six years, making his debut as a substitute in the 1-0 victory over Belgium in November 1971. He went to the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, but did not play well. Scotland were eliminated at the group stage, even though they were undefeated.</p>
<p>That spring of 1977 he had scored in Scotland's 2-1 victory over England at Wembley when the Tartan fans invaded the pitch and tore down the goalposts.</p>
<p>Dalglish had enjoyed an enviable run at Celtic. Five Scottish Championships, four Scottish Cup-winners' medals, one Scottish League Cup-winners' medal and a tally of 167 goals. But it wasn't enough for him. He was ambitious and needed a new challenge.</p>
<p>Liverpool had just won the European Cup, beating Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-1 in Rome. But their biggest star, Kevin Keegan, was leaving to play for Hamburg.</p>
<p>Dalglish was chosen to replace him, Bob Paisley making good that Anfield mistake of losing him as a boy. But the Kop wasn't so sure. To them, Keegan was a God. What's more, Dalglish was handed the No.7 shirt - Keegan's strip.</p>
<p>Dalglish immediately silenced the doubters, scoring after just seven minutes on his league debut away at Middlesbrough. For good measure, he also scored on his Anfield debut against Newcastle.</p>
<p>And when Liverpool met Hamburg in the European Super Cup, Dalglish totally exorcised the ghost of his predecessor, running the game as Keegan and his new team-mates were tormented with a 6-0 defeat.</p>
<p>That first season was a triumph for Dalglish. He scored 30 goals, including the only goal of the game as Liverpool retained the European Cup against Bruges at Wembley.</p>
<p>Dalglish had left Scotland looking for European glory and had found it inside one year.</p>
<p>Was Dalglish better than Keegan? Former Liverpool veteran Tommy Smith, who played with them both, has no doubts. "Dalglish WAS the better player," he said. "His talent was heaven-sent."</p>
<p>And Paisley said simply: "Of all the players I have played alongside, managed and coached in more than 40 years at Anfield, he is the most talented."</p>
<p>What Dalglish understood better than most was space. He could hold the ball, sometimes so long that it seemed the moment had gone, then he would see that something was on and deliver the inch-perfect pass.</p>
<p>Later, as his role developed from goalscorer to goalmaker, he was to form an almost telepathic understanding with Ian Rush. The Welshman, who holds both the FA Cup and League Cup scoring records, said of his team-mate: "I just made the runs knowing the ball would come to me."</p>
<p>But the paradox of Dalglish is that while he was without peer in midfield in the domestic game, he never quite produced the same level of performance on the international stage.</p>
<p>He was the hottest property in British football in 1978 when he went to the World Cup in Argentina. It was a nightmare for Scotland. They lost their opening match 3-1 to Peru and Willie Johnston was sent home after failing a drugs test.</p>
<p>It got worse. Scotland drew 1-1 with no-hopers Iran. Then, when all was lost, Scotland astonished everyone by beating the "total football" aristocrats of Holland 3-2, Dalglish getting his name on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>In the wake of World Cup failure, Scotland manager Ally McLeod was sacked and replaced by the legendary Stein - Dalglish's old mentor. Stein made Dalglish captain, but it was not a happy time.</p>
<p>Dalglish's reign lasted just four games, losing three, before he was replaced as captain by Archie Gemmill.</p>
<p>The 1982 World Cup in Spain was no better. Dalglish scored in the 5-2 defeat of New Zealand but, by his own admission, played badly. He came on as a substitute against Brazil, but only when Scotland were 3-1 down, and was left out for the 2-2 draw with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>No-one, least of all Dalglish, has sufficiently explained why he failed to make more of an impact in international football. That he had the talent is beyond question, but his failure meant that he was never rated as highly abroad as he was in Britain.</p>
<p>Liverpool, however, saw the best of him. After that World Cup shambles of 1978, he was inspirational as the Reds regained their League title with a record number of points - 68, under the old two-for-a-win system. They were undefeated at home and at the end of a 42-match programme had conceded just 16 goals.</p>
<p>Dalglish scored 25 goals that season and was voted Footballer of the Year.</p>
<p>These were the glory days at Anfield. Liverpool retained the Championship in 1979-80, won the League Cup four years in a row between 1980-81 and 1983-84 and then topped everything by winning a hat-trick of Championships in 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1983-84. They also won two more European Cups. Only the coveted League and FA Cup double eluded them.</p>
<p>Dalglish was at the heart of it all and became Footballer of the Year for the second time in 1983.</p>
<p>The 1983-84 season was the most astonishing - the Championship, the League Cup and the European Cup. Yet within 12 months, tragedy would turn Liverpool's world upside down.</p>
<p>Paisley had retired and his boot-room assistant Joe Fagan had taken over as manager. Dalglish's international career was drawing to a close. He had been named in Scotland manager Alex Ferguson's squad for the 1984 World Cup in Mexico, but had withdrawn through injury.</p>
<p>He was to make his final appearance in the blue jersey in a 3-0 win over Luxembourg in November 1986, claiming a record 102 caps and sharing the Scotland goalscoring record of 30 with Denis Law.</p>
<p>But in 1985 he still had the European Cup in which to parade his skills. And despite his shortcomings at international level, he had no such problems in Europe, scoring 19 goals in UEFA club competitions, a British record.</p>
<p>Liverpool again reached the final where they faced Juventus at the Heysel stadium in Brussels. On the eve of the match, Dalglish was told by club chairman John Smith that he was to be Liverpool's next manager. Fagan was retiring and Dalglish was to take over the day after the European final.</p>
<p>During the next 24 hours, the club was to be convulsed by turmoil. There was crowd trouble at the match, a wall collapsed under the strain of rioting fans and 39 Juventus supporters died.</p>
<p>Liverpool lost 1-0, but what did that matter? Their fans were held responsible for the deaths, the distaste of the football world was turned against Anfield and English clubs were banned from Europe. Welcome to management, Mr Dalglish.</p>
<p>Such were the appalling circumstances under which he began a new phase of his career as player-manager. Nonetheless, Liverpool retained the Championship in 1985-86. And though he restricted his playing appearances, who was there chesting the ball down to score the goal that won the title at Chelsea? None other than Dalglish.</p>
<p>What's more, Liverpool won the FA Cup, beating Merseyside rivals Everton 3-1. That elusive double, which had been beyond Shankly, Paisley and Fagan, was Dalglish's in his first year in the job. No wonder he was Manager of the Year.</p>
<p>But just as others have found before him, winning is one thing, repeating it is another. The following season was a flop by Anfield's standards. True, they finished second in the league, but they won no trophies. It was made worse by the fact that Everton won the title and Rush was leaving to join Juventus.</p>
<p>Dalglish had to rebuild and he did it by buying two players. John Barnes from Watford and Peter Beardsley from Newcastle. Everything clicked into place for that 1987-88 season. Liverpool equalled Leeds United's record of 29 games without defeat (eventually coming unstuck at Everton!) and won back the title. They also made the FA Cup Final, only to lose 1-0 to Wimbledon.</p>
<p>But once again, misfortune was lying in wait - and this time it was to be cataclysmic.</p>
<p>Ninety-six people died in the Hillsborough tragedy on the day Liverpool met Nottingham Forest in the 1989 FA Cup semi-final. It was the worst sporting disaster in British history and was to lead to the introduction of all-seater grounds.</p>
<p>Merseyside was numb with grief and the chain of events was eventually to drive Dalglish from the game, drained by the unremitting pressure.</p>
<p>But in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, Dalglish was a giant. He told his players: "What is called for is dignity. We need to set an example." It was Dalglish who provided leadership, not just to the club but to the whole of Liverpool.</p>
<p>It was Dalglish who organised hospital visits to the injured, attended funerals, read lessons in church, visited the bereaved, helped with counselling for the grief-stricken. He worked tirelessly, giving every ounce of himself. He would take calls from families of the victims in the middle of the night when they could not sleep and patiently talked to them for hours.</p>
<p>He stood, like an unwavering colossus, a comforter for a city's pain. Which is why, despite subsequent events, they have never forgotten him.</p>
<p>And then there were the flowers, laid like a never-ending blanket covering the goalmouth in front of the Kop. "The saddest and most beautiful sight I have ever seen," said Dalglish.</p>
<p>After a period of mourning Liverpool returned to football, winning the replayed semi-final. They met Everton at Wembley, forcing a 3-2 victory in extra time. Naturally, it was dedicated to the fans who had perished at Hillsborough.</p>
<p>They were also in the running for the double, but this time there was to be no fairytale. Meeting Arsenal at Anfield in the final match of the season - Liverpool's third game in six days - they could afford to lose by one goal and still be Champions.</p>
<p>They lost 2-0, Arsenal's Michael Thomas scoring the crucial goal in injury time. Dalglish was stunned.</p>
<p>The following season they regained the title and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup where Liverpool suffered one of their most amazing defeats. They were leading twice, yet contrived to lose 4-3 to Crystal Palace - a team they had beaten 9-0 earlier in the year.</p>
<p>By now Dalglish had hung up his boots, and the season of 1990-91 saw him at the centre of a controversy over his habit of selecting Beardsley as a substitute.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, February 20, 1991, Liverpool met Everton in a replayed FA Cup Fifth Round tie. It was an extraordinary match, ending 4-4. The following morning, Dalglish had a routine meeting with the club chairman and chief executive. Twenty minutes into the conversation he told them, without warning, that he was quitting.</p>
<p>The news was broken to a stunned football world the next day. Dalglish was walking out on a club that were top of the league, chasing a cup and league double and in the middle of unfinished business with rivals Everton.</p>
<p>Dalglish described himself as "a person pushed to the limit." He said: "I was putting myself under enormous pressure to be successful." His health was suffering and he told Liverpool chairman Noel White that on match days he felt "as if my head was exploding".</p>
<p>But if his resignation was a shock, his decision to join Blackburn Rovers as manager just eight months later was a sensation. Dalglish won them promotion from the old Second Division in his first year. Within three years they were Premier League Champions.</p>
<p>Of all places to clinch the trophy, Blackburn did it at Liverpool! Though they lost at Anfield in their last match of the season, nearest rivals Manchester United could only draw at West Ham and Rovers were celebrating.</p>
<p>The Dalglish magic was still working. It had cost former steel magnate Jack Walker, the Blackburn president, £30 million in transfer fees, breaking the British record twice for Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton. But Rovers had won their first senior title in 81 years and Dalglish had become only the third manager to lift the Championship with two different clubs.</p>
<p>And then he did it again. Just as Blackburn reached the pinnacle, he sought a way out of the day-to-day pressures, asking to be made director of football and handing the team manager's job to Ray Harford.</p>
<p>After success the fall. Blackburn struggled and both Dalglish and Harford left the club.</p>
<p>Then in spring of 1997, Kevin Keegan quit as manager of Newcastle United. His successor was Dalglish, just as he had replaced Keegan as a player at Liverpool.</p>
<p>What drove this man, who had quit twice at the top through pressure, to tread once again into the lion's den? Perhaps he wanted to be the first manager to win the Championship at three different clubs.</p>
<p>However, despite taking the Magpies into the Champions League that season as well as leading them out at Wembley for the 1998 FA Cup Final, he was sacked by the Newcastle board just two games into the 1998/99 season.</p>
<p>Despite the setback, he would soon return to football, this time back in his native Scotland, with his first club Celtic. Appointed Director of Football, he brought in former teammate John Barnes as manager. But when results would simply not go their way, Barnes was axed and once again Dalglish took up the managerial role. Unfortunately there would be no happy ending as he too would be sacked by the board. Unhappy with the way he was treated, he pursued legal action against Celtic and was eventually awarded compensation.</p>
<p>There is, nevertheless, something incredibly single-minded about Dalglish. He takes the business of football much more seriously than most, and is such a perfectionist that pursuit of success is an obsession.</p>
<p>He has 14 Championships to his name as a player and manager in England and Scotland. That combined total makes his achievements virtually unrivaled in British football. Yet somehow it doesn't seem enough.</p>
<p>One simple story probably captures the essence of what makes him tick. It is told by Stephen F. Kelly in his book, Dalglish.</p>
<p>Kelly writes of how, some years ago, a Scottish football reporter, Ian Archer, was strolling through Glasgow when Dalglish came up to him.</p>
<p>Dalglish offered a one-word greeting: "Wisnae!" "Wisnae whit?" asked the baffled journalist. "Wisnae offside," replied Dalglish and walked off.</p>
<p>Archer was stumped. Then he remembered that four weeks previously he had suggested in a match report that a Dalglish goal for Celtic might have been offside.</p>
<p>"It was," said the journalist, "the most piercing, informative and lengthy interview Dalglish ever gave to me."</p>
<p>It also speaks volumes about the self-conviction of Kenny Dalglish.</p>

<p>PeaceKeeper Cause-Metics is a cosmetics company with a line of products for which all profits, after taxes, are used to support women's health advocacy and human rights issues, while educating the mass consumer about many issues within the Human Rights feild. The Company, Wisdom Says, was registered by CEO Jody Weiss as a S-Corporation in the State of California in May of 1999. Wisdom Says registered the name "PeaceKeeper" as a trademark in February of 2001 stating that "the very act of buying a product for which ALL profits support women's health advocacy &amp; urgent human rights issues would transform the buyer into a PeaceKeeper herself". The company is currently holding a Kiss Campaign to raise money for women and girls who have left indentured servitude and sex trafficking. Weiss says "The ethos behind the company is to invite women to be proactive, to use their discretionary income to make spending decisions that contribute directly to promoting gender equality and ending violence".</p>

<p>Medal of Honor Citation: Rank and organization: Sergeant, U.S. Army, Company E, 359th Infantry, 90th Infantry Division. Place and date: Near Chambois, France, 20 August 1944. Entered service at: Bremerton, Wash. Birth: San Francisco, Calif. G.O. No.: 55, 13 July 1945. Citation: He manned a light machinegun on 20 August 1944, near Chambois, France, a key point in the encirclement which created the Falaise Pocket. During an enemy counterattack, his position was menaced by a strong force of tanks and infantry. His fire forced the infantry to withdraw, but an artillery shell knocked out his gun and wounded him in the right thigh. Securing a bazooka, he and another man stalked the tanks and forced them to retire to a wooded section. In the lull which followed, Sgt. Hawk reorganized 2 machinegun squads and, in the face of intense enemy fire, directed the assembly of 1 workable weapon from 2 damaged guns. When another enemy assault developed, he was forced to pull back from the pressure of spearheading armor. Two of our tank destroyers were brought up. Their shots were ineffective because of the terrain until Sgt. Hawk, despite his wound, boldly climbed to an exposed position on a knoll where, unmoved by fusillades from the enemy, he became a human aiming stake for the destroyers. Realizing that his shouted fire directions could not be heard above the noise of battle, he ran back to the destroyers through a concentration of bullets and shrapnel to correct the range. He returned to his exposed position, repeating this performance until 2 of the tanks were knocked out and a third driven off. Still at great risk, he continued to direct the destroyers' fire into the Germans' wooded position until the enemy came out and surrendered. Sgt. Hawk's fearless initiative and heroic conduct, even while suffering from a painful wound, was in large measure responsible for crushing 2 desperate attempts of the enemy to escape from the Falaise Picket and for taking more than 500 prisoners.</p>

<p>Max Vadukul (Born 2nd February 1961, Nairobi, Kenya) is a self- taught British photographer. Infamous for his surreal, quirky style, Vadukul’s photography captures images with a raw elegance in the realm of fashion, music, advertising and portraiture.</p>
<p>As a child, Vadukul experienced unique expeditions across Africa capturing wild safari on camera with his father, a keen amateur photographer, which fuelled his fascination for photography.</p>
<p>In 1969 Vadukul was uprooted from his native soil and moved to London, England. Feeling dislocated and in the midst of a culture shock Vadukul embraced the camera and found a haven and sense of familiarity in photography. Driven by a passion to succeed, Vadukul, at age 22, left home and advanced to the fashion capital of the world- Paris. It was here that he was discovered by Yohji Yamamoto in 1984 and began a collaboration that would change the face of fashion. As an artist using photography, Vadukul set out to reform the rigid structure of fashion publications deeming fashion as an area of innovation in photography. He Produced satirical and wacky imagery influenced largely by cartoons, silent movies and British media, and had a flair for stimulating an emotion in his subject which possessed a distinctive Vadukul signature.</p>
<p>Revolutionary fashion journalists such as Franca Sozzani of Italian Vogue embraced this ‘Anti-Fashion’ style and commissioned Vadukul’s editorial voice by shooting for benchmark magazines such as Per Lui and Lei. His provocative and avant-garde work led to partnerships with Chloe, Emanuel Ungaro, Armani, Comme Des Garcons, Max Mara and Romeo Gigli. Moreover, he was an active contributor to the emerging supermodel phenomenon and his dynamic work caught the eye of musical legends such as Paul McCartney and Sting whose first iconic solo album ‘The Dream of the Blue Turtles’ was shot in 1985 by Vadukul.</p>
<p>In 1995, a decision to move to New York City took Max’s career to pioneering heights, shooting for magazines such as Rolling Stone, Harpers Bazaar, Vogue, Italian Vogue, Vanity Fair, and L’Uomo Vogue. The prestigious New Yorker Magazine offered Vadukul a three- year contract- it was only the second contract given to a photographer after Richard Avedon in the magazines 100-year history. This marked a transitional point for the photographer, transcending barriers from fashion to feature and journalistic photography. Vadukul captured the essence of extraordinary figures that shaped history such as Mother Teresa, Salman Rushdie, Yves Saint Laurent, Mick Jagger and Mayor Giuliani.</p>
<p>Vadukul’s images radiate his exuberance and he continues to work with a dedicated and ardent vigor. He currently resides in New York City with his wife and two children where he remains at the forefront of fashion and has shaken up the music world with his stunning images of Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Keith Urban, and Janet Jackson. Photography is clearly an unquestionable passion but what makes Max Vadukul truly three- dimensional is his fervor towards current social, environmental and cultural issues. The outlet of creativity is directed towards numerous causes and talents such as drumming and producing a new photography publication and fine art. As an advocate towards green peace and anti-drugs campaigns his energy is focused upon helping to improve the current conditions of society.</p>

<p>first off, after doing such an amzing job for youself, one feels good. they have completed something for themselves; earned a bragging right one might say. Feeling good is a sense that you are indeed healhy and do not have some termial disease. That's one sense, the other is what's going on inside your body emotionally. Do not question yourself, doubt leads to sadness.</p>

<p>Probably one of the most mysterious living painters. Demian Kniewald's paintings are sold exclusively among carefully chosen circles of people around Europe. It is not known that any exhibition of his work has ever existed and nobody seems to know who this personality really is, where is he working or living, what origin or nationality is he of. His work can be found in private collections all over Europe, but mostly in Spain, Italy, Switzerland and England. It is almost certain that he studied photography at the world renown film academy FAMU in Prague, Czech Republic as well as painting at Academy of Fine Arts in Milan, Italy (Accademia di belle arti <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brera.html" title="Brera">Brera</a>, Milano) and Academy of Fine Arts in Venice, Italy (Accademia di belle arti di Venezia), but all under different names.</p>
<p>Some time in the late eighties, his name was mentioned in Triest, Italy, as a member of notorious esoteric order <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordo_Templi_Orientis_01b0.html" title="Ordo Templi Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> O.T.O., founded by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>. Afterwards, his name is traced only occasionaly while his unusual work, connected to <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esoteric.html" title="Esoteric">esoteric</a> themes, <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">kabbalah</a> and even <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priory_of_Sion_9df8.html" title="Priory of Sion">Priory of Sion</a>, started to appear in certain European countries.</p>
<p>We were told that each of his paintings includes secret messages in form of hidden symbols and signs, whose meaning is known to his customers only, appearing to be free masons in general. That is the main reason why are these paintings so highly wanted nowadays.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, his technique and skills are brought to perfection by the use of brush technique, almost frightening for the 21st century painting.</p>
<p>There is story going on of a young promissing artist's painting titled Heroide Funebre appearing in private collection in Madrid, Spain. Supposedly, painting was shown to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dali_16fc.html" title="Salvador Dali">Salvador Dali</a> in 1987 who commented it:&#160;»This is not art, this is painters' genocide!«. The painting was never exposed in public. People who had a chance to see it, described it as a gloomy picture with corpses at the front and misty valley spreading through the background, from which you can almost hear symphonic poem named Heroide Funebre composed by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Franz Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, after which the painting received it's name. It is told that the author of the painting, while working on it, played that music constantly until it's tones were captured among the different layers of paint from where it is still audiable… We cannot say with certainty if it was all true, but the description is mysterious enough to awoke our fantasies… The young author was Demian Kniewald himself, of course.</p>
<p>Some of Kniewald's work can be found on the website www.demiankniewald.com, but do not expect to find any personal information about himself or his art. Beside an extract of his work, look carefully at the darkened photographs in the background, where you can partly see his face, still not enough to identify him. Like if he wants us to believe that he is present, but not reachable…</p>
<p>If you are not an owner of some of his rare artwork, this is the closest chance to see any of his mystical opus.</p>

<b>ENIGMA DA VINCI:</b></p>
<p>Demian Kniewald surprisingly opens to the public with the incredible new painting collection named&#160;»<a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma.html" title="Enigma">Enigma</a> <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Vinci_0eec.html" title="Da Vinci">da Vinci</a>«.</p>
<p>It is a succession of twenty one coordinate paintings revealing the secrets of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priory_of_Sion_9df8.html" title="Priory of Sion">Priory of Sion</a> through the centuries and it's grandmasters. The masterpieces of famous painters, members of the free masons' order mentioned above, are blended and merged in a complex project, kind of a visualisation of what we have partly learned from <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Brown_5a02.html" title="Dan Brown">Dan Brown</a>'s bestseller&#160;»<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a>«. Incredible attention to the details, masterful aproach and symbolism are just few of the superlatives, which can now be admired publicly.</p>
<p>The project's subtitle&#160;»The revelation of the secret dossier of Priory of Sion«&#160;is definitely a dessert for our expectations and it just might seal the final chapter of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Grail_c5ce.html" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a> myth.</p>
<p>The greatest enigma of all is that this collection is available via internet now.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-14_4427.html" title="Edit section: Mark Rapp: Jazz Trumpet, Composer, Didgeridoo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark Rapp: Jazz Trumpet, Composer, Didgeridoo</span></h2>
<p>Mark Rapp, trumpeter, composer and groove-merchant of the didgeridoo, hails from a life uncommon amongst most professional musicians. He was not pre-destined for the world of music nor was he brought up in a family of musicians. However, he was and continues to be a one of a kind.<br />
<br />
Mark was raised in South Carolina and although he played trumpet in the high school concert and jazz bands, his awareness of jazz did not come to fruition until he heard his first Louis Armstrong recording when he was 19 years old. Nearly in his 20's Mark was finally introduced to and quickly immersed himself in the world of jazz. The years to come held in store for Mark an expeditious journey of ambitious study and performance of the music called jazz.<br />
<br />
Mark received a Bachelor in Music Performance at Winthrop University where he studied under Dr. Ian Pearson who hails from the tutelage of Vince DiMartino.
