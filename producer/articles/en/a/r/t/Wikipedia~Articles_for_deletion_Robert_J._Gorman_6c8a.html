<p>Has been listed as a speedy, but I didn't think it quite fitted into that. To be honest with you, I don't know enough about law or otherwise to be sure enough that he isn't notable to speedy delete, if you see what I mean. Also, its worth noting that this is one of many articles written about the same family by the same user. So, nominating for deletion but I can be convinced otherwise. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 23:56, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> RJ is another matter than his son. RJ is a major civil rights attorney with a long reputation and participation in many historic events. The article is specifically given as a beginning, and should not be deleted unless it is clear that there will not be enough to prove N and V-- and we have at least 2 good ones here. His key cases have not yet been added, but they will--an indication of them can be seen in the obits cited., which are from reputable newspapers. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The case he won was before the Illinois Supreme Court, not the US Supreme Court. (<a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/depts/clinic/wrongful/exonerations/IllinoisList.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/depts/clinic/wrongful/exonerations/IllinoisList.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> and <a href="http://forejustice.org/db/Eaton__Roy_.html" class="external text" title="http://forejustice.org/db/Eaton__Roy_.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> are all I found about it.) The case may have had repercussions in Illinois but this is a weak case for notability and no other major legal accomplishments are cited. Being with Ike at D-Day or marching on Washington are interesting sidebars to an article but not in themselves notable. There's potential here but I don't see it. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:11, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think <b>DGG</b> is 100% correct! I've yet to finish RJ's article, because I'm still learning how to cite references and sources that can be vefified by any fact checker. FYI - I am NOT an attorney, so I'm a little handicapped at citing legal references - but I'm in the process of learning. There's several important civil rights cases (most on a pro-bono basis) that RJ was involved with that I'm till trying to cite and document that clearly illustrates his importance. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrommeyer_cf66.html" title="User:Frommeyer">Frommeyer</a> 17:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Your Help Please</b> I fully understand the need for editors to check &amp; verify facts. I have a link to a PDF file of a six (6) page feature article about the Roy Eaton case (he spent 16 years in prison for a crime he did not commit) that was in the Saturday Evening Post in 1956. Can I put a link to this article on the RJ page for you check? Right now, I suspect that it would / could / might be more appropreate within it's own "People vs Roy Eaton" article? Likewise, I suspect that the NBC's 1957 television documentary "Error in Judgement" requires its own seperate Wikipedia article that can be linked to from RJ's page? Your help and guidance would be most appreciated. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrommeyer_cf66.html" title="User:Frommeyer">Frommeyer</a> 17:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Thanks</b>. I am not a lawyer and I don't know too much about copyrights (but trying to learn). It seems like the copyright notice at the end of the 6-page reprint allows for it's use by anyone EXCEPT for three specific conditions (none of which this use in Wiki seems to violate).

If I removed the link to the PDF and just cited the source (6-page story "The Case Of Prisoner No. 16688" by John Kobler, 1st published in the July 14, 1956 issue of Saturday Evening Post) would any Wiki editor or admin even bother to look it up "off line" since there seems to be no current reference to it anywhere on the internet that I could find?

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Delete</b> I did a lot of cleanup on this article, which came to my attention due to copyvios in the original version. I was going to argue for a keep based on argument before the <i>US</i> Supreme Court. <s>Now that I see the case was before the <i>Illinois</i> Supreme Court,</s> I just took a look at the Chicago papers from 1956 and found out that Eaton was not released because of an appellate court decision. In actuality, the prosecuting attorney obtained a confession from one of the real criminals and then petitioned the trial court to have Eaton released. Gorman was involved, but it appears that the person primarily responsible for Eaton's release was the prosecutor. I feel even more strongly now that Gorman lacks sufficient <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. Perhaps the case of People v. Eaton is notable, having been the subject of a TV documentary, and it might be appropriate to include some detail of Gorman's biography there as Eaton's attorney, but I don't think a standalone article on Gorman is appropriate based on the lack of notability in his own right. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 22:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC) and revised by <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 01:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Even worse, for the article's sake that is, the SEP article indicates that the case itself was not argued before the Illinois Supreme Court (although the compensation case, that led to the new state law, may have been).--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>According to a Chicago Daily Tribune article from 1960, Eaton received $48,000.00 through legislative enactment in 1957, paid $16,000.00 of it to Gorman (so much for the <i>pro bono</i> stories) and had spent the balance by 1960, when he was arrested for drunkenness and jailed because he didn't have the $23.00 in fines and court costs. Sad. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 01:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, but probably inevitable. To clarify from what I understand, Gorman was asked to be an <i>amicus curiae</i> by the state judge in the case, in an era before Miranda and widespread public defenders, somewhat unusual. He then pursued a civil suit on Eaton's behalf which is where the settlement came from. In any event, I wish this were a bit more notable, because it is interesting.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>NOTABLE</b> I do not wish to waste anyone's time, including my own. Unfortunately, this RJC is my very first entry for any topic in Wikipedia - and I'm still going thru a big learning curve. However, it clearly seems to be that Roy Eaton story and RJC's involment certainly meets the "primary criterion" for inclusion in Wiki, if nothing else. If a 6-page story in the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Evening_Post_2355.html" title="Saturday Evening Post">Saturday Evening Post</a> and a 1-hour <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> television documentary on the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armstrong_Circle_Theatre_678b.html" title="Armstrong Circle Theatre">Armstrong Circle Theatre</a> series (aired from 13 years, 1950 to 1963) aren't reliable secondary sources about this topic, then I am wrong.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is we have to be careful not to confound topics. Just because a person is involved in something notable does not make the person notable in his or her own right. The SEP article and TV special are about Roy Eaton's situation, with only passing mentions of Gorman because of his connection to Eaton. I think that Eaton is notable (and interesting, btw) and may merit a Wikipedia article. That does not mean that Eaton's <i>attorney</i> should have a self-standing article. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 18:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> That's true, but it seems that Gorman has has more than his 10 year involement (1946-1956) with Eaton before he was released from prison in 1956. Afterward, he won (as a seperate notable case) the 1st payment for a wrongful conviction case in Illinois in 1957. Then, during the 60s and 70s, I think his 95% success record in defending 19 of 20 conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War is notable. That's three seperate notable items that have been referenced so far. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrommeyer_cf66.html" title="User:Frommeyer">Frommeyer</a> 15:03, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
