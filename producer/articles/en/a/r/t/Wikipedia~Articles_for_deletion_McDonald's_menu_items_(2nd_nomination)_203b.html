<dd><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to point out that the nominator is on shaky ground using <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> to try and invalidate the results of the previous AfD. Firstly, that is an <i>essay</i>, not a policy or guideline. Secondly, WP:ILIKEIT refers to liking the <i>subject</i> of an article, not liking the quality or usefulness of the article itself. Unless a majority of arguments were "Keep because McDonalds food is delicious" - and they weren't - there is no grounds to use WP:ILIKEIT to invalidate previous consensus. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 00:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The subject matter is encyclopedic. The subject? A list of foods served by the biggest chain of restaurants in the world. Millions eat McDonald's food every day. I think this is enough to claim that this belongs in an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>This is not an indiscriminate collection of information. The minimum requirements right now are any food items sold by McDonald's, past or present. This can be tightened up a bit if need be. The list can't possibly be "endless". Large? Duh.</li>
<li>Sources <i>exist</i> for this. Whether they be primary (from McDonald's) or secondary, they do exist.</li>
<li>Secondary sources have covered the subject of McDonald's food as a whole. Therefore, we are not inventing some new concept by mashing a bunch of unrelated subjects together. Here's something that was published just today: <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/234980,CST-FIN-Mac30.article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suntimes.com/business/234980,CST-FIN-Mac30.article" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I cannot state it any better than RockMFR. The article is decent.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think it's worthwhile. Pretty much everything can be verified (it's not as if McDonald's is a small chain with a supersecret menu) and the original research can be edited out. I think that the "regional dishes" section is important/interesting enough for the article stay. This is more than a menu, some of the entries include history and many others might be expanded in the same way. The article is too long for the intersting stuff to be merged back into any other McDonald's article. <b><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikm_d2c0.html" title="User:Mikm"><span style="color: #36393D;">superapathy</span></a><a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikm_27e1.html" title="User talk:Mikm"><span style="color:#B02B2C">man</span></a></b> 04:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per most of those advocating same. The information is verifiable enough (and that which isn't obviously has no place here, blablablaboilerplate), and this information is encyclopedic enough to be included <i>somewhere</i>. It looks far too big to be plonked in the middle of the main article, so a separate one would make good sense. Strangely enough, my two McDonald's-addicted brothers were just comparing notes on "local specialties" we encountered on a recent trip through Europe. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - wow, this article is surprisingly well written for what looks like it should be a list. Talks about the dishes and their history, and in depth international varieties. The information is worthy of an article on WP - despite nomination by Jaranda, I see no evidence of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> here any more than <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> before looking at the article, I thought the same as several people above: "<i>if Wikipedia starts including menus, then God help us all...</i>". However, looking at the article, I think it's a perfect example of the sort of international collaborative effort that is virtually only possible on Wikipedia. The article is NPOV, this is not a "fan page" as some have suggested. It's verifiable, in my opinion notable, and (at the risk of being accused of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>) pretty bloody interesting. Perhaps part of the problem is the title - "Regional variations of McDonald's food" does not seem to have the "Wikipedia as a collection of menus" connotation that the current title does. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 12:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Several items on the menu at McDonald's have been <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other</a></i>.

<dd><b>Keep</b>, but article editors should consider renaming. McDonald's has spawned hundreds, perhaps thousands of articles around the world dedicated to it's menu alone.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as Lankybugger notes, the McDonald's menu is <i>itself</i> the subject of frequent coverage, since this is one of the world's major brands. This is <i>not</i> indiscriminate (although there's little point to listing all the soda brands, if you ask me), different international menus is in fact <i>justification</i> for having this article, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problems may be dealt with via cleanup or dispute resolution.

<li><b>Keep</b> In all honesty, sometimes I support a page because it has been created although I think other ways would be as proper. I would have been satisfied with a template since there are 28 items in <a href="../../../m/c/d/Category%7EMcDonald%27s_foods_3a69.html" title="Category:McDonald's foods">Category:McDonald's foods</a>. However, since it is there, there is little reason to delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a valid article as per my reasons stated in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Burger_King_menu_items_2a31.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Burger King menu items">Burger King</a> thread. In addition, the menu is not just a collection of products for sale but a form of advertising that targets demographic trends and groups as well as the tastes of the markets these companies operate in. These companies spend millions of dollars and thousands of man hours on developing products that will give them market share and is a major part of their operating budgets; these articles help demonstrate that. To delete these sub-articles would take away from the main articles and fail to demonstrate how one aspect of the modern restaurant chain business works. While I understand his initial reasoning that these articles were just a list of products, it is my belief is that Jarada may never have been fully exposed to the product development processes of modern business that these articles are trying to explain and may not fully understand the reasoning process that goes into creating products at a major, international chain (<i>I am <b>not</b> making a dig or insult of him, just trying to understand his thought process</i>).</li>

<dd>There is a major difference between a list of products from something like Coca-Cola or Ford from this, the main thing is that it's a store, that the menu here can change all the time and it's different for all parts of the world, unlike ford kraft or coca-cola. You are basiclly saying that you are endorsing articles of a listing of every product for every major brand like Wal-Mart, which wikipedia is WP:NOT for, there is a limit Jaranda <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 21:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your argument is flawed.
<ol>
<li>Wal*Mart is a retail chain, not a manufacturer. Burger King <i>is</i> a manufacturer, specifically of a food product that is designed for immediate consumption. You do not think of it as a manufacturer, but it is. A store is a retail establishment that usually sells pre-manufactured products, while a manufacturer takes raw or semi finished materials and constructs a product to sell. The product maybe sold at a retail establishment, on on-site or through private vendors. In addition, a restaurant while not only manufacturing the product (food) a restaurant provides a place to consume the product (food), but does not have to.</li>
<li>The menu does not change on a consistent basis, in fact is fairly stable. BK offers special products on occasion (e.g. special Whopper varieties) as does Coca-Cola (e.g. Special flavors of Sprite) and Ford (e.g. Eddie Bauer Explorer). Like Ford, it removes non-selling (Ford Excursion, CCC's Tab product) products from its lines when necessary.</li>
<li>Wikipedia provides an informational source of products manufactured by Hershey's, Nestle and others. They are manufactures of food products designed for resale, while restaurants such as BK or McDs are are manufactures of food product designed for immediate consumption; just because the food is consumed in different venues does not matter, both groups should be treated equally.</li>
</ol>

<dd>As on the Burger King outlets discussion above, you argue that a McDonalds is not the same as any other store, it is actually a factory. Again I ask you for evidence to back this up; McDonalds don't claim their outlets are factories, and where local authorities have powers to zone or designate specific activities in specific areas, they do not class McDonalds as factories. Show me an example of a shopping mall where such a mix is allowed - the shops, the McDonalds, the Ford truck engine plant etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 08:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your are twisting my argument- At no time did I use the term <i>factory</i>. You are seeking to discredit my argument with data that seem to be applicable but are really not. You do not have to have a giant mill or factory to manufacture a product. Examples would the people who make hand crafted jewelery, weavers who make there own cloth for sale, tailors who manufacture custom clothing, potters who make hand thrown stoneware- all of these people are manufacturing products, usually in a small location that also usually serves as their retail outlet. Yes BK is a retail outlet- it serves food products that are manufactured on site, as do brewpubs, bakery cafes, chocolate stores, small coffee roasting houses etc. Look at the definition of manufacturer from Webster's:</dd>

<dd>Notice that it does not say giant factory or mill. Based on the definition, all restaurants are manufactures; just as Coca-Cola, Nestle, Ford, Sony, Dow etc are. Just as these companies' products are important and noteworthy, restaurant menus from these fast food restaurants are too- they affect major societal issues like health (Mr. Spurlock's film showed this), the economy (several million burgers are sold each day generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue) and business practices (these companies spend millions on product development, and the failure of these items can be detrimental to the company). The menu is an integral part of the business operations of these companies and to delete them would be removing an important piece of the main article. I have stated my opinion as why Jarada's argument for deletion is flawed and that the article should be kept. I believe that it meets accepted Wikipedia standards for articles.</dd>

<li>To further explain why the argument is flawed, Ford, Kraft and Coca-Cola do have regional differences in their markets, and they do change their offerings from time to time. I don't know if you've ever bought soda for retail, but if you had, you'd have a coke man come visit you and tell you about their new products, or their discontinuations if something isn't selling well.

<dd>I don't know why you're upset over that, I think it provides valuable encyclopedic content, as it provides information as to what in-house brands Wal-mart has. They are the world's largest retail concern after all. And while I do concur that listing every product produced under those brands might eventually be a bit much, that same problem doesn't apply to a fast food restaurant, which even though they can have a large menu, is still a bit more finite in scope.

<li><b>Keep</b> Let's see, nobody can question McDonald's overall notability, right? What are they notable for? Serving food. Heck, their food gets in the news with some regularity. (I know there were news articles about the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arch_Deluxe_d7db.html" title="Arch Deluxe">Arch Deluxe</a>, and I bet they even appeared on the Today show and Good Morning America. Thus covering their food is highly important. This article does a reasonable job of doing that, and in fact, the nomination for deletion makes a good argument for having this article. International differences are yet another thing people might want to know. I've even seen newspaper and magazine articles that discuss it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> At first I was sceptical about this article, however, the sheer enormity of the McDonald's franchise, and consequentially, its cultural influence around the globe, makes the list more than simply fancruft. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairman_S._cc1b.html" title="User:Chairman S.">Chairman S.</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairman_S._c158.html" title="User talk:Chairman S."><font color="#E32636">Talk</font></a> <font color="#177245"><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chairman_S._1280.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chairman S.">Contribs</a></sup></font></span> 12:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
