<p>Let's leave aside for now the fact that this article was deleted by an AfD, despite heavy interference from its subject. Let's leave aside for now that after the article was deleted by due process, one of Clary's supporters tried to recreate the article under titles such as J L Clary, John Clary, and Johnny Clary. What makes it absolutely outrageous that this article exists is that this individual <i>already has</i> an article created by the same supporter who then created <i>this one</i>! The two articles even link to each other, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Angel_%28wrestler%29_5296.html" title="Johnny Angel (wrestler)">Johnny Angel (wrestler)</a>! When I saw the attempt to promote Mr. Clary again, this time with an article focused on his career in pro wrestling, I thought it was pretty cheap, but I let it go. But now he's supposed to get <i>two</i> articles, when he and his supporters couldn't demonstrate enough notability in the first AfD for <i>one</i> article? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:45, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability is established by several newsworthy events with which he was involved.

Most of the hits seem to be blogs and forums and, interestingly, a lot of Australian sites. I can't really find anything that qualifies as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Sources</a>. To clarify the history, earlier versions were pretty much created by Clary himself, full of OR, POV and unverifiable personal claims. Author of this version appears to be unrelated, someone who heard Clary speak, felt he deserved an article, and launched the DRV. However, it seems the content is still overwhelmingly based on Clary's own claims. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:09, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

(He seems to have done a better job of selling himself down under than he has in the US.) However, what these news reports all amount to is basically <i>"Clary says that..."</i> How much can be verified from a news report citing a source other than Johnny Lee Clary? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Subject is former head of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. That alone makes him notable enough for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Merge</b> While notability in all areas is reasonably weak, I think that it's enough. We have a conversion story that's compelling enough to get coverage in numerous specialist (i.e. Christian) publications and on a couple of national TV shows, along with a pro-wrestling career (as unimpressive as it may be). While I might have thought each one just missed the mark on its own, when there are a combinations of factors for notability I don't think individual ones need to be as strong. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> is a non-comprehensive guideline.

<li><b>Keep, merge and cleanup!</b> as per Gwernol. Stop rigging the voting by asking friends to vote to keep the article (comment to whomever is doing this). This is a discussion based on arguments made in favor or against the AfD. The votes don't really matter if you're not going to say why you want to keep/delete the article. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 21:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> His high ranking in the Klan coupled with the media attention he received (and still seems to receive) as a converted outspoken critic of Klan ideology and practices more than warrants an entry on him. As for hits - in some cases I don't think too much weight can be put on them in terms of determining someone's notoriety. I'm sure there's a lot of important composers and artists who get a similarly low number of hits, but those shouldn't go up for deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/p/User%7EDeputyMarshall_aaea.html" title="User:DeputyMarshall">Deputy Marshall</a> 01:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
