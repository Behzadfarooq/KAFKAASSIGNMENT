<p>This is a long nomination, but please, I ask you to read on as I would like some participation from the wider Wikipedia community. This comic was previously deleted at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Outsider_%28comic%29_eadd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic)</a> and was nominated for a second time at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Outsider_%28comic%29_%282nd_nomination%29_db2b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic) (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic) (2nd nomination)</a> where it ended as a no consensus. I am nominating again because I feel that the outcome of the second discussion was erronomous. Although the second nomination had such great keep votes such as "I masturbated into a sock last night" and general ILIKEIT style comments, I really do not think that their arguments hold much weight. They claim that this webcomic, seen <a href="http://well-of-souls.com/outsider/" class="external text" title="http://well-of-souls.com/outsider/" rel="nofollow">here</a> is notable because it was nominated for the 2002 outstanding sci-fi <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_888a.html" title="Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</a>. This however, is not a notable award, the WCCA's have more categories than the <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscars.html" title="Oscars">Oscars</a> (really), and so many are nominated every year, it's meaningless. Just because it was nominated once for a web award with no ceremony (they just gather up votes in an online poll then post the results) doesn't mean that it's more notable/popular/better sourced than Encyclopedia Dramatica. Having one nomination puts it up with those big hitting websites such as Psychic Dyslexia Institute, Bikeeni 2000 and The Tenth Life of Pishio the Cat . This comic has no other reliable third party sources, has not achieved great popularity as seen by its <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=well-of-souls.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=well-of-souls.com/" rel="nofollow">Alexa rank</a> and pretty much all the information is sourced from the website itself. We should not have slacker inclusion guidelines for webcomics over other web content. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:08, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Nominating this for a third time is a completely pointless waste of energy and time.

<li>Haelth, I think we can agree that the article is quite good. The subject itself seems to be the problem. I also think that the value of the very first nomination <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Outsider_%28comic%29_eadd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic)</a> has been quite exagerated don't you agree? There were only five users interrested at that time and the article was nominated just 14 days&#160;! after being created, it never had enough time to evolve yet. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 23:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't think the case has been adequately made that the Alexa rankings for Outsider don't demonstrate a notable webcomic. I have not seen any guidelines that quantify what sort of traffic ranking qualifies as notable. Previous comparisons with traffic rankings for Penny Arcade and Megatokyo don't seem very appropriate; I don't know whether a webcomic must be among the four or five most popular in the world to be considered "notable", but in any event comparing the traffic numbers of a daily or thrice-weekly comic strip with those of a weekly (or less) long form comic doesn't seem to be a very good basis for judgment. An informal survey of long-form, weekly-or-less updated comics with current Wikipedia articles produced this general range of Alexa numbers:</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I have always maintained that the standards for webcomic inclusion have been incredibly lax, and that they seem to be treated through rose tinted spectacles in comparison to other websites. There is an absolute shedload of webcomics on my watchlist which have Alexa ranks like the ones you quote and should be deleted. Encyclopedia Dramatica had a rank of around 8000 I think, Final Fantasy Shrine has a rank in the top 10,000 also. They were both deleted. Barring the sci-fi web cartoonist's choice award nomination, there have been no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> or professional third party reviews or critical commentary on your work. I cannot imagine any other set of websites outside of webcomics in which the claim that an Alexa rank of 370,000 makes it notable would be used as an argument for keep. The Alexa rank wasn't even the main point of this nomination. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:33, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - No reliable secondary sources of information regarding the notability of this. Doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> at all. For what its worth, I would've closed the previous AFD as delete, due to complete lack of arguments based on WP policy/guidelines and instead stuff like "the comic clearly exists and has some history". I'm actually busting out the "strong" delete on this one, which I haven't done in awhile. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:25, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I find the fact that the WP:WEB classifications as being incredibly short sighted and that such criteria will create false positives and false negatives all over the place if used as criteria for deletion in the particular case of webcomics. If a webcomic publishes their material in paperback form, and opens their own personal bookshop out of their garage, they immediately qualify as they have an outside source(their publisher). Why should a site suddenly be better because the owner decides to shell out money to publish? A webcomic is a peice of fiction, not fact, and I think after scrutinizing the INTENT of the rules in question, that this webcomic is sufficient to warrent a wiki article. I do agree that webcomics are a dime a dozen, but *any* award from any organization (whether web derived or not) therefore implies quality of work simply because winners had to compete against hundreds or thousands of similarly themed works. Just troll through the latest comic ranking sites like buzzcomics and see how many exist. But I ask you to think, go wiki some webcomics like inverloch, earthsong, no need for bushido, look at their pages, and think about why all of these shouldn't deserve to have a wiki page. If you think that they shouldn't, than why are ANY fictional works presented herein? I think the time has long passed that having a paperback published copy of your fictional work somehow makes the work more immortal. I'll finish up with some counterpoint aimed at Hahnchen. Reliable sources I quote&#160;: "Evaluate the reliability of online sources just as you would print or other more traditional sources. Neither online nor print sources deserve an automatic assumption of reliability by virtue of the medium they are printed in. All reports must be evaluated according to the processes and people that created them." This is a work of fiction, the author's word is final, hence it is no different than the lord of the rings or any other published non-fiction work. Another point, because we are to consider this source just as we would if it were published in another medium, why are we even talking about alexa rankings as we certainly do not consider how many copies were printed, or how widly circulated or translated a particular book is. Addiitonally I would question your criteria for "well known" award, as I think it is very well known within the commuity it serves (i.e. those who read webcomics). The point of the rules is to keep fradulent works out, to keep facts close to reality etc. That is the spirit I see behind the rules being sited, and that is why I find that works such as webcomics break that mold. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.169.189.3 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.169.189.3_54e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.169.189.3">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Do you even know what a reliable source is? The difference between this webcomic and Lord of the Rings is that in one case, we are taking the author's word for every claim, and in the other case, there are thousands of other people who have intently scrutinised every claim, checked every fact, and published their own findings independently! A reliable source, whether online or offline is necessarily and inherently a <i>secondary</i> source, and that completely and utterly rules out any author whatsoever as a reliable source on their own work. If Shakespeare himself had a website about his plays, we would not be able to cite it as a source! How much less, then, can we have an article about a lesser author that doesn't cite adequate sources? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:36, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>How is the "reliability" even in question, it is a work of FICTION the author is the sole person responsible for it. Are we going to eliminate Lucas's early Star Wars films because the commentary on it by people before the rereleases are now moot as he changed things around? I fail to see how external commentary makes a work of fiction any more or less reasonable as a wikipedia article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, right? And it's the only encyclopedia that 'records' the Internet. This is information about a lasting place on the Internet. More, it's about a carefully, extensively and deliberatly crafted place on the Internet. I would love for, one day, to have Wikipedia have an entry for /every/ Webcomic; atleast enough to know what it is and some review quotations. Why? Because it's information. Usefull information</li>
</ul>
<p>. Quite frankly, I think it's notable simple because it very deliberately exists (as can be seen in the effort of world and art creation), and has existed for a long enough time that I'm very certain it will continue to exist for a good long time. Summarize: Information is usefull; content has deliberatly existed and shows all signs that it will continue to do so. <s>Narfanator 3:26 AM EST August 23 2006</s><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.7.93.7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.7.93.7_0308.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.7.93.7">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: This is a signed "vote." The comic does not pass WEB. The presence of a Wikipedia article does not make something good, and the absence of one doesn't make something bad.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> per Geogre and Wickethewok. The simple fact is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory of websites or comics, and as such synopses of webcomics - completely regardless of their popularity or "notability" - fall outside our scope, and should not be included. Comixpedia exists for a <i>reason</i>, folks. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:33, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think that wikipedia should use external reasons such as "comixpedia exists for a 'reason'" as why even have wikipedia exist. There are encyclopedia, and countless volumes of books that contain the same information, and some would say more accurately. I'd say keep your arguments germane, I don't think the existance of external information sources for the same material is relevant, as such an argument nullifies all that wikipedia stands for. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.169.189.3 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.169.189.3_54e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.169.189.3">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Seriously, I thought the whole point of wikipedia was that if you want to know something, you go to wikipedia to get infomation on it.

<li>That's a very common misconception, but no - that is not what Wikipedia is for. Wikipedia is meant to collect information from secondary sources about notable topics. There are standards for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">inclusion</a> as well as standards for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">sources</a>.

There has never been a consensus to keep this. That's all beside the point anyway, since the results of previous AfDs don't have any bearing on the previous one as long as it was nominated in good faith.

<li>That's the problem with the folks here who try to use <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> on AfD. Verifiability, while an official policy, doesn't really matter in this case. We all know the comic <i>exists</i>. The question is whether or not it is <i>notable</i> enough for inclusion, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">the standards for which</a> are only guidelines. This discussion is intended to decide its notability, not its verifiability. The information is obviously verifiable, but if consensus holds that the subject is non-notable then it's pointless to add sources. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 00:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>In response to Flamarande, no, linking to the website will not satisfy our content policies. First, per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, "If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic." I feel like I'm stating the obvious, but a website is not a third-party source for an encyclopedia article about itself. Second, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> requires website articles contain info on "achievements, impact or historical significance," not simply descriptions of the website. Anything that is actually an achievement or of historical significance will be covered by third-party sources. To Kafziel, I'll point out that that this article is not "obviously verifiable" in the sense of our Verifiability policy. That is, "Information on Wikipedia must be reliable and verifiable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources." Nothing in this article has been published by a reliable and reputable source. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 01:52, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
