<li><b>Keep</b> It's fine as it is, especially if used, say, in comparison to unconditional love, or in the context of how legitimate institutions should not behave. &amp;c. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 16:55, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. If all these reputable contributors think it's valid, I'll trust them, but the current article is rather confusing, implying that there is something sinister about a practice that, as described, sounds like it consists entirely of people being nice. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 19:26, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now thats a good point. As hard as the author(s) tried (and I can tell they tried pretty hard), the article isn't NPOV on the subject. It presents it as a cult's method of indoctrination. I doubt anyone disagrees that it has been used that way, but there are plenty of other reasons for, and interpretations of, being intimate. Myself, I tend to judge others by their fruits, and if they are nice to be around, thats a pretty good sign of their character, certainly a better sign than their religious denomination.

<li>Well, in the <a href="../../../a/s/c/Asch_conformity_experiments.html" title="Asch conformity experiments">Asch conformity experiments</a>, the test subjects were influenced to give an incorrect answer to an easy question by the presence of confederates posing as fellow test subjects. Some of the test subjects said that they had gone along with the group's answers because they thought their own vision must be flawed; others because they did not want to face the disapproval of the group. Imagine how much pressure on your perception could be exerted by a group that was consciously and deliberately controlling its expressions of approval towards you based on your conformity. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:39, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. While there are disagreements about the efficacy of "love bombing", it's been a prominent concept in the literature for over 20 years. To say it should not even be discussed as a concept because one side has been claiming for the 20 years that it's been in wide use that it doesn't exist just doesn't hold up. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:39, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-known term. Reasonable start for an article. I thought it was the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_God_b3f2.html" title="Children of God">Children of God</a>, not the Moonies, who used the term <b>themselves</b> and catapulted it into the popular consciousness. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:56, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC) Well, our <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_God_b3f2.html" title="Children of God">Children of God</a> article doesn't mention it. Apparently they <i>did</i> use "flirty fishing" which isn't <i>quite</i> the same thing (!). Might be called "love-bombing: thermonuclear option." Googling associates the phrase with "cults" generally, including but not limited to the Moonies. It's been applied to <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a>, too. None of which answers the question "who originated the phrase, and when." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:05, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've refined the opening definition to make it clear that the term love bombing is meant to refer to an <i>insincere</i> (or at least deliberately <i>exaggerated</i>) show of affection, and that it commonly applies to a <i>group</i> of people acting <i>in concert.</i> I can't tell whether Dr. Margaret Singer actually originated the term, but she appears to at any rate have been an early user and popularize of the term, so I added something about that. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:56, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Seriously, though, I have no problem with either the existence or title of the article.

I just used it myself at <a href="../../../l/o/v/Talk%7ELove_bombing_b9a4.html" title="Talk:Love bombing">talk:love bombing</a> today, to describe an incident in which I participated.

<dd>I thought of that, but how do you <b>fake</b> sincere interest over a text-only interface?

<dd>As a critic of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> (whose page is actually a reference on the article in question), I have found remarkable difficulty in persuading Scientologist editors to come on board and bring their point of view to the party.

Possibly they don't trust me ... - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 01:40, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>(Are we off-topic yet?) 1) I would have thought it would be <i>easier</i> to fake sincere interest via text than in person. In fact, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Weizenbaum_722e.html" title="Joseph Weizenbaum">Joseph Weizenbaum</a>'s <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliza.html" title="Eliza">Eliza</a> did a reasonable job of faking sincere interest. 2) I'm always surprised at peoples' lack of interest in Wikipedia. Several times I've emailed press or PR contacts with questions, and have usually gotten answers. Each time I've given them the URL of the article in question and pointed out (with some misgiving!) that they can edit it themselves. I've been surprised that so far not one of them has tried to edit an article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:30, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
