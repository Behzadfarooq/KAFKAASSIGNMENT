<p>Article about <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">User:SimonP</a>, though not created by him. Is being the top Wikipedia editor generally notable? I don't think so, but let's see what others think. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 19:09, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I expected to vote delete, before I did a Google search and saw how much has been written about him. The Globe and Mail article has been copied all over the place, there's an interview in U of T Magazine, and several quotes in other stories about Wikipedia. It doesn't <i>seem</i> like the Wikipedian with the most edits would be notable based just on that... but the press seems to disagree. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 19:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd say he shouldn't decide, unless he is really, really, really unhappy about the article. I mean, modesty alone might provoke one to vote Delete on an article on oneself, and this is not a good reason to have an article deleted. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 19:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> With all due reverence and awe at SimonP's superb work, there will always be an editor with highest edit count. While the news articles do establish some notability, it is a borderline case so I say delete per <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>. Will the article be referenced in the future? Best to limit the crossovers between editors and subjects as far as is possible. --<a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeaDrinker_0ad2.html" title="User:TeaDrinker">TeaDrinker</a> 19:53, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Like it or not, he is now famous in Canada, at least among Globe and Mail readers. A friend e-mailed me a copy of the the Globe and Mail article, so the aftershocks from the article are reinforcing the fame. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 20:35, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If you are going to delete this, then there's lot to delete before deleting this entry. What is more relevant, the most ative user of the biggest "encyclopedia" or the detailed history of an obscure fictional cartoon character? Just my 2 cents <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.155.165.182 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.155.165.182_7647.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.155.165.182">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. WP:SELF does not apply here; it would if the article had a link to <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">User:SimonP</a> (it doesn't). Wikipedia is now big enough that it is beginning to hear echoes of itself from the greater world; that's simply a fact we must live with. While we should strive to uphold WP:SELF, we should not impose an institutional bias against articles referencing Wikipedia; we should have <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Pulsifer_7baa.html" title="Simon Pulsifer">Simon Pulsifer</a> for the same reasons as we have the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a>. SimonP's prominece comes not from being Wikipedia's top editor but from having a half-page profile by one of Canada's major daily newspapers. —<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 21:24, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There's a lot of info here, by a respectable paper - it would seem SimonP is now notable... <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 22:04, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Move Out of Wikipedia Article Space</b> It's great that he's such a prolific editor but this does <i>not</i> make him encyclopedically notable. Remember its not just notability, its <i>encyclopedic</i> notability. Being covered in a couple of newspapers or even more source is not proof either - as I keep saying, much or even most of the material carried in mainstream news sources every day is non-encyclopedic, and we shouldn't just make articles based on whatever's covered in the news. There is a place for this kind of page but not in the main article space. I recommend a Hall of Fame page for editors who are extraordinarily prolific. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">User:Lord_Emsworth</a> (who has also been mentioned in major media sources such as <i><a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_magazine.html" title="Wired magazine">Wired</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> but not by his real name or in as much detail), for instance, would be on such a list as well. Note that keeping the Simon Pulsifier article as an encyclopedia article also discriminates against extraordinary editors like Lord Emsworth who prefer to be less revealing about their true identity and avoid Media labels such as "King of Wikipedia" (not enough detail known on Emsworth for an article - but certainly enough for a Hall of Fame list). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:42, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is hardly "discriminatory", as our job is to record notability in the world at large (and yes, Wikipedia is part of the world, which is exactly the point), not to reward profilic contributors. If another profilic contributor chooses to avoid media interviews, then he <i>should</i> be left out because he <i>isn't</i> notable, just as some guy with a billion dollars who nobody's ever heard of would be left out of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Category%7EBillionaires_e18c.html" title="Category:Billionaires">Category:Billionaires</a>. —<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 07:10, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia's task is to record <i>encyclopedic</i> notability in the world at large, not whatever's in the newspapers. I strongly feel the Hall of Fame idea is fairer and much more decorous and more appropriate. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:14, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> His name is being mentioned in the press related to this site. I think that earns him the right to have an article on him. We congradualte and honor those who make landmark pages (like the 1-millionth article), this is pretty close to the same thing. Jimmy Wales has a 5 page article about himself complete with his political views and college experiance, I don't see anyone petitoning that page. Although granted, voting has no meaning on here... so I dunno why we bother. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostalker_d602.html" title="User:Ghostalker">Ghostalker</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Any establishment or initiative such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> itself needs role models to survive and thrive. If this initiative of a 'free encyclopedia' has to survive then it needs its own heroes and role models. SimonP is truly one of them. We must keep this article as it is of a pioneer and a role model for all of us.Devpriya piyadassi</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>– He has become a celebrity over night based on the Globe and Mail article. There are many articles about overnight celebrities, such as about <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a> on this site, who become an overnight "sensation" for more debateable reasons in popular culture or what is fact and what is not then this. The way I see it, Simon is now popular culture. Everyone who read page 2 of the Globe and Mail knows about this guy, and its true, he does live with his mom and has no girlfriend. the Globe and Mail said so at the end of paragraph 11.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mirovnik (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mirovnik_7e30.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mirovnik">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> His relationship with wikipedia is irrelevant. All that is relevant is that he is a public figure due to press coverage and therefore merits an article. It is rather <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> to think that wikipedia should except itself from phenomena in the world. The fact is that wikipedia has now become established as a notable subject and will have to learn to cover itself as objectively as any other subject. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 08:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
