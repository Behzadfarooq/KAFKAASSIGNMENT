<p>The result of the debate was <b>No Consensus</b>--Default--KEEP.</p>
<p>Also, note that: "[The M16] has been the primary infantry rifle of the United States military since 1967, and is in use by 15 NATO countries, and has been the most produced firearm in its caliber." Also, the AK47 was widely used in the Iron Curtain and it was "produced in greater numbers than any other assault rifle in the 20th century". The widespread military use and the relations to the Cold War make this a noteworthy comparison. Comparing these two rifles is hardly a crime, as this is one of the most notable gun comparisons you can make; this is not imply a "random" gun comparison. However, the article has been moved to "Comparison of the AK-47 and M16" and proper tags have been added. The difficulties in merging having been well noted. Regardless of this explanation, KEEP was the default choice regardless.<a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_f816.html" title="User:Voice of All(MTG)"><b>Voice <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></b></a> <sup><small><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_da05.html" title="User talk:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">@</font></a><b>|</b><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkred">Esperanza</font></a>|<a href="../../../w/p/e/WP%7EWPEM_c980.html" title="WP:WPEM"><font color="black">E M</font></a></small></sup> 03:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, though the article would do well to add sources. If you want sources for the very idea of comparing the two items, consider as a first example the "Rifle Evaluation Study" published by the Army Combat Developments Command in 1962 (I believe at the behest of McNamara), which focused on the AR-15 and AK-47 (as well as the now largely bypassed M14). We don't need to worry about having totally absurd comparison articles because we include this notable comparison, any more than we need to worry about having totally absurd people articles because we include notable people. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 07:00, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point is that the objects being compared are arbitrary; it's not surprising that a study written in 1962 about a new assault rifle would compare it to the AK-47; it is then and now the most popular assault rifle in the world. Any article about any assault rifle, on Wikipedia or off, will not be unlikely to make reference to the AK-47, mentioning how it was influenced by the AK-47 (or why it wasn't) and/or comparing it to the AK-47 as a baseline.<br />
If you don't like my (admittedly silly) example, would you want to see FN FAL vs. AK-47 and Sig 550 vs. Heckler-Koch G41 and every possible comparison thereof? Of course not; stick general philosophy of design and tradeoffs involved therein in the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Assault rifle">assault rifle</a> article, and compare each rifle to its contemporaries in the individual rifle articles. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:56, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Seems to me that just about anything with "vs." in its title (yeah, yeah, except articles about works that include that in their names, obviously) tends to be inherently OR. If this article were to remain, it should be renamed to something like "Differences between the AK-47 and the M-16" or whatnot, and even then I think some rather extensive sourcing and very solid references to actual performance tests would be required, so that the article is something that illustrates well-documented differences between the two weapons rather than sets them against each other. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 07:12, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It would, and I would also be in favor of merging the article. However that would call for a laborous process to properly integrate it and might involve the rewrites of several sections of the M16 article.

<li>I'll note my support for this position; certainly with work this content could be made more useful, better organized, etc. That sort of careful refinement, however, isn't produced by putting articles on AFD; it occurs through discussion on talk pages, perhaps with the involvement of RFC.

<li>That's simply not true. There is a laborious but straightforward procedure for doing a "history merge" which provides a GFDL-compliant merge-and-delete. And it's easy to improvide GFDL-compliant merge-and-delete since the GFDL does not require any specific form for the attribution so long as it is done. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:51, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
