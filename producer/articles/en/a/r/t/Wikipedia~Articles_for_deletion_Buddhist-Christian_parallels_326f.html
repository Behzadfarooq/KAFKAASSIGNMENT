<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Total Re-write</b> I'm surprised how low the standards being applied are. First, it has tons of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, a comment above notwithstanding, and regularly violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Who decided, to take an early example, that "cognitive" and "theistic" are antonyms? The article is an extended argument in support of the theory that Christianity derives from Buddhism -- and as with all such arguments, it displays an incredible lack of critical judgement -- Antioch was founded by a king of a line that had diplomatic relations with an Indian king, therefore Buddhism influenced Christianity? Nazarene comes from Nazir? -- and a total disregard for chronology whenever it suits the argument.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Where do we get the source for Jerome saying <i>Buddha</i> (rather than Jesus) was born from the side of a virgin? I seriously doubt any reliable source can be found for this. Have a closer look at the "parallel sayings" table -- first, some of them have little or no similarity and were apparently added just to bulk up the list, second, we are given no information about whether the Buddhist saying are recorded in Theravada or Mahayana sutras, which is necessary information in that Mahayana Buddhism is several hundred years <i>younger</i> than Chistianity. At least one has Buddha and Jesus actually saying opposite things. The article generally plays fast and loose with the account of Jesus. In one place it says Jesus told all his disciples to give up all material possessions, a common misunderstanding of what He told the rich young ruler. But encyclopedias exist in part to correct misunderstandings, not spread them.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I voted to keep. Much is not OR and presents long standing comparative religion scholarship, but some of the statements are undocumented OR, such as you cited. But the libraries of theological schools are full of dusty tomes which could and should be cited vis a vis such questions. Unsupported claims should be fact tagged and then deleted. The WP principle is to edit boldly and footnote everything to reliable and verifiable sources, which does not necessarily favor online sources rather than published work.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The deletion processes all focus on whether an article meets the criteria for existence on Wikipedia;</p>
<p>1)that is, they are to determine whether it is <b>not original research</b> -- There is no original research, all the work is researched with quotes from major scholars and works, links and references are fully listed.</p>
<p>2)<b>its central information is verifiable</b>and it is capable of achieving a neutral point of view with good editorship.... -- all sayings and quotes are verifiable, all historical information is verifiable</p>
<p>3)<b>XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked, whose perspective is against ones beliefs, or which is not yet presented neutrally</b>. Using XfD as a "protest strategy" in an editorial or NPOV debate is generally an abuse of process and the article will usually be <b>speedy kept</b>.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>The similarity of the teachings of Buddha and Jesus has long been noted by scholars. Comparison of religions has a long scholarly history, so the article has a lot of scholarship to draw on. The subject is notable and encyclopedic.That said, the scholarship can be improved. Footnote 5 is very vague as to what it refers to. Footnote 1 is to a website which appears to be a book, but no ISBN is furnished and it is not footnoted as a scholarly book. It is important in documenting 1st century Christianity in Palestine, a subject with few primary sources. The same info is cited to writings by Hypolytus, but clicking the link leads to a disambiguation page, and checking the various pages does not produce backup for the claim made re Terebinthus. This is only skimming the surface of need for improvement. Editors, get busy and make all references to only verifiable and reliable scholarly sources. (Edited to add: I added ISBN info for ref 1, but tthe form could still use a tweak. Please check other books cited and provide full publication info)<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:17, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: while it may <i>contain</i> some OR, it clearly is <i>not</i> OR. Could use some cleanup, but how many articles is that <i>not</i> true of?
