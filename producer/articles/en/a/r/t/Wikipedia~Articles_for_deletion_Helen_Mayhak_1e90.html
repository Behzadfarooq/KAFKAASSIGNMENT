<li><b>Keep</b> - I started this stub when I was newer here, and never got around to adding to it. I feel she is notable because she was the only township clerk for 40 years. I think she's as notable as a small town that has a pole barn on Main Street (Yes, that describes Hartford). I never got around to expanding it though. I would have no problem with merging it, however. This is one of those things that you would not hear much about on the internet.

<dd>There doesn't presently look much chance of this being deleted any more than the Pokemons (and I don't think it should be, as I said). It's often said "but if my article A is deleted, then articles Bâ€“Z-in-unrelated-field ought to go too, because they are surely less notable". Should we judge articles by the lowest common denominator, or the highest? Which way lies the raising of standards? Would inclusionists or deletionists favour LCD or HCD, or neither? The fact is that there is a considerable body of editors prepared to defend Pokemon to the hilt â€” and to face-down those that claim it lowers standards with the claim that comprehensiveness is everything. The same seems not to be true of articles on real people, for some reason. I don't personally subscribe to either philosophy absolutely. Oh, and notpaper is notfree. $165,000 of the $200,000+ just raised is to be spent on hardware. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:00, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Minor government officer for a township with a population of 3000? OK, she held the post for 40 years, but it's not exactly Mayor of New York, is it? Local colour, and should be merged as such. As for the professor claims, I don't believe we keep articles on every single professor, only those with a notable publication record. So merely doing the job for years doesn't qualify them. Neither does padding out the article, which is what the minor financial losses (about $2 dollars per person) would count as to me.
