<p>Artemis worked briefly for Ra's Al Ghul during her rebellious teenage years in the Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman Trinity series. She led armies of Ra's men, and was only ever bested by Batman in combat. She turns on Ra's when their forces attack Themyscira. She realizes that even though they are of a rival tribe, they are still Amazons, her people.</p>
<hr />
<p>She was never a JLA member, this is fact. She went on some missions with them -- just like Catwoman or Adam Strange -- but was never an official member. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesfer_a67b.html" title="User:Lesfer"><i>Lesfer</i></a> <a href="../../../l/e/s/User_talk%7ELesfer_d1c5.html" title="User talk:Lesfer"><font color="red"><big>☎</big></font></a> 21:52, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great article, AB! I've made some minor opyedits, but otherwise, it is an excellent addition. As far as the picture goes, I quite like it, but there are those here who go around deleting nude pictures, so it is best to keep an eye on it. I usually use DVD covers downloaded from on-line retailers because they usually are non-nude. I would leave the picture up until someone deletes it and then put up a different one. Thanks for your contribution. And don't forget to sign your talk page comments with four tildes.

<p>No problem. I was glad to back you up, and I agreed with what you wrote. The moments between Rogue and JP in the X-Men/AF special are some of my personal favorites. <i>Beautiful</i> work by Claremont.

<p>I noticed you reincluded the part about Alex Proyas directing "over 100 music videos"... I originally changed that (as discussed on the talk page) because I couldn't find any reliable source for that. Do you have one? Otherwise I'm going to change it back to "a couple". --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">Fritz Saalfeld</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFritz_Saalfeld_515f.html" title="User talk:Fritz Saalfeld">Talk</a>) 14:53, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:CharmedHollyMarieCombs.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

<p><i>Most photos that are found on the Internet are not publicity photos. Publicity photos found on the Internet typically have the following characteristics:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>They are found in a section of a web site called "media kit", "press kit", "press", or something similar</li>
<li>The images are available in high-resolution TIFF versions (upload the JPEG versions to Wikipedia though)</li>
<li>There is text on the site asking that the photographer be credited and/or there is licence text permitting reproduction for certain purposes (usually using them to sell products is prohibited).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Your case it means giving an exact location for the photo, also it has to be in a clearly marked: <i>section of a web site called "media kit", "press kit", "press"</i> -section. Unless You are able to provide that this photo is a copyright infringement and as such illeagaly in Wikipedia and has to be removed. If You want to remove the photo ad: {{db-author}} to the photos page. Sorry for the long rant.

<dd>OK, as I don't want to be the only judge on this case i'll put a {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusedisputed_0925.html" title="Template:Fairusedisputed">fairusedisputed</a>}} notice on the image page and we'll see what an admin says. The image looks like a promo photo, but without a source it is not possible to clarify that and as such should be deleted. N.B. why don't You try other sources for a better picture for the article, like f.ex. TV screenshots?

<p>Sorry to remove your category adds on the wildstorm Kherubim characters, however they were not immortal. The kherubim are just an alien race whose members have extremely long life spans, they however are not by any means immortal. They can both die by murder as well as eventual old age. It was commented in a few comics that they might be immortal or they were practically immortal, but these were in refrence to the short human lifespans of earth natives. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 04:20, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do believe kherubim can die of old age though, didnt some die in alan moore's run of wildcats? as well as majestic's father? if you wish to re add the categories go for it, however I just dont believe they truly fit under that category, I believe their race has just evolved to the point they can live thousands upon thousands of years, kinda like the idea of elves in many fantasy stories. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 04:33, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Due to the fair use policy of Wikipedia, which states:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The material should not be used in a manner that would likely replace the original market role of the original copyrighted media; our use of copyrighted material should not make it so that one no longer needs to purchase the actual product.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>it has been decided that images derived from "model sheet" images from the following sources:</p>

<dd>If you already knew this (which I did not by the way) then why go through the charade of "this may need to be edited" as opposed to "this image isn't allowable"? You should save a lot of user time by not beating around the bush. Delete the image if its necessary. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtemisboy_24da.html" title="User:Artemisboy">Artemisboy</a> 15:34, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../a/m/a/Image%7EAmazonVaria.jpg_8b8d.html" title="Image:AmazonVaria.jpg">Image:AmazonVaria.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Artemisboy_bb6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Artemisboy">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<li>Thanks for updating the image's source info. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">fair use</a> policy says that images of sports cards (or collector cards in this case) are only allowable under fair use if the image is used in talking about the card itself. Therefore this image would only be fair use in an article (or discussion in another article) about the Varia card or the Xena collector card series. I know this probably seems overprotective, but Wikipedia has been clamping down on potential copyright problems. I'm going to remove this image from the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varia_%28Xena%29_a9f0.html" title="Varia (Xena)">Varia (Xena)</a> article]], in keeping with that guideline. If you have any questions let me know. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>) 20:41, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Good question, and to be perfectly honest I'm not sure. It'd have to be more than just a sentence or two mentioning the existence of the card. If you look at the "Baseball card" section of the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honus_Wagner_4380.html" title="Honus Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> article, that is a perfect example of where fair use of a card applies.</p>
<p>It might be a better idea to try and get some more screen shots of these characters, like the one in <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furies_%28Xena%29_474a.html" title="Furies (Xena)">Furies (Xena)</a>. Just make sure to provide full information if you do (who uploaded it, who owns the copyright, etc.).

<p>I'm not sure about the description of Image:TribalTriquatra.jpg -- is it really a TV-show logo, or is it an emblem used by "neo-tribals" inspired by a TV-show logo?

<dd>Dude, I don't think that the tag on Image:TribalTriquatra.jpg is correct, and if you don't provide some further information about the source or context of this image, then in a few days I'm going to remove the tag from the image description page, whereupon it will be flagged as having no tag, and so put in the process for eventual deletion. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 07:44, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are correct about the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Kale_7a13.html" title="Jennifer Kale">Jennifer Kale</a> article. Most articles are expected to have references to where the original data comes from, otherwise it could be assumed to be non verifiable information you have written.

<p>I appreciate that you put a pic up there, but I might advise you get a better quality one.

I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>

<dd>A. Covers are always fair use. There is no licensing problem with a cover, ever.</dd>
<dd>B. I think that image is a good illustration of the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magik.html" title="Magik">Magik</a> character as "Darkchilde," as well as the art style of Bret Blevins. Even better, it's a cover, so doesn't need special licensing, as stated above. Until we find a better use for the picture, I have added the orphan to the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bret_Blevins_e2ba.html" title="Bret Blevins">Bret Blevins</a> page, as it's a good example of his distinctive style. It's not an absolutely ideal place for it, but it looks cool. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentifax_9bbd.html" title="User:Ventifax">Ventifax</a> 20:58, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
