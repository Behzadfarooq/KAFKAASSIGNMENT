<dd>That's my point — they're <b>not</b> notable books or articles.

<dd>"For great justice" is right that the stuff on Calton's desk isnot worthy of an article. But Calton does raise a legitimate point. Just because something is verifiable does not mean that it deserves an article in Wikipedia, as "For great justice" seems to suggest. Wikipedia policy makes that clear. HistoryBA 19:28, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are two definitions of verifiability here. The common 'folk' definition, of 'everything I can see', and the WP policy definition, which specifically excludes things like Calton's desk coffee maker. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is specific in pointing out that only things that are verified by credible sources are to be included. The 'my coffee maker' agrgument is bogus here because it is not verifiable in the WP policy sense of the word. For great justice. 20:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're missing my point. I am saying that verifiablity alone does not justify inclusion. There are all sorts facts that are verifiable by Wikipedia standards but do not get included in Wikipedia. Wikipedia policy makes it clear that verifiability is just one thresholds that information must clear before being included. It must also be significant. HistoryBA 20:43, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I disagree. 'Significance' is a terrible concept for an encyclopedia. Art history is significant to me, but not to others, local history is significant to historians, not to scientists. Nuclear physics is significant to some, not to others. Pop culture is signficant to students of pop culture, not to clasicists. That's why verifiability is the gold standard. For great justice. 21:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Rather than <i>significance</i>, how about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>? I don't think there can be much argument that Dilbert is notable; the question is if each individual compilation of strips is so notable, <i>on its own merits</i>, as to require an individual entry. Given the stubbiness of the articles in question, I'd hazard a guess that the answer at this point is no. Thus, my vote to merge 'em all into a list. If at some future date, someone discovers the Dilbert Code in one of them, then by all means spin it out into an article. Until then, the fragmentation of our knowledge of Dilbert compilations into twenty-three four-sentence-long pages doesn't serve anyone. <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> 22:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Notable' suffers from all the same fatal flaws as 'significance', but I agree that Dilbert should stay, because it is 'verifiable'. Merging to a list is perfectly sane, but does not need AFD permission. For great justice. 22:41, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I will gladly retract "significant" from my edit below, and substitute "notable." If "For great justice" disagrees, he/she should take up the matter on Wikipedia policy pages, not here. HistoryBA 23:09, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, third time lucky, you've found something that is, actually, part of Wikipedia policy, and is so vague that it could mean litterally anything. Thankfully, there's nothing indiscriminate about a cataloguing of books. The section you are reffering to (as you would know if you had read it) says nothing about books.

<li>Besides the fact that notability is not deletion policy, I don't know what you can possibly mean by that. Pokemon is verifiable, thoroughly referenced, extremely popular, can be written about neutrally etc. What is the difference between you saying that and me saying 'Mozart is not notable'? All you mean is 'I don't like Pokemon'. For great justice. 22:20, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>What is the difference between you saying that and me saying 'Mozart is not notable'?</i> Given the effect of Mozart on the world of music and culture -- and the world in general, I'd call that statement -- and I'm being charitable here -- utterly and objectively wrong. And given that notability is a requirement for GETTING an article in the first place, it's absurd to wikilawyer about their lack of explicit mention in deletion policy. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:00, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So what, apart from 'it's obvious', is the difference? It's the number of fans? The 'effect'? What 'effect?' I'd venture to argue that the number of Mozart fans is not an order of magnitude different to the number of Pokemon fans. Sure, Mozart was a dead white guy, and, as such, has a historical head start, but I'm not sure of your point. And pointing out that your assertion has no support in policy (you're wrong by the way that notability is a policy criteria for articles) is not 'wikilawyering'. For great justice. 17:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>W.A. Mozart was a <i>live</i> white guy when he performed the actions for which he is notable, and he was a <i>live</i> white guy when he first became notable by WP's standards. "Number of fans" of a topic is a measure only of shallow but broad notability. Another inclusion standard worth considering is whether there was a substantial and enduring influence on that field. Hundreds of reputable books cite Mozart as one of the most influential composers in the history of music. Pokemon merely entertained hundreds of millions of kids and led to a few imitators. Is each individual Dilbert collection noted in reliable sources for more than "being popular"? (By comparison, there are citations for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dilbert_Principle_8f14.html" title="The Dilbert Principle">The Dilbert Principle</a> being discussed by major magazines, and being required reading in university courses, as being an unusual source of influence on the business world.) 209.2.145.43 23:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I agree that Mozart was alive, and that he is verifiable, and that it is verifiable that he had a substantial impact on his field. It is also pretty obvious that Pokemon has had a substantial impact on its field. Hundreds of books cite Pokemon as one of the most influential phenomena in computer games and card trading games. Mozart, ultimately, 'merely entertained hundreds of millions' of people and led to a few imitators. It is simply a question of 'what I like'. You like Mozart, but not Pokemon. A lot of people share your point of view, while many do not. The mark of maturity however, is being able to differentiate 'what you like' from 'what should go into an encyclopedia. That's what 'verifiability' is for. For great justice. 23:52, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As far as I can tell, the argument for "keep" goes something like this: Dilbert is well-known, and having separate articles for each book doesn't hurt anything. But does it add anything to Wikipedia? Anything at all? I say it actually does hurt by contributing to Wikipedia's image as a collection of trivial information.

<li>It's not that we neccessarily think the articles enhance Wikipedia; it's more that we think the articles <i>could</i> enhance Wikipedia. Forcing them to be deleted removes that potential, and for what? They're verifiable and NPOV, and this is not a violation of WP:NOT, which are the only relevant policies. These are encyclopedic topics: they're books, some very popular, of a popular series, and people might be interested in learning more about them. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 11:30, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My question wasn't clear--my fault. How <b>could</b> the articles enhance Wikipedia? In theory, what sort of information still awaits addition? It seems to me the content of each article individually is marginal, but to collect them all in one place would allow readers to see how the series developed over time. I enjoy Dilbert, and that would be useful to me. Right now I would have to go to lots of almost-identical articles for that information. This is not a rhetorical question and I am not trying to cause trouble, I just feel that the "keep" people are seeing something I am missing. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestlin_04d4.html" title="User:Maestlin">Maestlin</a> 17:09, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know what specifically could be said, but I don't know that much about the books. I dunno, maybe a discussion of the running jokes in each book, or some of the longer-term plots that occur, or reaction from fans, may get them to a point where a list would be ungainly. Let me say that I personally would approve of merging them all into a single article, at least as they stand now, for exactly the reasons you say. However, I have a problem with voting "merge" on AfD unless it's a judgement that the topic doesn't deserve an article: otherwise, we should not be mandating it via process. AfD is a bad way to improve the quality of articles. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:19, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
