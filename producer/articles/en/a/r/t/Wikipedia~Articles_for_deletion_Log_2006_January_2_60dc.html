<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Sorry, but not notable enough. The information available at KLOV, MobyGames &amp; GameFAQs already trump this site. It doesn't matter how old the site is if it's a poorly developed concept. The size/scope of its list of games is duly noted, but the coverage of said games is nothing but flimsy and unsubstantial. Searching for Super Mario Bros. on the NES, just look at the spareness of the information in the <a href="http://www.uvlist.com/lista4.asp?sort=name&amp;fname=Super+Mario+Bros.&amp;fplat=5" class="external text" title="http://www.uvlist.com/lista4.asp?sort=name&amp;fname=Super+Mario+Bros.&amp;fplat=5" rel="nofollow">resulting games</a>. All 5 of those games barely have any information, and Super Mario Bros. 1, 2 &amp; 3 are arguably the most popular games listed in the database. No reason in my mind to keep this article as "notable". - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 22:49, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article appears well researched and deals with an important Filipino hip hop/rap group. Yes, it's absolutely correct that non-USA rap (or any non-English language rap for that matter) is not generally covered by All Music Guide, no matter its quality or importance to its local culture or subculture, all the more reason such groups be covered here. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 12:38, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Furthermore, these musicians are born and raised in California, what do you mean by non-USA rap group? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 12:50, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>An Internet search shows that the group is well known and performs widely in Filipino and Asian Pacific American cultural festivals, and that it is one of the more active and well regarded hip hop groups in the Filipino American hip hop subculture (probably the third most important hip hop subculture in the U.S. after African American and Puerto Rican American). Further, the group's work frequently appears in Filipino and Asian Pacific American print and radio media. Has also toured throughout the U.S. and Canada. From WP:Music:

<li><b>Keep</b> the article on the Native Guns should not be deleted on the grounds that they are a not only a staple in current Filipino-American hip-hop culture, but of independent (indie) hip-hop music and are also well known activists for human/Asian Pacific American rights. They are known within that community and yes while they are NOT on allmusic.com, so aren't Francis Magalona, or Andrew E. who's impact in the history of Philipppine-based Filipino hip-hop cannot be disputed. Neither are even "Asin" or Florante who are national stars and heroes and whos anti-Marcos songs such as "Upuan" and "Balita" played a big role in the inspiring the famous 1986 EDSA People's Power Revolution and also have had their songs along with Freddie Aguilar translated into more than 20 languages and have become hit songs in other countries other than the Philippines. What these artists meant to Philippine-based hip-hop and rock then is exactly what the Native Guns mean to the Filipino-American hip-hop community now. It should also be noted that the Native Guns' Kiwi, (born Jack DeJesus) went to high school with the world famous Black Eyed Peas' Apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda) as well as Will.i.am and was one of the influences young Allan had upon moving here from the Philippines. Furthermore the Native Guns have been featured in numerous magazine and newspaper articles, and were named one of L.A.'s "Top 10 Most Intriguing Bands" by the L.A. Alternative Press. Links:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Hey this is Kiwi of the Native Guns. i just found out about all this recently, so bear with me. anyway, as far as the article, yes there's some cut-n-paste, but whatever's written about us looks satisfactory. not sure how else to go about this. we're also mentioned in an article on wikipedia regarding filipino hip hop [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinoy_hip_hop" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinoy_hip_hop" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]. i can clean it up if need be, but for the most part, it's accurate. if you need me to add or clarify anything let me know groundworkmusic@yahoo.com. as far as whether or not we're 'worthy' of being on here well that's not my decision but i think the track record speaks for itself. sorry if i didn't follow the format, i never even heard of wikipedia until now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.131.4.166 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.131.4.166_a924.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.131.4.166">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Some people make bad-faith copyright violation nominations, in order to do an end run around the {afd} procedure. An article I started was on the receiving end of someone willing to take advantage of the three week long backlog in addressing copy-vios. So I checked this assertion. The copy-vio assertion is solid. I went back to the beginning of the article, to see whether rhe article could be saved by reeling back to an earlier version that was not a copy-vio. The very first contributor's version incorporated material from its external links.
<ul>
<li>This does not mean there should be no article about this band. If the original author of the material on the myspace web-pages that has been incorporated into this article releases it under an appropriate liscence, or puts their material in the public domain, the copy-vio concern goes away... -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 22:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>ADDENDUM</p>
<p>Since yesterday’s announcement some of the main points we made in it have already been confirmed! Thanks to the technical work of some administrators who showed that they function without any political agendas against us but instead attempted to find out the truth, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cardan_1994.html" title="Paul Cardan">Paul Cardan</a> (the disgruntled ex-member of the journal with a vendetta against us who was the main cause of the first AfD against Democracy &amp; Nature through his repeated vandalising attacks against it) and <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisposableAccount_42bc.html" title="User:DisposableAccount">User:DisposableAccount</a> (who proposed the deletion of the successor journal to D&amp;N and with the support of two (2) administrators managed to have it deleted), Llbb and Bbll (who persuaded other administrators to keep the page deleted) are all the same editor! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JWSchmidt#Inclusive_Democracy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JWSchmidt#Inclusive_Democracy" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Meanwhile, other administrators still doubt whether the present announcement is a genuine Editorial Board announcement.

<li>FWIW, I sort through 100-150 stubs per day. Of them, I rarely nominate more than one per day here - and after a few hundred stubs you can usually spot the ones which are or are not savable. So yes, I did think about what i was doing to nominate this. I far more frequently fix up things other people had nominated here. This one, though, looks like just a dictdef is all that it could be - and disctdefs belong in Wiktionary, not here.<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 10:53, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Being a substub article that can never be expanded, or being an outright dictionary article that cannot ever be other than a dictionary article, does. This article isn't a dictionary article, because it is an article about the concept of softness, not an article about the word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/softness" class="extiw" title="wikt:softness">softness</a>. But if you want to argue that it is a stub that <i>can</i> be expanded, <i>then demonstrate that</i>, exactly as I did at <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kindness.html" title="Kindness">kindness</a>.

<li>The demarcation of which you speak is entirely imaginary. Encyclopedic material is often the same as dictionary material. A compendium of information must include definitions.

<li><s><b>Speedy Delete</b></s>: From Googling, I suspect the article is mistitled. It is probably the <a href="http://www.nortonplaza.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.nortonplaza.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Norton Plaza Shopping Centre</a> which is on Norton Street and in Leichhardt. But, there is no way to know this. Given the lack of context and content, it arguebly qualifies as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-empty_b1c9.html" title="Template:Db-empty">db-empty</a>}}. The fact "plaza" was not capitalized may mean the editor just meant "the plaza in Leichhardt" and not "The Leichhardt Plaza". Rather then guesse, a speedy delete would be more appropriate. It's not like we'll be loosing information here. If an editor doesn't tell what an article is about, we shouldn't guesse, and waste time debating the signficance of an unknown entity. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:55, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are actually 3 shopping plazas in the suburb, and information on any of them could better be covered there. While not necessarily small, this one (Rob above is correct in deducing that this should actually be called the Norton Plaza Shopping Centre), is the smallest of the three. None of them are formally called "Leichhardt plaza"- the others are Leichhardt Markettown and The Forum- but since it is a noted shopping precinct the phrase could be left as a redirect to the suburb's article.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 04:55, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>These elements should be discused in the article. I believe it is possible for this to be included.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Essany is notable for having a successful cable talk show before he had graduated from college. It's not well discussed in the article but I'll look for references.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If written in a neutral tone, I see nothing wrong with starting your own autobiographical article, given that it meets our established criteria for notability and verifiability. Even <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> has tailored his own article on Wikipedia several times over.

<li><b>Comment</b> - These subjects are notable enough for a wikipedia article. These are major factions which have played a large part in the <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_Scrolls_da19.html" title="Elder Scrolls">Elder Scrolls</a> universe. We have articles for some of the races of the series, like <a href="../../../d/w/e/Dwemer.html" title="Dwemer">Dwemer</a>, so if these articles were of reasonable quality, I'd definitely vote keep. The Elder Scroll series of games have a very rich history, there are literally pages and pages of texts within the games, most of it is lore and background detail. One could build up a very comprehensive article on each of the guids mentioned here. It is a shame that these articles really aren't very good, but I really don't think they should have been lumped together in an AFD like this. I mean, the article on The Dark Brotherhood is actually coherent, and so is The Thieves Guild, however, the other three by User:Daedric Prince are not. So <b>Keep</b> those 2, and delete the rest. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Oh joy, yet another rant poorly disguised as the explanation of a non-notable neologism. Wikipedia is not a slang dictionary and all the supposed "facts" about what 'business sluts' are like are original research. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 05:53, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see no way to debate all these people in one nomination - this is not a bunch of related hoax articles, or vanity articles on a group of schoolfriends, but bios of academics who <i>may</i> each well have legitimate claims to notability. However, I would expect an experienced wikipedian such as <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> to do better in establishing the academic notability of these people. I added an external link to the webpage of Anderson, and he seems to have quite a few publications (and has been advisor to some notable TV shows). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 07:23, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep all</b>, for now. I prefer, for the time being, to <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume the good faith</a> of <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> (<a href="../../../z/a/n/User_talk%7EZanimum_c101.html" title="User talk:Zanimum">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zanimum_c396.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zanimum">contribs</a>), the experienced Wikipedia editor who has created these stubs, and should be given a chance to improve them. He hasn't edited since the 30th and I think it would have been a good idea to give him a chance to work more on these articles before nominating them (and definitely before speedying them, as was originally done). <i>I also strongly disagree with this group-nomination.</i> The nominator has not attempted to show that the notability of each of these individuals is in any way dependent on that of the others. They should be judged as individuals. I notice, for instance, that some of these have hits on Amazon, others do not. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 13:42, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree that these were not well served by being grouped, but understand why it was done. Who has assumed anything other than good faith, by the way? If someone removes a speedy tag, they aren't doing anything other than saying "I disagree." This is perfectly acceptable, as is bringing the article to AfD afterwards. As to articles needing to be "worked on," once they enter into main space they must stand on their own. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 14:42, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, forget the moratorium. The point is in any case not to get a moratorium "until some way can be worked out for things to be <i>kept</i>" (my italics). I'm not sure why you assume that. The point is to get a guideline reflecting the actual consensus of deletion discussions, which has been to keep in a large number of cases where the nominator has had nothing more to say than "nn professor". As should be obvious by now, WP:BIO doesn't say anything practically useful on the notability of academics.

<li>My superficial reading of your contribution amounted to the words "moratorium, kept". I do apologise for any slight I rendered. Yes, the guidelines <i>should</i> reflect the results of AfDs, although there is some dynamic tension between the micro-level discussions here and the macro-level ones on guideline talk pages.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Firstly, I can agree to 'weak keep' for Anderson - but the article should list just his notable achievements and not every boring academic publication. (I was mislead by the blanket AFD, my mistake). The others seem like great people, but so are 99% of the academics worldwide. Being on an advisory board of a brand such as Seasame Beginnings is not notable. Nor does "being involved with" things. Brands have lots of advisors, year after year. And academics are all on lots of panels and committees, and make lots of publications. I think the idea to discuss outside this AFD is wise. <a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 10:39, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If no one else, you <i>must</i> keep Dr. Anderson, I've found that he's nearly a legend among the children's television industry, for both program creators and advertisers. He's involved in the creation of the top three rated programs for 2-5 year olds (Diego, Dora, Blue's), and been involved in all-time classics (Sesame, Kangaroo). The others are still notable, though not as accomplished, relatively. This is a spin-off of one of the world's top 10 preschool brands, just the fact they were chosen to be on the board should make them notable. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a>

<li>Please put some work into improving these articles now. Tell us not only that someone is a PhD and on the faculty of a certain university, but exactly what position they have and how long they have had it. Dig up more on their publications and try to find reviews or citations that tell something about their influence on other people in their field. Are they members of editorial committees of important journals? Fellows of prestigious scientific societies? I'm voting keep for now, largely because it is a group nomination which doesn't really give any opportunity for a detailed discussion of each one of these persons, but I can easily see some of these being nominated for deletion again if they are kept this time. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 17:19, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, don't waste your time doing that. A real bibliography has to include the article titles - that's the important part. However, I suggest that you limit yourself to his books and the most important articles. Look for citations and reviews to see which those are. And I don't think you should redlink all the book titles. Most books are not in themselves important enough to write individual articles about.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Here's a free tip. You're probably hurting your band more by refusing to accept your band isn't notable enough for an article and bringing all this unwanted attention to your immaturity. Spend more time rehearsing perhaps. Who knows, all that practice might make us want to change our minds one day, and maybe, a fan might just pop an article in on your behalf, once you've earned it. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 02:46, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

Since the firm has now apparently decided to operate "loudly and in the light", they should continue to do so for a little longer before they warrant a Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 07:46, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Potentially, though I didn't find any citable sources for it. As for the obscurity concept, you're right about subjectivity, but on some level, all decisions are subjective.

<dd>Chief Wiggum: " Now, what I am about to show you next may shock and educate you. Hold onto your values as we step through the looking glass into a hippie pot party. [flicks a switch, lighting a mannequin with a joint crudely stuck to his mouth] While Johnny Welfare plays acid rock on a stolen guitar, his old lady has a better idea. [lights up another mannequin, of a woman opening wide to eat a baby sandwich. (That's a sandwich with a baby in it, not a really tiny sandwich.)

<dd><i>The author of the transcript comments:</i></dd>
<dd>"Not to trod on Haynes Lee's territory, but I think I spotted an urban legend when Chief Wiggum pointed out the "California Cheeseburger." According to legend, a couple leave their infant child in the care of a teen-aged babysitter and enjoy a night on the town. When they return, the obviously stoned babysitter reports that the baby is fine, and the turkey is in the oven. "What turkey?" the parents ask themselves - until the horrible truth about what's &lt;really&gt; cooking hits them..."</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem (from this writer's POV as I wrote MS up to FA status) is that that article serves as a dumping ground for criticisms of the company in a relatively NPOV matter.

Or the way the company balked at Gates's plan in 1987 to license the OS, even after he'd lined up some pretty big clients, again guaranteeing the Windows market would exist) compared to what you <i>could</i> say that if you have (as we should) a separate article devoted to criticisms of Microsoft, to have such a piddly small section devoted to criticisms of Apple smacks of POV on Wikipedia's part in and of itself regardless of how much those articles strive for NPOV (OK, before you ask I would write it myself but I'm not as expert on that as many more people are around here, and I have other fish to fry both on and offline at the moment). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 16:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>well, yes, a timekeeper is someone who keeps time, but different rules govern timekeepers in different occupations. This has faint potential to give some details of how a timekeeper in, say, basketball, differs from one in soccer; the history of the changeover from manual to automatic timekeeping in different industries and sports. Note also that there is a specific type of watch called a "timekeeper watch", which could easily become the subject of this article (see <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Timekeeper+watch%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Timekeeper+watch%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>).

<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b> They'll need to add the label to which they're signed [or claim to be], and Wiki does not need full sized pics nor logos, but apart from that it appears to be enough to stay.

<dd>Added our label to the page, as far as "local scene" it is important to our history to include where we came from, a great number of bands have come from our area including "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beach_Boys_6081.html" title="The Beach Boys">The Beach Boys</a>", and "<a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennywise.html" title="Pennywise">Pennywise</a>". The logo has been removed, but as far as the picture goes, I feel it is important to our site, plus I've seen it on a number of other band pages, ie <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atreyu.html" title="Atreyu">Atreyu</a>. Also we don't claim to have 3 albums, we state very clearly that we have one studio album, one compilation, and are featured on one dvd.

That's cool that you played with the Violent Femmes and Reel Big Fish, but there are alot of bands that have opened for alot of notable bands.

Felony Fights vol. 4 is being released in about a week, if BNRX doesn't count, then very shortly we are going to be featured on on of the XM radio stations.</p>
<p>Personally I just don't want to see my page go down, We've had it up for a little while, and we all really enjoy being part of the wiki community, and frankly we don't want to lose it. Honestly I don't think our page is hurting anyone, it's a valuable resourse for people to get more information about us if they choose to do so. I loved the idea of wiki when I first started to use it a long time ago, I wanted to share the information about my band for anyone who is interested. And isn't that the mission of wiki, to have an open encyclopedia where anyone can add information they believe to be relivent others? Wiki is very precious to us, so please let our page stay. - Chris Gabriels Fallen Fiend1138 02:53, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Fallen Angel Industries does not look very notable either, so if you want to nominate it for deletion, go ahead. However, it does look more notable, more established, and less promotional than Satan Sam. (Wikipedians frown heavily on using Wikipedia for advertising; see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.) Here is some more explanation why I think the Satan Sam article should be deleted. The SatanSam.co.uk website starts with "1. Blog 2. Real Site" -- that doesn't look professional. Your forums have on average 1 or 2 posts, the highest being 9 in the "off topic" forum, of the "Released games" forums only 1 forum even has any posts -- so this gives a strong impression of non-notability. Websites need Alexa rank 10,000 to be considered notable, and your website <i>is not even ranked</i>, meaning there are millions of websites more notable than yours. Also this article talks about <i>upcoming</i> games. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>; information must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>.

<dd>Huh? You're inferring something from my comments which I don't understand. My only point is simply to try to characterize the territory which this article refers to. The best I can do is to say that it was land that was not traditionally populated by Ukrainians, or simply underpopulated, until it was colonized by the Russian Empire (also, that such lands were not a unified territory, and weren't restricted to modern Ukrainian boundaries—i.e. not "East Ukraine"). I did not mean to imply that it was sparsely populated at any time since then. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-01-6&#160;15:54&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This ship has more notability than say the F, the H or the I as it was considered for use in the TNG TV series. The existence of the J in Enterprise clearly does show that this ship existed at some point in the star trek universe too.

<li><b>Delete</b> as fanon. This argument is an old one; the consensus is only canonical Enterprise vessels get their own articles. The -J gets one because it was featured in an episode. The fact it was considered for the TNG series doesn't justify an article; make it a trivia item either under the main Starship Enterprise article or TNG. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:01, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The Enterprise G should not be treated in the same way as the Enterprise I or H as the G apparently does have an importance as being originally seriously considered as the Enterprise to be used in TNG, where as the H and I have not been considered for use as far as any publicly available reference sources says. This alone makes the G much more notable than H or I and hence no comparison o deletion of the H and I should be made when considering the G. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 21:06, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, I was not aware of this group and didn't go thru all the variant spellings. My mistake. Even if I had been aware, I am still reluctant to have articles on every set of arrested protesters. From what I see, there were no overriding &amp;/or notable issues (e.g. constitutional issues), just some vandalism and a stand against the war. As bige1977 notes below, this happens many times a year. Would you "Keepers" feel the same if this were an anti-abortion group? I too think this war was a mistake, but that doesn't make the protest notable even with mention in the NYT. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 01:29, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>- I agree with ScienceApologist that it's apparently a POV fork. However, the <i>cause</i> of a POV fork is often insufficient accounting for that POV in the main article, and a quick look shows that the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a> article is lacking on a number of points, especially as the article he/she apparently refers to is titled "redshift" and not "cosmological redshift". I repeat here my earlier comments on the Talk page: this article certainly fills a gap (I learned something today thanks to it!) but to make it general and NPOV, it should be called "List of redshift mechanisms", and be linked from the redshift article, containing all notable past and current cosmological as well as non-cosmological redshift hypotheses. Such a page will be very useful as general reference, and free from any POV. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 18:59, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I, Ari Brynolfsson, find that Ian Tresman's article on ‘’’Intrinsic Redshift’’’ is good and very neutral. It does not advocate anything and reports the facts. The use by Ian Tresman of “Intrinsic Redshift” appears to me to be dictated by the fact that most of the processes he mentioned are more likely to work where the densities are high, that is, very close to stars, galaxies and quasars. Such redshifts are properly called intrinsic redshifts. Expanding the subject to “Alternative Redshift Theories” is reasonable, especially, when many people are mislead to believe that only expansion theory of the Universe with its many absurdities can explain the cosmological redshift. (My previous more extensive comments was deleted by somebody that apparently got the point. This is an abreviated version). Ari Brynolfsson, 15:20, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here's the situation. Tahirih is revered by two religious sects (<a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_Faith_be4d.html" title="Baha'i Faith">Baha'i Faith</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayani.html" title="Bayani">Bayani</a>) which basically hate each other. Starr is a former Baha'i from Australia, who gravitated to a number of New Age and esoteric interests. One of her contacts is Nima Hazini, an Iranian-Australian Baha'i-by-birth who converted to Bayanism, which he understands in light of various gnostic esoteric traditions. Hazini encouraged her to write a book on Tahirih, but was far from pleased with the finished work.</p>
<p>What to do with it? One good solution would be to give Starr her own entry, put all this there, and link from there to <a href="../../../t/a/h/Tahirih.html" title="Tahirih">Tahirih</a> and back. Another possibility would be to make an entry for their Bayanic Gnostic Society, or whatever Hazini's group is called. (Have to check.) This assuming that Starr and Hazini still wish to be associated with one another. 218.167.179.63 07:41, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. Something odd about this article. It reads like a little chunk copyvio'd from somewhere -- no hits on Google but could be from a book. Literate but inconsequential and context-free, like a fragment ripped from <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmares_%28quilombo%29.html" title="Palmares (quilombo)">Palmares (quilombo)</a>, Capitão do mato or Jürgens Reijmbach (should be Jürgens Reijmbach not "Jürgen" apparently). What little info is there certainly doesn't belong under that title, presumably the plural of his job title -- and just possibly a chapter heading in some book? <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 13:06, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the changes to the article made by <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">User:Nunh-huh</a> show, the theory is false.

<li><b>Keep</b> regardless of the ridiculously unlikely nature of the theory even on face value (it's something like four quadrillion to one against such a coincidence...unless we're to believe there's a secret succession committee running the elections), it is a REAL "myth". One might as well delete all the reference to Greek mythology, since nobody believes them any more.

<li>Big difference between registering and fielding candidates. Even bigger difference fielding candidates who actually win. Parties rise and fall all the time.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that [1] no proper article on the King of <s>Gat</s>Gerar exists and d "references" IMO don't include a single reliable source. Look at this: <i>The Unauthorized Version</i>[2] texts were deleted or moved. I may very well be mistaken. Perhaps others can look this up in the history of the article <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimelech.html" title="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> and elsewhere. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 20:55, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with discussing it under <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimelech.html" title="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> is twofold. Firstly, there are other quite distinct biblical individuals named Abimelech. The second is that discussing it under Abimelech creates a problem with discussing the Genesis 12 version between Abraham and Pharaoh. B.t.w. what is Gat? Do you mean Gerar?
<ul>
<li>Is there a source that linked Sarah into the story. And yes, I did confuse between Gat and Gerar. Back to Sunday School&#160;:-) That leaves open the question of the texts that "disappeared". <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 21:18, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes. It's called the Bible. Sarah is Abraham's wife. See Genesis 20-21 for the Abraham/Abimelech version of the story which explicitely mentions Sarah. --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User_talk%7EFDuffy_2e93.html" title="User talk:FDuffy">User talk:FDuffy</a> 21:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am looking for sources that tie all three cases together (not only the later two which you keep returning to) under one clear theme, other than the article you created or the separate inclusions in Genesis.

<li><b>Keep with heavy modifications</b> I currently feel that the article is framed in a very POV manner. I nonetheless think it should exist, under this name or another. The common thread of the three stories is undeniable, and thus I am sure has responses in many fields; currently only the documentary hypothesis is present without any heading indicating that this interpretation is the one to be unfolded presently. I am sure you could find some sociological/anthropological understanding of the phenomenon of wives and sisters, or at least some understanding given by Rabbinic or Christian scholars. I don't believe the article as it is is original research but it is currently POV and also needs to cite sources for individual facts if it wants to retain integrity.<br />

<li>Find better name, if possible</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This example is classic documentary hypothesis stuff, as anyone in the field of Bible knows. One may agree with the analysis or not (the field of biblical poetics, for instance, shows that classic source criticism fails to account for many important aspects of Genesis, including in this example), but I fail to see why anyone calls it original research. It is standard stuff, and has been since the 19th century. I think some of the objectors would prefer not to see the basic articles on biblical topics cluttered or even overwhelmed with source-criticism, and on this I happen to agree with them. I don't think that would be appropriate at all. But the way to achieve that is not by deleting source-critical articles and removing real information from Wikipedia, but rather by expanding on source-critical aspects in articles devoted to them (like this one). The weaknesses of source-criticism and alternative approaches can be discussed in such articles as well. More broadly, if others would like to discuss this issue beyond its relevance to this article, I would be happy to so.<a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 07:07, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This ended up here because normal contributors can't see the content of previously deleted articles, and this specific article title was deleted just yesterday, and a NEW article created with the same name today. So without any way to see whether it was the same content it was speedied, and someone from the speedy deletion section instead switched it to AFD instead of closing the nomination due to it not being a recreation of the previous article. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 22:33, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry for all the confusion. I actually saw the previous speedy and when I saw all the Google hits for the frontiersman, I thought, "Why not? He seems encyclopedic." I'm not sure if my vote is necessary anymore, but here it is. I created the article under discussion using the cited sources. If you look at the first one, which lists books of frontiermen, pioneers, etc., you will find one explicitly lists Jesse Hughes in the title, and several have him as one of several described. So he certainly is not as notable as <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Boone_e1f1.html" title="Daniel Boone">Daniel Boone</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davy_Crockett_bf0f.html" title="Davy Crockett">Davy Crockett</a>, or even <a href="../../../j/a/m/James__Grizzly__Adams_1539.html" title="James &quot;Grizzly&quot; Adams">Grizzly Adams</a> (perhaps), but still notable enough for inclusion, in my opinion.

<li>The main problem is that tagging an article after one minute or five minutes shuts down editing. It is not the best approach when the topic is or could be valid. A message could just as easily be left on the article or user talk page. I once got a warning from an admin for speedy tagging an article on a game forum after 24 minutes. The general rule is to allow editors 30 minutes for editing before tagging. Frankly, I am far more concerned about biting newbies than biting noms. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:55, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've never seen a general rule as to how long you have to wait to tag anything, whether it's as a Speedy or as an AfD. If something's tagged as an AfD, either the article will come out in the wash (especially with a wait of a week) or it'll be deleted (again after a week). Only stuff that meets <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> gets deleted before that, and this article isn't a candidate for it. In my own opinion it's silly to AfD schools of any sort because of the cabal of editors that get up in arms about including all schools, but this school is clearly notable in its own right <i>after doing external research</i>.

<p>Article contains <b>no</b> factual arguments, rather is literally full of selective quotes. Cited single POV arguments are based on the biased and innacurate assumption that Fascists had their own economic ideology distinct from both "capitalism" and "socialism and communism." This assumption is used like a straw man to attack the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> and government intervention as "fascist." Article does not address correlations between Fascist economic policies, it is simply a tool for ideological smearing.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Wikipedia definitely needs an article on the economic policies that existed in fascism (an article distinct from generalized <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>). The article is well sourced and NPOV. The article doesn't assert anything, but presents sourced assertions. Note that even the father of fascism, Mussolini, said that the economic system was distinct from capitalism and communism. The New Deal section must be in there because it's a notable view; it's been attacked since its inception as being modeled on fascist economics (if it seems like a large section, it's only because the rest of the article still awaits further development). I think the article, now in its infancy, has a great future. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:01, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I do not believe there is such a thing as "fascism" (in the sense of a distinct political or economic system, or even a coherent ideology). Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany did not have a unique political or economic system - they were just your average nationalist dictatorships. The fact that Hitler happened to kill more people than your average dictator doesn't change anything. And fascist ideology was never clear and coherent, not even to the fascists themselves. But this is off-topic... The point is not what <b>I</b> think, the point is what the majority of people think and the stigma they associate with fascism. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos (f.k.a.

<li><b>Keep subject to cleanup</b>. There is scope for useful discussion on Wikipedia of the nature of economics under fascism.

However, in its current form the article isn't terribly helpful as a discussion of the topic. There's some confusion with the previous name of this article, "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>", which appears to be a term and theory of the relationship between fascism and economics specific to certain theorists. Presented as such, properly sourced, this is not a problem - the difficulty is if this theory dominates the article. One solution would be to give it a separate article (<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>), which could be devoted to describing that theory and its development. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 01:09, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>:I think you're misguided on that. "Economic fascism" is just another way of saying "fascist economics." You see a few libertarians using the term "economic fascism" in their articles and it's throwing you off (note that socialists also use the term). It's a commnon phrasing, as in "economic individualism," "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_nationalism.html" title="Economic nationalism">economic nationalism</a>," and a term that is not used much anymore "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22economic+socialism%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22economic+socialism%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">economic socialism</a>." There is no need for a seperate article. Everyone is talking about the same thing ...the economic practices in fascism. Also, it certainly does need a seperate article from <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporativism.html" title="Corporativism">corporativism</a>, as there is more to the economics of fascism than corporativism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 01:23, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I cannot agree that <i>"Economic fascism" is just another way of saying "fascist economics."</i>. Look at the people who mostly use the former term: it's primarily designed to allow "fascism" to be used to describe economic policy in democratic states, by driving a notional wedge between fascism and the political sphere (which contradicts the essence of fascism, which is political). There's also the linguistic issue: economic fascism is no more the same as fascist economics than lemon coke is the same as a coke lemon. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 11:57, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The topic is definitely notable, and the article is well-written and well-sourced. It's true that it's a subtopic of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>, but it's a common, accepted practice to give lengthy discussions of subtopics their own articles, and I think there's enough material here to justify it being in a separate article. However, I do think it needs to address more of the "other side" that argues the New Deal is distinct from fascism. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, the article doesn't even tell you why the New Deal is "fascist!" That section, like the rest of the article is simply a collaberation of quotes agreeing with the authors premise (that fascism is the distinct area between socialism and capitalism)! I would be fine with this article if it was what the name suggested, a discription of common fascist economic policies.

<li>I've seen British universities from the inside, and the Student Union at <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanuel_College_6dd2.html" title="Emmanuel College">Emmanuel College</a> is in no way different from any other <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Union_5939.html" title="Student Union">Student Union</a> in the UK. In fact that's what the article tells us - it manages the weekly bar and is the had organization of the sports and social clubs at that college. If they can't do better and have no other claim to notability than that they exist and do nothign different from the student unions at the other 30 colleges of the University of Cambridge or the student unions at the over 100 universities in Britain the entry ought to go. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 22:26, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm happy for you <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a>, but I've seen British universities from the outside and they mostly look like a bunch of old buildings to me. I find it heartwarming that Cambridge can still muster a few devoted students willing to give their time for the benefit of the other young scholars. That deserves recognition, particularly as the main thing Wikipedia tells me is that <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanuel_College%2C_Cambridge_7ff0.html" title="Emmanuel College, Cambridge">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a> is "<i>noted as the home of a wide variety of duck species</i>".

<li>Interesting. However, ECSU is a small union that represents just one college out of the twenty-odd colleges in the University of Cambridge -- <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_University_Students%27_Union_fa9f.html" title="Cambridge University Students' Union">CUSU</a> is the overall student union for the university. All of the unions on those category pages represent entire institutions. While I agree that the existence of that page invalidates some of the arguments in this discussion, I still think that the sheer size of ECSU and its relative unimportance compared to a full-sized student union mean that it doesn't merit a separate article. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrismear_266d.html" title="User:Chrismear">chrismear</a> 12:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Part of me tends towards wikify, but my main instinct is <b>delete</b>. To be honest, this whole page reads like a giant commercial. I don't really think that it belongs here, especially considering that the editor's sole contributions to Wikipedia have been to big up Aten. Maybe that's because of my line of thought that making KVM switches, as important as that may be, isn't exactly something that I would call contributing to public consciousness.<a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">iinag</a> 22:51, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please <b>help</b> me understand then the difference between the way this article reads and the way the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belkin.html" title="Belkin">Belkin</a> article reads?--Aten 00:25, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Although the article is a bit better due to your modifications, the language used in it does have a few fundamental difference to the Belkin article still. First of all, all of the facts in the Belkin article have points of verification. Secondly, the Belkin article gives the reader a far more balanced view, whereas the Aten article is written very commercially, as though you wanted to hawk these products. If you could change that, and verify your facts, then I guess that I would drop my objections to the piece. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">iinag</a>, 11:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
