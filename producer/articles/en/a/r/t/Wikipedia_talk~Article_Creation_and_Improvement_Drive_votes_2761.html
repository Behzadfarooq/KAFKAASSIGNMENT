<p>There would be two articles worked on together each week, instead of one.

<li>Don't forget that doing 2 a week ultimately contributed to the decline of COTW. The same will happen here. 2 cannot be sustained. To "unclog" AID, simply raise the threshold to 4 votes per week, or maybe 7 votes per fortnight to be less harsh. - <a href="../../../j/u/p/User%7EJuppiter_0c89.html" title="User:Juppiter">Juppiter</a> 06:38, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What decline? COTW has occasionally been doing 2 a week and is doing well. Are you talking about something that happened a long time ago? In any case, it may just be a question of competition. If every collaboration did 2 a week, there'd likely be no problem. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> <sub><span style="text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contrib</a></span></sub> <sup><span style="position: relative; left: -36px; margin-right: -36px; text-decoration:none;"><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a></span></sup> 14:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>COTW officially switched to two a week in Summer 2005. It quickly proved untenable and COTW went back to one a week. After this stunt failed, COTW has suffered such apathy that it will soon probably have to shut down. <a href="../../../j/u/p/User%7EJuppiter_0c89.html" title="User:Juppiter">Juppiter</a> 00:44, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but you forget that the AID started with this idea (among a wholly different set of rules than the ones its uses now). It diddn't work very well then because there were so few people. There are now so many that I think widening the bottleneck can only help. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 15:51, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oppose. I agree with increasing the threshold though. Perhaps there should be some indication of those who are just voting and those who are willing to help edit. In the latter situation, they could gather independently from AID and improve the article instead of waiting months for their article to be selected. <a href="../../../g/f/l/User%7EGflores_bda8.html" title="User:Gflores">Gflores</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/f/l/User_talk%7EGflores_1e9f.html" title="User talk:Gflores">Talk</a></sup> 06:17, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If we don't adopt either one of the other proposals, I propose that we impose a moratorium on new nominations for a while.

<dd>We shall lift the number of votes required.

<dd><b>Starting with articles nominated in August, at least four votes will be needed each week to stay active on the list of nominations.</b></dd>
<dd>That shows that old maintenance crew planed on lifting the number of votes. AND except for the fact we have 12:6 in favour for lifting the vote barrier, all of people who <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_Improvement_Drive_Maintenance_3d04.html" title="Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive/Maintenance">do the dirty work</a> voted for the proposal.

<li>I'm striking my vote. I just did the rollover for this week, and I can see that nobody edited these articles.

<li>I used to do the rollover, but I now refuse to do it for same reasons - to much job to do. But I think that even if we fix that problem (by means of a bot or deciding not to post noitces), I'd like to return to only one AID as having two aids is splitting of attention and is not good. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 19:24, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Same here, the pasting alone takes up too much time and effort, plus, as I mentioned before, it isn't much use. After all, if the person that voted for the AID is active, they will check the AID sooner or later. Otherwise, its wasted effort. It wastes a valueable 10-20 min that can be spent on another part of wikipedia. As well, there is something that just isn't attracting people to participate anymore. There is no longer that push that had driven the AID for so long. Reducing the AID back to 1 article a day would be a good first step back to gaining attention. As well, I noticed that the AID section is further down on the community portal page.... could that be a cause too? It takes a while to find. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 00:39, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>2 articles/week was an innocent opinion but unfortunately it didn't work at least for last AID. Maybe we can try for one more week, but my vote is "return to one" for now.

<li>There is a template that people put on the talk pages of articles while they're being considered for AID.

<li>Oh, that. I see what you are trying to do. The thing is, does it really matter that much? After all, there is a contents on the page for fast access right?

<li>Well, no, it's not that big a deal. It's just that broken things cry out to me for fixing, why have broken links when we could have functional links? But I'm not prepared to redesign the bot and the page, so I guess it'll stay the way it is.

<li>We do not allow IP users to vote due to the fact that we have no way of making sure one user doesn't vote on one nomination multiple times. However, currently, we have nothing down in writing about newbie users. This allow people to create multiple accounts for the purpose of voting on one nomination multiple times, giving that nomination an unfair advantage. In my opinion, we should require users to have at least 1 contribution on another part of Wikipedia before they are allowed to vote in the AID. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 21:25, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since I support this, I figure I might say something brief. I think a user with no other contributions (and I mean NO other contributes; someone with two or three article edits under his/her belt is fine with me) is a bad idea. It's just too suspicious.

<li>One of the first places I found on Wikipedia was the AID, and I was attracted to it because I didn't have to edit an article itself; I had everyone else who voted on it to help me. But yes, I agree that any accounts without edits should not be voted, and that accounts with, let's say, at least 5 edits can vote. <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b>(^'-')^</b></i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovington_6d97.html" title="User:Covington">Covington</a> 02:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point. I'm sure that we can have a template to show a link to the vote count like the user2 template, but this one would have a datestamp. And maybe we can have a bot scan the users? I'm sure that if we choose to support this, we can find a way to make it work. <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b>(^'-')^</b></i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovington_6d97.html" title="User:Covington">Covington</a> 02:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was actually thinking about this myself the other day. Signing up on Wikipedia is quick and easy, way too quick and easy for those that want to simply manipulate votes. If a user that has previously not paid any attention to an article votes, then their contributions should be checked to make sure they are not simply boosting numbers. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 03:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I support in principle, but I also think we can handle this on a case by case basis. <b>IF</b> an article gets a lot of votes by users with few contributions we can take action, if necessary. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 08:55, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see the rationale for the proposal -- but I'm uncertain whether I support its current parameters. Perhaps we should treat a registered user who has submitted several votes, especially over time, but who has not made other contributions, differently from a registered user who has only submitted a single vote. (I feel that the one-vote user is more likely a fake account than the multiple-vote user -- though I wouldn't be surprised if someone provides evidence to refute this view.) Also, should we count a comment as a contribution other than voting, so that a single-vote user that submits a comment would not be subject to deletion of the vote? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 14:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure about the idea that they have a contribution in a comment, I have no strong opinions about that. However, here is the thing. What if the a person was too lazy to create a new account for every single vote he or she wants to double? Wouldn't they just make one account and use that? Besides, because they had no other contributions to the Wiki in the first place, they should not have been allowed to vote that first vote either ways, right? --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 14:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We can fix a ratio (e.g. 15-20) between contribution to main space/wiki space (not associated with any kind of nomination vote) and voting for article improvement drive. But it would create an extra work for maintenance contributor. I am unable to seek any other feasible maintenace work, if you have some other sugestions for fixing a criteria, please suggest. <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 19:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Does it have to be this complicated though? I mean, couldn't we just say, anyone that has less then __ contributions, may not vote? (Setting it at 3 contributions seems to be a reasonable amount, since we have to keep in mind of the newbies.) --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 20:32, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is little bit complicate. But according to your suggestions, after only 3 or such contributions an user is free to vote for AID as many times (s)he wants. We want to fix a criteria for avoiding such condition. An user can create one or more additional accounts in advance and when (s)he can vote accordingly when the user feels to vote. If we fix this type of criteria, what I mentioned earlier (s)he has to contribute before polling here. I think 3 is very less number for it. An user has to have little bit knowledge about editing articles here. We can fix the ratio equal to 10 which has total contribution in numerator. <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 20:52, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What you are saying is very detailed, however, if you say that for every vote a user puts forth, they must contribute to ten things. This means, one must then have at least 1000 edits under the belt before that person can vote 100 times. At the current number of nominations that gets churned up each week, 100 votes can easily be made withing 2-3 months, forcing the user to make an astounding number of contributions. As well, I believe that this discussion has completely veered off topic, in the sense that this vote is for a general agreement on whether there is such thing as an unqualified registered user. Should the detail of the qualification be on the judgment of whoever is maintaining the project that that time? Remembering that when a user is removed from a vote, he or she is placed under the <b>Removed Votes</b> section, and so if there is a disagreement for that paticular case, then people argue about it at that point in time, for this is more of a case by case problem. Certain users might make a big edit, while another user might make 10 small edits to achieve the same result.

<dd>1) Yes I am biased against this; according to this rule, I'm not even eligible to vote more than three times. But bias aside, having a very strict vote requirements means that less people will be able to participate in the AiD.</dd>
<dd>2) As a <s>n00b</s> beginner Wikipedian (I just completed my first month here.), I was drawn to the AID because it gave me a chance to improve an article without having it to do it all alone; I had the other thirty voters to help me do that. I know I might be in the minority, but on the contrary I believe that the AID should be one of the first places a new Wikipedian should visit; they do not necessarily have to vote (and I suggest that they don't until they make two or three edits first), but they should have this opportunity to familiarize themselves with Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>3) Some Wikipedians are more "readers" than "editors"; they use the Wikipedia too, and they should have a say on which articles they want improved.</dd>
<dd>4) We don't want to make it seem that the AID is controlled only by the Wikipedian "elite".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In short, while the voting requirements are a good idea, we should stick with votecounts between, say 3-10. This would let new users contribute, and if sockpuppets want to vote, they'll look suspicious anyway once we look at their contribs. If any of us feels suspicious about an individual user, we can deal with it on a case-by-case basis. <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b>(^'-')^</b></i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovington_6d97.html" title="User:Covington">Covington</a> 23:56, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>After mulling over this discussion, I believe that the rule should be something like: "A registered user may submit his or her initial vote on the Article Improvement Drive only if (1) the user has made at least one edit/post on Wikipedia other than voting or (2) the user submits a comment in conjunction with the vote." This would be a clear rule (without any need to resort to vote counts or ratios), which would allow new users to submit votes, but only if they do something other than mere voting. Accordingly, I oppose the proposal as currently written.--<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 23:06, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wait, aren't you supporting my vote then?

<ul>
<li>Why the "Er..."? ("Er..." seems to imply that I have missed something quite obvious, which I believe I didn't. Or does "Er..." mean something else? You used it earlier, apparently towards yourself, so perhaps I don't understand what you mean.) I suggested new wording at the start of this thread: "A registered user may submit his or her initial vote on the Article Improvement Drive only if (1) the user has made at least one edit/post on Wikipedia other than voting or (2) the user submits a comment in conjunction with the vote." I'd be happy to hear constructive suggestions about it. I'd also be happy to make it the subject of Vote #8, if Vote #7 is ultimately inconclusive. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 02:11, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here is why I used "er...". I believe that the two proposals say the exact same thing except for one small part. What my current proposal states is it anyone with only <b>votes</b> as contributions should not be allowed to vote. What your proposal states is that anyone with any other kinds of contributions, including a vote with a comment is allowed to vote. However, your proposal stills agrees with my proposal that anyone with <b>no other contributions besides votes</b> should not be allowed to vote. Remember that the details are not discussed in this vote, for its more of a case-by-case basis. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 20:28, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe that the current proposal is not clear, while my suggested wording is clear. I don't think that the rule should be interpreted on a case-by-case basis. I think, rather, the rule should draw a clear line between who may vote and who may not. Therefore, I do not support the current proposal, unless the proposal as implemented on the project page includes wording that is substantively the same as my suggestion. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 06:16, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

At this point, the only voter qualification is to be "a registered user." Moreover, since some newbies gravitate immediately to AID, I don't think we can simply presume that a new account is a sock puppet.

<p>Perhaps a rule that articles may only be reelected after three months from their last nomination. This way, articles can get a second chance of being worked on (by possibly a different set of people), and there won't be the same articles every week (and therefore room for more articles in the AID). <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b>(^'-')^</b></i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovington_6d97.html" title="User:Covington">Covington</a> 04:38, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the 'incumbent' idea better. My suggestion: if an article gets five additional votes in its week as AID, it can be the article for another week. If it gets ten additional votes during that week, it can go on to the week after that. Then 20, 40, 80, etc. That way an article could get renewed once or twice if people really liked it, but there would be no chance of it becoming a permanent autocrat. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 12:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I would say, instead of 5 additional votes, candidate should have 8 additional vote at the time of current AID. We should limit the number of votes for a particular user at a time. Means, a voter can vote only three articles in the list at a time. <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 19:08, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>After three-six months, we allow it to become re-nominated, IF someone wants to renominate it. Its not a must, but its allowed. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 19:11, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Good ideas; I volunteer to split the difference. How about, after six months, an article can be renominated with eight (or whatever number you like) votes, to automatically overtake the leader. If there are more than one renoms, the one with the highest amount of support wins. As for the limit-three-votes idea, I think that should be a totally different vote. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 23:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I see. You mean it would say something like "This previous winner had X votes," and any additional votes for its re-nom would count toward its overall scoring. So a previous winner that won with 25 could only beat a fresh contender with 32 if the old nom got 8 votes, by 8 new voters. Is that what you mean? -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 00:12, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think, if we make a seperate subpage for succesful nominations which mentions at the end of removal "how many additional vote the nomination had". When it would be renominated in future, it can be considered as additional votes in the nomination and we can start fresh voting after adding those numbers. <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 04:09, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I do mean this. After frsh renomination, which contains only additional votes (minimum 8 votes), which should be renominated after an interval of minimum 3 months, anybody would simply eligible to vote. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyam_Bihari_9010.html" title="User:Shyam Bihari"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/y/User_talk%7EShyam_Bihari_b27a.html" title="User talk:Shyam Bihari"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shyam_Bihari_1d48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shyam Bihari"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 12:49, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, as long as everyone can vote twice. Let me make sure I have the rules right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any previous AID or TWID article can be renominated, as long as it's been three months between the original candidacy and the renom;</li>
<li>You can vote again on the remon, even if you voted for the article the first time around;</li>
<li>I still don't get the "minimum 8 votes" bit; can we streamline that?</li>

<p>Are any new process or rules really needed? Can't we just renominate any article after a reasonable wait? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 04:26, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Welcome back. The purpose here is to give old articles an <i>edge</i> in renomination. There's a consensus for that; we're just not sure how we want to go at it. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 23:07, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wait a minute? we're voting to give old nominations an edge? Is that what you're trying to do? Sorry, I must have misunderstood then. In this case, I'm opposed. I would rather agree to the idea of renominating after a reasonable wait. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 00:42, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What you support is what you oppose: renominating after a reasonable wait <i>and</i> counting the earlier votes. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 01:16, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I mentioned minimum 8 additional votes because when an article gets selected it would be having 3 or 4 additional votes generally so we can atleast escape these 3-4 votes while it would be renominated. It can simply be started from 0 vote. If majority wants to escape this point then we can. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyam_Bihari_9010.html" title="User:Shyam Bihari"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/y/User_talk%7EShyam_Bihari_b27a.html" title="User talk:Shyam Bihari"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shyam_Bihari_1d48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shyam Bihari"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 06:11, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
