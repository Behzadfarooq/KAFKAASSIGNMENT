Aspden's fringe ideas, which make up the bulk of this article, are not even known, let alone recognized as "expert" by independent sources. For non-experts reading this AfD, it's important to note that many of the claims made in the article (<i>e.g.</i>, that he has debunked Einstein or is being oppressed by the mainstream scientific establishment) are simply silly. The "groundbreaking" ideas focused on by the article that make an implicit claim to notability appear to all be self-published on his webpage. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 00:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Indeed. It may be churlish of me to point it out, but the experimental results do, in fact, falsify his theory; but that's not really relevant to his notability. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 02:20, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Simply producing an incorrect prediction for the fine structure constant does not seem to be a sufficient criteria for notability -- there are thousands upon thousands of scientists who have worked on this problem. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 02:25, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yet another attempt at removal of interesting content, and the article was just brought to attention, today, on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Electric_universe_%28concept%29_d839.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)">vote page</a> for deletion of another article.

<li>Can you give the criteria you are using to establish the subject's notability? <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 02:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Whilst the criteria for academics may be a proposal, our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> are not, and have been in regular use for many years. Similarly, our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy is not a proposal, either. Please explain how this person satisfies our criteria for the inclusion of biographies, and how xyr theories are not original research. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are no agendas nor rules to remove content which may be interesting, just that where the subject is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">not notable</a>. Just being interesting is not reason to retain an article. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 23:57, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed you point out actual criteria which are not proposals. However, the first argument made for removal was based on proposals, along with <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a>, which are being contributed to from the nom and SA. What usually happens is that a not-so-valid reason is first given simply to get the ball rolling, and with time actual criteria are then accumulated. I will not waste my time explaining how the article satisfies actual criteria, because it is likely that either 1) even if it does, I wouldn't be able to convince anyone and my vote is one keep out of many deletes 2) it doesn't satisfy the actual criteria. My initial point remains valid, deletion of an article should not be based solely on proposed criteria, especially when the people who are defining the proposed criteria are the same ones attempting to delete the article. Now that actual criteria have been stated, I will remain silent if success is achieved, however I will not retract my Keep vote, as it still stands that the article was initially attacked without solid warrant. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 00:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a holistic thinker, my personal notability criteria is far more lax than those of Wikipedia, and as such you would likely find any arguments I make concerning notability to be inapplicable here. As a Wikipedian, my contributions are bound by guidelines put forth by the founders and community, whether or not I agree with them from a scientific standpoint, and as such I have always stayed just within the boundaries of Wiki and cited my work as per the older guidelines. Indeed I do think that most, not all, topics concerning physics, whether mainstream or not, deserve mention. Many years ago on Wikipedia, I was under the impression that it is for the reader to decide what is noteworthy, that was the whole point of writing articles with NPOV intent. However it appears that over the years notability has been incorporated further into Wikipedia guidelines than it was in the past, and the recent Pseudoscience arbcom case and its subsequent outcomes demonstrate this. Wikipedia has changed over the years, notability has become far more strict, as evidenced by the current proposals being put forth to further restrict content to only orthodox views. In my opinion, it has gone too far, but that is just my opinion, hence not noteworthy per the standards.-<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 03:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate that comment. But given the precedents and recent and past happenings here on Wikipedia, I very much feel that my attempts to affect notability standards would be a personal waste of time. However I am still considering at least giving my opinion on the matter at the associated discussion page concerning the newest proposed guidelines, and will perhaps do so soon. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 22:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not the deceiver or the lier here! All I have stated above was in good faith and the best accurate to my knowledge: Dr. Aspden published about <b>145 papers</b> (not including books and patents) distributed through some of the most notable peer-review journals and in alternative non-mainstream journals (see <a href="http://www.aspden.org/papers/bib/refs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aspden.org/papers/bib/refs.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)! In spite of all current technology and the intellectual advancement of the last century, You are doing here exactly what the middle ages dogmatic Church did toward the forefathers of Science (except the [physical] death penalty, that would be improper of our advanced society...).

<dd>Of course Wikipedia editors won't kill him - but he should <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anti-relativity_af68.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anti-relativity">watch out for particle physicists</a>. On a more serious note, the Pseudoscience ArbCom decision precludes the use of "alternative non-mainstream journals" as sources for scientific topics. Also, I would recommend for your sake that you not make the stereotypical crackpot arguments like comparing us to the church in the middle ages. We've heard most of them before, many of them more creative than yours, and they will just make editors lose respect for you and view all of your arguments with distrust.</dd>

<li><b>rewrite from a NPOV</b>This is one of the most difficult cases in pseudoscience--when a scientist with definite conventional credentials in a subject adopts what would generally be considered highly unusual views. The "definite credentials" refers not only to his degrees, but to the journals where some of the work as been published, which are as reliable sources as can be imagined. But there are no references to the acceptance of the theory by any other scientist. The article with the greatest number of citations as shown in Web of Science is no.3, to which there are 23 citations. However 21 of those 23 are in later papers by Apsden himself, which is fairly clear evidence that nobody else thinks him worth citing, even to refute.
<p>In any case, the article as it stands is also wholly unacceptable. It assumes the truth of his theories, and--while admitting there are criticisms--goes on in a manner as if here were none. I think a NPOV article could be written, but he and his supporters would find it highly unsatisfactory, for the plain honest presentation of the material shows it not accepted. The edit history reveals that his supporters have resisted any critical comments. I can see no basis we can refuse to include an article. However I do not see how one could be written. I certainly would not attempt to do so against the expected reverts. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:29, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you can "see no basis we can refuse to include an article" on a theory that you yourself state has "no references to the acceptance of the theory by any other scientist" and that hasn't been addressed (even to refute it) by anyone, then I suggest that you refresh your memory of our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy.
