<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. While "Unicerosaurus" is an invalid dinosaur, the name <i>does</i> appear frequently on various lists of dinosaurs. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7EComplete_bollocks_3a83.html" title="Wikipedia:Complete bollocks">Wikipedia:Complete bollocks</a> does <i>not</i> apply, as this information is verifiable. Didn't anyone even check the reference which is listed!? Here are some professional paleontological sites, examples where this dinosaur genera is listed:<a href="http://members.aol.com/Dinogeorge/dinolist.html" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/Dinogeorge/dinolist.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/genera.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/genera.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://users.tellurian.com/rmarguls/d-genera.html" class="external text" title="http://users.tellurian.com/rmarguls/d-genera.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, more can be listed if needed. Please don't nominate an article for deletion when the material can be verified by clicking a simple link already <i>in</i> the article. Also, I'll note deleting this article would leave a red link on Wikipedia's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dinosaurs.html" title="List of dinosaurs">List of dinosaurs</a>, which is a Featured List, representing "what we believe to be the best lists in Wikipedia [...] reviewed [...] for usefulness, completeness, accuracy, [and] neutrality. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 08:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your examples aren't good. The AOL member page is hardly a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and more interestingly <a href="http://users.tellurian.com/rmarguls/d-genera.html" class="external text" title="http://users.tellurian.com/rmarguls/d-genera.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and <a href="http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/genera.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/genera.htm" rel="nofollow">this link</a> call it a <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomen_nudum.html" title="Nomen nudum">nomen nudum</a>. (I'll spare you quoting what's on the <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomen_nudum.html" title="Nomen nudum">nomen nudum</a> page.) Hardly a reason for keeping it. As it is a <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomen_nudum.html" title="Nomen nudum">nomen nudum</a>, once deleted via afd it should also be unlinked from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dinosaurs.html" title="List of dinosaurs">List of dinosaurs</a> (which notes it is a fish <i>not</i> a dinosaur).

<li>My examples are just fine. The "AOL Members Page" just happens to be the web site of noted paleontologist and nomenclature expert <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Olshevsky_ff7c.html" title="George Olshevsky">George Olshevsky</a>. The fact that "Unicerosaurus" is a <i>nomen nudum</i> is already noted in the article. Also, where is the policy which states an article must have "a definition cited in a scientific journal"?<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 09:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>You have three lists that tell us the term is hollow of a definition. Read <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>, which states "To support the use of (or <b>an article about</b>) a particular term we must cite <b>reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term</b> â€” not books and papers that use the term." A list saying the term is hollow of value does not cut it. Please give use books and papers about the terms as the policy states.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatriotBible_b2fa.html" title="User:PatriotBible">PatriotBible</a> 10:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> is a <i>guideline</i>, not a policy, actually. Additionally, Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> indicates it's for "newly coined" words. As the name "Unicerosaurus" has existed for at least 20 years (see links above), it's hardly a neologism. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 10:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's "hardly a neologism" and yet you can't provide any books or journal mentions. Follow the guideline and get a source about the term. Get a source taht tells us what it is. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatriotBible_b2fa.html" title="User:PatriotBible">PatriotBible</a> 11:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>While I'm sure Olshevsky has done his research, it would be nice if he'd provide some actual citations, especially for the nomina nuda. As I mentioned below, a lot of the nomina nuda he lists on that page should probably not be considered as such, having been named in things like newspapers, etc. which the ICZN does not consider valid sources, and having not been properly named in the first place with something along the lines of <i>gen. nov.</i>, or anything showing clear intent to erect a scientific name. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 23:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Changing my vote to <b>Strong Keep</b>, and throwing in an apology for my comments - I should know better than to do this when tired. This article should be kept for the same reason it is being deleted, paradoxically: <b>the article explains the name as utter <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">balls</a></b>! --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 09:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. The article clearly states the animal is invalid and undescribed. It clearly states the it has been rejected by mainstream science. We have an article which discusses <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a>; this article is in many ways quite similar: both present a now-discredited view. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 10:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Good example. Flat Earth has serious scientific sources (journals/books). This does not.

<ul>
<li>It should be kept, in my opinion, to demonstrate precisely <i>why</i> it is not used - or at least, considered harmful by mainstream science. The article does precisely this. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 18:34, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Wikipedia is here to inform, which also means to highlight non-valid terms too. See <b>Brontosaurus</b>, which was actually a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimera.html" title="Chimera">chimera</a>. Similarly Piltdown man and Flat earth too. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 11:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to nitpick, <i>Brontosaurus</i> was not a chimera, it was a junior subjective synonym of <i>Apatosaurus</i>. The whole "wrong head" story has nothing to do with the naming issue, and is very misleading, since 99% of dinosaur mounts to this day invent speculative body parts (especially skulls) based on known relatives to fill in the gaps of incomplete skeletons. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 23:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're comparing <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_man.html" title="Piltdown man">Piltdown man</a> fake, an event that triggered several academic inquires to a term never used in any academic work or by any academic? Also the flat earth article has several academic refutations and sources. What about this one where are the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">"reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term" â€” not books and papers that use the term</a>"? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatriotBible_b2fa.html" title="User:PatriotBible">PatriotBible</a> 13:13, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is all relative; sure the others caused a much bigger stir but in the end the basic issue is the same; a term which has no validity but there still lies a small story behind it and on the net the term snuck into lists of valid creatures. I have seen rumours and bits of knowledge get blown out of proportion before (I have looked into some other issues with Banksias and fungi - read Tom Volk's page on <i><a href="../../../h/y/g/Hygrocybe_conica.html" title="Hygrocybe conica">Hygrocybe conica</a></i> to see how one small event of quetionable validity in 1930s china sent ripples through modern texts on fungi. This is why I'm all for keeping the info. Wikipedia is a <i>reference</i> body on <i>everything</i> not just valid things. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 19:47, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. which part of the <i>article</i> is nonsense? 20:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Edison, Science is a process and many the value of much is increased by showing the false leads. To ignore these is to reduce science to dogma. Sure, two years ago this may have been deleted but the dinosaur section is pretty well developed now and can't be said to give undue weight to this given the thoroughness of what else is around. Maybe some of these other articles need to be discussed again.<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 20:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Science is a process. The examples/analogies you gave are notable. This on the other hand is not notable. For example, give a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for the Baugh claim. I get 14 hits at yahoo and none meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatriotBible_b2fa.html" title="User:PatriotBible">PatriotBible</a> 23:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. All nomina nuda are hollow of definition. By definition, a nomem nudum is any old name that's been made up and/or bandied about carelessly in the literature. Technically, I believe a name has to be followed by <i>gen et sp. nov.</i> to indicate the author is trying to coin a new name, and then if that name is not described properly, it becomes a nomen nudum. A lot of <i>nomina nuda</i> listed on the List of Dinosaurs are not real nomina nuda, they're nicknames that have been picked up by the press and included carelessly in genera lists. That said, Wikiproject dinosaurs has agreed to include both formal and informal nomina nuda in its lists, and this decision means any old name included by any old lunatic in any old list. Including this one. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 23:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please provide <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> of the term and its creator, and show notability. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatriotBible_b2fa.html" title="User:PatriotBible">PatriotBible</a> 23:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is my belief that fossils which have been preserved for 65+ million years are notable. You are free to disagree, but I sure hope this article isn't deleted, because the Wikipedia:WikiProject Dinosaurs team has worked hard to prepare articles for all dinosaur genera, as dinosaurs are perhaps more encyclopedic than the list of Pokemon characters or whatever which proliferate on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 23:50, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Like I said, this is exactly why it should be kept - it explains it as utter balls, and declares it accordingly as something that should be rejected. Wikipedia should also be for explaining bogosity - e.g., this article - and why it is bogus. Science, after all, requires the incorrect findings and unsuccessful experiments to be proven and documented just as much as the correct findings and successful experiments. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 17:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i><a href="../../../a/v/g/Avgodectes.html" title="Avgodectes">Avgodectes</a></i> is a made up term by a person who espouses extreme minority theories, though non-religious. Other scientists have not used the name in serious literature so far. There are literally hundreds of cases like this. Just because the person who named this particular dubious, undescribed specimen is a creationist should have no bearing on the situation unless the article itself espouses creationist beliefs. If the guy who made up the term <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> had been a creationist, it would not make that term any less valid, only the interpretation of it. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 06:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the arguments against this boil down to: it hasn't been used scientifically, and it was named by a creationist. The second point is more easily dealt with: it's always better to expose errors than to cover them up. The first point has some merit, in that as a <i>nomen nudum</i> there's not much that has been said or can be said. Paleontology is littered with names that aren't in use (at least half of what <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Bakker_d814.html" title="Bob Bakker">Bob Bakker</a> has coined and all of the Stephen Pickering names), misidentifications (<i><a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuvosaurus.html" title="Shuvosaurus">Shuvosaurus</a></i>, anyone?), and combinations (<i><a href="../../../a/a/c/Aachenosaurus.html" title="Aachenosaurus">Aachenosaurus</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/c/Succinodon.html" title="Succinodon">Succinodon</a></i>). I think that the merits of showing <i>Unicerosaurus</i> as an error outweigh its uselessness as a pointless name. <a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Spencer_cced.html" title="User:J. Spencer">J.

<li><b>Keep</b> - if it was just a name made-up by a pseudoscientist and included in some fringe newsletters, that wouldn't be good enough; but the terms seems to have been used in other places as well, and was important enough that a geologist wrote a paper to expose it as a mistake. While it is obviously not <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_man.html" title="Piltdown man">piltdown man</a> on the <i>importance</i> scale, it does seem to establish <i>notability</i>, and it would be helpful to inform people that it does not actually exist. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:53, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment to nominator</b> - To explain my vote, I'm maintaining keep for the exact reason you are requesting a deletion. Right now, the problem I'm having is that it's a bit deceptive: whereas your nomination states that it is by all effects a bogus term created under pseudoscience and thusly you assert it should be deleted as such, the article states pretty much the same thing, except that it asserts that it should be <i>kept</i> as such. I honestly fail to see the logic in deleting a term for the exact same reasons it states it should be kept. Care to explain? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:23, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It was a made up term without any sources. The article is much different than it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unicerosaurus&amp;diff=99156930&amp;oldid=89069397" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unicerosaurus&amp;diff=99156930&amp;oldid=89069397" rel="nofollow">before</a>. There was no scholarly comments on his "dinosaur fossil." As such without proper academic sourcing it should be removed. Review the article in the state it was when I made the nomination; two personal webpages and a "journal?" without page numbers nor properly footnoted. Hence, a highly suspect article. If you fail to "see the logic" then be sure to "see" how the article was and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatriotBible_b2fa.html" title="User:PatriotBible">PatriotBible</a> 02:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then consider this: right now, it's less important to consider how the article <i>was</i>, and very important to consider what the article <i>is</i> as of now - and will note the range you cite is covering a period of time ranging about a month and a half with twelve intermediate changes bypassed by the article history link. Just because it was bad doesn't mean it can't change. In its current state, it is, in short, not deletable in my opinion: as I write this, there is a link to Dinosauria.com, two published works referencing ISBN numbers, and two pending such numbers, coming up to five reliable sources. I'm certainly in agreement that personal web pages and blogs in particular are downright horrible for sources (and certainly aren't <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. My vote, however, remains as <i>Keep</i> however, and even more so, as the article, in its current state, has been improved, and at least in my opinion more than meets WP standards. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 02:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think PatriotBible's acknowledging (and correct me if I'm wrong) that the article has been improved since the Deletion tag. At the time, there wasn't much to it. <a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Spencer_cced.html" title="User:J. Spencer">J. Spencer</a> 03:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But even simple "citation needed" tags could have been placed on the article, if all that was needed was proper citation and a little formatting. There didn't need to be an AFD.

<dd><b>Fake Comment-Sorta</b> Now be good Firsfron and stop calling it an animal. Are there really that many sources outside of creationist "literature?" Or is it in code you've uncovered with OR? <b>Peudo-Real Comment</b> I would appreciate if people would stop nominating articles on fake topics for deletion because they are about fakes, well, at least until <b><a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_Man_3087.html" title="Piltdown Man">Piltdown Man</a></b> is deleted, at least. I bet my neighborhood <b><a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a></b> has an article already, <b><a href="../../../a/b/o/Abominable_Snowman_3fc2.html" title="Abominable Snowman">Abominable Snowman</a></b>, <b><a href="../../../l/o/c/Lochness_Monster_cb5b.html" title="Lochness Monster">Lochness Monster</a></b>, too.
