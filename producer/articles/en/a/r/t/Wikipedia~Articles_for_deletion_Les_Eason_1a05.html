<p>Prod was removed without explanation. A minor indy artist with one independently released album. No major hits, no major media coverage, no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third party sources</a> leading me to believe that the article doesn't meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">largely unverifiable</a>. His claim to fame is his supposedly high PureVolume rating, which is a dubious mark of notability at best. A Google search of <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Les+Eason%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Les+Eason%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">his name</a> brings up a forum about him with roughly 10 posts, and a pure volume page.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Counterargument</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><b>1)</b> In defense of the artist, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> rule states: "Has had a charted hit on <b>any</b> national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country." <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> qualifies under this rule, period. If this is not the desired definition of the rule, the rule should be rewritten or elaborated upon. Furthermore, being that I edited the article with the <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> statistics, the statement "His claim to fame" is a subjective and therefore an irrelevant remark. The word "dubious" (above) also suggests subjectivity and should therefore not be considered valuable to the evaluation the argument. If so desired, and if this case were being conducted properly and fairly, the protestor should verify <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> statistics by contacting <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a>, especially before making accusations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2)</b> It is not a standard practice for Independent artists such as Mr. Eason to submit publications to organizations such as AMG, therefore, AMG (Allmusic.com) is not a reliable tool for scrutinizing credibility. In addition, there is no rule under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> that credits AMG with being the means by which to validate an artist. If this is so desired, a rule should be put in place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3)</b> The above argument about the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> search is misleading. As we all know, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> results vary daily depending on hits. The fact that the search "Les Eason" brings back 10 pages (635) of results, and the fact that profile views on the artist's <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> on October 17 are exceedingly high, it can be assumed that while his forum doesn't necessarily reflect high traffic, it is still a fairly popular page, at least on October 17. It is fairly common for music fans to prefer the artists MySpace over their homepage. Since the artists <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> was recently updated, it has been cycled to last of the results when searching from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> while it would normally be the top search result (as I have personally seen). Such is the case when any <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> profile is edited. The artist's <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> suggests a large fan base and boasts a number of posts, contradicting the above beliefs which are simply a result of premature evaluation based on the lack of participation, not traffic, on the Les Eason Forum page. An unfair and incomplete interpretaion. And again, forum activity is not one of the required criteria under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Conclusion:</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> does not tolerate promotional or marketing pages, but just the fact that I got on here today and searched "Les Eason" is evidence enough that people are interested in the article. At first I was surprised to see that he had a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> page, but then I was even more surprised to see the discrepancy since this artist is so well known as an independent musician in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. It would be a shame to delete the article and definitely not based on substantial reasoning (contradictory to the given criteria even). If you left the page alone, you would undoubtedly find that numerous people search this artist. I also feel that further arguments should be strictly objective and supported by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> criteria, not personal opinion.</dd>

<li><b>Les Eason</b> Hey lindsaypooh10, I appreciate your support and yes, I do you remember you from the Amarillo show. Anyway, I was just board during one of my grad classes yesterday afternoon and thought I would make a wiki page. I read the rules for deletion and knew beforehand that it would be deleted. I was surprised to log on this morning though and see all the debate about it. <b>Just delete the page.</b> It's not a big deal and I agree that PureVolume shouldn't qualify. And if these guys have nothing better to do than to troll inferior pages like mine than and make rediculous comments (with the exception of Dhartung and Aaron) then that is pathetic and it says alot about the wiki community. I had never edited on here because I've never had time, but I did expect to find a more scholarly bunch than this. I do appreciate in some sense the attention the page has received and I would urge all of you to check out my MySpace for some samples. By the way, the Purevolume Stats she posted were wrong anyway. Happy trolling! <b>LES</b> Sometime during the day, 18 October 2006<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.188.116.189 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.188.116.189_ed1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.188.116.189">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>So you created a page knowing it would be deleted, and proceed to tell us that discussing its deletion is stupid and trolling? And now you want us to visit your page? What? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 20:14, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I very highly doubt that calling dedicated wikipedians "trolls" and their comments "rediculous [sic]" is going to encourage anyone to get onto your myspace page and listen to your samples. You said yourself that you knew this page is going to be deleted, you don't have to make such a big fuss about it. Since you've apparently acquainted yourself with the deletion guidelines, might I reccommend that you acquaint yourself with <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikipedia:Etiquette</a> as well? <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a></b> <small><a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">Contributions</a></small> 01:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
