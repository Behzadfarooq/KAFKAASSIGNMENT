<p>This person seems to be on the threshhold of notability for Wikipedia. I'm forcing the issue for three reasons: (1) there are several claims made in the article that need citations, including one about the film <i>Proof</i> that should be in IMDb if it's true, but isn't there; (2) Wikiquote now also has <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Paul_Sally" class="extiw" title="q:Paul_Sally">an article on this person</a> (which has also been nominated for deletion), using the WP article to support a notability claim; and (3) to get a current "temperature" on the WP community's feelings about professor notability. I'm hoping this review will encourage interested editors to improve both articles in order to convince the respective communities with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> for the anecdotes and quotes. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 15:43, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - one of the more important professors at the University of Chicago, which is one of the five or six best math schools in the US. He is widely considered an innovator in the teaching of mathematics. He runs (and I believe started) an influential teaching program which trains high school teachers in higher mathematics. Because he is funny and charismatic, some of his former students have added amusing anecdotes to his article, which I believe is what is motivating this move for deletion. That doesn't mean he isn't notable; <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> is a good example of an eminent scientist who is also an amusing personality. Should we be trying to delete that page because it has a list of funny things that he once said? -<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaceMoose_a4ea.html" title="User:SpaceMoose">-SpaceMoose</a> 21:20, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, but Richard Feynman has copious <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> from which to cite material, even his anecdotes.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think if you look at the discussion on the talk page of the article so far, you will see that I am among the foremost of critics of the article that believe things should be verified and notability established and so forth. But I can't agree with your motivation for nominating this article for AFD. AFDs should be kept distinct from content disputes. If you dispute some assertion, AFD is not supposed to be a battleground for verifying some fact. Not to mention that the disputed facts are not what I would regard as essential to a claim of notability. The article claims he is a widely recognized math educator. This has nothing to do, for example, with whether he was the math consultant for the movie "Proof" or whether some anecdote about him is correct. It has plenty to do with the achievements and awards noted. In fact, my research into this has convinced me he is more than notable enough and not anywhere near the "gray" area that you would need to see where to draw the line. In addition, I suspect his research may be quite significant also, but I have difficulty determining this due to my lack of expertise, which is why I have prodded others on this talk page to supply the info. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 07:20, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I apologize for making this nomination sound like it was primarily a content dispute by listing that reason first of the three that I gave, but as I said above, I had two others that led me to make this a general AfD instead of my usual talk page discussions. The possibility of an AfD had been raised twice already on the article's talk page, so I was hardly out of line to make it official. Frankly, I suspected it would pass, and the above votes seem to be confirming this. However, I saw no point in raising the content issue if the article was going to be deleted, so I waited until the consensus was strongly leaning toward "keep" to post the specific content argument on the talk page. Finally, Wikiquote, which rarely has more than 2 or 3 participants in its AfDs (still VfDs there), benefits greatly from Wikipedian input on debatable articles that have been nominated in both projects. I felt that this nomination would clear up doubts already expressed <i>here</i>, help Wikiquote in its efforts, and perhaps incidentally resolve the content issue, one way or another. I believe this was an efficient multiple use of this forum. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 10:28, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
