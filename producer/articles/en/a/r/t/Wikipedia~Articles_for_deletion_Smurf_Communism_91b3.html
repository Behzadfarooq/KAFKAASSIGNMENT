<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> I was looking up this topic today (did a google search and clicked on the wikipedia link only to find that people are trying to get it deleted so I had to comment because it was clearly of use to me) and this says many of the same things other sites discuss about the topic. It's interesting and can be backed up by numerous other sites. This is not an idea that's too far fetched and there is clearly research involved. Please keep it!!

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is not a printed encyclopedia, and there's no reason to save space by deleting a well-written article such as this, as unconvential as the topic may be. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBushytails_47fe.html" title="User:Bushytails">Bushytails</a> 06:05, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as insufficiently notable. It's not whether an article is about something wacky or unconventional or silly, it's whether people out in the rest of the world are aware of, or are discussing or recognizing the subject. The Google test above is misleading; if you go a few pages into the Google results, they become pretty random and the "Smurf" and "Communism" references are not necessarily related. "Smurf Communism" (<i>with</i> quotes) yields only <b>217</b> results. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:47, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but if you type "Communist Smurf" (<i>with</i> quotes), you get <b>1330</b> results on google. and <b>761</b> for "smurfs are communist" and if you google "papa smurf" and "karl marx" together (both in quotes) you get <b>2020</b> results.--<a href="../../../k/e/w/User%7EKewp_9a75.html" title="User:Kewp">Kewp</a> <a href="../../../k/e/w/User%7EKewp_9a75.html" title="User:Kewp">(t)</a> 08:45, 9 October 2005 (UTC)talk</li>

<li>Comment: Well, it looks like this will be kept now. I would suggest a new name be thought of. At a minimum "Communism" should not be capitlized, since "Smurf Communism" is not a proper name of anything. Something semi-neutral like Smurfs (comparisons to communism) would be legitimate (as it doesn't imply there is actually such a thing). Unfortunately, we've now set a precident here, and everyone and everything ever called a "communist" might get a comparable serious or silly POV fork-article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 08:57, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, I would like this article to stay right where it is, but if it does get moved somewhere, I would suggest Smurfs in popular culture, so that we can add the rant from <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donnie_Darko_1f86.html" title="Donnie Darko">Donnie Darko</a></i> to it as well.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 22:53, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Very weak. The article as written is nonsensical and too credulous of the idea. Probably spinning on "Smurf rumors" as its own article would suffice. That said there is some justification to this. Scholarly articles on the theory are lacking, but not nonexistent. I did find one article at scholar google that seem to indicate elements of the anti-globalization movement discuss the idea.

<li><b>Keep, but...</b>. It is a very in depth article with good references. It should not, however be under the Communism section.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Even though it's never been confirmed by the creator, there are far too many parallels between the ideals of practical socialism and the smurfs for this to be dismissed off-hand. Anyone who's really studied Soviet political history / ideology will agree. But yes, should be under a "socialist" rather than a "communist" heading if you want to split hairs. <a href="../../../v/o/n/User%7EVon_sanchez_e6ad.html" title="User:Von sanchez">User:Von_sanchez</a></li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with the Smurfs page. Simply put, it seems to be a valid area of speculation, albeit silly. However, I think it does not warrant its own page.--<a href="../../../t/t/o/User%7ETtogreh_9046.html" title="User:Ttogreh">ttogreh</a> 07:06, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> This is a theory that I have been going off about for many, many years to friends when the Smurfs come up in a conversation. Where I first heard it, I have no idea. I'm not sure what shocked me more, the fact that there was a Wikipedia article devoted to the idea, or the fact that it took me this long to even look it up. However, I think it could be merged with the main Smurfs article.</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Seems relevant, but it's a stretch to have it stand on its own. I think it can be merged with the main article in its own section, and also condensed and cleaned up a bit. Ottamymind 02:22, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is not original research, as some have claimed, just look at the references at the bottom. Nor dose it claim that Smurf communism is a fact.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The idea sounds absurd at first and many think that this article is therefore a troll or a joke. I disagree with them, I think this link between smurfs and communism is a very credible and a valid theory with historical importance.
