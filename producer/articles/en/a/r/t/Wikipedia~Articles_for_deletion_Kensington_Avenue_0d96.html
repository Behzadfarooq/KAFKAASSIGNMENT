<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not too sure about some of these roads but <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastings_Street_%28Vancouver%29_6899.html" title="Hastings Street (Vancouver)">Hastings Street (Vancouver)</a> and Willingdon Avenue are two notable city streets to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Vancouver_09b5.html" title="Greater Vancouver">Greater Vancouver</a> region. I believe Hastings Street was one of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>'s first major roads and is the identifying street to <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skid_Row_8dd7.html" title="Skid Row">Skid Row</a>, the first Skid Row ever. Hard to say the street that founded the name is not notable. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 10:48, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all except Hastings Street</b> If some of the other articles show signs of actual notability, I might change my mind, but I agree that simply being a busy road is not good enough. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 14:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm gonna have to think about this, but my immediate reaction as with Brianyoumans, is that Hastings Street is a big <b>keep</b>. Sperling I can see, and although Willingdon's a much more major street there's not much to report; Kensington also, other than the Burnaby Lake Rec Complex and its freeway exit (as with Willingdon). The tricky one is Cariboo Road (Burnaby) - it has a history behind it, and like Douglas Road was one of the original after the area's survey was carried out; both are obscure now, but at one time were all there was. Hastings, though, has to stay for all kinds of reasons, whether it's the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Eastside_%28Vancouver%29_403c.html" title="Downtown Eastside (Vancouver)">DTES</a> or the West Hastings banking district, and everything that lies between; as well as what lies along it as it runs out to end in Burnaby (just past Sperling, and nearly right in front of my porch, as a matter of fact...).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> If they are all that important, they would have been the primary subject of nontrivial coverage in reliable sources. I do not agree that all streets are inherently notable, or that things people like do not need multiple articles about them to prove notability. If several good references are added where the subject if the street per se, and not just a mention of a store on the street or a car accident on the street, I might change my mind. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Well, with Hastings Street the problem is that the article is still just a stub. It's one of the main axes of the metropolis and will have all kinds of non-trivial coverage once someone can spend time on the article and "flesh it out". The others are much more marginal, although as noted there's history behind Cariboo Road (which needs to be added/written, granted, but it's not a simple arterial like Willingdon or Kensington/Sperling; that Hastings also happens to Hwy 7A, in the same way that Kingsway is 99A, is a further factor.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:36, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hastings is <i>certainly</i> expandable and encyclopedic; along with <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granville_Street_1a66.html" title="Granville Street">Granville</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robson_Street_e313.html" title="Robson Street">Robson</a>, it's one of the relatively few streets in Vancouver that a person who lives at the other end of the country and has never even <i>visited</i> Vancouver can be reasonably expected to have heard of. The others are marginal at best. My own instinct would be to <b>keep</b> Hastings and allow people to work on it, but <b>delete</b> the others. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:18, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's unfortunate that these are grouped together, as I don't think they all share the same set of circumstances. My opinion is:
<ul>
<li><b>Keep <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastings_Street_%28Vancouver%29_6899.html" title="Hastings Street (Vancouver)">Hastings Street</a></b> as core of Vancouver's downtown eastside and synonymous with it and its well-known social problems;</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep Cariboo Road (Burnaby)‎</b> per Skookum1;</li>
<li><b>Delete Kensington Avenue, Willingdon Avenue</b> and <b>Sperling Avenue</b> as they are simply main roads and nothing more (and streets are not notable <i>per se</i> - just because there's a category doesn't mean all streets are so). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 04:02, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> all except <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastings.html" title="Hastings">Hastings</a>, per Bearcat and others. If there's a notable story behind Cariboo Road it can be easily recreated with the story.

<li>Hastings is possibly the most important street in Vancouver's history. By building a road to Hastings township, the CPR's Gastown/Granville/False Creek (modern "downtown") Vancouver severed the area, essentially modern East Vancouver, from the older New Westminster, from which it was built as an extension where the New West coach met the Burrard Inlet ferry. I would definitely <b>keep</b> the Hastings article. I'd probably delete the rest. --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 00:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>quibbles</i> on historical geography of Hastings Street I'll save for outside this discussions, but Hastings does have to be a "keep"; it would be like deleting Yonge Street from Toronto, or Ste. Catherine's from Montreal....I still have strong reservations about deleting Cariboo Road (Burnaby), because of existence of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cariboo_Road_94ce.html" title="Cariboo Road">Cariboo Road</a>, about-to-be <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Cariboo_Road_85ca.html" title="Old Cariboo Road">Old Cariboo Road</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cariboo_Highway_56d8.html" title="Cariboo Highway">Cariboo Highway</a>, and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Cariboo_Highway_cb66.html" title="Old Cariboo Highway">Old Cariboo Highway</a>. Ppl might look up Cariboo Road, meaning the Burnaby one, and not find anything; could just be a subparag on the others, though; not as major an early road as Douglas Road or Westminster Road or North Road - or Hastings Road, for that matter - but from the same era (though Hastings Rd was more like Powell-McGill than modern Hastings Street).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC) PS the difference with Lillooet Road (North Vancouver), in case anyone brings it up, is that it's actually built on the road bed of the <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lillooet_Cattle_Trail_9418.html" title="Lillooet Cattle Trail">Lillooet Cattle Trail</a>; the Cariboo Road in Bby didn't connect with the actual Cariboo Roads, either the one from Yale or the one from Lillooet.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> I agree with Brianyoumans that simply being a busy road is not good enough criteria. Donteatyellowsnow
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Donteatyellowsnow (who didn't date his sig, also) is an SPA who's been involved in a hostile/bad faith edit at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a>, which he just "lost" so has been attacking various unrelated articles edited by others in the AFD discussion; during the course of which he apparently also attempted to "vote" using an IP address SPA. Donteatyellowsnow's "contribution" to the AFD discussion here is IMO largely petulant and destructive; from railing against Vancouver's and BC's mere existence in the Hollywood North AFD, he's now presuming to pontificate on street articles here, and even on a BC mention in <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_towns.html" title="Ghost towns">Ghost towns</a>, which was my addition and apparently found by "stalking" me through my Edit Contributions. Of such people the world is made...more's the pity.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Whatever behaviour (or misbehaviour) is being undertaken by Donteatyellowsnow elsewhere, those circumstances aren't enough to discount his comment here. I say this not because I agree or disagree with his comment here, it's just that it should be taken at face value only because the comment does at least offer a reason for his&#160;!vote. If there is an issue about his behaviour, a Request for Comment may be appropriate, but until then, and without stronger or more clear evidence (and I have looked at his contributions), we'll have to err on the side of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> in <i>this</i> discussion. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
