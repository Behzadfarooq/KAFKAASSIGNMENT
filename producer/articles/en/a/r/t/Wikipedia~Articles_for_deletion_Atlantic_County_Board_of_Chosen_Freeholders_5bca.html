<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no need for a Merge into the county article -- the information is present already. As to the freeholders in question, it is my understanding that holding a purely local office is not a basis for sufficient notability.

<li><b>Reply</b> - We need to have more information regarding your postition that county officeholders are <b>not</b> <i>encylopediac</i>. My concern is that in Wikipedia we use <i>reliable sources</i>, and don't rely on repetition of a statement or putting a word in <i>italics</i> to make it so. I have searched through the criteria of both <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, and find no automatic exclusion criteria that would disallow county officeholders. As requested previously, can you please refer me to the specific standard you are using as justification that specifies that state or national offficeholders are encylopedic, but corresponding county officials are by definition not. I have searched through the criteria of both <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, and find no automatic exclusion criteria that would disallow county officeholders. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:24, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> From <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: 'Political figures holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature.' and 'Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage.' A county office fails the first part, and merely listing that the members of the board are members of the board fails the second. --68.69.152.140 17:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC) not signed in there... should be --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 17:17, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> three, <b>Merge</b> one, per Alansohn. On its surface, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guideline seems to support delete. However, there is also a proposed guideline, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, which seems to go beyond the current WP:BIO guideline. It states, <i>"As a compromise between those who would keep all candidate articles and those who would delete all articles on yet-unelected candidates, this guideline states that articles on elections should be written before articles on individual candidates. Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on a candidate should one be written."</i> Well, if an article can be written about a <i>candidate</i> that satisfies these criteria, then surely by extension, an article can be written about the <i>election winner</i>, i.e., officeholder/incumbent. Although the proposed guideline seems to contemplate state-level elections, given the examples that are provided, the policy is still open to discussion and could be extended to county-level elections. Deleting articles in the absence of a clear policy or guideline is not a good idea, especially when said articles are part of a WikiProject that is committed to expanding them. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 20:29, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>: In the name of consistency, I'm not sure how county-level officeholders differ from schools. A quick browse through [Category:High schools in the United States] reveals that there are numerous schools listed that would fail nearly every test under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, save the 100 year test; of survivors, many would pass the 100 year test solely because the actual structure is still standing and/or in use. Of course, other schools will probably be gone or unused, 30, 50, or 99 years from now. Finally, <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> is seeking to <i>upgrade</i> many of these articles. High schools just don't seem encyclopedic to me. I would support standards around schools, but that would result in an awful lot of AfDs. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 19:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
