<li>Thanks for asking, it's a common mistake to not understand what we're actually doing here. If you want the closing admin to take your recomendation into consideration, yes you must be explicit. You might, for instance, be basing you "keep" on it being the first sprite comic. Then if evidence comes up that it's not, and you don't revisit the discussion, we wouldn't know that the rational no longer applied. It takes very little extra effort to say <i>why</i> you want to keep, and far less to say "keep per foo" than to say that you won't do so.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It is notable as the first sprite comic, and has inspired many spinoffs. GeoWeasel, a flash toon, was originally a sprite comic, and its motto was "the best thing to happen to sprite comics since NC." Google scores and Alexa ranks are not the only determiners of notability, guys. This article passes all three of Wikipedia's tests for inclusion. The sources are verifiable (read the comic and the 1UP article), the research is not original, and even if it is vanity, it can be edited down. The last thing I want Wikipedia to do is to claim that <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a> was the first sprite comic and ignore NC completely. Its forum contains roughly 5000 members (the VGF forum contains 15000 members, and it's very possible that most of its members came to VGF via NC)<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Crazyswordsman</a> 16:47, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've never heard of GeoWeasel. It's not notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. Although the sources are verifiable, (although the source to the only claim to notability, that it was the first sprite comic, is absent) the research is not original (although earlier edits of the article read like advertizements) and it may not technically be vanity, (the guy who runs the website that hosts the comic made it instead of the author of the comic) it is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">not notable according to these guidelines</a>. I will need empirical evidence of 5000 members of this webcomic's forum, and even then, when a comic like <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achewood.html" title="Achewood">Achewood</a> gets several hundred thousand mentions in passing on Google, I really don't see how that helps your case.<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 18:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Those guidelines are merely suggestions, and are the opinion of those forming the page (it says so at the top of the page), not policy. And if you're so concerned about these matters, why don't you go look for verification yourself? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Crazyswordsman</a> 19:14, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're being a tad immature. Wikipedia is an attempt at a verifiable, usable encyclopedia. By creating an article about a comic that's only notability is the shaky clame that it innovated a minor style of webcomic, than you need to back this claim up. Being a Wikipedia editor is about verifiability. The burden of proof is on you. If you do not wish to take responsibility for the burden of proof, stop arguing against the deletion of the article.<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 03:44, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Okay, you start looking at one end of the Internet; I'll start looking at the other. The reason we "Keep"ers keep bringing up B&amp;G is that it was called the first sprite comic until people saw the NC timestamps. What's it called when you're before the "first"? The <i>real</i> first. If someone finds an earlier sprite comic, then I very well might change my tune, but until then, this is the kind of claim that can stand in good faith until it is disproven. Besides that, NC is easily the longest-running sprite comic, as any that <i>may</i> have been started before it are completely lost and could safely be presumed dead. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptHayfever_007c.html" title="User:CaptHayfever">CaptHayfever</a> 19:53, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As you can see, we have has a long and heated discussion about the merits of whether or not NC should have a Wikipedia article. I say there have been good arguements on both sides. Yes, NC has not and probably will not be as notable a spite comic as <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a> and <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-bit_Theatre_fcec.html" title="8-bit Theatre">8-bit Theatre</a>. However, you can't ignore the fact that NC is, if not the first, then at least the longest running sprite comic. When I first created the NC wiki page last May, I only wrote it as a short little history of NC (look at the archived page in the history for proof). I never intended all the bells and whistles that were added in the next 9 months. I did not ask for there to be a separate page created for cultural references. I did not ask for a wikiquote page. These were added by fans of NC, who felt like they should be part of the article. Me and <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptHayfever_007c.html" title="User:CaptHayfever">CaptHayfever</a> have been trying to clean up the page, so it will be a good median between the simple article I started with and the overblown article it had become. Yeah, there are better webcomics out there, however NC still has a history can not be ignored.

The arguments based on unverifiability seem very strained indeed.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The Wikipedia article was created on May 24 2005 saying "Nelected Mario Characters (also known as NC) is the world's first (if it wasn't the first, then it was at least the first well documented) sprite-based web comic." On Nov 7 2005 1up.com says "Neglected Mario Characters, the first sprite comic." This doesn't look trustworthy. Isn't it possible Wikipedia was there source? That promotional claims made in wikipedia arrticles are being picked up by other web sites? <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotWings_6f2a.html" title="User:HotWings">HotWings</a> 21:10, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't want to vote, but I have some thoughts:
<ol>
<li>Being the first sprite based comic would seem to confer a certain <i>de facto</i> notability on the subject.</li>
<li>Can we deem something notable ourselves in this way, by looking through the internet archive and comparing dates? Is this original research? I'm not sure what I think about that, but it is a point that stands out to me. How does this mesh with the idea of direct observation?</li>
<li>Is it reasonable to expect that if the strip is truly notable, we would have some decent sources to inform us about it? At present we seem to have only a brief mention in a VG website article about the early history of webcomics. I am confident that, if we decided to keep this article, this would probably be one of the very least notable topics we have officially approved for inclusion on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>I am impressed by the commitment involved in writing the article and fighting to defend it. Sometimes, when I am on the borderline between voting to keep or delete, that will push me just slightly onto the keep side. I figure: you know, I really don't want to be wrong about this, if we have somebody here wanting to develop our content on this subject, and committed to it. I would at least like to put off the decision for a while, or let people on the article talk page reach some decision on their own. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:23, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mr Brenneman, it's already established verifiably and through a process very much not original research. I would hope the closing admin will take a note of that. Webcomics historian T. Campbell has cited it as the first, as has a column on a major publishing companies website. It seems redundant not to note those claims, which are verifiable and are not original research. Since those claims are citable, it is now up to those seeking to disprove those claims to cite otherwise. The burden of proof is with those disputing the sources. Any decision on those sources should be made consensually, not by a closing admin. No-one as yet has addressed those sources in great detail. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 14:48, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have no idea how notable or nonnotable this is, not being a big webcomic buff (I collect comic books, the old fashioned kind printed on paper, but haven't looked very much at the Web-based kind). I'm rather frustrated with the degree of histrionics that occur whenever a webcomic with a fervent fan following gets nominated for deletion, which often spills over to the wikien-l mailing list as well as discussion pages within Wikipedia itself. People, it's <i>not</i> the end of the world if this gets deleted, or kept. The AfD process makes mistakes sometimes, but the eventualist position holds that, in the long run, notable stuff will get articles and non-notable stuff will fade away, no matter what happens in the short run. There's no need to get all pouty and start screaming about how you're starting a forked site and abandoning Wikipedia... go ahead and start specialized sites on different topics if you want, but Wikipedia will stay around no matter what happens elsewhere, and bashing and sniping at it does no productive good. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 01:09, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Great job with the cleanup. I don't mind if the article gets deleted anymore, (although I prefer it be kept, thus my vote stays at keep).
