<dd>You can start by editing the article and integrating these supposed citations. I looked at some of what you've listed here and many are self published articles. They don't seem to say much, but to indentify that the man published some works. In fact, his article says about as much. He's alive, he worked at a university and he published some works. I can think of numerous university profs that meet this criteria. Are you suggesting that every published university professor should have a bio on here? Anyone who has a Ph.D will have written something, as they have to be published to get their Ph.D! <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 04:31, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Believe me, I know that - and it takes a lot of effort. no, I'm not suggesting every PhD or professor deserves an article. But one with multiple international awards? That's a different matter. As to "supposed citations", are you suggesting that the Canadian Encyclopedia would make these things up? And yes, one of those articles (a strange definition of "many") was by Walker himself, it is true - perhaps simply picking the first three of the many articles on him online was not the wisest choice on my part, but there are many more. Her's clearly very notable. This is beginning to have the faint whiff of bad faith nomination. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:36, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Gruteness, bad faith would imply I had no basis for the nomintation. The article was short and wasn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">verifiable</a>. Since the nom, and this debate, the article has improved substantially. Please remember that a biography of a living person must be well sourced. This is not my POV, this is a well established view on wikipedia.

<ul>
<li><i>"This page contains more effort and contribution than the article we're debating."</i> That is exactly why nominating such an article for deletion is a really bad idea. First of all, the article was perhaps not ideally, but <i>sufficiently</i> sourced (just as the article on <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Walker_%28academic%29_153a.html" title="Alan Walker (academic)">Alan Walker (academic)</a> which you prodded). It was sourced with a link to a web page at the <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMaster_University_8276.html" title="McMaster University">McMaster University Library</a>. And finding more sources which verify the information is easy if you bother to look. (There is even an article in Grove on this Alan Walker, but, as has already been demonstrated, you don't need access to Grove to find additional verification.) Secondly, by wasting your own and other people's time and energy on debating this article you are in effect diverting attention from useful tasks, such as expanding this article or finding and discussing those <i>other</i> articles which we <i>do</i> need to get rid off. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Upp◦land</a> 05:06, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have the same answer for you as I did for Dhartung. I prodded the article, this didn't prompt anyone interested to improve it. This is not my area of expertise, I am merely challenging an article based on wikipedian principles. Those 3 pillars we all read about when we began editing here. You guys don't need to argue with me here, modify the article, include the sources and this AfD process will be moote. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 06:05, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm quite happy to add to the article, but I honestly have other things going on in my life at any given moment and Wikipedia is a pleasant hobby for me rather than a job, and you are not the judge and jury of your own nomination here, so please don't act in an obstructionist manner. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The fact that it has already been demonstrated that this person meets verfiability and notability requirements already shows that the article should not and will not be deleted. Just because the article needs work and needs expansion does NOT mean that it should be up for deletion; that's not what AfD is for and it really is nothing more than a disruption in order to make a point, which can get you banned. This looks more and more like a bad faith nomination... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:15, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The AfD debate is not a trial for the nominator. Everytime an AfD debate results in <b>keep</b> it does not imply the nominator should be banned anymore than every unamious result for delete should result in the editor to be banned. Through this process many improvements have been made to the article. Please remember, <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">Verifiability</a> supercedes subject notability. If an article is not verifiable, it should be deleted. However, in this case, the article was greatly improved and therefore I now agree that it should be kept. It is, in fact, bad faith to assume a participant in an AfD debate with a viewpoint contrary to your own is not acting in good faith. Deletion is a reality of this project and I hope you will keep an open mind to contrary view points in the future.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 18:09, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dhartung, I keep repeating myself, you keep making the same assertions. I started the AfD because the article was not well sourced or verifiable. This is a basis for deletion if the subject is notable or not. Once again, I tell you, there is a difference between a notable person and an article about them. You assert the man is notable, now the article proves this to be true. When the process started, I believed it did not. You will also note that the speedy deletion criteria does not apply because the article asserts notability. I never tagged the article with speedy deletion. Prod and AfD are the avenues for editors who believe the asserted notability is not verifiable. I appreciate the debate we've had here, let's not close it on a bad note.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 18:24, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, fair enough. Tell me why it is that nominators almost never say, "OK, I'm open-minded, that sounds promising, can you find more sources?" Once in a blue moon, perhaps. Usually they say, "Nope, not good enough, work your butt for this article if you expect it to be saved, I will not be moved by your puny NYT citation." I like to "save" articles from the axe <i>when I can see that they deserve it</i>, but I run into this stonewall attitude all the time. Sometimes I think the thing to do is just ignore the entire frickin' AFD debate and silently improve the article, but I've done that too and "lost" because I didn't add my voice to change the consensus. I would dearly love this to be less adversarial. What are your suggestions? --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>I continue to feel that those who want to delete it should simply add the reviews instead. It should not be necessary to defend such a work as this. The argument that a NYT review alone is not enough is wrong in any case, because it shows an inability to judge the weight of sources. all newspapers and the reviewers are not equal. When its a question of having one review from a very non-notable paper, we'd be justified in asking for another (at least). <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
