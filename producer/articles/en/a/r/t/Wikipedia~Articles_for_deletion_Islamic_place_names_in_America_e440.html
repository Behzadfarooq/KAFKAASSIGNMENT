<p><b>Delete.</b> Quite apart from the obvious unencyclopaedic purpose of this article- to promote what can only be an extreme minority viewpoint even among Muslim communities, namely that Islam had a presence in the Americas pre-Columbus- this article is misconceived as well as misinformed. Islam is a religion not a language, and it is no more sensible to claim that placenames are etymologically "Islamic" than it would be to claim they are Christian, Jewish, Taoist, Animist or whatever. The cited "source" drawn upon for the article hardly seems to be (and is not represented as) a credible one for this 'research', and as such the contents are indicative of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a>. <a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 09:36, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>He does not argue, and certainly not rationally, he presents clearly controversial research by one fringe researcher as uncontradicted fact. He doesn't establish that the placenames are either "islamic" or even that they are precolumbian (there is a town called Hell does that prove diabolical presence in preocolumbian ameria?) And he doesn't cite any complementary sources or accepted etymologies. If not exactly bad faith (which I might be inclined to think) the page is definitely pushing a bizarre and non-notable POV in a non encyclopedic manner.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 15:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>by example, the article on the Earth only very briefly refers to the Flat Earth theory, a view of a distinct minority</b></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Considering that we have <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a>, this clearly shows that this article could very well exist. As for NPOV and other editoria issues as "presenting theories as facts" and such, those are not grounds for afd, its only grounds for editing. Regarding sources, the given article indeed is about this topic. I also missed it, but if you scroll down a bit to the <a href="http://www.zaman.com/?bl=aksiyon&amp;trh=20060415&amp;alt=&amp;syf=butun" class="external text" title="http://www.zaman.com/?bl=aksiyon&amp;trh=20060415&amp;alt=&amp;syf=butun" rel="nofollow">First Immigrants of the New World</a> section, you will see it. Also, in that article they make claims of notability for those holding that view. A small example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Barry Fell (1917 - 1994), British-born and <b>distinguished Harvard professor of marine biology</b>, wrote "Saga America" one year after his retirement in 1980, which proves the existence of Muslims in America.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Salih Yucel began to search for the traces of lost Islam in the United States <b>just after his appointment to Redfern Mosque in Sydney, Australia, as a religious official, 14 years after his graduation from Ankara University‘s Faculty of Theology</b>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So the article is clearly sourced and makes claims of notability. So far, the above disscussion (this is not a vote) has been regarding this being a minority view and having NPOV issues, and i have referred to policy and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">precedence</a> to prove that those are not grounds for deleting. And i have showed that the article is indeed sourced, makes claims of minority scholarship and is not a hoax.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Neither Fell nor Yucel are reliable sources (Feel was a marine biologist dabbling in the esoteric, Yucel is a moslem religious specialist, neither are hisorians nor are their theories even discussed by historians, this does indeed constitute a very small minority view - probably more people believe the earth is flat). None of the claims of references are verifiable the way they are quoted, and if they were verifiable it would only be in nonreliable sources.

<dd>My only problem is that I don't see any case for this being a notable minority POV. IMHO, it looks more like the discertation that some Harvard professor believed, and decided to put on Wikipedia. Can you find sources that talk about how this movement has a following? If so, please do add them to the article, and clean the thing up so it doesn't look like it's being presented as factual, but rather, a small group of people hold the belief. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 02:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless the Harvard professor has a notable following, we can't include every work that a Harvard professor has done, especially without noting that it's a fringe work. Once this place names thing becomes a notable movement, with many followers, then include it. Otherwise, it's just a few people.

<dd>Um, which Harvard Professor? <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Fell_bbe2.html" title="Barry Fell">Barry Fell</a>? Despite what the messageboard linked to proclaims, he has nothing whatsover to do with the contents of this list, nor anything really to do with 'establishing' pre-Columbian Islamic presence in the Americas. That source is quite evidently bandying his name about in a misguided attempt to associate some academic credentials behind all this. While Prof. Fell did indeed make a number of claims to have identified petroglyphs in the Americas as having non-American origins, such as in North African and (mainly) Celtic (<a href="../../../o/g/h/Ogham.html" title="Ogham">Ogham</a>) scripts, his ideas in this regard are assessed by the academic community as being outlandish, eccentric and are not seriously contemplated. He did not AFAIK ever claim or set out to claim Islamic presence, though.</dd>
<dd>Instead, the sole source behind this "research" seems to be a rather obscure figure associated with a mosque in inner Sydney, Australia, with absolutely no demonstration of any credentials, of any kind, whatsoever. This source is reportedly (and <i>reportedly</i> since we've only the word of the original messageboard poster to go by) claiming that not only are these localities in some sense "Islamic" -and per my nominating comments this makes no linguistic sense- ,but also that these localities had these names already, ie before European settlement came along, and thus the "proof" that there was Islamic presence pre-Columbus.</dd>
<dd>So we are being asked to believe that, for example, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina%2C_Washington_37ee.html" title="Medina, Washington">Medina, Washington</a> is so named because that is what it was called long before European settlers ever got there. However, even cursory research will show that in this case the township was only established in the late 19th C., and the town's historical society gives a rather different account has to <a href="http://www.medina-wa.gov/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={0EF1CA38-E35B-489B-8446-8B309737C420}" class="external text" title="http://www.medina-wa.gov/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={0EF1CA38-E35B-489B-8446-8B309737C420}" rel="nofollow">how its name came about</a>- to quote: <i>"A community meeting was held and three women were appointed to select a name for the community. Mrs. Flora Beloti’s choice was the name selected. She had decided on the name “Medeena”, after a popular Arabian city."</i> (and this was in 1891, not 1291).</dd>
<dd>Clearly, it and presumably the other Medinas in the US were named after the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">original in Saudi Arabia</a>, but <i>not</i> by any Muslims who were there pre-1492.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 07:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Fell_bbe2.html" title="Barry Fell">Barry Fell</a> conducted a very large study of west african and north african muslims linguistic roots in the Americas before Columbus. This is detailed in his book Saga America</dd>

<p>"Dr. Barry Fell (Harvard University) introduced in his book Saga America - 1980 solid scientific evidence supporting the arrival, centuries before Columbus, of Muslims from North and West Africa. Dr. Fell discovered the existence of Muslim schools at Valley of Fire, Allan Springs, Logomarsino, Keyhole Canyon, Washoe and Hickison Summit Pass (Nevada), Mesa Verde (Colorado), Mimbres Valley (New Mexico) and Tipper Canoe (Indiana) dating back to 700-800 CE. Engraved on rocks in the old western US, he found texts, diagrams and charts representing the last surviving fragments of what was once a system of schools - at both an elementary and higher levels. The language of instruction was North African Arabic written with old Kufic Arabic script.

<p>The Academic discourse on pre columbian prescence of muslims in America is quite established . It is a shame that so many wikipedians are unaware of this recent acedmic historical research. Here are some books that cover the research in some depth</p>

<li>Deeper Roots Dr. Abdul Hakim Quick</li>
<li>Sylvian diouf "slaves of Allah"</li>
</ul>
<p>What Wikipedians need to appreciate is that this acedemic research is relatively new spanning just 50 years. I have yet to see a barrage of reliable acedemic source that refutes these new findings, as these discourses are becoming increasingly acceptable amonst reputable Historians. 62.129.121.63 12:34, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>- 62.129.121.63: on the contrary, it is your comments which give the appearance of unfamiliarity with the current standing of pre-Columbian historical research. To say "...these discourses are becoming increasingly acceptable amonst reputable Historians" is demonstrably false, at best misleading. Any readings done outside of the same material you have quoted (which is spammed and duplicated across a number of afrocentrist and other miscellaneous messageboards) -say, any peer-reviewed academic journal, <i>Archaeology</i>, <i>Science</i>, etc- would show that these ideas have no acceptance by mainstream historians.</li>
<li>- <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a>,81.178.99.202- while some of these sources may indeed have held or still hold positions in academia -Fell, van Sertima, Wiener- to generally describe what they have written on these subjects as "reputable/academic works or studies" would be misleading. Their publications cited have not undergone any peer-reviewed academic process (which is what "academic publication" means), but instead are popularly published and are no more deserving of an 'academic' label than other well-known fringe/pseudoscientific writers like Erich von Daniken and Zecharia Sitchin.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 02:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>further comment and clarification:</b> if it is not already clear, it should be noted that the likes of Fell, van Sertima, Diop, Wiener, et al <i>are not</i> the direct or indirect sources for the claims made in this particular article- namely, that a number of "Islamic-sounding" placenames in the Americas have those names because they were called that by some supposed Islamic presence pre-Columbus. While these folks have indeed published works which postulate pre-Columbian African or Islamic presence, they are only mentioned by the messageboard site this material is taken from as being sources which are supportive of the general concept, and not the specific claim. There is <i>no demonstration</i> that any of these "academics" have made the connection on these placenames in their works. At all. The <u><i>only</i></u> attributed source for the claim on which this article is based -that all the Medina etc placenames in US are "Islamic"- is the Redfern mosque attendee Salih Yucel, and furthermore we only have the messageboard poster's word for it. Frankly, this is a very poor demonstration of any notable, "researched theory", and on the face of it is barely distinguishable from a hoax. "Fundamentalist Christian WASP so-called scholarship" has absolutely nothing to do with this either.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 09:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>reply to CJLL Firstly lets not denegrate Yucel as the Redfern Mosque Attendee, as he was a Doctorate student At Harvard and one of his professors was Harvard Professor Fell. His research referenced and detailed these half a dozen harvard and other notable academics works on the subjects. As yet You have failed to produce ANY evidence that the Acedemic circles reject these theories or that it is widespread, or that the research did not undergo Peer review. Yet the arguments for the inclusion of this article have consistantly give sound references of the Harvard historians support of this field of study.</li>

<p>Yucel then traveled to the US to pursue his doctoral degree in "Religion and Mental Health" at the University of Boston; he is currently a preacher at the School of Medicine Hospital of Harvard as well as a member of the religious affairs planning committee of these hospitals. In addition to being on the administration of the Boston Dialogue Foundation, Yucel has researched the traces of Islam on the American Continent for years. The most important findings he notes also concur with the research of his former professor and member of the US Science and Art Academy faculty, Professor Barry Fell.</p>

<p>However this all acedemic as it is abundantly clear that this is a acedemic viewpoint that is backed up by half a dozen Harvard Professors as well as other Acedemics, and is contained in several Acedemic Books (which have been listed).

<dd>It is most certainly not clear. It is not our task to prove that the viewpoints haven't undergone peer reiew. It is the task of the article creator to refer to reliable sources something which he fails to do. Even if fivehundred harvard proffessos think the theory is sound it is of no importance untill one of them publishes a book about it or an artcile in a peerreviewed journal. The article links to a message board not to any artciles or books. Also being an academic doesn't mean that thei viewpoint hold any leverage at all - the are biologists and theologists not historians. Their statements about history or linguistics hold about as much value as bold claims I might make about quantum physics. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 11:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
