<p>Elonka Dunin is a Wikipedian who has gotten a friend to write an article about her and then edited it extensively. Working as a game developer does not make her notable, being mentioned in a few magazines does not make her notable. Being an amateur cryptographer (or amateur anything for that matter) does not make her notable. Working for a company that won an award for its product does not make her notable. Being thanked in a book does not make her notable. This is simply a case of someone abusing Wikipedia to gain publicity for themselves. There is way too much of that going on these days. Also note that a previous VfD was never closed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 01:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not sure why the first AfD wasn't closed... to my eye, it looks like a <b>no consensus</b> close, the arguments advanced are not clearly one way or the other. I looked long and hard at this article. I don't like to see vanity articles here. But I'm not convinced this article isn't about a notable person. The number of different publications cited, the published authorhood, the number of hits, the tie to <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryptos.html" title="Kryptos">Kryptos</a> all seem to confer some notability. None is enough in my view all by itself, but together they seem to add up to just barely notable enough. <b>Keep</b> (with regret because I don't like to go against Danny, he's pretty sage). ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:15, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> (as subject).

To be honest, as much as I love editing Wikipedia (I think I'm at around 6,500 edits at this point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Elonka" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Elonka" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), my own Wikipedia bio article is something that I tend to perceive as being drastically out of date, but I try to respect <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and keep my fingers out of it except for very simple factual updates. As for "proving" notability, let's see: Elonka Dunin is a published author, notable game developer (some of her work is even cited as references elsewhere on Wikipedia)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grind_%28gaming%29#References" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grind_%28gaming%29#References" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and she's a frequently-cited consultant on the CIA's <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryptos.html" title="Kryptos">Kryptos</a> sculpture.

<li><b>Comment</b> Some of that notability applies to the website though, not to you, no? perhaps elonka.com is what needs the article? That may be hairsplitting though, I dunno. Perhaps both do. Somehow, though, I just don't see Danny as doing a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> on anyone, that may not be a good place to go. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:52, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, not bad faith at all. This simply made me aware of the fact that there was an article about you. Whether it is in that article, your user page, or your talk page, you are using Wikipedia for self-promotion, and that is simply unacceptable. I sepnd many long hours every day on the phone at the Wikimedia office, dealing with people who insist that we include articles about them because they are "notable." I get it from wannabe actors, pizza parlors, inventors, bloggers, you name it. The same efforts to prove notability, the same complaints, the same personal attacks (and I see that comment as a personal attack). Sorry, but there are guidelines. Those guidelines may have been bent out of shape by process over the past year or so, but there are guidelines nonetheless. WP:AUTO is a guideline that was violated by the incredible amount of vapid information posted to this article, and by the fact that in the talk page Elonka goes on an on about where to find even more information about her. For everyone reading this I ask: Will we have an article for every person involved in the creation of video games--they are massive productions? Will we have every person involved in the creation of a film? Just look at the roller for any film to understand what this will entail. Where are the limits where we say "No, this is not worthy of inclusion. This is barely verifiable." Wikipedia is, and will remain to be, an encyclopedia, not a directory for anyone looking for attention. The fact that we are online must not be turned into a means of boosting someone's own website or ego. This is nothing more than spamming. Stating "Strong Keep" about one's self is nothing more than spamming either, and very tasteless spamming at that. oh, and I wonder whether Elonka is contacting other encyclopedias and reference works to ensure that she is included in future editions. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 14:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as borderline notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> - she wrote a fairly successful book, and has a reputation among cryptographers. The article may not emphasise this enough, because it's modeled after the other biography pages on wikipedia which tend to linger on a person's childhood and connections, rather than their accomplishments and notability.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm getting confused with all the different versions. Are we now determining WHICH version is notable enough? Can't we work on the broader question of whether Elonka Dunin is notable enough to warrant an entry about her, and THEN wrestle with the specifics of format and content as one normally does with any Wikipedia entry? I'm getting the two concepts of voting for deletion, and editing an article mixed up. FWIW I think editing is needed, but we may not all agree herein where, what, who, and how. -<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartermaster_2ada.html" title="User:Quartermaster">Quartermaster</a> 19:26, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
