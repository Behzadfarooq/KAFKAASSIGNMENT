<p>Instead of leaping immediately to delete, I had proposed merging this article with <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> (see the discussion about why and the results at the<a href="../../../h/i/n/Talk%7EHindi_2f78.html#Proposed_merge_of_Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_into_this_article" title="Talk:Hindi">Hindi talk page</a>). The consensus of was that this article ought not to be merged into the Hindi article. That brings me to this nomination. This article, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_6b78.html" title="Origin of some common Hindustani words">Origin of some common Hindustani words</a>, is indiscriminate as it provides no basis for what words are to be included on the list and which are not. There is no similar article for any other language that I could find (other than a few pages about words English has borrowed from other languages). They might be out there, but I did not see any. There is also no article on Most common words in Hindustani for this article to support. Anything in this article is more than adequately covered in the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html#History" title="Hindi">history</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html#Vocabulary" title="Hindi">vocabulary</a> sections of the main Hindi article without any need to refer to this article. I am also concerned about this article being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Finally, I am wondering about proper copyright authorization because of the odd line in the article, "The derivations below are based on posts by Yashwant Malaiya, and are given here by his consent". No verification of this is provided anywhere. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as wikipedia is not an etymological dictionary. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 02:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is very useful and is in the process of expansion. It is also the Main Article for the Vocabulary Sections of the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindustani.html" title="Hindustani">Hindustani</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, and <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> pages. Before reading this article, I had never knew the information provided here. I would highly recommend keeping this article. Thank you very much all. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulQadir_391e.html" title="User:AbdulQadir">AbdulQadir</a> 05:57, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article is properly referenced to Dr. Yashwant Malaiya, Professor at Colorado State University,Fort Collins, CO, USA. as well as other sources (see the References section). He is also a Wikipedia editor. (see his userpage: <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalaiya_1119.html" title="User:Malaiya">User:Malaiya</a>. I am also working on expanding this article and adding new information to it. This is a very helpful article. Please keep it. Thank you in advance. --Zulfikkur 06:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> What <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> forgot to mention was that the reason most people did not accept the merge is because they felt that it would be a good standalone article and main article for the Vocabulary section on the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> page. (Please see <a href="../../../h/i/n/Talk%7EHindi_2f78.html" title="Talk:Hindi">Talk:Hindi</a>) Three out of four individuals on the talk page wanted to keep the article as a sepate page! I think this should be acknowledged. The article is also well referenced and well written. Topics covered in <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_6b78.html" title="Origin of some common Hindustani words">Origin of some common Hindustani words</a> are not covered in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html#History" title="Hindi">history</a>. These articles deal with totally different things. This article is also the main article for the vocabulary sections of three pages: <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindustani.html" title="Hindustani">Hindustani</a>, and <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>. Also, this article is being worked on currently by myslef and other Wikipedians. I would very much appreciate if you kept this worthy article. Patel24 07:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, but <b>wants a better title</b>. An entire Hindustani etymological dictionary, or even a fairly representative subset of such a dictionary, probably is beyond the scope of the project, and unhelpful to users on the English encyclopedia. But move this to Sources of the Hindustani lexicon or some similar name, and it probably wouldn't be here. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tl√∂n</a> 19:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Articles that give insight into different languarges are extremely important. Think of all the English crud on Wikipedia. Interest in other languages should be encouraged, as should the people who write them. GrapePie 19:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki to various individual entries on Wiktionary and delete</b>. Wikipedia is not the place for this information; Wiktionary is. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very valuable article. It should be kept becaus it is the main page for the Vocabulary sections of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindustani.html" title="Hindustani">Hindustani</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>, and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>. Also <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> did not mention that Professor Yashwant Malaiya (the individual whom the article is referenced to) himslef is the author of the article (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>)He used his other professional Hindi collegiate level sites as his source for the article. I took a look at the article and it was very lucid and interesting. I am going to help by developing this article even more so. It would be a shame if this article was deleted. Please keep this article. Khuda Hafiz. Jdas07 22:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please re-read my nomination discussion. I <i>did</i> in fact note that the article claimed material was "<i>based on posts by Yashwant Malaiya</i>"; however, there was (and still is) no notice on the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Talk%7EOrigin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_87cd.html" title="Talk:Origin of some common Hindustani words">article's talk page</a> that copyright authorization had been granted or that "Yashwant Malaiya" and <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalaiya_1119.html" title="User:Malaiya">Malaiya</a> are one and the same (nor is there any indication on Malaiya's user/talk page. Of course, that means there still may be an issue with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, but that's besides the point.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sat Sri Akal. It seems like the wide consensus here is to keep the article. I, myself, looked over the article and feel that it is a good and worthy one. I also agree with the other opinions of those who wish to preserve the article. In the near future, I also hope to add to the article. Dhanyavaad <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinghman_1d6e.html" title="User:Singhman">Singhman</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is well worth keeping. Yeah. 70.104.119.81 23:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but rename. The title is nonspecific, and should be an article on the evolution of Hindi words with some used as examples. The exmamples shouldn't define the article's name. So rename it Hindi-Urdu word etymology and discuss the relevant factors there with some examples and references. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:35, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
