<li>You're right. I've changed my vote to <b>Abstain</b> to reflect this. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventypercent_9424.html" title="User:Seventypercent">Seventypercent</a> 09:31, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You seem to be applying your own strict criteria here. What parts of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guidelines suggest that the subject of an article should be the <i>primary</i> topic of any given sources? <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 20:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It has to be <i>non-trivial</i> coverage. "<i>"Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject.</i>" This is widely regarded to mean the subject of the article is the primary subject of the coverage. That is exactly what <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says, for example, but only to make it clearer. Specifically, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does say that it must be <i>the</i> subject. In a newspaper piece about Lordi, the band is <i>the</i> subject of the article. It's possible for there to be more than one subject, I'll grant, but that is not the case in any coverage yet presented here. All the coverage has been nothing more than passing mentions of the song. And "a guideline" does not mean "something we can pretend doesn't exist". Notability is required, it is part of policy. See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Problem articles where deletion may be needed</a>, non-notability is one of those things that requires deletion. Again, one cannot write a Wikipedia article from a passing sentence or two. In order to be verifiable, the topic must have plenty of third-party reliably-sourced coverage. That's what notability establishes: that enough such material exists. If this article is never going to expand beyond a stub, then it must be merged. If it can expand beyond a stub, that would only be because there are notable verifiable sources to rely on, so let's see them. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 13:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly, even if it cannot be expanded beyond a stub, that would not in itself be a reason to delete the article in my view. Even a stub can be a valid article, there is nothing to say it <i>must</i> be merged, and there are some advantages in maintaining a separate article (e.g. categorisation and infoboxes). Nobody is disputing that notability is required, the reason we have AfD at all (instead of having admins just zap every article on sight) is because notability is subjective. As for WP:BIO - that is about people, not songs, so does not apply here. Taken absolutely literally, the phrase "the subject..." in WP:N actually implies that the article subject should be the ONLY subject of a cited work - which is evidently absurd if interpreted as a requirement - I would guess that almost no sources meet this requirement. As the literal interpretation makes no sense, I would be more inclined to interpret it as "<i>a</i> subject" - if "the primary subject" is actually what was meant, then the guideline page should say so. This is actually just a semantic argument over something which isn't cast-iron policy anyway. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 17:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Major chart hit by notable band. This is a somewhat less clear cut case than <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Who%27s_Your_Daddy__%28song%29_4b2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Who's Your Daddy?

<ul>
<li>Doesn't matter that it was a major hit. That's not enough information to write an article from. Now why, by the way, do you say this is a less clear cut case? What's the difference, exactly? —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 13:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Simply because this was a major hit, but not a No.1 hit. It's not <i>that</i> much less clear cut, to be honest. We may well disagree as to whether there is enough verifiable information to write an article from. A relatively simple stub is fine, it does not have to be War and Peace. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 17:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable enough to stand as an aricle in its own right. The only Lordi track that can be regarded as notable enough to get a separate article is <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Hallelujah_de8f.html" title="Hard Rock Hallelujah">Hard Rock Hallelujah</a>, for its historical significance.

<li><b>Delete</b> all articles on single songs. (Yes it's a silly and non-consensus reason, but no less so than the keep votes above.)
