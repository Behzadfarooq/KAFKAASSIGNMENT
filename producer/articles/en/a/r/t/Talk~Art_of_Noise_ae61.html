<dd>Yes (if you'll pardon the pun} and no, mate. The basic origins of the Art Of Noise are highlighted into the splendid booklet that accompanies the recent box-set 'And What Have You Done With My Body, God?' - Langan, Jeczalik and Dudley were part of Trevor Horn's production crew (as Engineer, Programmer and Arranger accordingly). Horn, as a previous member of Yes, had left the band as a full-timer but was hired to mix the 90125 album; Langan and Jeczalik were the main collaborators on this project. When the mix was rejected by Yes, Horn bitterly stomped off back to his team... who turned round and presented him with a tape of a little thing the two of them had cooked up with a rejected drumloop from the Yes sessions and a VW sample. Horn was galvanised by this recording to launch the ZTT Label under the auspices of Chris Blackwell's Island Records (a man who on first listen of the tape, insisted that they should be ZTT's first band - "...<b>then</b> you'll have a label.") So, it was a whole collage of sounds (including some that had been cribed from the Yes sessions) that made up the foundations of the Art Of Noise - the band itself however, was pretty much in place as a working concern already. (Indeed, it was this undermining belief that Langan, Jeczalik and Dudley were really no more than Horns 'house band' that led to them splitting away...).

<p><i>The band is considered to be among the pioneers of electronic music.</i></p>
<p>I might have thought of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karlheinz_Stockhausen_5bc8.html" title="Karlheinz Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> (for example) as being a pioneer of electronic music.

<dd>The thing is not many have heard of Karlheinz Stockhausen, but in the 1980's and early 90's the Art of Noise was very big, and very different than most of the music out there. Since electronic music didn’t really become popular until say the late 1990's, most of the artists where relying on music they heard as younger adults or kids, namely the Art of Noise. Also the Art of Noise tended to do a bit more computer generated sounds than Stockhausen, which is the real pull of the modern electronic music scene, but I while I am not totally familiar with all the works of Stockhausen myself, please correct me if needed. Also you may be right in classifying the electronic music of today as electronic pop--<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.0.140.167.html" title="User:67.0.140.167">67.0.140.167</a> 07:45, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether or not people have heard of him is not really the issue. The issue is, was he a pioneer of electronic music? - perhaps, he certainly pre-dates the Art of Noise and he has been well known internationally for several decades. The fact that Stockhousen pre-dates the use of computers and manufactured electronic instruments only emphasises the extent to which he was a pioneer. I feel this quite strongly, when I was listening to Stockhausen in the 70s, it was considered quite strange by many of my peers, some years later, the electronic textures became mainstream - suddenly the bizarre had become normal. Whatever role the Art of Noise played, and I really do enjoy their work it, the above statement does seem to me to need some sort of qualification. The Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">electronic music</a> says that artists at this time: <i>developed entirely new ways of making popular music by electronic means.</i> - which is a reasonable statement.--<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 08:31, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it "Art Of Noise" or "<i>The</i> Art Of Noise"? Even their own releases aren't consistent about it. I note that the page, as it stands, votes for "<i>The</i> Art Of Noise". --Larry Hastings 12:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In initial releases, the band called itself <i>The Art of Noise</i>. Recently, the band has called themselves <i>Art of Noise</i> (sans "The") in their last few major releases. Anne Dudley (AoN's composer and musician) herself refers to it as <i>Art of Noise</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. I consider the voice of one of their members to be canonical.

I corrected the implication that the band started out using <i>The</i>, which is not entirely true. Here is a photo of the cover of the second 12" single and the word THE is nowhere to be seen, whereas 'Into Battle' and 'Who's Afraid' both use 'The'!!! Briantist 09:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that it was a #1 makes me say maybe, but the sample isn't a very important component of the song, so I'm leaning toward no. —<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 07:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of what I can remember of the song, the sample was used at the end of every line, making it a pretty fundemental part of the song, and the rythem. It's also somewhat ironic that they probably made more money from the success of their own 'sampled' song being sampled in another song, than the original itself. - Gary 28th July <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.27.96.39 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.27.96.39_410d.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.27.96.39">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Now, is this true? ""Moments In Love"—a ten-minute, downtempo, instrumental ode to sex that appeared on both Into Battle and Who's Afraid—was remixed and released as a single in 1985"</p>
<p>Yes, the version that appears on both "into battle" (except the cassette version) and the album is ten minutes. But it's not really instrumental, it features a lead vocal, singing "Moments in Love", "In love, in love", "in, in" and various other permutations thereof. "Close (to the Edit)" is closer to being an actual instrumental. And is it an "ode to sex"? The Art of Noise were faceless and bodyless, and the song proceeds at a snail's pace. The vocal line is angelic; I don't think I hear any breathing and moaning ... maybe Paul Morley said it was about sex in an interview once (sources, please?), but the record sounds positively etheral; "in love" with nothing and no one in particular; fully clothed in Victorian garb and floating through the air. 85.165.5.149 13:20, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just been trying to track down this story of how "we were voted the second best new black act." I can't find any specifics whatsoever. I remember the story at the time (1984 or 1985) ... but not with specifics. What award, given by who, verifiable third-party references? Is there any evidence this wasn't just a PR story? - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:50, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So close but no cigar. It's something that's missing from the article but I need the time to do the proper research (and I'm a DJ and it's approaching christmas and I dont have time to break wind - and if someone wants to do it for me...!!)</dd>
<dd>On the release of Beatbox, it was adopted very successfully by the danceclubs in the States, so much so that the band were put up for an American magazines Best New <i>Black</i> Dance Act of 1984 Award - and won it. So you can imagine the surprise when a bunch of white people from England got THAT news through the post...
