<li><b>comment</b> Comparisons of Bush and Hitler are fairly widespread (as a quick Google search will confirm). While Wikipedia should definitely not have an article actually comparing Bush to Hitler, and should probably not have an article under this particular title, an acknowledgement of the existence of such comparisons (without endorsing them) would be appropriate and could probably, with some effort, be made NPOV. -- <a href="../../../a/v/o/User%7EAvocado_d936.html" title="User:Avocado">Avocado</a> 23:50, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Kappa flippant responses don't help here. It is a valid point. However, and sorry to harp on this topic again, but wikipedia could have a very good niche with respect to schools if these school district lists made some attempt to clarify hierarchy. In other words, which elementary schools feed into which middle schools into which high schools. Even on the school district official web pages this information is often missing (are hard to find). If wikipedia wants to do something very constructive with regard to schools this type of hierarchy would be excellent and non copy vio. While I'm at it, if these lists are not linked to the pages for the relevant communities and visa versa they are not that useful in wikipedia. The first clean up response on these school pages needs to be creating this type of context. Actually you did a very good job with this regard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henderson%2C_Tennessee&amp;diff=24500161&amp;oldid=16024655" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henderson%2C_Tennessee&amp;diff=24500161&amp;oldid=16024655" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 16:06, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK I will be calm...and I thought about your post, <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a>, but as a newcomer, my take on this is that a. this article is not crap, it is someone's home town. b. the author is probably a young person c. there are similar articles about unincorporated communities, this one needs time to emerge, and c. to put all this in Wiki Lingo -- <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome_anonymous_editing_56ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome anonymous editing">Wikipedia:Welcome anonymous editing</a>.

To have them appear in 6 hours, before these kids have a chance to upload their photos and other text, will scare them off.

<li>No, it's <i>not</i> someone's hometown. This is not a separate community; it's either a neighbourhood or a housing subdivision <i>within</i> their hometown, which is a city called <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth%2C_Nova_Scotia_b76f.html" title="Dartmouth, Nova Scotia">Dartmouth</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:33, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay. The article on <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth%2C_Nova_Scotia_b76f.html" title="Dartmouth, Nova Scotia">Dartmouth</a> has a list of neighbourhoods within the city. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crichton_Park_ab80.html" title="Crichton Park">Crichton Park</a> has been sitting redlinked on that list for months, equivalent to unquestionably valid articles like <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cole_Harbour%2C_Nova_Scotia_4d52.html" title="Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia">Cole Harbour</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Passage%2C_Nova_Scotia_0ff3.html" title="Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia">Eastern Passage</a>. So that means that it's a legitimate neighbourhood. Accordingly, I'm down with the <b>keep</b> side of this, with the proviso that it needs some cleanup. I've already created a temporary redirect from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crichton_Park%2C_Nova_Scotia_992c.html" title="Crichton Park, Nova Scotia">Crichton Park, Nova Scotia</a> to this title; if the article is kept, it needs to be moved to the disambiguated title since I can virtually guarantee that there are other Crichton Parks in the world. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:45, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This article needs more context. The original article gave little but subsequent edits have provided a better understanding. It looks like it is a small neighbourhood in the former municipality of Dartmouth, and now the Halifax Regional Municipality.

<li>Hey hold on a sec, am the original arthor of this article. Am still a bit new to the site but I found the webcomic list and, being a cartoonist, added mine onto it. The thing said "Webcomic without an article would be deleted". I added an article, updated it and am now keeping watch over it. Yeah it hard to search for, but many Comic Genesis comics don't have search links, aren't picked up by other search engines, or you have to go direct (i.e: use the whole address, not just the name) to look for it. You can't delete the article just for that. C'mon.</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> - There is a problem with the inclusion criteria for webcomics, being that it is too lax. If the webcomic is not popular, has no real influence within the webcomic community and the outside community, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_FactBites_2nd_nom_07db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/FactBites 2nd nom">This website</a> will probably be deleted, even though it has had some mention in the outside press and is probably a lot popular than this comic. That's because it's a website, and people are judging it as so. Because of overly slack guidelines at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>, many non notable comics have been left on Wikipedia, and I believe this to be one of them. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:25, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

The entry belongs there for the time being. If it picks up a lot of readers and gains some sort of influence/notoriety within the webcomic and or wider community, then you could always copy it back over. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 12:21, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>&#160;:( Peachy. Two questions: 1.What do you guys mean by notability?</li>
</ul>
<p>and 2. Will it still remain on the webcomic list despite the article being over in comiPedia?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Reply, it will not be in the wikipedia List of Comics. Some aspects of notability - Is it extremely popular/well known? Has it received critical reviews from respected webcomic journals? the wider press? Generally, what has this webcomic done, which would lift it over the others. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:02, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sure <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, which ran several season, was a top-rated show. <i>Super Mario World</i> was a thirteen episode Saturday morning cartoon, and is hardly as notable. The "they did it, so we can too" reasoning is not a valid defense of the existence of this article, especially since the other twelve episodes aren't covered. Why not , if plot synopses are desired, mae on article with all of them.

<li>Spongebob is certainly popular, but one could easily argue that this is at least as important, being part of the Mario phenomenon which has been going strong for more than 20 years now and with no end in sight. One could make a very convincing case that Mario is the most consistently-popular character of the past quarter-century. Have a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_best_selling_computer_and_video_games.html" title="List of best selling computer and video games">List of best selling computer and video games</a> and note that 4 of the top 5 bestselling games for all platforms are Mario titles. Who knows where Spongebob will be in 20 years? This is why I tend to be very inclusionist with pop-culture stuff... oftentimes, notability is in the eye of the beholder. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 11:58, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>True, Buffy is much more notable than this short lived cartoon show, so comparing the two is maybe not the best argument, but I'm going to vote keep anyway.

<li>I'm sorry Highbreed, but I'll have to vote <b>delete</b>. First of all, I don't think that a disambig for Highbreed is necessary..the word Highbreed refers to nothing except your username. Merging the bit about MMORPGs to <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> wouldn't also be a really good idea in my opinion, since your opinion doesn't really add new information to the article. I assume that most of the words which you want to move to Wiktionary already have articles, but we could add those entries. We can't however move that whole section to Wiktionary, since that would be violating the Guides of Style on Wiktionary. And don't forget to mark your posts using four tildes ~~~~; it makes things less confusing for both of us&#160;:P -- <a href="../../../s/o/o/User%7ESoothingR_cd35.html" title="User:SoothingR">SoothingR</a> 11:04, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hey I did not mean that I am gonna move the whole page to wikitionary. I mean just some of the definition of terms. That's why I said I am going to rename it because It isn't really supposedly to be highbreed. Okay I will reopened it by the name of MMORPG</p>
<p>hey this is me again. Just wanted to remind you people that you can help edit my page since I already gave my username and passwrod. Okay</p>

<p>I vote <b>undelete</b> because the information quite interesting although, the page sure needs a lot of work from the experts.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Hey the page is worthy. It's just that it needs more restructuring and editing. <b>Keep</b> Cursed user talk zoe for starting the deletion page. Grrrrrr</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Wrote the article, so I won't vote, but its like Mysdia said, it is a large community. Also, the forums are not well know in the ENTIRE CS community (which could easily consist of 1 billion+ people) but are very well known in the CS customization community.

I admit, I'm not a CS buff of any kind, but I've never heard of CotDG despite being fairly well-informed about computer/video gaming in general. Has it had any mentions in press, either gaming press or mainstream? How has it influenced the modding community as a whole? The answers to these sorts of questions help establish notability, and it seems like this is a borderline case. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 09:00, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable CS forum and skin designers. The article itself confirms this, and the 85 <i>unique</i> hits for "Clan of the Dead Goat" confirms that it doesn't have a wide presence.

<li><b>Keep</b> all of this verifiable information about famous works. Do not merge as this information applies equally to three different articles (the book, and 2 movies). Merging it into another article, would inevitably mean the comparison information would become redundant in each of the three articles. The suggestion of the merging it into the article about the 2005 film is especiallly bad. The 2005 film is a re-adapatation of the book, *not* a sequel to the 1971 film. Hence comparisons of the 1971 film to the book, would not belong in an article about the 2005 film. Information in this table is simply beyond the scope of any of the three other articles. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 18:16, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I have done two shows thus far, one using all songs with American states names and another with American city names. I have also used the Nonsense title song list for a show. As an aside, I find it interesting that it is the "delete" folks, the "Nay Sayers" if you will, voting here who seem to need to justify their vote by writing mean, insulting and/or derogatory comments. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 01:19, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>DoubleSign Astrology is a branch of Astrology</b> Hey guys... I'm Walter J. Kin, who happened to be founder of DoubleSign.com which uses DoubleSign Astrology as its main basis for matching people. DoubleSign.com, by the way, has more than 55,000 registered members. But I'd rather talk about DoubleSign (or New) Astrology. It's not my invention and is very popular among readers. Inventor of DoubleSign Astrology <a href="http://www.suzannewhite.com/SuzanneBio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.suzannewhite.com/SuzanneBio.html" rel="nofollow">Suzanne White</a> published her first book "The New Astrology" in 1985 and this book (along with 3 others that discuss DoubleSigns) sold in millions in 15 languages. You can check www.SuzanneWhite.com and Yahoo News about her.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>I did removed my name from the article if it seems to be unacceptable for any reason.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I also mentioned 5 other astrology experts, bestselling authors that wrote books about combined DoubleSign tradition in DoubleSign Astrology. As you can see on Google search for "DoubleSign" produces 14,600 results, search for <b>Suzanne White</b>, returns <b>38,000 pages</b>. When I search for <b>The New Astrology</b>" I get <b>16,200 pages</b>. Another search for phrase "New Astrology" returns <b>35,800 pages</b>. In case it still seems as not enough to recognize DoubleSign Astrology as a branch - here are more Google results for this expression "<b>Combination of Chinese and Western Astrology</b>" returning <b>152,000 pages</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, DoubleSign is a registered trademark (in fact, there are 4 trademarks that contain word DoubleSign) - you can check it on <a href="http://www.uspto.gov" class="external text" title="http://www.uspto.gov" rel="nofollow">US Patent and Trademark Office website</a></li>

<li>"Suzanne White has written COSMOPOLITAN'S annual 50-page horoscope pamphlet in French each year for the past ten years. She has written columns for major publications in both the US and France and in the past few years, has regularly forecasted the future in Chinese Astrology for both Tarot.com and AOL.com."</li>

<li>"1986 THE NEW ASTROLOGY - first published in French as LA DOUBLE ASTROLOGIE by Robert Laffont Publishers Paris. In the same year, THE NEW ASTROLOGY was published by both St. Martins Press (USA) and Macmillan (London). This book still is a long time best seller. It sells over 20,000 per year in the US alone. THE NEW ASTROLOGY also exists and sells well in British English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Polish and Czech. This book's concept is unique. White blended Chinese Astrology with Western Astrology thus inventing 144 "NEW" astrological signs. (12 animal signs combined with 12 sun signs makes 144 "new" character types). It's amazingly accurate. Suzanne White actually created 144 NEW character types."</li>

<p>Lukin is a <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muay_thai.html" title="Muay thai">muay thai</a> fighter, according to the article. I have been unable to verify the article through Google. (Pavle lukin muay thai) doesn't get any relevant results and neither does "Pavle lukin".

<p>Non-notable actor.

<dd>First, thank You for calling attention to my spelling error. The name should be 우 대갱 / Thus U Dae-Kyeong. I have moved the article. Second, a negative search of the Internet is hardly adequate basis for non-notability - especially in creative, noncommercial areas. If You live in Korea, You could call the Nonsan Culture and Arts Center at 041-734-0815, since they just had a showing of U's works, and ask them about his notability. Third, where is notability (i.e., <i>that</i> it is relevant and <i>what</i> constitutes it) discussed: I searched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> and the word is not used.</dd>

<p>Fourth, invitational international showing would seem to me to be at least prima facie evidence of notability in the visual arts. <a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdammers_e118.html" title="User:Kdammers">Kdammers</a> 03:26, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>QUESTION</b> You state that <i>it's very much a real merger, and very much not original research</i> but all the work seems limited to the two authors cited as references (and presumably this article has been authored by them or a related party). As such, is it accepted enough to justify inclusion here?

<ul>
<li>Your presumption is wrong; much of the text was originally written by me in a post on a web forum not too long ago (and plagiarised when included here), and I'm very much neither Cox nor Palethorpe. Cox and Palethorpe seem to have been involved in a relatively high proportion of what's been published on Australian English phonology in the last decade (or perhaps my searching methods are geared towards finding stuff by them...), and I haven't seen anything on the Victorian merger except by them. (But then, I'm not a linguistics student/linguist and haven't read all that much.) I've never been too concerned about the lack of diversity in authorship because as a merging speaker living in a predominately merging community I've made and heard many puns/been confused by the homophony on a number of occasions. There seems to be more diversity on authorship of the merger in New Zealand, but as I say I haven't read much on that so can't talk much about it... —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> <span class="usertalk">(<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary"><span title="Ae hI: ja" class="IPA">ɑe hɪː jɐ</span></a>)</span> 23:28, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

It doesn't need a separate article. Some of it also seems quite odd, if not incorrect (like the bit about it being the only feature shared between NZ and VIC but not the rest of Australia, which I'm sure is not the case - the word "chance", for instance, is pronounced the same in VIC as in NZ, but not as in the rest of Australia). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 01:19, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>

<li>The "a" is as in "part" in NZ and Victoria. In many other parts of Australia it is as in "pants". In SA and Tasmania, it is slightly closer to the "a" in "fall". The same pronunciation is found in the word "advance" - it is often possible to pinpoint which state an Australian comes from by asking them the name of their national anthem. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 06:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>

There's no cut-off for heavyweights, all weights are allowed of boxing, so before the weigh-in, you'd just sign up for the next class.

<li>Well, I was just going by what the article claims. I haven't been able to verify the specific claims made in the article; as it says in the article itself, this seems to be a difficult phrase to search for, since most hits are copies of or references to a "list of bizarre holidays". Also, curiously enough, Yahoo search returns significantly more hits for the phrase than Google does. What little I have been able to verify includes:
<ol>
<li>There is such a thing as "ask a stupid question day". It's not <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a>.</li>
<li>At least some schools mention it in their calendars for September, although I've so far found no evidence of official observation (see <a href="http://www.gaston.k12.nc.us/departments/sss/oldpages/Tidbitsv4i1.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gaston.k12.nc.us/departments/sss/oldpages/Tidbitsv4i1.pdf" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://www.bucksiu.org/pennridge/psd/menu2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bucksiu.org/pennridge/psd/menu2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>).</li>
<li>It is mentioned in at least some publications intended for teachers (<a href="http://teachers.net/gazette/SEP02/today.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://teachers.net/gazette/SEP02/today.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://jl058.k12.sd.us/Updated_Mrs._Lamb's_Classroom_Website/holidaypageaugsept.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://jl058.k12.sd.us/Updated_Mrs._Lamb's_Classroom_Website/holidaypageaugsept.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>).</li>
<li>At least some teachers use it as a classroom theme (see <a href="http://maranausd.org/tm/documents/2004fsspecialed.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://maranausd.org/tm/documents/2004fsspecialed.pdf" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> page 19).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make of that what you will. In my opinion the thing has sufficient legitimacy to justify it having an article, even if it might be better written than it currently is.

<p>Hi, this entry was copied from my website www.simonjenkins.co.uk and is an attempt to explain to people what is actually happening in the real world. We are all familiar with government spin and dentists know that government is forcing them into private practice and then accusing them of going into private practice. For the full detail please see my website above, if you decide this is not an appropriate entry into Wikipedia then so be it, but it is the truth.</p>

<p>Two for one! Two different bands named Prussian blue, both apparent vanity, both crappy articles. The first one is an english band, with an empty entry on AMG but no other hint to WP:MUSIC. The second I'm not sure about. It's an "aryan pride" duo of young twin girls, who do claim to have done a national tour. I've tried, but can't verify this (nor do I know what counts as a tour, since they seem to be tied up with the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Vanguard_9439.html" title="National Vanguard">National Vanguard</a> organization). No AMG entry, hard to google.

<li><b>Comment</b>: An article should add value - if I follow the link to the book from <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandurang_Vaman_Kane_9776.html" title="Pandurang Vaman Kane">Pandurang Vaman Kane</a>, I'd find it a duplication of material well placed in the Kane article. Either the info about the book should be expanded or it should be made a re-direct to Pandurang Vaman Kane. Also, it may be pertinent to point out that Machaon is the author of the Afd. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 06:13, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This article is about a book by a particular author, who also has an independent article in wikipedia. Here, the issue is duplication of some texts from the article about the writer. In my opinion, to begin a stub, sometimes such duplication/ same contents with minor changes would be inevitable. This has perhaps happened in this instance. Over a period of time, other editors shall surely add relevant materials and this page shall continue to grow and the contents shall have further value addition. As such, there appears no justification to delete this page on the ground of duplication of contents. The contents should be allowed to mature. I am not sure, but I may add that the page may be moved to a page name 'History of Dharmasastra, book' or something similar. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 09:46, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hm. Yes, <b>keep</b> - and definitely renamed, so as to distinguish the history of Dharmasastra from the <i>History of Dharmasastra</i>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 16:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> and definitely rename - sorry for listing the article on afd. Now I am clear about the purpose of having an article on the book as well. would edit both the pages on the book and the author significantly by the end of this month to reduce unnecessary duplication. Pls suggest a better re-name (am thinking of ---(book)). Hope this serves as a lesson to me before crying wolf on Afd in future. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 06:04, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think the present title of the article would also be ok.

But it could of course as well be called "History of Dharmasastra (book)" or "History of Darmasastra - Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India". --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMachaon_0184.html" title="User:Machaon">Machaon</a> 10:20, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I found this article by following a link on Talk:Joseph Blanchette. The link admits to cheating, and that article was deleted in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Joseph_Blanchette_9f0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joseph Blanchette">this AfD</a>. Whilst I have no opinion, I think this article should also been seen by AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons given on the talk pages of both articles, as well as my objections to the original VfD on the other article. And the "cheating" line was probably a joke, man.

<li><b>Keep</b> (disclosure: I created this page). I'm not sure I can say much more than what I've already said elsewhere. If we are to have any articles on flash animated artists/series at all (and we certainly do), then Legendary Frog is more than notable enough for inclusion. (I have a much bigger defence for keeping this article, in the article's talk page - please go there.) In any case, whatever the outcome of this vfd, I'm relieved that this issue will finally see some formal resolution. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_oojah_611f.html" title="User:Wandering oojah">Wandering oojah</a> 15:02, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, as for my comment about 'cheating', yes, I was mostly joking.

<p>Not the case. Coventry and North Warwicks Cricket Club is a long-established cricket club in the first ever cricket league in the world. It is also a club with a close association with arguably the most successful County side in modern times (Warwickshire County Cricket Club). Perhaps the relevance and importance of this imformation being on wikipedia is lost on a Canadian, but people's areas of interest are wide and varied and being so dismissive about information some people will useful and informative has no place on an Encyclopedia site. <b>Keep</b>.

<li>It's true that this band spells its name "Parafinalia," but under the criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> the band does not appear to qualify for a Wikipedia entry yet. The purpose of the redirect would not be to help people find the band, but to help people find the word "paraphernalia" which is often misspelled. Looking up "Parafinalia" on Google I find several references such as "Pipes, Rolling Papers, and Marijuana Parafinalia," or "There was plenty of drug parafinalia in plain sight," or "im telling you depeche mode would never use drug parafinalia to promote themselves" [<i>sic</i> in all cases]. I'm not finding references to the band. So <b>redirect</b> (non-speedily, the article merits a full AfD) as per Brighterorange. If the band becomes successful, they can have a proper article at that time. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:11, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's no content on this page that is not already on <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powergen_Cup_61bd.html" title="Powergen Cup">Powergen Cup</a>. The situation occured because the Challenge Cup (known as Powergen Cup) was abandoned and a new Anglo-Welsh tournament was created in its place. So I created the article. It was then announced that the tournament would also be sponsored by Powergen and use the Powergen cup name. I'm pretty sure the original trophy is still used. Then somebody else creates an Anglo-Welsh section on the Powergen Cup page. I don't really care what is decided but merger has already happened.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 13:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> - I just tidied it up a bit, but there is really no more information than can go into an infobox. These school pages are only useful if they have context with other wikipages. This appears to have no context. Any author who creates a school page should be required to also build a page for the school district and describe how all the schools in that district feed into each other. Also, they should make appropriate links to the local community pages that are in wikipedia. Ironically Henderson, Tn does not appear to have a page. If the appropriate context is not there, and no one is willing to do the work to determine the context, I agree that this page, and similar pages, should be deleted until someone is willing to do it properly. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 17:31, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK i found the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henderson%2C_Tennessee_0ac7.html" title="Henderson, Tennessee">Henderson</a> page, however, the author has not bothered mention the school on this page. Why make a page if you can't even be bothered to mention it on the town page. These contributions to wikipedia are random events that get lost in the noise and are not helping to improve the product. In my view this is why these school articles keep getting put up for deletion, and why not? If the author can't even be bothered who will rescue this article and do it correctly? If someone cares it will be done correctly the first time until then i see no reason not to delete these contextless schools. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 17:40, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sjakkalle is correct. CSD A7 applies specifically and only to articles on individual persons whose notability was not asserted in the article. If this page was indeed speedily deleted under the impression that CSD A7 was applicable to it, it was improperly deleted. I hope, Wile E. Heresiarch, that you would consider restoring it for the duration of the AfD, failing which it shall be nominated for undeletion at VFU.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 10:56, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to clarify: As Wile E. Heresiarch himself writes above, the wording of A7 specifically states that it covers articles about <b>"a real person"</b>. Since general consensus seems to be to interpret speedy deletion criteria rather strictly, the use of singular is generally taken to mean that it covers articles about <b>one and only one person</b>, not bands, clubs or any similar groups. I don't doubt that the band was non-notable, but since speedying can be rather controversial, and once done also non-transparent to the ordinary user, what we need isn't rules-stretching, but better (i.e. wider, but specific and unambiguous) criteria. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 12:43, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-Notable Person. Just because she was Jay Leno's agent doesn't mean she is notable and qualifies for a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. As Hollywood agents go, she was pretty controversial. <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Bates_d2bd.html" title="Kathy Bates">Kathy Bates</a> won a Golden Globe and was Emmy-nominated for playing her in the TV movie <i>The Late Shift</i> (about the Jay Leno-David Letterman rivalry), so I think some people might want to look her up in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:02, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is so little info available about her online, and much of it is very biased against her; she co-founded an <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> awareness organization and much of her work in her later life (post-Tonight Show) was involved with AIDS research. Further, she is an important figure in the "late night wars," whether or not people want to acknowledge her role in severing the relationship b/w <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Leno_9d45.html" title="Jay Leno">Leno</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Letterman_d46f.html" title="David Letterman">Letterman</a>. She was a representative for several other <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> figures besides Leno, and in many ways was famous in her own right, and so my vote is to keep this article with expansions. Telestylo 07:05, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Her role in the 'late night wars' alone makes her notable, if not for exemplifying how not to handle a client. Being Jay Leno's agent is not what makes her notable; his current agent - whoever that is - is certainly not notable. But she was particularly notorious in hollywood for many years, particularly because the tonight show is such an important show for the industry. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspersions_d055.html" title="User:Aspersions">Aspersions</a> 07:05, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am not convinced Arne passes the average professor test. If the article were created today I'd be tempted to speedy it for not making any assertion of notability - however this article has been around since <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">19 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> and has attracted only 4 minor edits since then, including the <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConversion_script_2b4d.html" title="User:Conversion script">Conversion script</a> and my addition of the afd tag (the first edit in over a year). There are a grand total of two inbound links.</p>
<p>Because of its age this article has been picked up by just about every Wikipedia mirror site going, making raw google hit numbers irrelevant. Almost all the other hits seem to be directory type listings. The lack of an interwiki to the Sweedish Wikipedia makes me doubt he is significantly more notable in that language, but my knowledge of Sweedish extends to one word - Igelkott (<a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedgehog.html" title="Hedgehog">Hedgehog</a>) - so I cannot say. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:22, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wow, the weird things one finds in Wiki-land. <b>Keep</b> -- since the article has been here forever, I give it the benefit of the doubt and presume it is notable. As nom. suggests, its age also makes it unclear what set of criteria to apply to judge it. Absent a positive case that this fellow is non-notable, I think such an established, if obscure, article does no harm in remaining.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps because a lot of people don't consider "notability" to be a major factor in whether something's worthy of having an article about it in an encyclopedia, or disagree with your assessment of this person's notability? There are articles on <a href="../../../b/r/f/Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116.html" title="Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116">Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_8._Lee_9f70.html" title="Jennifer 8.

<li>Jennifer 8. Lee writes for the New York Times. The naming of Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116 was at least a protest against Swedish naming laws.

<li>No, but the fact that he's named <i>Optimus Prime</i> makes him more notable than hundreds of thousands of others who have. Why can't someone be notable because of their name? You've already granted Brf...116 a pass in that regard, and Jennifer 8. Lee's notability as a Times writer doesn't appear to be the reason why the article was written either considering how much of it's focused solely on her name - there's as much about her job in her article as there is about Prime's job in his article. I don't see why the fact that the name was self-chosen in Prime's case would make a difference. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:23, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>At the very least, assume good faith. My vote is based mostly around the fact that it's already survived the VfD process, but I do believe he's notable enough to warrant an article and would have voted keep then, too. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 15:22, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm trying to assume full good faith, but I just don't see any reasonable basis being given as to why he is notable. Surely you realize there are probably thousands of people with names just as unusual as "Optimus Prime"; Mr. Prime just happens to be one of a few who've received mention in their local newspaper.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 15:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sure there is a pretty large number of people who change their names to something a bit bizarre. If they recieve media attention and/or do something a little out of the ordinary (this guy, for instance, was deployed in Iraq and his military ID also reflects his new name, which is fascinating), I'll vote to keep them every time. If I have a kid and decide to name him <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Underpants_7c43.html" title="Captain Underpants">Captain Underpants</a>, he's not going to be notable until there's a reason to notice him, such as a newspaper article or something he does.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even if someone does something just to become notable, that doesn't prevent them from becoming notable for doing it. This person has found a unique way to become more interesting and notable than the average National Guardsman. <i>"Optimus Prime comes home from Iraq."</i> I love it.

<li><b>Keep</b> as this is an article about a member of the National Guard with a notably unusual and bizarre namewho has received ample press coverage, and is duly noted at <a href="../../../u/n/u/Wikipedia%7EUnusual_articles_dd7d.html#Language_and_names" title="Wikipedia:Unusual articles">Wikipedia:Unusual_articles#Language_and_names</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 18:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It actually got merged into that article for a while after the first VfD. However, the merged material didn't fit very well and wound up pared down to the snippet that's currently in the "see also" section so the person-stuff was split off into its own article again. I suspect the same would happen now, the Optimus Prime article is even bigger than it was back then. Besides, how would the merged article be categorized? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:40, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
