<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball. 43 years from now is a long time from now; we can make an article when the subject becomes encyclopedic: how sure can we be that there actually will be such an election? There could be a constitutional ammendment to change the presidential term from 4 years to 5 years, for instance.

<li><b>Delete</b> Worse case of crystal ball. We don't even have an article on the U.S. presidential election, 2016, why should we have an article on 2048? --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 20:43, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>User:Wolfpackfan72: How in the world did you find my artical so darn fast, I put it up 5 miniuts ago? And are you from france? Of cource, bw will have an election in 2048!</li>
<li>User:Wolfpackfan72: We have an artical up about 2008, what's the diffrence? Okay, so a couple of years, but this is not fictional, it really will happen. Scientists and theolagists speculate all the time about things that can't be proven.
<ul>
<li>2048? Of course there's a slight chance that there might not be a 2008 election (nuclear winter, asteroid impact, etc), the chance that there won't be a 2048 election is exponentially higher. Of course, all that aside even, the difference is, as WP:NOT says, preparation is already underway for the 2008 Presidential election, and there has been much talk and discussion over it. I really hope you're not serious. –<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadniGeneral_d205.html" title="User:ArmadniGeneral">ArmadniGeneral</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmadniGeneral_7b01.html" title="User talk:ArmadniGeneral">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ArmadniGeneral_f664.html" title="Special:Contributions/ArmadniGeneral">contribs</a>) 21:01, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete/Comment</b>. In accordance with WP:NOT. Plus, just curious, why would the 2048 Election be held in 2008?

<li><b>Comment</b> Wolfpackfan, the article would not be anything substantial for 43 years, it is not the same as an article like <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Presidential_election%2C_2008_b4d0.html" title="U.S. Presidential election, 2008">U.S. Presidential election, 2008</a>. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 20:59, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>User:Wolfpackfan72: I am very serious, Our country has been around for more than 200 years, In that time we have faced: Two wars w/ britan, a civl war, the KKK, the Nazis, the Japeniees, the USSR, Comuniist China, The Great depreession, a terroriset attack, and even Bill Clinton!</li>
<li>User:Wolfpackfan72: And you must really all be from France. Your acting like the USA will not live on forever, your just being silly.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> it seems to me more than the crystal ball argument, there is a notability concern There is simply nothing of note to say about this.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator.

There is <b>not</b> a large quantity of notable, verifiable <i>speculation</i> about the event, so speculation about the event is not a verifiable or otherwise encyclopedic topic.

<li>User:Wolfpackfan72:I found it! The smoking gun! Evreyone, check the 2008 artical, now go back in the history to the earlyist entry. It was posted in MARCH 2004, when the "event was not in progress", no one complained then.</li>

<li>I would disagree, the election is only 43 years (and one month) off. The youngest person to ever be president was Teddy Roosevelt, at 42. (Kennedy, at 43, was the youngest ever elected.)

<p>How? You were asking how could your article have been discovered so quickly?</p>
<p>Matthew, it's impossible to make a change to an article on Wikipedia without having it instantly show up on the "Recent Changes" list. And it's impossible to make a new article without having it instantly show up on the "New Articles" list. And it's impossible to make a change to an article without instantly having your name (or IP) show up in the article history, even if you didn't sign your name; that's how we know you're the one who tried to vote anonymously to keep the "2048 Presidential Election" article.</p>
<p>We keep track of these things, Matthew.</p>
<p>You're welcome to contribute more articles, but don't be silly, okay? DS 18:35, 3 October 2005 (UTC)<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfpackfan72_8e70.html" title="User:Wolfpackfan72">Wolfpackfan72</a> 19:44, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Matthew Overby hey, this is wolfpackfan72, I didn't try to not sign my name, I'm a fairly new user and I simply didn't know how to. also, I was not being silly, I think the artical was compleatly ligit, people seem to think that things that are a long time away can't be speculated on. It hurt my feelings to hear that you think I would ingage in vandelism. Please write back, however, you seem like a nice guy.</p>

Sorry if I hurt your feelings, Matthew - I was trying to be friendly, but firm - and just so you know, it's a good idea to always sign your name when you leave a comment. You do that by typing <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfpackfan72_8e70.html" title="User:Wolfpackfan72">Wolfpackfan72</a> 19:52, 3 October 2005 (UTC) - that's the "tilde" symbol, four times in a row. If you're a registered user, that creates your signature. If you have IRC, you can join channel #wikipedia on irc.freenode.net and ask for someone to help you out directly; I'd go there to see if I can help you out in person, but I'm a bit busy right now writing some stuff on a deadline.
