From what I've seen the BZPower community are a very professional and above-board group, and I cannot see that this is an officially-sanctioned action. Therefore if we are flooded with rubbish one of us could post about it on their forums, and leave the rest up to the people in charge.

<li>Comment. I had made some changes to the article under its original title, and today discovered that the same original content has been duplicated under the better title that Charles Matthews reported above. For that reason, I put a notice near the top of the original asking people not to edit it, but rather to edit the new one. This series of articles is turning into a valuable in-depth look at several aspects of Manchukuo. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 03:48, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, not your bro, sweetie-pookums.&#160;:) Secondly, a consensus is a general agreement or accord: a decision reached by a group as a whole. There is no way that decitions at wikipedia VFD could ALWAYS be determined by an actual consensus because then it would mean EVERYBODY has to agree on one outcome. As far as I am aware VFD is is supposed to last for around five days at which point an action is supposed to be taken based on the GENERAL consensus of the votes accumulated, and in this case, the majority of the votes indicate that the article should be kept. An 8 to 6 to 3 vote is as close to a consensus as we're going to get, unless you forsee some way to FORCE everyone to vote one way and one way only...?<a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 04:08, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your vote is valid, of course, but I am curious why it should be merged to the energy drink page. Should the rest of the energy drinks that are linked to from the main energy drink page going to be merged as well? If yes, merge it. If not, leave them all on their own individual pages. Is it necessary to do these things on a case by case basis? Do with one drink as is done with the rest. It is given a separate page because there are separate pages for many other energy drinks. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrd00d_a0e1.html" title="User:Mrd00d">Mr d00d!</a> 04:07, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>P.S. If you don't like it as is, why don't you edit it so that it is valid and neutral, non-promo.

<dd>Yes, I tend to think these all these so-called energy drinks are just minor variations on a (snake-oily) theme, and could all be merged into <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_drink.html" title="Energy drink">Energy drink</a>. Unless, that is, there's something about these drinks (either in general or in particular) that has escaped me. I can't easily add to the article, even if I wanted to, as I've never heard of the stuff. There seems to be an assumption that the reader is in some nation where dollars are used; I'm not (we use yen here), and though I'm vaguely aware of a few so-called "energy"/"sports" drinks here (notably the divinely named "Pocari Sweat"), I really don't think that this one is for sale here. What I think is encyclopedic is medical and similar info (see <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=20800" class="external text" title="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=20800" rel="nofollow">this</a> for example). Or again, the main article says <i>energy drinks today are commonly associated with the image of a hacker or IT professional, sitting up late at his computer trying to stay awake. This is not an entirely inaccurate picture</i>; if somebody who's interested in "energy drinks" has the, uh, energy to write more, how about a clarification of this (to me) extraordinarily woolly statement? (Does it mean "Much of the sales of energy drinks are to people who want to stay awake and alert", and if not, what does it mean?) Incidentally, the "energy drinks" sold in the Czech Republic have <a href="http://hoary.org/snaps/czech/fd/fd258u.jpg" class="external text" title="http://hoary.org/snaps/czech/fd/fd258u.jpg" rel="nofollow">more explosive names</a>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:03, 2005 May 5 (UTC)

<p>Explain the nonsensical medical claim, and if you mean "energy stimulance", then you better argue with all the other drinks. Which makes no sense. Also, my email wasn't SPAM because I didnt market anything. I sent an email to you ACCIDENTALLY thanking you for your KEEP vote, but you probably hadnt even seen this page yet. I went to someone's talk page and saw your email there, and assumed it was that persons, because it just said "email me here". I didnt advertise the page or promote it to you, I mistakenly sent you a message that you werent meant to get. You are wrong, sir. And are all people that get nutritional information from a food product, and list a slogan, violating a copyright? No. You are being unreasonable.

<dd><i>Pan tries to blast Naturon Shenron out of the ground by firing energy blasts into the ground. But Naturon Shenron is so deep in the ground that the attacks have no effect on him at all. Pan then stuffs Giru into her backpack. Goku and Pan rushes to the city to help everyone. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 4 and tries to stop an office building from collapsing. Pan rushes around picking up people all over the place to a safe area. When a road was going to crash into the sewers, Goku went underground and stops it. Goku then emerges from a subway station. Naturon Shenron emerges from the ground to admire his handiwork but was furious when the city looks like the earthquake did not affect it at all.</i></dd>

When Goku asks her what wish she was created from, her face turns red with anger and she shouts "THE GIRL'S UNDERWEAR!" This also enrages Pan.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Let the voters review the article for themselves, since it quite clearly already suggests which font to use (Terminal, 10 point, or <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_page_437.html" title="Code page 437">Code page 437</a>) to view this list. IMHO, it's unfair to intentionally excerpt ASCII art borders and exclude the content when the majority of the article is content and not ASCII art borders. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 00:18, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's nothing to stop the reader doing this...except the document size, which makes it almost impossible to view without broadband. Also the fact that the document requires special arrangements just to be viewed properly is in itself a strong suggestion that the document is unencyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have had nothing to do with this article or its earlier VfD. I noted that you had it transwikied and thus we have two copies on WikiMedia's servers (and it *is*, as it happens, the largest article on Wikipedia at present,at nearly 500KB). Normally after transwikying to wikisource I would expect to have the Wikipedia version deleted. I don't want your file to be removed from WikiMedia's servers but this physical duplication is clearly unnecessary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:35, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, no potential to become encyclopedic, no matter what size it is, no matter what its VfD history is. The group seems (barely) notable enough to keep the parent article, but there's no way content like this belongs on WP.

<li>By "uniquely formatted", do you mean "including hidden stuff, such as obfuscated keys to cracked software so people can use Wikimedia servers to work around legal responsibilities"?

<li>The article is not formatted according to <b>any</b> style guide; it's an ASCII data dump with tons of non-text and some filenames and attributes.

<li>When the previous discussion was held, <s>the consensus was to transwiki</s>, which was done incompletely (removal from the WP side wasn't completed). This VfD exists to implement the previous decision. I'm only adding policy reasons why the content shouldn't kept on WP in case the resolving admin thinks this copy should be kept. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:48, 2 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To clarify, in the previous VfD (linked above by Tony S), the votes were approx. 7 Keep (or transwiki-and-still-keep) to 15 for Delete or Transwiki-without-specifying-Keep. The consensus is at the edge of clear deletion, but the admin treated it as consensus to "keep" (an overbroad interpretation of "no clear consensus -&gt; keep by default"), and did not delete the non-article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:57, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>What seems to have happened is that Alkivar unilaterally said that he had transwikied. Then the VfD closer chose to disregard all votes made after this announcement. A little odd, but I won't dispute it. But clearly there is a good argument to be made for deleting a redundant copy of an extremely large, unencyclopedic file. I don't care what intrinsic value it has, even if it's the contents of George Bush's brain it doesn't belong her if it isn't an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:17, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

It's enough to know that a warez group has cracked 500+ titles, without giving out the exact filenames of the cracked versions. WP is not a warez release list.

Anyway, can you give me a reason why all releases of a distributor (legal or illegal) should be put on wikipedia, no matter who it is?

<li>He's a dancer. I found this: "Conor has won the World Championships, All Irelands, British Nationals, and Great Britain's. He was an original cast member of Lord of the Dance and after two years in the show was promoted to lead dancer. He was the original lead in the show that is currently playing in Las Vegas. He left the show after three years to complete a degree in Business Management at LSE in London and is qualified as a stockbroker. He is a member of the Riverdance fly in squad and has also performed in Magic of the Dance and is currently touring as lead dancer once again in Troupe 4 of Lord of the Dance.

</dl>
<p>This page represents a new idea - a portal for Readers. (We do have WikiPortals, but these are for editors and live in Wikipediaspace - this one is for readers.) A lot of hard work and consideration has gone into it. The aim is to allow readers interested in a particular subject, in this instance cricket, to easily navigate between the various pages - or at least the good, well-developed pages. This is why it has been place under the title <a href="../../../c/r/i/Portal%7ECricket_1b4e.html" title="Portal:Cricket">Portal:Cricket</a>. It makes it clear that this is a different type of page, neither Wikipediaspace (which is purely administrative) nor a normal article page.</p>
<p>However, some people wish to kill this idea to promote Wikipedia at birth. After the farce at the VfD page for the original Cricket (portal) page, I am therefore rationalising the discussion by opening it with a clean slate here, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:56, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Still not an article. A move out of the main namespace would be acceptable, but by no means necessary.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Once more with feeling. Am I correct in summarizing the status quo as follows?
<ul>
<li>The main namespace is reserved for articles, with the exception of
<ul>
<li>The unique <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>;</li>
<li>Redirects, which are a technical aid and ideally invisible to readers;</li>
<li>Lists, which serve as ways of ordering either
<ul>
<li>Pieces of information that merit no separate articles or are factored out from articles (the appropriateness of which is disputed by some); or</li>
<li>(Possibly nonexistent) articles by other means than category and title.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disambiguation pages, which are hybrids of article content and pure navigation.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(Note that some of this contradicts <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENamespace_6ef8.html" title="Wikipedia:Namespace">Wikipedia:Namespace</a>, but that only describes what <i>should</i> be the case.)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The Wikipedia namespace is reserved for internal Wikipedia affairs, including all editorial processes like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikipedia:WikiProjects</a>.</li>
<li>The intent of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> is
<ul>
<li>To make information as accessible to reusers as possible by not mentioning Wikipedia in a non-factual way;</li>
<li>To prevent displaying what some see as an unprofessional image by mentioning Wikipedia in a non-notable way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reason this discussion (well, not <i>this</i> one, but this is only the perimeter) has generated so much heat so far is because portals are triggering more than one of these concerns. If you believe the main namespace is good enough for anything useful to readers, then you'll get different results than if you believe it's for articles only, and you'll get different results still if you believe that portals resemble the Main Page, which need not be unique. Likewise, it matters to what extent and for what reason you believe self-references should be avoided, and whether a link to a WikiProject in a portal constitutes a promotion to an "internal Wikipedia affair". A separate namespace might be the best solution simply because we can write new rules for a new namespace. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 09:09, 2005 May 2 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think your summary looks good to me. I'd clarify that one of the reasons this is so contentious is the turf war pushes this portal both ways. This portal is intended not for editors but for readers—say a reader is interested in cricket, this is a way to explore different areas of cricket. I personally think it's a great idea. As a page in the article space, some argue that it should be out of the main namespace and in the Wikipedia space. Fine; {{<a href="../../../p/o/r/Template%7EPortal_d2ae.html" title="Template:Portal">portal</a>}} on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> would be a nice way to let readers of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> know about the other articles. However, another group say that this violates no self-references and remove the portal tag. (Note that the basis is for this instance, as I understand it, is making accessible for reusers, not the unprofessional image). Those (like me) who think it's a good idea argue that the portal, now in Wikipedia space, is unreachable from the article space, so readers (the intended audience) have no way to get to it, rendering a good idea useless. I feel that in the two wars going on, a good page is getting pushed out from both sides. A third possibility is that a page like this is not appropriate for readers and readers should not be directed to it, which would of course resolve the problem, but I haven't seen anyone suggest this so far. The fourth possibility is the creation of the portal namespace, which would solve the problem, assuming links from the main namespace to the portal namespace are allowed. If not, there'd be little point. Also, incidentally, I am arguing from the point of the portal just featuring cricket-related articles and such; I believe links to WikiProjects would be unprofessional and inappropriate (the second reason for the "no self-reference") — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 09:47, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>It seems like the only real issue with putting this portal in the main namespace is that it violates "no self references". This really isn't much of a reason:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1) We can trivially style the link to the WikiProject as an external-style link (as is done at <a href="../../../c/e/t/Category%7ECetaceans_612b.html" title="Category:Cetaceans">Category:Cetaceans</a>). Thus there is no problem for re-users.</li>
<li>2) The original self-reference policy was formulated to avoid things like "Mount Everest is as high as 55 Wikipedias" in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Everest_bc8a.html" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a>. It was never originally applied to things like stub notices.</li>
<li>3) Carrying on from 2). We have thousands of references to Wikipedia in the main namespace. E.g. stubs notices etc... the reason that it is not a problem is that a re-user can easily rewrite the (relatively few) templates to suit their own needs. Often they just use a no-op.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thus <b>KEEP in the main namespace</b>, it is a new, innovative and useful way of presenting information to readers and the problems it raises can be trivially worked around. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 13:10, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The problem with having this article in the main namespace is that it's unencyclopedic and, IMHO, has no potential to become encyclopedic. If there were a Portal: namespace, then this would be okay, but there isn't. <b>Move</b> to Wikipedia: namespace and <b>delete</b> the redirect. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 22:38, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>What does "encyclopedic" mean in this context? We are just trying to open new avenues to our content.

<p><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">User:LeeHunter</a> made a very wise suggestion on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamofascism_0d82.html" title="Talk:Islamofascism">Talk:Islamofascism</a>. His recommendation was to create a page titled Fascism as epithet, which would describe the use of the term <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> as applied to individuals and groups who do not consider themselves Fascist. This would avoid all of the interminable arguments about which [[<i>X</i>ofascism]] should have an article of its own. It would also help alleviate the concerns over the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> article becoming a POV platform. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 07:32, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I strongly disagree with the proposal. That would equate <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, which is a real word used by notable people, with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a>, which is not. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 21:04, May 3, 2005 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>Actually "Christofascism" is a real word used by notable people. See the talk page for a pointer I've provided to real use by a serious theologian. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 02:49, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference, to me, is how notable. Ms. Soelle gets about 200 google hits--maybe not bad for a theologian, but nowhere near 1.6 million for <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a>. There's a clear distinction between the two terms in how often they're used and how prominent the users are. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 02:52, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I may have been unclear. I'm not saying that every neologism needs to be mentioned in the Fascism as epithet article, nor that little-used terms must be given the same amount of space in that proposed article as ones that see a lot of use. What I am saying is that the use of the term "Fascism" to describe individuals and groups who are not self-identified Fascists is a very well-known phenomenon, and that it makes more sense to have a single article for the entire phenomenon than to splinter it up (especially when certain splinter articles, like <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, have become POV springboards to attack the groups in question, rather than to focus on the use of the terms as epithets). "Christofascism" isn't as prominent as "Islamofascism" as a term, but what about other uses of "Fascism" as an epithet? What about terms like "Feminazis" (certainly notable, it was coined and used by <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>), "Hitlery", and "Bushitler"? People have been comparing their political opponents to fascists ever since the end of the Second World War. I think we should have an article on the use of the term "Fascism" as an epithet, and have this article encompass all latter-day uses of such terminology, with article space allocated in rough proportion to the prominence of each term. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 23:17, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Okay, that does clarify things a bit, but I still must disagree. IMO, each instance of notable "X-fascism" should get its own article. The problems you're describing with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> are an argument for watching that article closely and editing it boldly. That doesn't mean we should get rid of the article. An article on <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminazi.html" title="Feminazi">Feminazi</a> would make more sense than merging all these disparate articles together, although <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminazi.html" title="Feminazi">feminazi</a> isn't as well-defined as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 01:37, May 4, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're a hypocrite. You say "IMO, each instance of "X-fascism" should get its own article." but then you vote delete for a very notable X-fascism term.

</ul>

<li><s>I agree with Firebug, and yet I also agree with Meelar. A bit of each. What I think we need is that if a REAL "-fascism" term (not this one!) comes up it can be merged, along with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, into Fascism as (an?) epithet. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 22:13, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</s></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with giving each its own article is that you totally lose the historical context and perhaps the general commentary of people like Orwell re the use of fascism as an epithet. When you see how various groups have used the word to slander their enemies, it is more interesting and enlightening. By the way, the article has been created under the name <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_%28epithet%29.html" title="Fascist (epithet)">Fascist (epithet)</a>. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:34, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I, as the original creator of this article, totally support this compromise.

<li>Meelar, take a look at the article as I have updated it. I included several citations of the use of the term, as well as the likely origins of the term.

<li>It's also worth pointing out that you won't see many major commentators using terms like <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> either, because they are considered to be highly offensive.

<li><b>Do whatever is done with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>.</b> Just as that term has been often used in the right blogosphere, I have often heard terms like "Christofascist", "Jesofascist", and "Jeebofascist" in the left blogosphere. If these articles are kept, they should focus on the epithet itself, not be a list of bad things that <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a> have done. After all, the <a href="../../../z/o/g/ZOG_892b.html" title="ZOG">ZOG</a> article isn't a list of bad things Jews have done, nor is <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> a list of bad things black people have done. That's where I think a lot of the problems with the Islamofascism article lies. I can't speculate as to the creator's motive for this article, but it could have been in good faith. This isn't an extremely well-known term, but most people who regularly visit the left blogosphere will have heard it more than once, and a reasonable argument could be made for keeping the article. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 22:33, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I see nothing here to indicate this word is anything other that a term used by extremist opponents of Christianity. If this is true then it no more deserves an article than "commie traitors" should be a redirect to the Democratic party. HOWEVER this is a very young article. I suggest that this article is given time, say a couple of weeks, to see if anything substansive is found. If not it should be renominated for VFD. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:05, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Okay it's a crap stub. <b>cleanup</b>. Recuperation has a couple of meanings that are very encyclopedic, but I'm not going to do it because I'm getting to feel like a performing monkey. Why don't you just take the initiative and say "Recuperation is gradual recovery from illness." And then you just add some "see also" items and you have a useful stub. This an intrinsically encyclopedic subject because it touches on disease, nursing, medicine, health, psychology and whatnot, so it fits well into the organic environment of a Wiki. <b>keep</b>--<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:36, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: A quick look indicates that "recuperation" is only used with the strange meaning in <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situationist.html" title="Situationist">situationist</a> jargon. That's got to be made clear in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recuperation.html" title="Recuperation">recuperation</a> or WP is going to help kids fail their vocabulary exams. The current state of recuperation is also bogus because the rare, specialized slang meaning is listed first and the common meanings later. The article for <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detournement.html" title="Detournement">detournement</a> is also a problem — it's simply copied from part of <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situationist.html" title="Situationist">situationist</a>. It seems that <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detournement.html" title="Detournement">detournement</a> should just be a explanation that it's situationist jargon with a brief definition and link to <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situationist.html" title="Situationist">situationist</a>. I'd do this myself, but I have hopes that there's someone else here who knew there was such a thing as Situationist International for longer than the last 5 minutes. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 00:42, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>SPEEDIED. No meaningful content or history</b>. There must be a Peter Reed in nearly every English speaking community. I did look at the history--no indication of which person was alleged to be a pedophile. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:02, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
