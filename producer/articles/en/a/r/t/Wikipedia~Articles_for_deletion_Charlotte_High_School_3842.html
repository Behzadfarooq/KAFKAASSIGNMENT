<ul>
<li>If that's your attitude, why bother to delete? You could easily just edit the article to improve it. That is, if one consider wikipedians to be editors and not just robots designed for deleting things. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:18, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I apologise if my comment reads like a personal attack--it isn't my intention. The point is that your vote rationale puzzles me. You clearly think the article contains valuable material, because you want it merged; however you instead vote for delete because you think "such sensible moves would be blocked". I find it hard to avoid the conclusion that you are willing to sacrifice good material simply because you can't get consensus for your preferred merge. You then say "deletion does not prevent future creation with a full article", so naturally I ask you: why bother to delete in the first place? The article can be expanded where it is--if you think it needs to be. For myself I am quite happy with the current contents, so it's silly to ask me to edit it. It's a lovely, bijou little stub sitting there inviting someone who knows about the school to write about it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:53, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your apology. I didn't take personally anyway just as an attack on everyone voting other than keep. I am not keen on schools in wikipedia, at least merging reduces the number of articles about them, but 1 vote to merge amongst all keeps and deletes is a wild goose chase. (and I note some closing admins count them as keeps&#160;;) ) --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimPope_0d3a.html" title="User:TimPope">Tim Pope</a> 16:49, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I generally assume that people who vote to merge want the information to be retained, since they're voting to have it preserved elsewhere on Wikipedia. Is this not your intention? <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 07:49, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Merges <i>are</i> keeps. This is a fact, and not one that has ever been, or ever will be, seriously disputed. When an article is merged, the material is kept and its history is kept.

<ul>
<li>Simply merge the history for the two articles when you do the delete. At least that is what the documentation seems to say you can do. I don't see this as incompatible, just more work. This could explain why so many votes wind up as keep, the admins don't want to do the extra work, and elect to call the vote keep rather than merge and delete. So, maybe this is a good reason to not vote merge and delete, but to simple vote Merge. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:47, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Oh I see. A history merge. That is compatible. However I don't see what is gained from this that couldn't be achieved by simply merging and redirecting without deletion, which unlike a history merge is a reversible operation. I'd suggestion that admins probably don't want to do this precisely because once it's done even a sysop cannot undo it.</li>
<li>Voting merge won't necessarily get you a merge done for you by the closer. Anybody can do a merge so sometimes a sysop will do it (particularly if there is a consensus to merge--ie, merge votes outnumber all non-merge votes by a considerable margin, which is very rare), and often he'll leave that decision up to other editors, who are perfectly capable of doing it themselves.</li>
<li>There isn't a sysop "merge" button that a sysop can press to do a merge, it's an editing operation and often requires good judgement and knowledge of the material that, being chosen maybe for his clerical abilities and general reliability, a sysop does not necessarily have. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:16, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, just so we're clear, you agree your comment "Probably not compatible with the GFDL" was incorrect? Can we further agree that you'll no longer use this as an oft- repeated argument against delete and merge? I'll interpret no response as "yes" and "yes". - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:50, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>For the record, no and no. And it's preposterous to make these little assumptions--what if the editor you're addressing should happen not to read your comment, as I nearly did not? Have you by any chance recently been a denizen of some kind of flame forum?</li>
<li>Clearly it would be impractical to perform such a complex and irreversible procedure just to comply with a license, when a simple paste-and-redirect merge achieves precisely the same result in a reversible manner without any license issues. Also as a closer I'd not expect to see a discussion ending in a consensus "merge and delete", if only because it's a patently perverse vote. Having refined the argument, I shall reuse it to much greater effect. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:37, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
