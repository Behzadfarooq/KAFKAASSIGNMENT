<p><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a>. The "black cop" is such a broad category of characters that I don't see it as an actual archetype. A Google search for <i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22black%20cop%22%20archetype" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22black%20cop%22%20archetype" rel="nofollow">"black cop" archetype</a></i> doesn't turn up any discussion of such an archetype, and certain clues in the text (ie, no possible origin for the archetype offered) makes me think someone is trying to advance an idea without the serious scholarly homework needed to do so. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 08:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> At least for now. This is not neccessarly OR, but certainly lacks references. Google is not holy, especially with difficult search terms like these. Especially in the context of "white cop" "black cop" partnerships, this can be considered a real character type in movies. Should be given the benefit of the doubt for now. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 09:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Respectfully, I disagree. This article is entirely <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> (Wikispeak for "he made it all up!"). It appears to be nothing more than one writer who sat down one day and wrote about a trend he thinks he's personally noticed in films lately. Since Wikipedia is not a source for unpublished personal research, this isn't a practice we'd like to encourage. Additionally, since the trend itself is not particularly well-defined or (in my insufficiently humble opinion) worth remarking upon, I very much doubt we'll <i>ever</i> have anyone attempting the "serious scholarly homework" <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">Hateless</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/t/User_talk%7EHateless_a584.html" title="User talk:Hateless">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hateless_afa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hateless">contribs</a>) refers to. As such, it shall always and only be original research. This "archetype" is not worth an encyclopaedia article just yet, and I doubt it ever will be. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 10:04, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand your opinion, but actually I <i>have</i> read articles about this subject in notable magazines and newspapers (I live in Europe btw, don't know if that matters), suggesting that the author of this article is not alone in his opinion.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> Original reasearch, no sources and most of all, ill-defined. Does everytime a black actor play a cop fall into this category or does the black cop have to exhibit certain traits? "<i>many viewers poked fun at Bill Duke's appearance in 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin as the leader of a gang by referring to him as "Black Cop"...</i>. Although, Duke often plays cops I doubt if "many viewers" were doing this. Maybe he and his friends did and he decided to write an article about it. PLUS, user added category of "Notable Niggers" to the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denzel_Washington_8230.html" title="Denzel Washington">Denzel Washington</a> article and I am afraid this may be part of some kind of personal agenda. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrblondnyc_7b00.html" title="User:Mrblondnyc">MrBlondNYC</a> 11:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, but rewrite.</b> The article contains Original Research, but the archetype the article describes is most definitely a valid one.

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems to be just an attempt at formalizing an opinion about a trend in movies. There are several bold, unsourced claims made, such as the first appearance of the black cop. The black cop doesn't even seem to have any relevance- I sure wouldn't write an article about the Mexican gardener or the teenage pool boy. <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 16:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Update</b> Source has been added. Will continue to search and verify everything in the article. Origin of the archetype has been added and verified. Wafulz, the difference between the Mexican gardener and the teenage pool boy is that the "Black Cop" archetype is one of the most used cliches in the "Cop Movie" genre. In the last two decades it's in almost every popular cop movie. I Robot, Die Hard, Miami Vice, Lethal Weapon, Exit Wounds, Red Dragon, etc. I can come up with an entire list if it will help change your view. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStukov_cb80.html" title="User:Stukov">Stukov</a> 16:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As long as the article is sourced, I see no reason to prevent its inclusion into the Wikipedia database. This IS an archetype I have witnessed commonly in "buddy cop" movies and television dramas. There always seems to be the one sergeant or superior who is African-American and plays a stereotypical "stern father" role so to speak. I've found several essays regarding it on the web as well. Continue the discussion though.<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysCyYoung_e7a6.html" title="User:JaysCyYoung">JaysCyYoung</a> 16:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> OK I've actually read the sources. The essay "Black People as Scenery" definitely has merit. The <b>very brief</b> mention in the <i><a href="../../../n/a/r/Narc_%28film%29.html" title="Narc (film)">Narc (film)</a></i> review does not. You may need better sources than that. Plus, I seriously doubt there's any source to the "<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Duke_a0db.html" title="Bill Duke">Bill Duke</a>/<i><a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Rich_or_Die_Tryin%27_%28film%29_1cc9.html" title="Get Rich or Die Tryin' (film)">Get Rich or Die Tryin' (film)</a></i>" claim besides you and your friends at the movies. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrblondnyc_7b00.html" title="User:Mrblondnyc">MrBlondNYC</a> 17:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> since it is evidently a growing trend in entertainment. There is some OR but I'm sure the authors can eliminate that given the described prevalence. I would also suggest looking into adding content about any possible trends of black and white cop pairings (Lou and Eddie on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, for instance, or Smitty and Swanny on <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanford_and_Son_8d35.html" title="Sanford and Son">Sanford and Son</a>.) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 19:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and be allowed to organically grow. GrapePie 20:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The black cop is a common archetype in modern films wether the critics of this article would accept it or not, while the persona may not be Jungian in origin, it has evolved in modern film and needs to be recognized. User:Shadow387 19:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as original research on user-defined archetype that doesn't actually exist. Is there a similar article on "white cop?" (another, far more regularly used, archetpye I could make up an article for and slap a few afterthought "reference" links on to try and keep from deletion). --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 01:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Does a black character being a cop automatically make him a character stereotype? Maybe the gruff black lieutenant or captain (<i><a href="../../../4/8/_/48_Hrs._8ab1.html" title="48 Hrs.">48 Hrs.</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Starsky_and_Hutch_c4a1.html" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Homicide%7E_Life_on_the_Street_4b34.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></i>) would qualify as a stereotype. The first two predate the example given as the "first" in the article. The pic on the page is of a character who was a sergeant, therefore not in charge, and was pretty nice. But just any cop who's black regardless of personality or rank is automatically a stereotype, huh? OK. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrblondnyc_7b00.html" title="User:Mrblondnyc">MrBlondNYC</a> 07:52, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
