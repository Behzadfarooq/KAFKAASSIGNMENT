Either way, the subject is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">notable</a>.</s> This is an entry repeatedly attacking and harrassing the subject of an Internet meme, a local access TV presenter who received prank calls on-air.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Gorgeous George is a popular internet meme. I could compare George to John Daker, his popularity is also mostly negative. I have been looking at this article since it was created, and it definitely was not vanity, as the article was mostly insults. He has been featured on <a href="../../../e/b/a/Ebaumsworld.html" title="Ebaumsworld">Ebaumsworld</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> etc. so this is clearly one of the more popular memes. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapinmies_aa85.html" title="User:Lapinmies">Lapinmies</a> 21:57, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that it needs to be mentioned on the page that his show had been attacked by prank callers, and that as a popular target of malicious comedic enjoyment on the internet, the article warrants keeping. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoulsrocker_3f0c.html" title="User:Soulsrocker">Soulsrocker</a> 00:36, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable local public access host.

The article and talk page have subsequently been vandalised by people wishing to re-add the material, and the subject has then blanked the talk page. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 00:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. At best a figure of minor notability, and his minor notability is mostly being attacked on Something Awful. He is (understandably) upset about becoming famous purely by being mocked by people he's never met. Basic decency says that we should remove the article of a borderline notable person who is actively disinterested in the grounds for their notability. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:22, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> (edit conflict) Would <i>you</i> want an article about yourself on Wikipedia, if your only reason for notability was that some website made character attacks at you?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Deleting an article solely because its subject demands it would be a bad precedent; it would encourage others to get all <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> on us to try to manipulate our coverage. I'm not from the area where G.G. has his show, so I'm not prepared to pass judgment on its degree of notability (I've never heard of him or his show before now), but the deletion or not should be based on this rather than on his personal wishes. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 17:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And while I agree with keeping the Daniel Brandt article, I cannot help but notice that the precedent we set there made every admin on this site into a real-world target of anyone with a grudge. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:04, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agree - the principle is to keep the article if it's notable and encyclopedic, <i>not</i> to keep it just to prove that Wikipedia doesn't buckle to pressure. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 18:19, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with that; we should strive not to let grudges and personal feelings influence us either to keep or to delete an article where the encyclopedic course would be the opposite. Being human, we may not always follow this guideline (I suspect that in cases like this, a "reverse psychology" approach might work at manipulating Wikipedia editors -- if you really want the article on you kept, you should loudly and obnoxiously demand it be deleted, or vice versa), but it should at least be our stated goal. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 18:24, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
