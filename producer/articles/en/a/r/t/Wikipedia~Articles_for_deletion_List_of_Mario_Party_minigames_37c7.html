<p>This is a game guide article that is much better suited for a gaming/fan wiki. Explaining how to play each and every mini-game isn't a notable subject for Wikipedia. It should be noted: many of these Mario Party lists were in AFD about a month ago (with a result of no consensus). Since then: there has been little improvement to keep them looking like game guides/how to play guides. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 03:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Being unencyclopedic is not a reason to delete an article. you must show why you think the article *can't* be encyclopedic. Being unsourced is not a reason to delete an article. you must show why you think the article *can't* be sourced. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 19:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How will you fix the fact that level/mini-game lists don't warrant articles on Wikipedia? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:21, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>What?

<ul>
<li>Because a list of levels and list of mini-games is guide content? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Can you show that by any reason besides <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">"<b>Delete</b> as cruft"</a>? <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 16:57, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh yes, because being cruft isn't good enough. Hmm... Let's see... Besides the fact that it tells you how to beat the mini-games? Well, besides that very, very good reason to get this off of Wikipedia, I got nothing. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 17:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, being cruft is not good enough. Please take a read at the essay on <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>. No policy there, just that some people think cruft should be removed. I'm merely stating that we should stick with policy, and not precedent. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And how can you even argue that lists belong on Wikipedia when both Rayman RR and Monkey Ball Wii's were deleted for not belonging on Wikipedia? Only reason the MP lists survive is because of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, personally, I don't like it, but that's not a reason, I'm fighting it, beacuse *I actually think that the article's existence is in accordance with wikipedia policy.
<ul>
<li>What policy suggests that we should have a list of levels or mini-games? There is a ton of precedence saying that we SHOULDN'T make articles like these. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 17:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>okay, I'll say it again. I believe this article should stay, because it is a notable topic that could contain encyclopedic information. Because the article can contain (potentially encyclopedic) information that doesn't fit in the main article. Also, precedence is more along the lines of <a href="../../../w/a/x/WP%7EWAX_2720.html" title="WP:WAX">WP:WAX</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/WP%7EALLORNOTHING_ed9c.html" title="WP:ALLORNOTHING">WP:ALLORNOTHING</a>. Let's stick to policy, okay? <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Did you even read the links you just gave? Those aren't policies. Those aren't even guidelines. They're essays created by Wikipedians. You've more or less agreed that the article in its current state is not encyclopedic. So how many reasons can you give to say that Mario Party deserves a million lists of mini-games teaching people how to beat the mini-games, but no other mini-game game can have one? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 17:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I don't believe that the article in it's current state should be nominated for FA status, but that doesn't mean that it should be deleted (see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). I think that the article has potential to be a great article, if people will put some time into it. I've put more time into rebutting your concerns than fixing the article, and I've made it better. But there's still room for improvement. Yes, things from <a href="../../../a/t/a/WP%7EATA_2c1b.html" title="WP:ATA">WP:ATA</a> are essays. But they're good ideas. I think its funny that you're criticising me for quoting essays (after you did first from that page), when the effect of my statements is "lets stick to policy." <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> We have no reason to think that this article should be deleted. There has been some discussion as to whether this article (and the 8ish others like it) are encyclopedic or not. I'm sorry, but the policies regarding this are in favor of this article. The most common reason others have with regards to this article is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipdedia is not an indiscriminate source of information</a>, it doesn't say that we shouldn't have listcruft like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Slytherins_43e3.html" title="Minor Slytherins">Minor Slytherins</a>, but that if we're to have lists of things like this that it should be encyclopedic information. We use AFD not to say something isn't encyclopedic, but to say that something can't be encyclopedic. All of these Mario party minigame articles *can* be encyclopedic. so quit your complaining, and make it right. (yes, I was drawn here by a small canavs. I'ven't even played this game, so I don't think I'm the right person to fix this article, but I'll see what little I can do. You should probably do the same.) <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 19:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not going to say that there shouldn't be an article on the "list of levels in SM64". I think that if SM64s page got large and there were encyclopedic information to be place there (and I think there could be), then there should be an article on the list of levels in sm64. Why should there be a list of mini-games on wikipedia? Because there is potentially encyclopedic information about these levels. Like maybe what people think of certain video games, or <a href="http://www.drinkinggamerules.com/view_game.php?id=563" class="external text" title="http://www.drinkinggamerules.com/view_game.php?id=563" rel="nofollow">which games make better drinking games</a>, or awards, or novel uses of the controller to do things in strange ways, or which ones <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mario+party+blister" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mario+party+blister" rel="nofollow">give you blisters</a>. There's a bunch that could be written about these games, the hard part is finding the information that can be cited according to Wikipedia Policies.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This can easily be described on a gaming wiki, but in my opinion people are just being difficult and demanding it must be here. It's cruft, plain and simple. As A Link to the Past has said: it's not encyclopedic, and is similar to articles on levels. Wikipedia isn't a place for game guides, and that's what the mini-game articles are. Even if they are purely just listing the games: it's still listcruft. Take Monkey Ball and Rayman as recent examples: both had list pages in AFD, that were deleted. Does anyone have the links for them? If those can be found, it's proof this type of content isn't wanted here (except by a few users). Also: these list pages stem from a major conflict at the talk page of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Party_8_eafa.html" title="Mario Party 8">Mario Party 8</a>. The majority were against listing each and every game in the article: so a few users decided to just make these list pages with little to no consensus. I think the logic of "it's not wanted in an article itself, so branch it off to a list page" is a bit of bad faith. Users failing to understand the majority doesn't want it, is simply not helping Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia doesn't exist to make your life easier. Its sole purpose is to be encyclopedic.

<li>I wasn't very clear before. I meant to say not that its hard to find this content, but it's hard to source the article with reliable sources. Sourcing Wikipedia articles is hard (particularly when there isn't a search term that doesn't include 9 sequels). And just because it's hard to source doesn't give us a reason to give up on the article. Writing an encyclopedia is hard work.

<li>Articles get deleted if they can't be sourced. And I want it deleted because the content is of no worth. IT IS GUIDE CONTENT. For the love of God, what about that do you not understand? There is precedence to NOT have articles like this, there is absolutely NO precedence that suggests otherwise, and throughout this conversation, you've been waving around the "people like it" flag but never actually explaining why this is encyclopedic! Levels aren't encyclopedic, but a list of mini-games with a basic guide to explain how to beat them all are encyclopedic? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 17:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, Articles get deleted if the <b>can't</b> be sourced. This AfD has shown that the article <b>can</b> be sourced. Precedent means nothing. Lets stick with policy. And I have been explaining why I think it's encyclopedic. and I have helped the article to make it more encyclopedic. Also, I've said before that there's nothing inherently unencyclopedic about levels. It's possible that the levels in SM64 were encyclopedic at it's AFD. That doesn't mean that all levels are unencyclopedic, or that minigames are unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what policy do you use to defend this article's worth? What one says that the only game in the world that can have a list of levels/mini-games on Wikipedia is Mario Party? Seriously, I am sick of this. When will you explain to me why this article deserves to be on Wikipedia SO much more than List of (insert any game in the world) levels/mini-games? No other game series has such lists. NONE. Absolutely none. And yet, of course, for literally no reason whatsoever, THESE 8 mini-game lists are magically notable. There was no reasonable consensus over its creation, just a small group of people agreeing on it with no input from anyone else. Rayman RR's list of mini-games wasn't notable. Super Monkey Ball BB's list of mini-games wasn't notable. Explain to me why the List of MP mini-games is different. Explain to me why telling people the objective of every mini-game in the list is necessary. What encyclopedic value does this have? WHAT? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED THIS QUESTION OF YOURS SEVERAL TIMES: Because articles have been written about them, because some of them gave rise to a class action lawsuit (which spawned several articles), also please refrain from using <a href="../../../w/a/x/WP%7EWAX_2720.html" title="WP:WAX">WP:WAX</a>. Should we drop the article on <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a> just because almost all of the other bands that formed that year are not notable? No, we independantly check to see whether U2 meets the criteria. <b>Precedent means absolutely nothing.</b> Let's stick to policy. I have shown the primary notability criterion, namely that several, independant, non-trivial articles have been written covering them. There is a different hypothesis different than the one you're proposing -- maybe all those other articles were deleted because no one actually considered policy, maybe no one cared enough to do any research on whether articles had been written about them, maybe they didn't actually have articles written covering them. <b>Precedent means absolutely nothing</b>.

<li>When you haven't shown why this list of mini-games is particularly notable, or why it is necessary for it to be on Wikipedia, the fact that every other non-Mario mini-game list has been deleted from Wikipedia means EVERYTHING.

<li>I have shown how it's better. On several occasions here, and on the articles page and on the articles talk page. <b>Because articles have been written about them, because some of them gave rise to a class action lawsuit (which spawned several articles)</b>. Are you not reading these statements I keep placing on this page? I've said that it's encyclopedic. The minigames were notable enough to warrant a class-action lawsuit (and articles have been written about that lawsuit). Is this not enough for you.

<ul>
<li>No, the design of a mini-game causing damage to peoples' hands and thusly resulting in a law suit does not make the mini-games notable. That's the silliest notion I've seen today, that because people sued over damage from playing certain mini-games warrants that a list of mini-games be made for them. Mario Party 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4, none of those have this problem. So why are they notable? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First off, I would like to thank you for actually discussing the reasoning. You seemed to have missed that for the past dozenish posts. So, I think the information about the blisters is encyclopedic. In fact, you even seemed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Mario_Party_minigames&amp;diff=116806661&amp;oldid=116806105" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Mario_Party_minigames&amp;diff=116806661&amp;oldid=116806105" rel="nofollow">imply that you supportted it with a caveat that has since been met</a>. What would you qualify as encyclopedic information? Could you tell us why you think that it's silly? We hear about lawsuits about several other products, and those get put into wikipedia. Soemtimes the lawsuits themselves are enough to bring an entity to notability. Also, I merely presented blisters as one kind of information that could be encyclopedic. You challenged that one, so I showed an article, then you challenged how it didn't list the games specifically, so I found another source which did list the games individually, and you were silent on that issue for quite some time, now you're saying it's silly, and that seems to be a very subjective perspective, so I'd like more clarification. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 22:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So hey, guess what? We don't make articles on Magnetix's individual pieces just because they got sued over them. Similarly, Mario Party is notable for getting Nintendo sued over it, not the content of it. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>that's because there's nothing else to say about the pieces individually. Many of the minigames in MP have been mentioned in articles. Also, several of these minigames could be notable for other reasons, It's hard to come up with criteria for a game that I'ven't ever played, but in other minigames games, the minigames could be notable for being the first time two people shared a single controller, or maybe it's notable for being the first time a controller is used as a lasso. There's a bunch of thigns that could be said about these minigames. I don't think there's anything particularly notable about the levels in SM64, and people don't write about the levels much in articles, but because of the unique nature of minigames games, people talk about the minigames themselves a lot, particularly in a game review. Some of those mentionings might be trivial, but others won't be. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 22:57, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Suing over a game's content does not make the content notable. What about suing over Kadabra's swastika-like symbol? Or the scene that caused seizures in that Pokémon episode? MP is more notable for the lawsuit, not the mini-games. Also, Rayman and Monkey Ball's mini-games are mentioned in reviews and articles (Monkey Target, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf, Monkey Racing, etc.), so your argument of "getting mentioned in reviews and articles" doesn't hold water. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because no one brought up that point in the AfD doesn't mean it can't be used in this one. Hmm, you keep comparing this to other articles, I don't particularly like that, and I've expressed it on several occasions, so i'm going to do it because that seems to be how you think best. Can you tell me how the list of MP8 minigames is less notable than <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Slytherins_43e3.html" title="Minor Slytherins">Minor Slytherins</a>? AFAIK, most of them have trivial postings in other locations. What do they have that's so much better than these minigames? <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 23:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You cannot use my argument for MP. See, the existence of an article does not necessarily dictate that the article is appropriate. However, the fact that articles that are no less worthy of being on Wikipedia were deleted says that these lists don't deserve to be on Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:23, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Important question: Do you think <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Slytherins_43e3.html" title="Minor Slytherins">Minor Slytherins</a> should be deleted? I know that that's not the issue at hand, but I need to know for the purposes of the argument. You're right, the fact that it's there doesn't mean it should be there, but we can't have an AfD resolved in time for this discussion (see also <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>), so I'm willing to concede to your judgement on this matter and use it to continue the discussion. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 15:15, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You're right. Because he got rid of the content, the fact that the general consensus has been "lists of mini-games/levels suck" ceases to exist. Fact: There is no need for this article besides "it's informative", which now that you removed the game guide information, it is no longer informative. Why is this the only list of mini-games in the entire universe that warrants an article? Rayman RR was deleted for good reason.

<li><b>Comment</b> Mini-games in Mario Party are basically levels. We don't have level guides here, I don't see why mini-games should be made an exception. Sourcing is fine and all: but that doesn't fix how unencyclopedic it is. As I stated before: other mini-game lists were deleted in AFD, Mario Party shouldn't be an exception either. Just because it's probably the most known mini-games: doesn't mean it should be kept over Rayman game and/or Super Monkey Ball game lists. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 21:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hmm, Game Guides aren't allowed, so it can be reasonably assumed level guides aren't allowed. Game Lists are allowed, though there isn't any policy saying they can exist. So level lists? There isn't any policy about that. So the article should stay, and we should watch to make sure the guide content stays off. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 21:48, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So game guides aren't allowed. And just because there is no policy saying "list of levels in video games are bad, mkay?" does not mean that they belong on Wikipedia. Are you saying that because it's not explicitly stated that I can't make an article about flying purple rocks with hats on, that it doesn't violate any guidelines? What is the purpose of this article? Why is this list of mini-games notable to Wikipedia? Also, the reason why Rayman and Monkey Ball failed the AfD was not that it was particularly less notable than other mini-game compilations, but because it is a mini-game list. Why is this mini-game list more than just any mini-game list? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is correct, just because there isn't policy saying that a type of page isn't allowed, doesn't mean it should be allowed. Also, Just because there isn't policy saying that a type of page is allowed doesn't mean that it isn't. We need to evaluate the article based on it's own merits in accordance with wikipedia policy, which is what this discussion is all about. Also, I would say that the RRR list was not removed just because it is a minigame list. Also, I'd say that it didn't get the "fair" treatment that this one is getting. And the monkey ball one? It died from a prod. I'm going to claim that they never really had their time in court. Don't claim that mini-games lists are inherently non-notable.

<li>Hmm, I'm having a hard time fully understanding your arguments, so I'm requesting clarification. Is this article absolutely necessary? No. Is the article on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Slytherins_43e3.html" title="Minor Slytherins">Minor Slytherins</a> necessary? No, is the article on <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codd%27s_12_rules.html" title="Codd's 12 rules">Codd's 12 rules</a> necessary? No. But an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a> is "a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge." "As a general encyclopedia, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> seeks to describe as wide a range of topics as possible." so while an article on the effects of salt on slugs, or an article about me might not be strictly necessary it might be desired to have such articles. But Wikipedia can't police information about everything under the sun, so wikipedia has established a few core guidelines, namely that of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The first two are what's being discussed here, and are neatly covered in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. We don't add an article about something (like me for example), unless a couple of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> have written something on the subject.

<li>Also, wikipedia has the guidelines contained in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Here is the real concern. Some have said that this list is an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

Please, give me the benefit of the doubt. Assume this article is different somehow. And Evaluate, on it's own merits which wikipedia policy warrants its deletion.

<li>Just because you think it has encyclopedic content does not mean that it has encyclopedic content. The fact of the matter is that Rayman RR and Monkey Ball's mini-games have more substance than Mario Party's, yet still failed to continue to exist. If you wish, make a deletion review for them. If they come back, MP can stay. If not, MP goes. MP is no more notable than them. Also, I can use the precedence argument for deleting - you cannot use it for keeping. The fact that no other game series has a mini-game list and the ones that did were deleted is usable. The fact that another article exists with questionable notability is not. You're comparing a list of minor characters from Harry Potter to a list of mini-games in Mario Party. The fact is that those Slytherins are probably more notable than these mini-games since there IS precedence to have list of characters. If it's there, it either deserves to be or it has yet to be put on the slate for deletion. Being on Wikipedia is very different from deserving to be on Wikipedia. Your comparison of a list of minor characters that spans an entire franchise to a list of mini-games in a single game is apples and oranges, but my comparison is of two like-minded articles. So why is this a notable mini-game list? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I don't think a Deletion Review is necessary, because policy was kept, but that participation seemed partisan, and there's nothing that happened wrong from an administrative perspective (unless <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVAS_b8fe.html" title="WP:CANVAS">WP:CANVASing</a> can be shown, but that might prove difficult). It appears as if almost your entire argument is based on precedent (You keep saying "unencyclopedic" but haven't mentioned why since I've shown it's encyclopedicness). If we go off of precedent, Disavian has shown that 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 have all survived an AFD. Some more than once. Precedence clearly shows that these articles should stay. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 15:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, that shows that MP fanboys are too vast. Oh, and it's funny that you seem to expect me to argue why it's not encyclopedic (such as levels and mini-games list being guide content), but you won't answer why it is besides "Omg, if Minor Slytherins gets an article so does Mario Party mini-game lists!". - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:35, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you think that MP Fanboys have overwhelmed the discussion with worthless content, maybe you should open up a deletion review. With regards to encyclopedic content, I have answered that, I mentioned that Bowsy cleaned up the article and removed guide content. A list of something doesn't a guide make. Obviously that's the case, because a list of minor slytherins is not a guide. So, you'll have to tell us why you think that the article is non-encylopedic. Why you think it's an indiscriminant collection of information (and that it can't be cleaned up). I think it's clear that there is at least some encyclopedic content on the page, the blister stuff is notable enough. I have several arguements for the article. But note that it's your responsibility as the person voting for delete to bring up the issues, and my responsibility to say, "yes it's notable because it has sources, yes it is encyclopedic because it has information about the games involved in the blister lawsuit." You say I've only got one argument? Yes, I brought up the minor slytherins issue after you brought up the RRRmg. I've also brought up that the content is notable. I've also brought up that the content is encyclopedic. If you would like to explain <i>why</i> you think I'm mistaken, please feel free to do so, but you haven't brought up anything besides saying "game lists are guide content BBQ!" and I've said that they aren't inherently so, and that you must show me why game lists are inherently guide content, and you haven't done that. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree, something needs to be in place, otherwise all the list pages need to be re-nominated and deleted. If people think it's encyclopedic: then fix it already. But the issue is: it can't be encyclopedic, and it's just people wanting it because they like it. As I stated before: mini-games are basically levels of the Mario Party games. Wikipedia should <b>never</b> become a level guide. It isn't one now, and MP lists shouldn't be the start of major fancruft level guides. Let's look at the possibilities, shall we? 1: A plain and simple list of the games = fan/listcruft. 2: a list of the games, with descriptions = still fan/listcruft. 3: a list of the games and how to play them = listcruft/game guide. What else is there? Sourcing the article doesn't change it from being listcruft, fancruft and/or a guide. I don't understand why people can't understand Wikipedia isn't a video game guide. There is gaming wikis, yet people refuse to use them in this case. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 08:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just to be clear, I'm not opposed to a merge of the two articles. I am just hesitant to perform it myself given the seeming lack of consensus on this page and my complete lack of knowledge about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Party_69c6.html" title="Mario Party">Mario Party</a> beyond what's in this article and what I gleaned from skimming a few sources. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:35, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>And I still don't feel that the lawsuit information is relevant to this list. Only the article. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:21, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment to the closing admin</b>. A substantial number of recommendations by editors were made on prior versions of this article.

<li>My opinion to redirect still stands. The only meaningful change is the inclusion of the bit about the lawsuit. This is already in the main article and anything that is different in this version can be merged to the main article. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 19:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
