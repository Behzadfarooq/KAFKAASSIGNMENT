<li>A complex case. I suggest moving the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incubus_%28band%29.html#Discography" title="Incubus (band)">Incubus (band)#Discography</a> to a separate article, and merging this list's information into it.

<ul>
<li>That seems like a reasonable compromise.

<p>At the moment, it is mostly a duplicate of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English_e65a.html" title="List of words having different meanings in British and American English">List of words having different meanings in British and American English</a>, but is receiving divergent edits. The point of it, AIUI, was to bring together all word usage differences between <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>. However, there are a number of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the moment, only the first few rows are in the format being proposed. Apart from this, the effort to turn it into what it was intended to be seems to have abandoned. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPromsan_7dd7.html" title="User:Promsan">Promsan</a>, creator of the page, seems to have disappeared (no edits since 28 September 2005).</li>
<li>It is very long as it stands, and trying to bring together this information would make it even longer and produce little benefit over that already provided by the aforementioned article, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_English_words_not_used_in_American_English_f11b.html" title="List of British English words not used in American English">List of British English words not used in American English</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_English_words_not_used_in_British_English_fcbb.html" title="List of American English words not used in British English">List of American English words not used in British English</a>.</li>
<li>The format makes little sense. What's the point of having four columns if only the first two or only the last two are going to be filled in any row?</li>
<li>It is unclear what one is supposed to do with words that have more than one meaning on the same side of the pond, or meanings common to both sides as well as the different meaning. I can imagine it becoming quite messy.</li>
</ul>

Hi! I clearly understand <b>molydeus</b> or any other fictional creature is not a high subject, but since I've found page about other D&amp;D creatures (and I've just bought the Fiendish Codex 1&#160;:)) I thought that, for a completeness principle, it could be a good idea adding the missing creatures. Moreover I see no reason to delete this page while other pages about d&amp;d demons, like <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balor_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_f01c.html" title="Balor (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Balor (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilith_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_0189.html" title="Marilith (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Marilith (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succubus_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_ed19.html" title="Succubus (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Succubus (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</a>, only to cite a few, remains, in my opinion rightly, on the Wikipedia. I hope to persuade you!&#160;:) Bye! --Eldar Featel 12:13, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Was nominated for speedy deletion as a non-notable website. This isn't a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criterion for speedy deletion</a> and nominating articles using that as a criterion doesn't make it one (subtle hint: stop nominating, or change the criterion; stop making the life of deleting admins hard).

<li>I, for one, find this to be notable. Jaythejoke is incredibly popular in Chicago and has been featured by multiple news sources. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/g/User%7EChgojoey_3f6b.html" title="User:Chgojoey">Chgojoey</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chgojoey_e67b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chgojoey">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>To the Wikipedia Administrators:
<p>If I understand the reason behind nominating my August 11 entry for speedy deletion, one or more people have objected to the entry on the grounds that the subject of the entry, the Jay the Joke website, is a “non-notable” website.</p>
<p>In response, please note that as of the present moment, the Wikipedia encyclopedia now boasts a total of 1,316,282 articles in English (i.e., Monday, August 14, at 15:50 GMT).</p>
<p>Note moreover Wikipedia’s fundamental open-source commitment—a “free encyclopedia,” which “anyone can edit.”</p>
<p>In order for someone to raise a reasonable and fair objection to my proposed addition to Wikipedia’s 1,316,282 articles, I am afraid that the subject’s lack of noteworthiness in another person’s eyes is simply not sufficient. After all, facts are one thing. But who is to have the power to determine noteworthiness?</p>
<p>Instead, in all fairness, and in the spirit of Wikipedia’s core commitment, for an objection to lead to deletion, the objector would have to show that the substance of the proposed entry is false—and not only false merely, but false in some non-trivial sense.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless the person or persons who raised the “non-notable” objection can meet these last conditions, there clearly is no good reason to prevent my proposed entry from becoming a part of this encyclopedia’s growing family of entries.</p>
<p>Thanks. David Peterson 13:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC) (Chicago)</p>

<li><b>Redirect and merge</b> into <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Mariotti_077c.html" title="Jay Mariotti">Jay Mariotti</a>. While Jay the Joke doesn't fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (I could read one tribune article and the chicago reader article, the third wanted registration so should likely be removed), if one were to clean up the article per <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> it would be stubby. However, it could easily be made into a well referenced section on Jay Mariotti. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:55, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Friends: One of the more revealing features of the Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Mariotti_077c.html" title="Jay Mariotti">Jay Mariotti</a> is the way the entry already is framed according to incidents and around themes that are of major importance to Mariotti's enemies. In other words, overall, the Wikipedia entry for Jay Mariotti as it now exists reads more like a smear of its ostensible subject matter (Mariotti) than it does an entry about the same. Notice, for example, that out of its ten references, no less than nine are datelined June 16, 2006 or later; and the last, posted by Eric Zorn to the Chicago Tribune’s website on October 28, 2005, is nothing but an attack on Mariotti. Thus when you discuss merging an entry about a website the avowed purpose of which is “uniting Cubs fans and Sox fans through a common <i><b>hatred</b></i> of Jay Mariotti” (<a href="http://www.jaythejoke.com/blog.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jaythejoke.com/blog.html" rel="nofollow">Jay the Joke</a>) into an extant Wikipedia entry which already betrays very much the same purpose, I have my doubts. Thanks. David Peterson 21:11, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i><b>For the record</b></i>: I want it understood that I regard the extensive revisions to my proposed Wikipedia entry for ‘Jay the Joke’, introduced by Anonymous User "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=64.50.38.194" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=64.50.38.194" rel="nofollow">64.50.38.194</a>" (19:27, 17 August 2006), to be serious falsifications of the original. The purpose of the original entry was to describe a smear campaign organized against one particular individual, which, ultimately, has expanded to provide a license for hate speech and Internet intimidation more generally. However, the net effect of the revisions introduced by "64.50.38.194" has been to transform an entry about hate speech into what now reads as an entry about a sincere project on the part of a couple of individuals “to unite sports fans throughout the city [Chicago],” with “Critics of the blog” simply “point[ing] to the posts in the comments section as being excessively abusive.” In short, the revisions constitute an historical fabrication. Thanks. David Peterson 14:11, 18 August 2006 (UTC) (Chicago)</li>
<li>Friends: That is to say, what the Wikipedia guidelines describe under the rubric ‘<a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Sockpuppeting_is_not_to_be_tolerated_Sockpuppeting" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Sockpuppeting_is_not_to_be_tolerated Sockpuppeting</a>’ and similar offenses. Thanks. David Peterson 15:44, 18 August 2006 (UTC) (Chicago)</li>
<li>If you believe you can expand on <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">Hate speech</a>, the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">Hate speech</a> entry might be the proper place to do it. If there is to be a Jay the Joke site, it should explain the history of the blog, the stated mission of the blog, the blog's authors and news the blog has made. It gained a little bit of notoriety because of Guillen's slur vs. Mariotti and Mariotti's subsequent vacation. It gained a little more notoriety because of your role in publicizing the juvenile comments section. You really shouldn't be posting an article for a topic you are so closely involved with. Thanks... "Mr. 64..."</li>
<li>Also, how is it a fabrication that critics don't like the abusive nature of the comments section? Isn't that your complaint?</li>

<li>I'm still holding my ground on this one. Nothing in the article is sourced, and the links can provide a form a self published source (which it still does not meet), but thats all.

<li>Your ground would have been better laid if you had use the phrase "reliable source". It is <i>subjects</i> that are notable, not sources. It is <i>articles</i> that are verifiable, not sources. The relevant properties of sources are their provenance and depth, i.e. who created and published them and whether they are apposite, reliable, and non-trivial. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Wrong. I'm refuting your point. Your argument is that the web site is a reliable source. It isn't, for the reasons given. Subjects' own web sites are simply not reliable sources. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> has the right idea of what to look for. Instead of making a fallacious argument, please do what xe is doing and look for similar sources independent of the subject to show that the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria are satisfied. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Please take our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy more seriously than simply reading a web site and uncritically beliving what it says. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:06, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I again, take it very seriously. My disagreements with your interpretations as to how to handle this do not mean I take it any more or less seriously than you do, and I strongly object to your continued categorization of my beliefs in that way. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Simply reading a web site and believing uncritically what it says <i>isn't</i> a serious application of our verifiability policy, your objections notwithstanding. Anyone with a modicum of experience with the World Wide Web should know that there is no guarantee that what is published on a vanity web site is true. I pointed to two valuable lessons above. Please <i>learn from them</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My disagreement with you is not an example of "believing uncritically" or a lack of an ability to learn from other situations. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:37, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your <i>ability</i> to learn has not come up in this discussion, and is a straw man. Your disagreement (which is with more than one editor, note) is that "The website is a-okay" and that <i>is</i> an example of believing uncritically what it says. As I said before, <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> has the right idea of what to look for. But you aren't following xyr example. Please follow xyr example, please take our verifiability policy more seriously than simply taking bands' web sites at their face values, and please learn why it is a bad idea to do so from the valuable lessons mentioned above (which are far from being the only such occasions). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for your advice, but there's really no need for it. Don't doubt my seriousness about these policies, I know full well what's up. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:41, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for lacking multiple non-trivial third-party articles; also, I suggest that for a band to tour somewhere, it's making several stops around a country. This band's claimed schedule shows one show here, then back in Scottland, another show there, and then back in Scotland. Considering the venues also appear to be music festivals, it appears they have an enterprising agent, rather than international demand. Along these lines, Google only shows to me 218 distinct hits for "croft no. 5"+band; I agree Google is not the final arbiter of notability, but at this level I consider it symptomatic. Also no evidence of charted hits. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 14:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It looked like nonsense at first to me also, but then I finally wrapped my head around it: it's a neologism to describe common phrases that often get variations made of them, like "Does the Pope (blank) in the woods?".

Obliga-note: I was the one who reorganised this list into its present chronology; this was intended to present its information in a more encylopaedically accessible form, by allowing it to be verified and found more easily. Another option, organising by source or media (i.e. print, film, TV, advertising, music, etc.), was not attempted because at the time, there were far fewer entries. Chronology makes sense to show (1) longevity of certain elements; (2) development over time; (3) connection to historical (pop)culture. I've attempted to regularly prune the less notable examples, but likely it could do with a bit more trimming, and clearer explanation of the term <i>snowclone</i> at the head.--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, providing <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowclone.html" title="Snowclone">Snowclone</a> survives its own current AfD nomination. If there is to be an article on snowclones, it makes sense to provide a list of them for illustrative and explanatory purposes. The list shouldn't be (or try to be) exhaustive, and it should be sourced as much as possible (which would in practice limit it to only the most notable examples), but it does seem to me worth having. I admit the list could be merged with <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowclone.html" title="Snowclone">Snowclone</a>, but that seems like an unnecessary combination of two different types of article to me.

In <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_Neologisms_4225.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid Neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid Neologisms</a>, the only two reasons given that articles on neologisms "may not be appropriate" are that they often lack reliable secondary sources, and are often no more than dictionary definitions. This goes beyond dictionary definition -- it's an article about the linguistic phenomenon the term was coined to describe -- and there are sources. Sounds like the article needs quite a bit of work to be clear to an encyclopedia audience, but that's not a reason to delete it. <font face="Trebuchet MS, Trebuchet"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 06:22, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Doing the research, I've come to the same conclusion as <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis">Celithemis</a>. The problems with neologisms that are relevant here are that the concepts that they embody are unverifiable and original research. The concept embodied by this neologism is verifiable (There is quite a lot of discussion of it to be found.), not original research (The concept having spread far beyond its original creator.), and there is plenty of source material to work from. However, I do wonder whether this is simply a new word for the existing concept of a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a>. ("Snowclones are the new clichés, dahling!")

One of Wikipedia's natural advantages should be that it can document subjects more quickly than a top-down source could do. The suggestion that all newly coined terms belong in the Urban Dictionary is silly; this is a scholarly, non-humorous subject. Maybe a misunderstanding comes from the fact that some of the examples are irreverent, but these can be switched with more mainstream examples if somebody wants.

<li>Wal-Marts are all pretty much the same, but each indoor shopping mall has its own distinctive architecture and ambience. Also, the larger shopping malls often play host to mini-concerts, celebrity appearances, and assorted games and tournaments, so they tend to be more versatile than the standard big-box stores.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hot Rod Surf has been featured numerous times in the internationally renound Hot Rod Magazine BURN OUT from Japan, local San Diego press including Gernade Magazine, and Revolt. Hot Rod Surf is known to almost every younger hot rodder and greaser as well as universally hated by older fake hot roddres who don't built, drive or own 1930's steel hot rods but wish they did. There is a 150 page book just on HOT ROD SURF coiming out this next month which is availble around the world. Wickpedia is for counter culture definitions people should know about if they want to—like what’s HOT ROD SURF! (Jmcrownpoint 10:28, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: go look at what Hot Rod Surf is and has done for the living kustom kulture and then try and label it 'non-notable'! If someone wants to know what HOT ROD SURF is they should be able to find out at Wikipedia. To deny HOT ROD SURF is to deny the reality of the hot rods and the lifestyle that are very real and contemporary.(Jmcrownpoint 2:03, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Why is it that when some one dosen't know about something they claim it's not notable or not established. The fun of wikipedia to find out what things mean that you didn't know about. Clearly in this case it is Hot Rod Surf.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Despite the fact that this is really original research and theory, Wikipedia operates on a burden of positive proof system. Not everything deserves inclusion. And the burden of proof is on the authors of the pages to show that it should be included. This is also why we have Articles for Deletion instead of Articles for Inclusion. As well as a speedy deletion criteria that says, "An article about a real person, group of people, band, or club that does not <i><b>assert the importance or significance of its subject</b></i>." We don't just go around yelling yee-haw while we nominate stuff for deletion. We take the time to investigate, using many resources. And, searches all say that it's just not notable. If you think it's notable, prove it. If something is notable, there will be plenty of independent verifiable proof out there that can be cited and presented. --Signed and Sealed, <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> (<a href="../../../j/j/j/User_talk%7EJJJJust_a7ab.html" title="User talk:JJJJust">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JJJJust_7050.html" title="Special:Contributions/JJJJust">C</a>) 09:40, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Being a real counter-culture phenomenon Hot Rod Surf has not courted any mainstream news outlets.

HOT ROD SURF is featured in “Revolt In Style”<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> magazine September 2002 (p.12), “Car Culture Deluxe”<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> magazine, issue #9 year 2003, (page 71), one of the Hot Rod Surf parties is mentioned in “Revolt In Style,” November 2001.

<li><b>Comment</b>:The books are on the first edition and printing, it takes some time for them to show up in the data bases. The first edition is officially released for distributors and reviews September 1st. To further ‘verify’ try and contact 'Harley' the lead singer of the band Deadbolt . Deadbolt has played numerous shop parties and Harley owns and drives a genuine Hot Rod Surf hot rod built by MWM. Next we will hear Deadbolt and Voodoobilly doesn’t exist despite their 8 plus full length original albums and world tours?!

<li>Typically speaking, we'd use published sources as sources in articles without much question.

<li>I suggest that you take our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy a lot more seriously. A book that magically appears for sale on Amazon, by an Amazon seller named "hodrodsurf", the <i>day after I mention that I couldn't find it listed</i>, that is autobiographical according to the prior discussion (Please actually read the prior discussion.) and that hasn't been published yet (Please <i>actually read</i> the Barnes &amp; Noble listing given above.) is nowhere near being a reliable source. It isn't even a source at all, because <i>it hasn't been published yet</i>. As for the magazines, I conclude that the answer that you didn't give to <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">Wikipediatrix</a>'s question above is actually "No, I haven't actually read any of them.". I conclude this because I <i>have</i> made attempts to check these sources. The only magazine that I've been able to even find so far, <i><a href="http://www.revoltinstyle.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.revoltinstyle.com/" rel="nofollow">Revolt In Style</a></i>, doesn't have an accessible archive of back issues where I can check what was in the September 2002 edition. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:16, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I take it very seriously, actually. Whether the book "magically" appeared at Amazon during this discussion isn't really all that relevant. We're still talking about a published book that no one would ever question anywhere else. There are a number of sources we use in articles all over the place that I simply have not read, either. I'm not going to start removing books willy-nilly because I haven't read them, I'm going to assume good faith that the books are being sourced properly. Do we really want to discourage the use of published sources like that? Finally, I have a pile of books in the next room over that are technically "not published." While there are certainly some vanity issues we need to deal with on the editor side, his ability to have a prerelease version of something doesn't automatically eliminate it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:33, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>With regard to the books and only the books, they both were written and published by the corporation in question.

<li>From where you linked: "Material from self-published sources, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as there is no reasonable doubt about who wrote it, and where the material is one of the following."

<li>Two operative words that you are repeatedly overlooking: "published" and "notability". The notability criteria in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> specifically exclude published works that are not independent of the subject.

<ul>
<li>I'm more bothered that WP:CORP is being used to trump WP:V in this case. If it comes down to a disconnect between a notability guideline and a verifability policy, I'm going with the latter. This isn't me not paying attention, it's making a value judgement on the sources and the article's worth. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:54, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The set of things that are notable is a subset of the things that are verifiable, so yes notability criteria are more restrictive than simple verifiability. (There is a patch of unremarkable grassland next to my house that is verifiable.) Your acceptance of an <i>unpublished</i> autobiography as a source is not a "value judgement". It is simply not applying any form of judgement at all, and not taking verifiability seriously. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:22, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"We're still talking about a published book" — No, we are not. This was stated right at the top of this discussion, is stated in the Barnes &amp; Noble listing, and was stated by me in the very text that you are replying to. Please take our verifiability policy more seriously, and please pay closer attention to the discussion.
<p>"I'm going to assume good faith" — This is not a question of assuming good faith. This is a question of an application of our verifiability policy that is so lax that it includes books that haven't been published.</p>
<p>"Do we really want to discourage the use of published sources like that?" — Once again: <b>This book has not been published. It is not a published source.</b> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:25, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, our disagreement on these issues is not me taking WP:V at a different level of seriousness - we disagree on the sourcing, and we disagree on the application. We're both longtime, reasonable people, and can disagree on this one.

<ul>
<li>It <i>is</i> not taking verifiability seriously, because the fundamental point of verifiability is that <i>readers can check articles for themselves</i>. Clearly, a book that has not been published isn't a way for readers to do that. It is a simple rejection of the entire basis of the policy to argue that such a book is a source. It is a complete mischaracterization to state that this is a disagreement on how verifiability is applied.

<li><b>Comment:</b>Hello, I am new to Wikipedia but not to the Kustom Culture, Chopper and Hot Rod scene. I am here because the Kustom Culture scene is misrepresented and not understood by many people. It is a rising movement in American history and is recorded in many of today’s popular media. The modern era of Kustom Culture is changing rapidly with many independent press only covering accurate accounts. I am happy to see many other Kustom Culture stars on here such as Robert Williams, Juxtapoz, Jesse James, Von Dutch and so many more. This is an encyclopedia to stay onto of the current definitions. The outside sources of magazines, books and website clearly follow the WP:CORP definition for a company deserving inclusion. I would like to work on making the write up to standard and not deleting this company since this these type entits along with the above mentioned stars are what someone looking up hot rods, lowbrow art, rat rod, choppers or custom culture want to learn about.

<li>Hello, having two books with and ISBN number is not an overnight activity and I find it extremely disturbing that an long time editor of Wiki would discount independent books or act as if books are created out of nowhere. The books are not the only sources you keep leaving out the other sources they have provided. Magazines and news sources provided they have clearly made an accurate case to be included according to the WP:CORP.(<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterirrigation_137d.html" title="User:Hunterirrigation">HunterIrrigation</a> 15:57, 22 August 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Please do not misstate my position. I do not "discount" these two vanity press publications, I just do not believe they qualify as <i>"credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy"</i> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and thus are not a valid reason for a "keep" opinion from <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> as he/she states above. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_Son_533a.html" title="User:Satori Son">Satori Son</a> 16:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hello once again the other third party sources are being ignored the magazines Burnout, Krown, Reviewer, Revolt in Style, Street Car &amp; Bike and Jalpinx. There are three links above where you can find the magazines and you can find past issues at selected counter culture newstands. I personaly have mulitple BurnOut mag with Hot Rod Surf included from back in 2001, 2003 and in the current issue 2006. I am a long time subscriber of BurnOut mag publsihed in Japan and distributed world wide heavly in Europe and America. These thrid party mags completely follow inline with the WP:CORP. This is a noticalble company that people into Hot Rod, Choppers and Kustom Culture want to know about. They are well documented in Hot Rod magazines. Why is it people who don’t follow the major current builders in the Hot Rod scene are trying to delete Hot Rod Surf after third party evidence has been delivered? (<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterirrigation_137d.html" title="User:Hunterirrigation">HunterIrrigation</a> 22:58, 23 August 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>They aren't being ignored, for the simple reason that you aren't actually citing them in the first place. We need more than just a laundry list of magazine names. How are editors and readers to find the articles that you claim exist from just that?

<p>The information is certainly noteworthy, but not in its own article. It's also rather improper (IMO) to title an article something as general as "Allen family" and be so specific, since there are clearly more Allen families than just the one that the article refers to. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzy510_a9be.html" title="User:Fuzzy510">fuzzy510</a> 03:51, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the info seems important (and I know how those football fans are!) then perhaps a rename to "Allen family footballers" or "Allens (Reading Football Club)"&#160;?

<dd>I'd certainly back renaming it along the lines of Allen family footballers. I created the article and the reason for it was to include the family tree and to avoid replicating the information on each of the separate player pages. To my knowledge, no other family in English football comes close to having so many members play at a professional level, let alone represent thier country --<a href="../../../b/e/d/User%7EBedders_4073.html" title="User:Bedders">Bedders</a> 05:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>further <b>comment</b> to my vote above -- I remember a quote from somewhere: "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds". I also remember a rule that says to <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">ignore all rules.</a> There are 155 stations in this list. That means this list spans 9 pages on its own. Merging it into the MyNetworkTV article would make <i>that</i> article unwieldy. This page is handy for reference as the stations are listed by market, rather than by alphabet which is useless for seeking out stations where the letters may not mean anything at all (and every station begins with either a K, a W, or an X), which is how it would be listed if it was left to the category system. Furthermore, it has information which would be harder to find if the proposal to delete is approved. Many of these stations are either secondariry affiliated with MyNetTV or are placing it on a digital subchannel. This list easily gives that information -- the category doesn't. And lastly, it's actually easier to use this list to aide in checking the accuracy of the individual articles and categories, by fact it provides a brief description of each MyNetTV station (call letters, market, owner, type of affiliation, etc.) This table has helped me correct a number of mistakes in individual articles that may have gone uncorrected. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESterlingNorth_8b85.html" title="User:SterlingNorth">SterlingNorth</a> 06:48, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_show.html" title="Game show">game shows</a>, people are not usually going to be notable if they haven't won big in the game show's history (at least in my view of the current consensus). For example, I have raised <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Craig_Westphal_39fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Craig Westphal">Craig Westphal for deletion</a> because he's just not notable at this point in time.</li>
<li>As for other TV series, if the minor characters or guest stars were integral to the series' storylines, I think that's a basis for inclusion in Wikipedia. But that may be subjective to the popularity or the coverage of the series, which may be systemic bias. That's something I don't want to live with. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 07:19, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Normally I would <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">PROD</a> this, but this is a really bizarre situation. User:Jonotoes initially created this article at Kristina Paulsen (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_Paulsen&amp;oldid=69706703" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_Paulsen&amp;oldid=69706703" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>), and it was about an entirely different person. He then slowly edited it and moved it, and now it is a geneological entry about someone completely different. Kristina Paulsen looked as if she <i>may</i> have been notable, but Christian certainly is not. I would just revert it back to Kristina, except the same user who created it altered and moved it. This is really confusing.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not Michael Dunn. I am DodgeM4S (John White) and the author of this content. I did copy images off the official sites and cited them. While MTD Studios is your judgement call (don't really know what defines non-notable), the feature films "Black Zone" and "Alone and Restless" are significant films shot in this area (Central Florida). I also believe that Dunn is a rising star. I submitted these articles to Wikipedia and the links to other Wikipedia pages (that seemed to annoy). Sorry if I ticked anyone off, but I still believe these articles are relavant... and I believe not a single article violates the wikipedia agreements: every submission was written in the most neutral, approriate, accurate manner that I was capable. I don't believe I violated any copyrights and the content is significant info for the regional film industry (Orlando, Florida). I will add additional content or edit my existing contributions to meet your criteria if neccessary. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgem4s_e50c.html" title="User:Dodgem4s">Dodgem4s</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/d/User_talk%7EDodgem4s_1b98.html" title="User talk:Dodgem4s">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dodgem4s_c5cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dodgem4s">contribs</a>) 18:35, 22 August 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a primary author of the content, I will make whatever changes to make the content appropriate for Wikipedia. But again, to reiterate -- there are already many links to third party sources that are listed within these nominated page for deletion that confirm the accuracy and significance (and violate no Wikipedia guidelines) of the respective submissions. All of these contested projects are currently listed on The Internet Movie Database (a third party source -- and the world's most comprehensive movie database). It was one of the main sources of my research and cite it throughout. The company also meets the Company Notability Guidelines (companies and corporations) -- it is currently among the most productive studios within the Southeast United States. And an objection was made to Michael Thomas Dunn being referenced as a notable alumni of the University of Central Florida wikipedia page. Well, Officially from the University of Central Florida Film Program web site (<a href="http://film.ucf.edu/links_webpages.php" class="external free" title="http://film.ucf.edu/links_webpages.php" rel="nofollow">http://film.ucf.edu/links_webpages.php</a>) he is listed as a notable alumni -- so I am going to once again add his name to notable alumni on the UCF page. Not only is it a third party source, but its from the official site of the College mentioned. I think this is all just a mistake or someone's personal agenda. But the content belongs on Wikipedia. I think I have proven every objective wrong or moot. He also fails to prove that it violates "Wiki is not a Soapbox" as there are no political slant listed in any of the documents.<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgem4s_e50c.html" title="User:Dodgem4s">Dodgem4s</a></li>

It's a pain having to clean up comments every time when you cut other people's comments in half and indent in random places. And use 4 '~' in a row to sign so your comments are timestamped. OK.

It is a place, not a company or corporation. Perhaps I didn't word that properly in these wiki pages or the IMDb listing has lead to some confusion -- but there is no company with that name. It is a shooting location much like the city of Orlando or Miami. I think it is a notable landmark in Lake County, Florida -- since it is the only film production site in the county. I'd also like to point out, 4 individual production companies have production offices located there -- including Gator animation and Velocity TV (none of the 4 companies are listed as individual pages on wiki -- so not a single instance that violates the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines).

<li><b>Comment:</b> <i>Alone and Restless was the first feature film produced by MTD Studios in 2004.</i> That implied to me that MTD Studios was more of independent film company than a facility. In my honest opinion, all the separate articles on the movies should be deleted since they have haven't received enough coverage or critical acclaim in the press to be considered notable. However, I would be willing to endorse keeping MTD Studios as part of a series of articles on the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Film_Industry_a796.html" title="Florida Film Industry">Florida Film Industry</a> which to me would be a notable article.

<li><b>Reply</b> Yeah, it was a little unclear -- it should have read: AAR was first feature produced at MTD Studios.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for merging the articles: I think it is a great idea for most of the individual shorts/documentaries. I will begin the process of merging Steel Legends and The Standoff. However, I think the 2 feature films Alone and Restless and Black Zone may deserve individual coverage (these were large projects in the area). Although, I think the Midnight Conflict short might merit its own article (at least for UCF film program background) since its success prompted the program to allow Digitally Shot (DV) projects in their curriculum -- which had previously been excluded (the film school used 16mm film exclusively until 1998). Here is the updated MTD Studios with the merge. -<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a> 10:51, 27 August 2006 (UTC)&lt;</p>

<dd>As I already said on the talk page: if you look right on the first page of your first book search link, the texts are about deslovakization, reslovakization (explicitely or per content) or things like "Slovakization of Czech words" (in a purely linguistic sense) and one is about "natural" Slovakization (because Rusyn is very similar to Slovak). I still think this is one reason for moving this and similar words to the wictionary. Nobody denies that the word technically exists like for any other nationality or language. <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 10:59, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As a general short remark, I wonder how one can talk about "Slovakization" after WWII with respect to Hungarians, when the number of Hungarians in (Czecho-)Slovakia increased during that period, while it decreased in Hungary - their mother country - itself. (And Khoikhoi, given your permanent eagerness in Hungary-related issues, are you sure you are not a very carefully hidden sockpuppet of someone I know?) <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 10:54, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, so like always one (Hungarian) vandal managed to manipulate the whole wikipedia. We will have the first article in the world titled Slovakization (original research by a sockpuppet user who has absolutely no idea about the topic and only knows that we have Kurdification so we have to have Slovakization too), In addition, in line with reality , however, the article will have to imply that no such organized process exists, rather the opposite. Neither the title nor the content will be correct, nevertheless we are going to keep it.

<li><b>Keep</b>, since there is a magyarization page also, so it would be a racist double standard not to keep it. In fact in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries discussing Slovakization is more essential given the daily treatment of Hungarians in Slovakia (Jan Slota, who is part of the governing coalition, called for the "flattening of Budapest" by tanks). His inclusion in the Slovak parliament has made Slovak-Magyar coexistence considerably more difficult. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphysikist_59c8.html" title="User:Alphysikist">Alphysikist</a> 07:12, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nobody has called for nothing, Arpad. He said that - if you read the whole quote - for the case Slovakia would be attacked by Hungary, and he said that when he was drunk. Also, he was "included" in the parlament also in the past. Next, it is completely irrelevant what an individual person thinks or says, I have told you this several times. Postcards and novels (cited by you) are also irrelevant, fascist and nationalist sources (cited by you) are also irrelevant. Next, if you have deleted such opinions from the Magyarisation article, you may not add them elsewhere. And I am leaving out "personal attacks", although you are an obvious fascist (which is a fact). And permament creation of sockpuppets is another form of deception. <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 10:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable, unverifiable. None of the sources above is really about the club, they are about a fire, some tax evasion, etc that happen to mention the club in passing. The sources do not verify the information in the article. If the fire is notable (which it isn't) the articles would be The Elk Grove Township Fire of 2005, Michael G. Wellek (famous suspected tax fraudster), etc. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 08:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please re-read the articles weregerbil; the first two articles discusses the club very explicitly; you can possibly argue that the arson investigation at the club was notable if you like but $12 million in cash seized by the IRS is pretty notable IMO. user:nathanhubbard 04:29, 19 August 2006 (CDT}</li>
<li>Ok, after re-reading I still can't see verification of what the Wikipedia article says. If a tax evasion investigation is notable (I don't think this one is) then there should be an article on that. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 10:35, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article about tax evasion investigation of Wellek clearly verifies the tax evasion investigation and is the topic of the article. Whether the IRS seizing $12 million is "notable" or not, I guess is a matter of opinion! user:nathanhubbard 08:37, 19 August 2006 (CDT}</li>
<li>One of the Wikipeidia criteria of whether a company or corporation is notable is whether thatcompany or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. Clearly, there are multiple, independents articles about the subject. I guess it comes down to whether those articles are "non-trivial" or not. user:nathanhubbard 08:38, 19 August 2006 (CDT}</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Weregerbil. Nathan, your sources don't actually describe the "business"; they describe tax evasion and a fire.

<li>I added some sources that describe the business a little better but I don't agree that something should be excluded from wikipedia just because its a "local" interest.

<li>Well I see your point, but what do you expect for sources? "The New York Times has determined that the song <i>Bad Touch</i> is about sex. Groundbreaking." For all of the <i>List of songs about _____ articles</i>, you're not going to find sources that say "This song is about _____".

<ul>
<li>It's amazing what people write about, sometimes. Before asserting that there are "things that are so obvious they're not written anywhere", <i>do the research</i>. You might find that there are copious sources on the subject, which you can use to entirely refute the argument that this is unverifiable. Please <i>do research and attempt to find sources</i>, rather than trying to argue that we should make exceptions to our sourcing policies. You should be working from sources in the first place, anyway. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How can you claim that? Many songs contain both, especially rap which can contain all three. The List of songs about money is just as broad.

<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_money.html" title="List of songs about money">List of songs about money</a> is maintainable given that it is focused on songs specifically about money, and doesn't just mention every rap song where the rapper happens to mention his bank account.

<li><b>Delete</b> Agreed that its completely unmanageable.

<li><b>Delete</b> sex is a human desire and thousands of songs have been written, or could be interpreted to be, pertaining to sex. Unmanagable and unverifiable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 22:55, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETuluvas2_e965.html" title="User:Tuluvas2">Tuluvas2</a> 16:40, 23 August 2006 (UTC) I am saying delete because this is such a subjective topic in a way. First of all different cultures would probably consider different things to consist of "sex". Would everyone world wide accept oral sex as being sex? (Obviously not just look at the JAMA from when Clinton was president). Also some songs may indirectly refer to sex but they do not directly refer to sex. Someone can talk about sex indirectly in a song and never mention the word sex or anything related to sex. What subjective stand-point do we base the meaning of the songs from? Do we include songs that we perceive as being related to sex that others will not perceive as being related to sex? From the perceptions of some people songs which talk about things not related to sex may be subliminally refering to sex, and to other people songs which subliminally refer to sex with out mentioning it may not appear to be about sex. Wikipedia should be for objective information and NPOV and I see that this list is going to automatically be at least partially point of view. (Someones point of veiw may be that the candy shop is actually a candy shop, even though my point of veiw is that the song is obviously refering to sex). But does my point of veiw automatically over rule someone elses perception? I guess we could ask the artist who makes the song what the song was actually about? Or we could make a list of songs that have the potential to be perceived as about sex? It is just a mess really, and what I have just said may not make any sense, but I vote for delete.
<ul>
<li>So the list "Songs about Drugs" is ok, but a similar list of "songs" is not? Drugs are just as taboo, illicit, and controversial as sex, but the "Songs about Drugs" list isn't being considered for deletion. Also, as far as I can tell, the two lists have the same format. So I ask- why the double standard?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETuluvas2_e965.html" title="User:Tuluvas2">Tuluvas2</a> 14:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC) I agree with the above poster that we should hold the standard to all lists similar to this one. The topic of the list had no reason in my desicion to vote for deletion. Are there any standards on how the Wikipedia community has dealt with lists such as this one? I don't want to go against the standards with my vote and if someone could give me a link to an article/rule about lists that could be interpreted to say this list should stay I would quickly change my vote based on the new evidence. However if nobody can, I will keep my vote delete for this list and advocate that we delete all similar lists. We must be equal and fair and if one list is removed for a reason all other lists that meet that reason should be removed. But like I mentioned before, if someone gives a link to a standard/rule about lists such as these on wikipedia that can be interpreted to say this list should stay, then I will change my vote to keep and advocate that we keep all other lists like this.</li>

<dd>Yes, and those things are the very basis of an article. There is verifiable sources. You have the operation being doubt by Jones together with a explanation of what it is from a verfiable <b>first hand source</b>. Besides a <b>verfiable first hand source</b>, you have the <i>essence</i> of the operation being given coverage in Fox News and Colmes talk show. Aside from that, you have the huge <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomena.html" title="Internet phenomena">Internet phenomena</a> of people talking about the subject. But of course, none of that is included in the page, SINCE IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AN ARTICLE in the first place. Did you read the talk page were i said that i <b>might</b> turn it into a real article if even more sources did show up? I wanted to wait for a maintream source to mention both the name and contents of the operation, even though it is a notable internet phenomena by now.

<p>Technosocialism is used by an author, who is not me (the original poster of this wiki), to describe Karl Capek's early 20th Century drama <i>Rossum's Universal Robots</i>(R.U.R). I point to this work specifically as a refutation of the term's notability.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Appears to be original research as the nominator cited. I do not understand the above appeal to the article on Capek. Certainly Capek is very notable and we have an article on him <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karel_%C4%8Capek_29f1.html" title="Karel Čapek">here</a> as well as on <a href="../../../r/2E/u/R.U.R._d715.html" title="R.U.R.">R.U.R.</a>. However, the fact that the author of an article about him was playful with language and coined a portmanteau does not mean that the word itself can piggyback onto the fame of the subject of the article it was used in. To claim notability for this word, you would have to show that the <i>word itself</i> is notable by its usage. A one-off usage does not render it so.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 10:42, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes technosocialism is a portmanteau. Technosocialism is a concatenation of the words (technology and socialism). Simply being a portmanteau is no grounds for exclusion, though. Smog is a portmanteau and their is an entry for that. It can also be spelled techno-socialism, by the way. I believe it most accurately describes the world at the beginning of the Capek play. Capek's play is ultimately a dsytopia, however, because the robots rise up and slay the humans. I don't think I invented this word or this idea but if you guys are saying that I did, well then I will be more than happy to take credit for it. I guess it just means I'll be famous someday.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the etymology of the word could stem directly from Technophilia.</p>
<p>Please also see technocracy.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Quoted from when I tried: "You must be (at least) a Level 2 user to make submissions to TV.com. All registered users earn points toward their level for browsing the site, writing reviews, posting on the boards and posting in their blog. Levels are calculated nightly." So, if I browse the site enough, write enough reviews, and post on boards, then I can earn enough points to get Level 2 access and then I'd be able to edit his entry. I have no idea whether TV.com edits or verifies any information that is submitted by users. In addition, the trivia on TV.com is almost identical to IMDB. Are there any Canadian news references to this claim? I have not found any on google. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 22:59, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The thing is you have to look at the age of the claim. This claim was from about a decade ago. The internet then was not the insidiously invasive tool it is today. Many newspapers weren't online, and people in general, don't go back and OCR old papers and stuff. Some have online indexes that are growing, but most don't. So I'm not surprised you can't find this online. Maybe tag it with a {{fact}} and see if someone else can come up with a citation. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 23:02, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The original question that I asked was whether this would even be a <b>claim of notability</b>, if it is true. Do any other people have an opinion as to whether it would make him notable, if true? According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> he would be notable if he considered one of the "Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers", or if he is a "Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions." He has appeared in many big-name TV productions, but in small roles, and I don't think that he meets any of the listed notability "tests". But we need to get the opinion of <b>more users</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 23:11, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmmm. <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogwarts.html" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a> doesn't exist. Nor does <a href="../../../p/h/l/Phlogiston.html" title="Phlogiston">phlogiston</a>. I see what you mean though, this seems to be an article describing an organisation, which article is only there to say <i>"there is no such organisation"</i>. I can see an argument for keeping this one but renaming it something which wouldn't imply that it was the name of an extant organisation. Something along the lines of Australian coastguard services (lowerrcase on "coastguard" to emphasise that it's not an organisation <i>per se</i>) or Coastguards in Australia. <b>Keep</b> and rename. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 11:54, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I feel it was clear what my original rationale meant, even if it was semantically ambigious. Nevertheless, I've refactored it.

<li>I can't see where that comes from. The article states (in paraphrase) that "there is no Coast Guard service in Australia which is analogous to the US Coast Guard", and gives apparently-verifiable refernces about what bodies fulfil the services that the US Coast Guard performs.

<li>The article is a sub-article of <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_guard.html" title="Coast guard">coast guard</a> that covers the various coast guards in Australia, just as do the various other sub-articles for other countries, in a single article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. All the other articles for other countries are actually for individual institutions. This article, while it could be turned into something not completely useless, currently has sections about two organisations and one suggested organisation. The two organisations are linked by having similar purposes, but really could have separate articles. The ALP proposed Coast Guard (which is not a current proposal) is only linked to the others by the fact that uses the name Coast Guard, following the US usage of the term, rather than that established by the AVCG in Australia. I don't see any need for a page linking the three sections (and/or info about the Coastwatch division of the Customs service) together in one page. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 14:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Get rid</b> of this article - if published in Australia, its probably illegal as its prejudicial; its too much information about a disproven rumour. This guy, guilty or not, is a "no body".

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If the basis of your argument to remove the article is non notable persona and Arthurs actions have "no inherent notability(??!!), it is countered by the fact that he is an Australian prisoner on remand and has received enough media attention to warrant the Australian government at both state and federal level and the British ambassador defending against a "rumour" that originated BEFORE the alleged severely brutal, inhumane murder of Sofia Rodriguez.Elpocoloco 03:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, let's keep the discussion about the subject, not about the various editors involved. He is a suspect in a notorious crime, which is borderline notable; the Thompson rumors, even though false, were widely circulated and push this over the line to notability IMO.

<li>Ankit Fadia is a self-proclaimed hacker. None of his claims have ever been verified from reliable sources Silina 12:40, 19 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Silina (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Silina_b053.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Silina">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>
<ul>
<li>Ankit Fadia's biography must be deleted since he is a self proclaimed hacker and none of his claims have been verified. Some of his claims have been published by various media but never the less they aren't sufficient evidence.
<p>A hacker is acknowledged as a hacker if and only if his name figures in various high-standard technology sites or technology books. On the contrary most real hackers consider Ankit Fadia as a script-kiddie.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - The question here is not whether most of the other hackers in the world call him a script kiddie or something worse, but whether he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is the most notable "hacker" in India and is accepted by the media as such. A search for "ankit fadia" gives 30000+ ghits. The article cites BBC which says the same thing. His first book "The Unofficial Guide to Ethical Hacking" was a best-seller. A look at the history of the article sill show that this user has a strong bias against Ankit Fadia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ankit_Fadia&amp;diff=70419979&amp;oldid=70419381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ankit_Fadia&amp;diff=70419979&amp;oldid=70419381" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>, (assuming that all the IPs belong to the same person).

<li><b>Should be Deleted</b> - I feel Ankit Fadia should be deleted. If deletion is out of question, at least he should be removed from the category of 'Indian Hackers'. He is not acknowledged as a hacker by the "Hackers Community". There are various reasons of this. He has never submitted a bugtraq or exploit.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Ankit Fadia is not recognised by any Notable Hacker or Security organisation, other than as a fraud. As Per the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" class="external text" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" rel="nofollow">hacker how-to</a> (a hacker document by ESR, one of the first, and well reputed hackers) there are 3 things one must do to call himself a hacker
<ul>
<li>Do you speak code, fluently?</li>
<li>Do you identify with the goals and values of the hacker community?</li>
<li>Has a well-established member of the hacker community ever called you a hacker?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ankit Fadia cannot code, or at least, has never done so in public. The Second Question cannot be verified or not. However, Fadia does not qualify on the last count. No one has called him a hacker, but himself, and the media. ESR adds a note in the howto on people such as Ankit Fadia
<p><i>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.</i></p>

<li>I agree with most of the people out here that Ankit Fadia is a self proclaimed hacker. There is no proof that he has really worked in security field. Rather he uses tools developed by other eminent hackers without giving proper credits to them, which is against the hacker ethics. He also uses the tools which damage not only the security, but also the integrity of the computer system, which is also against the hacker ethics.About his books, he just provides tips and tricks to tweak a computer which are already documented and calls them hacks. - 203.129.199.148 17:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC) <small>contribution moved to chronologically-appropriate place.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Ankit fadia is not acting professional security persion also. Leave the pint of he becomming a hacker. First of all I would like to add that i have read his book ethical hacking. Which is just copy paste from the web sites. He has pasted even hundres of pages as virus code. His book is not increasing knowledge and the things specified in his book are very old none of them is uptodate. He has also started a course with the named CEH by Ankit Fadia. Lots of ppl have fooled by the name CEH considering CEH form EC council and doing his certification but his certification dont have value in india also leave the rest of the world. So he is just fooling the newbies. He dont have any achivements in hacking field. Just media has created fame for him. So I recommend that this artical should be deleted.</li>

The concept of 'half-truths' ie especially truths that lie, is a missing link that may explain the 'original sin' from the 'garden of Eden', this has logical implications for several concepts such as truth, and lie, and deception.<br />
The concept of truths that lie is an unrecognized logical error in human philosophy that has implications to most all concepts dealing with forms of logic and philosophy.<br />

Would this not be a form of censorship and contrary to the purpose of this dictionary&#160;?<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<p>Wikipedia has thousands of articles about various action figures. I think an article for a guy who claims to be a master jewel thief, whether true or not, deserves his own page.

<p>Thank you for re-instating. I am the author of the article and the great granddaughter of A. F. Pirie. I can improve the article per your welcome comments. I do have verifiable sources for my statements - I hold all his original correspondence, newspaper clippings from 1870s to 1903, Press badge, Chicago Press conference speeches, letter from Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, and genealogical info (funeral card), photos, etc. Part of the biography can be backed up with his entry in Canada's "Who's Who" of 1898 by Morgan<a href="http://groups.msn.com/CanadaWorldWarOnetheFirstContingent/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=840" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.msn.com/CanadaWorldWarOnetheFirstContingent/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=840" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> which I can add as further reading. I wrote from my overall research, rather than utilizing the work of others, but naturally, I can go back and source everything. His obituary provides further info and appeared in the Toronto Star, Toronto Evening Telegram, the Globe, Regina Leader, Hamilton Times, and nearly every newspaper in Canada. Yes, he is unknown today, but in terms of 1880s Toronto - he was well known and respected. In terms of Mr. George Pirie, I hold his correspondence from the 1840s to 1860s, his obituaries, financial papers, and photographs. Mr. Pirie faced greater obstacles than his son as he was establishing himself in Canada, but his contributions to Guelph were significant in his day. That being said, I respect the input of others. Once again thank you for your consideration. Mpirie 00:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Commend</b> Sorry, if you know better than Einstein, the citation (opening sentance): every co-ordinate system "can be used as reference body with equal rights and equal succes in the formulation of the general laws in nature" came from his book.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The problem might not be with the citation from Einstein, but how the article attempts to use quotations taken out of context to try to give a "scientific gloss" to this sophistry/codswallop. In the first paragraph we have "Einstein does not claim that systems are equal, no they have equal rights or they are similar in certain aspects." Examine this even for a moment and it's revealed as patent nonsense - who in the world <i>would</i> say that "all systems are equal"? What on earth does "equal" mean in this context? What on earth does "equal rights" mean in this context? Who in the world would question that "systems...are similar in certain aspects"? Just because you stick Einstein in front does not turn garbage into gold.</li>

<li><b>Commend</b> Einstein doesn't say: "all systems are equal", he said: "they have equal rights"; in the context this point is proven. The authors of "that paper" don't speak about homeopathy, they speak about quantum black hole analogies or white hole analogies; this is what homeopaths were writing all along.

<li><b>Reply</b> You miss my point. My point was why say "Einstein does not claim that all systems are equal?". <i>Nobody</i> would say that all systems are equal. Like saying "Einstein would not say that 2+2=5". The context of all systems having "equal rights" is not in the slightest "proven", neither can it be as it is patently a nonsensical statement. What do "rights" mean in this context?</li>

All with references. The article at the moment fulfills none of these criteria, probably because it is just a "POV among homeopathic circles", and the rest of the scientific community don't care to give it any credence at all. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 16:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>-Yikes, as far as I know the Pokemon franchise is one of the most major and notable videogame-based full media franchises in the history of the industry, and Diamond and Pearl are currently the games in much of that industry's spotlights. Add to that that when the game is released in Japan in a little over a month, Diaruga and Parukia would easily be among the most notable characters especially since they will be on the covers to the game (and being on the cover and representative of the game actually gives them more point than all the other Pokemon creatures), so I think you might not be fully aware of the situation.&#160;:( <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">(I appreciate talk!)</a></sup></b> 16:57, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>-Yikes, as far as I know the Pokemon franchise is one of the most major and notable videogame-based full media franchises in the history of the industry, and Diamond and Pearl are currently the games in much of that industry's spotlights. Add to that that when the game is released in Japan in a little over a month, Diaruga and Parukia would easily be among the most notable characters especially since they will be on the covers to the game (and being on the cover and representative of the game actually gives them more point than all the other Pokemon creatures), so I think you might not be fully aware of the situation.&#160;:( <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">(I appreciate talk!)</a></sup></b> 16:55, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, sorry but if you nominate one pokemon you might as well nominate all of them.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>: To claim that an article should be deleted simply because its a target of vandalism is not how Wikipedia works, and regardless of my opinion on the Pokemoncruft here, I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending anything but a speedy keep based on that aspect of the nominator's rationale. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 17:59, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> You seem to have something against all Pokemon; a great deal of your (few) contributions have been to nominate several Pokemon-related articles for deletion. Suffice it to say that despite your assertions, Pokemon is indeed a notable series of games, in part due to it's extreme popularity <i>worldwide.</i> --Robaato 19:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - you're making an effort to stop vandalism in articles by nominating them for deletion? That logic is basically flawed in that articles only occasionally get vandalised in the idea that the person who vandalised the article had the clear intent. Also, why nominate <i>Palkia</i> for vandalism when it, when there could be many other articles that suffer, have more vandalism? The article in question has very little "vandalism". --<a href="../../../t/e/t/User%7ETetsuya-san_b680.html" title="User:Tetsuya-san">T</a><a href="../../../t/e/t/User%7ETetsuya-san_Esperanza_a101.html" title="User:Tetsuya-san/Esperanza"><font color="#009933">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/t/User%7ETetsuya-san_b680.html" title="User:Tetsuya-san">tsuya-san</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/e/t/User_talk%7ETetsuya-san_b44e.html" title="User talk:Tetsuya-san">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tetsuya-san_c981.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tetsuya-san">contribs</a>)</small> 00:09, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is just like the discussion over the deletion of Diaruga. It is unecessary. Parukia and Diaruga are the main advertising pokemon of Diamond and Pearl, and they are the two lengendary pokemon of Diamond and Pearl. I would like to raise the point, If you propose deletion of Parukia and Diaruga, why not propose deletion of all other pokemon related to Diamond and Pearl? It doesn't make senseThey are highly notable pokemon in a highly notable game. This deletion nomination is rediculous. <a href="../../../0/-/1/User%7E0-172.html" title="User:0-172">0-172</a> 01:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> the fact that the user also tried to delete Pokémon Diamond and Pearl as well makes me question that this is nomination is in good faith. Also vandalism is not a reason to delete. --Edgelord 02:04, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: This article may not have much to it now, but that is because it is an article about a future release character. Within about a month, I'm sure that this article will expand and be just as relevent as every other Pokémon article. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESaturnYoshi_465c.html" title="User:SaturnYoshi">SaturnYoshi</a> 16:59, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A non-notable videogame that is also a hot-spot for vandalism. The deletion of this article as well as with it's sister pages of minor and non-notable characters will help prevent further vandalism on Wikipedia. Please understand that I'm aware the game is large in popularity in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. But this is why we have a Wiki in Japanese, is it not? An article already exists in J-Wiki, however it's lacking the length of information the english article has. Possibly the article could be translated back to Japanese, merged with the Japanese article and then the english one could be deleted? Thanks for understanding.

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Regnus" does <i>not</i> mean "king", that would be "rex". The <i>only</i> way to make "regnus agnus mundi" grammatical is to read "Regnus" as a proper name, i.e. as the name of a person, country, or the like. Nevertheless, no reputable source I am aware of (e.g. Encyclopaedia Britannica) knows either this "R.A.M." or a person called "Regnus". There is the word "regnuM" (with M) meaning "kingdom", but Coelho consistently writes "regnuS". Furthermore, even "Kingdom, the lamb of the world" would not make too much sense, would it?

<p>Okay, bit of an unusual AfD here. This article has been getting created, deleted, altered, moved and so on for about 2 months. Basically some people want it to be a cross-namespace redirect, others don't, some want it now to define notability in a non-Wikipedia-centric way... which seems like a dicdef to me. Anyway, no vote on my part yet, I'd just like to see a more definitive resolution reached through consensus.

<p>Dead Presidents &amp; British royalty should not be the only individuals history included on Wikipedia in my opinion. I have been working on adding color to this article, in addition to categories and additional relevant links. Please notice that there are significant notes, maps, and historical information and documentation on the main site dedicated to this individual. There is nothing trivial about the amount of research and organization spent regarding this individual.

An online search, for historical persons of note, is biased toward modern persons, therefore should not be the criteria for determination of notability.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am well aware of that rule, since *I* wrote it. But what has THIS man done, in his OWN life that makes him notable? Was he the first sheep farmer in Manitoba? Did he revolutionize the printing of phamplets on contraception? Was he the first black lesbian elected official in Paraguay? So far your article is basically an article that could be writen about any person who lived in the 19th century.

<p><b>Delete</b> as not notable. Another question might be whether he owned land that was subsequently used for some notable purpose. To be fair, the article does identify him as a mason (someone who builds structures with stone and brick, rather than a Freemason, which he was as well) by occupation, but only in the second-last paragraph. This is what journalists call "burying your lede". <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 19:45, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> John Mould and his brother Thomas were the first individuals of their particular surname in the entire state of New York to be naturalized as U.S. Citizens. John Mould was a well-known and respected Pioneer of Ballston Spa, Saratoga County, New York. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.210.153.157 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.210.153.157_0d4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.210.153.157">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b>. Being one of the first persons of one's surname to be naturalized as a citizen in a particular state is not a claim to notability.

Nor is being a stonemason a claim to notability. Also, he could not have been a <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pioneer.html" title="Pioneer">pioneer</a> of a town incorporated more than 30 years before he arrived in the United States. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 20:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Spice Girls discography is an un-needed article that contains a lot of inaccurate and inappropriate information. The group released only three albums and 10 singles - so that information can easily be merged with the main Spice Girls article. The rest of the information in the article relates to the solo releases made by each member of the group; a Melanie C album release, for example, shouldn't be included on a article detailing information relating to the group that she used to be in. Also, the solo information <b>already exists</b> in the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Beckham_45d1.html" title="Victoria Beckham">Victoria Beckham</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Bunton_b2c4.html" title="Emma Bunton">Emma Bunton</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_B_3c92.html" title="Melanie B">Melanie B</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geri_Halliwell_33b3.html" title="Geri Halliwell">Geri Halliwell</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_C_dee1.html" title="Melanie C">Melanie C</a> articles - so it is simply repeating already existing information.</p>
<p>So I propose that the Spice Girls discography be deleted and the information relating to Spice Girls' release be merged with Spice Girls article. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmers_934f.html" title="User:Rimmers">Rimmers</a> 17:32, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I wouldn't advocate keeping an article like this for a garage band or obscure local group, but with 50+ million wordwide record sales and at one time being the biggest band in the world, I'd say some level of discographical information is appropriate. I also like that it includes the solo work all in one article, it makes it easier to compare the girls' solo careers than flipping between 5 different articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> As someone who creates music, this article makes very little sense to me. For example, it says that someone doing "artmastering" might change the "<i>order of movements or instrumental parts</i>". Maybe, but if so they're not <i>mastering</i>, they're <i>arranging</i>, which is a whole different step in the recording process. Also, I don't recall ever reading about "artmastering" in any professional musicians' magazine, not even when they have whole articles about the mastering process. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:47, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The text states that changing the "..order of movements or instrumental parts.." is done only in some extreme cases. I think you will agree, that changing the order of tracks, or cutting off and fading out a section of a radio mix to fit it into a prescribed time slot, are tasks commonly performed in mastering studios. So I see no issue, if in some extreme cases, the artist wishes to change an order of movements. As far as calling it "arranging", you are right, it definitely goes beyond the regualar mastering, that is probably why they called it "armastering" because it involves artistic decisions. <a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoy7_86c4.html" title="User:Voy7">R.

<li><b>Keep</b> Do a websearch under "artmastering" see what you will find. "Maniac" and its subsequent remixes were big hits in the US. Another article on one of the leading music sites MusicBizAcademy.com features Art Sayecki and Artmastering and mentions Michael Sembello and "Maniac" <a href="http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm</a> . I also found a testimonial of Michael Sembello, the author of "Maniac", on www.artmastering.com website.

Not even mentioning that the article which you try to diminish is an editorial and features several competing studios so there is no question about credibility <a href="http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The source article from musicbiz academy is legit, The writer (G-Man) is legit, The website that published it is legit. That is already enough. But also there is a testimonial by Michael Sembello on artmastering.com website specifically mentioning thanking for work on "Maniac" and there is a picture of Sembello and Sayecki together in the studio. Most internet articles vanish after 6 months, while this article is kept on many websites for almost 3 years, so it is obviously meaningful and people read it and therefore is <b>Notable</b>. I have no time to browse through way-back-machine but I'm sure that if the article stayed for so lon on so many websites, it was much more popular right after it was published.</li>

<li>Keeper, Definitely. A one of my demo tracks was mastered with artmastering, so I have had a first hand experience with the process. I live in Oxnarxd and visit LA often. I had a limited budget and I couldn't go to back to the recording studio but I was not happy with a guitar part in my song, so we cut it out and changed the pitch of the first bar in the bridge to match the spliced parts. It was fun. Sayecki is well known here in a LA and obviously in the world, after all those articles appeared.

<li><b>Keep.</b> My name is Scott G of G-Man Marketing. I'm also the recording artist known as The G-Man, and write the "Communication Nation" column for the Advertising Industry Newswire. I have written more than 200 articles for Web sites and print publications and I stand behind each of them, including the one referenced here. During an interview conducted with Art Sayecki in Dec 2003, I learned about the process of armastering and heard several examples of it. I chose to have two of my albums, "Sonic Tonic" and "Motion Potion," mastered by Art using his process of artmastering. As far as I can see, the text is correct other than the date of artmastering of "Maniac" (re-release) which I believe took place in early 2003, but this can be easily corrected by simply contacting Michael Sembello or Art himself. If you have any questions about my articles or this comment, just go to <a href="http://www.gmanmusic.com" class="external free" title="http://www.gmanmusic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gmanmusic.com</a> and you can reach me via e-mail from there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Scottgthegman (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scottgthegman_77d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scottgthegman">contribs</a>).</small> 25 Aug 19:37 UTC</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't doubt that Sayecki is running a legitimate business and has happy customers such as Fran Lucci, Scott G, and Sembello. Neither do I doubt that he has an original view of the mastering process. But that doesn't qualify either the company or Sayecki's philosophy as being notable according to Wikipedia's guidelines. Being associated with a notable person is not a valid criterion for notability in itself, just like the staff of the US president is not notable unless there was a lot of publicity around them in the mainstream media. If Sembello ever mentioned in public that he specifically chose the company Art Mastering to master his cds, then that would warrant a paragraph in the article about Sembello and/or the cd in question (provided that these are notable for a Wikipedia article). <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHankwang_1955.html" title="User:Hankwang">Han-Kwang</a> 10:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Observation</b>: Please read the article thoroughly. <b>Sembello in fact did mention it in public or for the public.</b> Here is a quotation from the aforesaid article by G-Man: <i>"There can be tremendous loyalty toward mastering engineers on the part of artists and producers. Michel Sembello, composer/performer of songs from hit albums and the huge film "Flashdance," told Art Sayecki "After hearing what you did with 'Maniac,' you are the only person I will let master my stuff."</i> Please notice that G-Man is directly quoting Sembello. I doubt that he would write this if he didn't have supporting evidence. If you scout the web for his articles you will find that they all are supported by an extensive, almost obsessive (no offense intended), research. I think that if an artist such as Sembello makes this kind of public statement then it is definitely notable by wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoy7_86c4.html" title="User:Voy7">R.

<dd>To closing editor, it appears to me that Leibniz has some particular axe to grind on some of these deletions. The article states this man has published eighteen books (although not naming them all). That is sufficient notability. I think this deletion is in bad faith. I just don't have the time to investigate what's really going on here, but my gut tells me something peculiar. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 22:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> To Whom It May Concern, including The Closing Editors, about the truth, the only truth, and nothing but the very truth. The facts can be verified by everybody, he or she, wikipedian, ordinary people or whosoever: <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibniz.html" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a> <b>manipulated</b> in a way which verifies me first posting: “The Leibniz-spoors, Aug. 19, 2006, show a personal annihilation policy of Mr. Leibniz against these three entries: <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Abendroth_5509.html" title="Wolfgang Abendroth">Wolfgang Abendroth</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Albrecht_f9ac.html" title="Richard Albrecht">Richard Albrecht</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinhard_Opitz_0315.html" title="Reinhard Opitz">Reinhard Opitz</a> - all of them German social scientist &amp; left-wing scholars.

</ul>
<p>– I had a look on the “history” of the very method Leibniz systematically did apply in the “case” of Dr <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Albrecht_f9ac.html" title="Richard Albrecht">Richard Albrecht</a> the last three days since he nominated Dr A. for deletion (Aug. 19, 207, 18:32)[1]: for example Leibniz not only neglected the wikipedia principle according to “Living People” like Dr. A. (who, as far as I know, is still alive): “potentially libellous material <b>must be removed</b> immediately”, but also any rational rule of any “open debate” run publicly and expressed in another wikipedia-principle according to the deletion process. Moreover, whenever read thoroughly, the Leibnitz-“history” from Aug, 19, 2006, to Aug, 22, 2006, clearly and without any doubt demonstrates that this man is manipulating as his best: what Leibnitz stigmatized as <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essay_mill.html" title="Essay mill">essay mill</a> when characterizing scholarly texts of Dr A. on Aug. 20, 2006, 14:23, the next days got what sociologists name "<a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-fulfilling_prophecy.html" title="Self-fulfilling prophecy">self-fulfilling prophecy</a>” (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_K._Merton_a0cc.html" title="Robert K. Merton">Robert K. Merton</a>): prominent en.wikipedia-member Leibniz himself - and nobody else - defined what he had proclaimed as such (Aug. 22, 2006). Finally, for detecting Leibniz´ numerous manipulations needs some time, Leibniz declared, for reasons, Dr. A.s “nomination” for deletion as an <b>urgent case</b>, thinking that after Dr. A´s entry will be wiped out nobody will be interested in this individual “case”, and what he, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibniz.html" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a>, really did will be hidden forever. - M.

<p><br />
Somebody self-naming after the German philosopher <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibniz.html" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a> was at work 11:50, 21 August 2006. Under the label "ridiculous self-promotion and spam link to essay mill" this man deleted a passage in the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Engels_f952.html" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> entry on "The General &amp; His Shadow". The passage Leibniz deleted runs as follows:</p>
<p>"In remembrance of the historical democratic and socialist movements in Germany in 1848/1849, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">German</a> <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_psychologist.html" title="Social psychologist">social psychologist</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Albrecht_f9ac.html" title="Richard Albrecht">Richard Albrecht</a> read a public lecture in Cologne (Rhineland), 150 years later in 1988, on the specific role Frederick Engels played as an anti-Prussian partisan and counterpart of the Prussian police agent Dr. Wilhelm Stieber (alias Schmidt). This scholarly piece first appeared in print in 2000 (<i>Almanach der Varnhagen-Gesellschaft</i>, ed. Dr. Nikolaus Gatter, vol. 1 (2000), 197-208, Berlin: Verlag Arno Spitz <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 3-8305-0025-4</a>; but it became available online free of charge in 2004. It gives insights into the personality of Frederick Engels (nicknamed "the general") before, during and after his emigration (first to Basel in Switzerland, then to Manchester): see Richard Albrecht, "Gegenspieler - Der General und sein Schatten: Engels, Stieber &amp; die preußische Reaktion 1851/52. Historischer Bericht zum ersten Kommunistenprozeß zu Köln" [Counterparts - The General and His Shadow: Engels, Stieber &amp; the Prussian Reactionary Forces, 1851/52. Another look at the first "Colonial Communist Trial"] [<a href="http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/hausarbeit/jul/25110.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/hausarbeit/jul/25110.html" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>]."</p>
<p>Who so ever will read this documentary essay written by an experienced German <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a>, e.g. the online-version (I did, and gave the actual link), will, as a matter of fact, ascertain that this piece, originally a public lecture, in 1998, published in 2000 (printed, in an anthology which appeared at Arno Spitz, Berlin), and 2004 (as published online by GRIN Verlag für akademische Texte, Munich) is by no means any "<a href="../../../e/s/s/Essay_mill.html" title="Essay mill">essay mill</a>" in the definition Leibnitz coined out when, yesterday, posting five times (starting 13:39, and ending top 20:25): "a business, usually online, which dishonestly sells essays and other forms of homework assignments to students who are incapable or unwilling to do it themselves"), but is a legitime scholarly publication completely free of charge.</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels himself once stated: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating", and that´s why I do hope that relevant en.wikipedia.org-admins will, as soon as possible, stop future vandal acts of Mr. Leibniz as a chap who indeed, the last days, was running amok when executing his personal policy of annihilating Richard Albrecht and other still living German left-wing scholars and civil right figures. -M.

<li><b>Reply</b> Following the posting of the 2 tags, the author, <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> posted a message on both the talk pages of Users - <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> highlighting other articles where quotations from their holy text appear.<br />
<b>1).</b> Anthony.bradbury marked the article for deletion because of: <i>" Evangelical text; not encyclopaedic"</i> If we look at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Wedding_Feast_130d.html" title="Parable of the Wedding Feast">Parable of the Wedding Feast</a> it contains various holy quotes and says: <i>"Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready."</i> If this text can be allowed with many 1000's of other quotes, then why ban text from the Sikh Holy Book?<br />
<b>2).</b> Both these users have failed to directly address this matter when raised on their Talk pages. Why? No reply has been given to the key question – If quotes from the holy Bible can be allowed, then why can't one quote from the <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a>, which is the Sikh Holy Book?<br />
<b>3).</b> Tonywalton said: <i>"...this in itself is an attempt to maintain the POV of the page"</i> He has failed to see that this article SGGS on Meat does not contain any POV by the author but lists various quotes from the Holy Book of the Sikhs called the <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> for short on this subject. These quotation are not POVs – They are facts on which a Sikh has to base his or her life! They are matters of serious importance to anyone interested in <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> and reading this article. As the fifth largest organised religion, the text in this article is notable and important to the 23million Sikhs in the world. Further, the article clearly say: <i>This page is strictly for the purposes of recording the message of the Sikh holy scripture and <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh_Guru_e1fb.html" title="Sikh Guru">Sikh Guru</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Granth_Sahib_3e2a.html" title="Guru Granth Sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</a> regarding the matter of Meat and its consumption. <b>Please only add text from <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> or <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varan_Bhai_Gurdas_6af1.html" title="Varan Bhai Gurdas">Varan Bhai Gurdas</a> on this page</b> - All personal and other views should be stated on the page: Sikh Diet</i> This statement is not banning anyone but issuing guidance so that the Holy Quotes and the Interpretations can be maintained in an orderly and organised fashion.<br />
<b>4).</b> There are 5 rules governing article that have to be deleted: Not encyclopedic quality, not verifiable, original research, not NPOV and copyright material. This article avoid all five of these factors and hence should be allowed to be kept.<br />
<b>5).</b> Some users have shown a clear bias towards similar articles on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Look at these similar articles here: <big><b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Wise_and_the_Foolish_Builders_61ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Wise and the Foolish Builders">Parables</a></b></big> In both these cases we have verbatim quotes from holy text based on a central theme. Why keep one (ie <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>) and delete the other (ie: <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>) - <b>This shows clear bias</b> and is against Wikipedia policy and the law of the land (UK) --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - HariSingh, I have to say that I do agree with *some* of the concerns raised by Anthony.bradbury and Tonywalton. However, I do not agree that the use of quotations is inappropriate. Although this might border on original research, I'm of the opinion that extracting quotes from the Sikh holy book showing differing points of view is akin to referring to other third-party sources. In this sense, it's not original research.</li>
<li>However, the article in its current form has serious neutrality issues. It starts by saying what can and cannot appear on the page (which is not appropriate on Wikipedia). Statements like "here is no reason to rely on advice by any other third party." are not appropriate. The tone of the article seems more akin to a "guideline for Sikhs" as opposed to presenting the differing views on meat eating present amongst Sikhs. The views of scriptural sources are the most important for Sikhs, but they are not the only views or opinions.</li>
<li>The topic discussed is important, so my opinion is <b>NPOV and merge with Sikh Diet</b>. Sikh Diet might be best moved to Sikh dietary restrictions. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 19:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You say: <i>"…. the article in its current form has serious neutrality issues."</i><br />
The article is primarily quotations from the SGGS – As a Sikh, are you saying that the <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> is not neutral? The quotes are verbatim text from the holy scripture just like make hundreds of quotes in any encyclopaedia. I fail to see how this poses an issue with neutrality??<br />
You also said <i>"It starts by saying what can and cannot appear on the page (which is not appropriate on Wikipedia)."</i><br />
1). This article is entitled – SGGS on Meat which means that the article is informing the readers about the exact message of the holy <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh_Scripture_8da7.html" title="Sikh Scripture">Sikh Scriptures</a> (the <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Guru_Granth_Sahib_838c.html" title="Sri Guru Granth Sahib">Sri Guru Granth Sahib</a> or <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a>) to the world in connection with meat. This title in itself restricts what can be put in this article – I believe that this means that only text from the SGGS can be put here.<br />
2). Many articles on Wikipedia are restricted in various ways– The main page is restricted (full protected), various articles are restricted eg <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> (semi-protected), etc for various reasons. The fact that the statement "Please only add text from SGGS or Varan Bhai Gurdas on this page" does not mean that a user cannot add other important text to the page – The statement is there to focus the attention of the Users to the preferred segmentation of the subject matter – It is not a complete block – Is it? It would be preferred if all the holy text was to appears on the page: SGGS on Meat and subjective matter to appears at Sikh Diet. This is just a logical arrangement which makes the patrolling of the articles easier.<br />
Finally, you say <i>"Statements like 'here is no reason to rely on advice by any other third party.' are not appropriate."</i> Surely that's no reason to delete an article which is what we are deciding here! – That sentence can be changed if you feel that other people can give better advice to a Sikh than their Guru!! --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 01:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry about the late reply. I'm not active on Wikipedia at the moment. Yes, as a Sikh, I'm saying the SGGS in not neutral (it teaches against many things and advocates other things, hence it's not neutral). But that was not what I was referring to. I was talking about the way the article was worded, not the quotes. Your other points:
<ul>
<li>1.That's fair enough. But you shouldn't put that in the article. An article should not contain disclaimers of what should or should not be on a page.</li>
<li>2.See above. This is not similar to protecting pages. Protecting pages is done to combat vandalism.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is *not* a site to give advice to Sikhs on how to live their life based on their religious teachings. It's designed to *document* Sikh religious teachings, alternative interpretations and critiscm of the religion. Either way, I feel that this should be merged with Sikh Diet, where a full look at the issues with meat eating are discussed. Thoughts by prominent scholars on SIkhism must be looked at just as you look at quotes from the SGGS. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 11:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article is like many other such articles on religion which use quotations from their holy texts: Just a few examples of article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> that use quotations from their holy texts are:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Leaven_0ab2.html" title="Parable of the Leaven">Parable of the Leaven</a> four quotation from the holy text</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Weeds_01c3.html" title="Parable of the Weeds">Parable of the Weeds</a> 3 quotes</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Pearl_fba6.html" title="Parable of the Pearl">Parable of the Pearl</a> 2 quotes</li>

</li>
<li>So, if you think quoting from holy text is wrong then all the above articles are also wrong and should be deleted as well! I suggest you read the Talk page on the Article to see the original reasons given for the deletion of this article.

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>For all the Parables and SGGS on Meat article - The point of all these quotations is to inform the reader of what the Holy texts have to say – that I hope you will agree is an important point; an important issue and a mechanism that needs to be preserved. The job of Encyclopaedias is to correctly inform its readers!! Without quotations you get to a situation when wrong messages of what is in the holy text can be conveyed as is happening with some aspects of Islam. So it is very important that we are allowed to quote these text verbatim so that the message is not tampered with - Discussion can be NPOV or POV, etc and these can be added to these articles if required. The quotations in themselves do not have a POV or NPOV – They are of a factual nature. The quote from the holy Bible is a FACT which has existed for 2000 years. Whether you believe it or not is another matter – Many billions believe in these facts. The writings of the Bible, Koran, SGGS, etc are all FACTS – They are NOT NPOV or POV. If I write that the <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> says <b>"There is one God"</b> – That is a factual statement. If you go and look in the SGGS, then you will find that statement there. Whether you want to believe the statement or not – is another matter. Verbatim quotations are facts not subject to the POV or NPOV criterion. When we start making our own comments and have discussions on these texts, it becomes POV or NPOV. I urge all participants here to vote and argue to keep the SGGS on Meat and all Parables article as well as they convey important historic messages. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 23:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly Keep</b> Disencouraging Sikhs from reading their holy text would be the same as deterring Christians from the Holy Bible.--Pssoor 22:07, 19 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Pssoor (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pssoor_01ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pssoor">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> An encyclopedia should contain information of all different religions and the different aspects of the religions. Why should the teachings of the Sikh holy book not be contained, an encyclopedia should not be biased or false. All quotations from different holy texts should be regarded as divine, and should be handled with complete respect. A man can not be called peaceful, if he disregards other religions. Where is the justice of deleting an article which contains holy text? There is no text which offends anyone. It is true and only true.<br />
When one's religion is questioned, it is their duty to defend it, therefore it was necessary for me to make an account in Wikipedia, although I have browsed through it many times before, for a long period.--Pssoor 16:28, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The page lists quotations from the Sikh Holy Book called the <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Guru_Granth_Sahib_838c.html" title="Sri Guru Granth Sahib">Sri Guru Granth Sahib</a> or <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> for short. This page is very similar to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Wise_and_the_Foolish_Builders_61ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Wise and the Foolish Builders">Parables</a> pages which are also being discussed as candidates for deletion.<br />
1). It surprises me that at the parables site you voted: <i>[Strong keep- Quality of articles should not dictate whether they are kept. Subjects are clearly notable. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 00:31, 20 August 2006 (UTC)]</i> but here you have voted to delete? I would love to know why?<br />
2). You say this is <i>" Ridiculously POV"</i> – The page consists of quotation from the Sikh holy book – How does is differ from the quotations from the holy Bible? If this is " Ridiculously POV" than isn't the parables also the same?<br />
3). You say <i>"subject matter is already covered at Sikh Diet"</i> – where in the Sikh Diet article does it narrate the sayings of the Guru which form the basis of the Sikh Diet article? Where in the Sikh Diet page do find what the Guru has said about eating meat? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not similar to the parable pages at all. Read my longer comment down below, I addressed that. It was the intro that I felt was POV, not the quotes. It pretty much says "Sikhs are to base their decisions on diet on these quotes." I'm sure not all Sikhs agree, just as not every Jew stays kosher. And if the Sikh diet article doesn't have a section on what the SGGS says about diet, add it! It belongs there, not in its own article, and not in this form. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 20:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Many thanks for your latest comments on the SGGS deletion page. I am beginning to see why you have made some of the comments that you did.<br />
The main definition of a Sikh is someone who believes in the <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a>. So if you do not believe in these quotes, then I believe that you cannot be a Sikh. See <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php?title=Sikh" class="external text" title="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php?title=Sikh" rel="nofollow">Sikhiwiki</a> (please note I have links with this site) also see <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a>.<br />
So this brings me to the other reason why I have kept these quotes separate from the discussion page. It highlights the importance given to the issue under discussion (ie: eating meat) and the sacred text, which for a Sikh is like a living <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">Guru</a> - see article on <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> to see the reverence given to the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Granth_Sahib_3e2a.html" title="Guru Granth Sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</a>. I appreciate your time and effort in making your stand. This conveys to me your objectivity and at least a commitment to impartiality – which is refreshing and a scarce commodity these days.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, specifically the NPOV concerns. We have an article already on the Sikh Diet, as noted above. My greatest concern about the article is that it is constructed to only advocate certain positions. Quoting the article: "This page is strictly for the purposes of recording the message of the Sikh holy scripture." I think an appropriate solution is to <i>summarize</i> the salient points of these quotes at the Sikh diet page and to present them there within the context of an encyclopedic article discussing all verifiable aspects of the issue. If the quotes are necessary verbatim, Wikiquote can handle that. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 02:37, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

If I'm to express a preference, it would be <b>merge</b> to Sikh Diet. A quick review of linked pages would suggest that the phrase "SGGS" should be replaced with "<a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Granth_Sahib_3e2a.html" title="Guru Granth Sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</a>", to which <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> redirects. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 09:12, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between the AfDs is spurious. The New Testament one relates to individual parables and whether they merit thier own article. If the parables survive would would want NPOV verifiable factual, academically referenced, articles to be written on them - not 'here's what Christians should believe/should understant them'. Our articles on Christian topics must not be written from a Christain POV, nor are they excluisively for Christians. I'm not going to vote on this one, as I don't know enough about the subject - but it isn't an article on one passage, but a pastiche of passages that (in the author's opinion) relate to a topic of teaching. This clearly raises different issues for consideration. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 09:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, they draw attention to the <i>fact</i> that some of the parables are found in more than one gospel - and parralels can be found in simmilar passages elsewhere (but 'm not defending the content - it needs cleaned up). That's clearly different to arranging a number of passages round a topic as religious instruction. (But again, I'm not arguing for the deletion of this, I'm just saying it is different). But if this were an NPOV article on a passage of Sikh scripture, I'd vote Strong Keep. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 09:58, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You say: <i>"….specifically the NPOV concerns"</i><br />
1.) The article is about what the Sikh Holy Book says about Meat. The article only contains quotations from the holy text. How does this affect the NPOV? No point of view has been expressed by the writer. The article does not say "eat meat" or "don't eat" – This is discussed on the page at Sikh Diet which uses these quotations to highlight both POV. Please tell me how this poses a NPOV concern?<br />
2). You say: <i>"We have an article already on the Sikh Diet"</i> - As I have said before, the article at Sikh Diet does not have all the relevant quotes to allow the user to make up their mind one way or the other. Please show me where the two articles overlap?<br />
3). You say: <i>"If the quotes are necessary verbatim, Wikiquote can handle that"</i> Then I ask that all other quotes on Wikipedia are also removed so that no bias is evident in this policy. Check these sites: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Wise_and_the_Foolish_Builders_61ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Wise and the Foolish Builders">Parables</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Template%3AQuotation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Template%3AQuotation" rel="nofollow">1000's of pages</a><br />
4). You say: <i>"I think an appropriate solution is to summarize the salient points of these quotes at the Sikh diet page"</i> By summarising, you will be accused of bias and this page will be subject to constant change one way or the other depending on what suits the particular user! – Who will patrol these changes and decide where to draw the line? --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a></li>

<p>Hari I think you are getting off the mark---its not needed --anger will not convince anyone to follow you only by example are leaders of real repute born.</p>
<p>As for the editor--For Gods sake have some sense of fair play.YOU CANT DELETE THE ARTICLE ONLY IMPROVE IT&gt;by shedding more light on it.</p>
<p>If you treat articles on Christianity different from any another Religion you are breaching a very important Law of this country. Do you really want it printed in the national papers? So take heed and try to understand the situation.</p>
<p>Obviously there are some scholars who have misinterpreted the SGGS and to their own conviction have hijacked the True Meaning.</p>
<p>The next logical question is who has the rightful last word on SGGS in Sikhism??</p>
<p>Sikhism is founded on very democratic principles. In that there is no co-ertion to any viewpoint and an individual is allowed to arrive at his or her own conclusion and develope at his own pace.</p>
<p>This is so correct as I often find that as a person progresses spiritually, greater insight is brougt upon the subject matter and therefore the meaning of the texts just gets deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Therefore it is a folly to argue as to who is right or wrong but the correct thing to do is to experience the the spirituality within the the SGGS and learn therefrom by actually living a righteous life and meditation only such persons acquire the wisdom contained within SGGS.</p>
<p>There have been many Saints of high repute who have arrived at the same conclusion as Hari singh but have not uttered a word as to eat or not to eat meat--by their very presence you know instinctively that it is wrong to kill for meat. And I have met such Saints.</p>
<p>This debate will live on as will the many shades of people ranging from pure spirit to pure matter.That is not a proplem either in Sikhism as we evolve spiritually too.</p>
<p>So all is in Harmony--dont worry yourselves foolishly--God is in charge.</p>

I don't believe that to be the case. What this page is, essentially, is a collection of quotes about a central theme - the theme of the eating of meat in Sikhism. Under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, one of the items on the list is "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional). If you want to enter lists of quotations, put them into our sister project <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikiquote:Main_Page">Wikiquote</a>. Other than the relatively brief introduction (which I also have issues with), that describes this article - a list of loosely associated quotations. They should be moved to Wikiquote. There is <i>no Christianity-related article like this</i>. I challenge you to find me one Christianity-related page that is a collection of quotes. The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parables_of_Jesus_f336.html" title="Parables of Jesus">Parables of Jesus</a>, which you've claimed are more or less Christian equivalents of this article, are much different articles. Each article is about <i>one specific quotation</i> from the Bible - and all of those quotations are famous in and of themselves. I admit I am not familiar with the Sikh Shabads, but as far I know they aren't considered particularly famous parts of the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Granth_Sahib_3e2a.html" title="Guru Granth Sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</a> - and even if they are, they would need their own articles, each of which discusses the Shabad itself. You will not see an article such as Bible on the Afterlife that just explains the Bible's position on the Afterlife and provides a bunch of quotes supporting it. You do see articles like <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>, which explain (more esoterically) a Christian (not exclusively in this case, but you see my point) belief. This is analogous to the page Sikh diet: no one has a problem with that, because instead of being more or less a collection of quotes, it's a general treatment of the subject. It's fine to quote a holy book a few times in context about a subject like that, of course, but when the article is pretty much just a collection of quotes, it belongs at Wikiquote. Also, to the above commentor: You seem to have a very flawed perception of what Wikipedia is. "Obviously there are some scholars who have misinterpreted the SGGS and to their own conviction have hijacked the True Meaning. The next logical question is who has the rightful last word on SGGS in Sikhism??" Perhaps that is "obvious" to followers of mainstream Sikhism, but obviously not to the followers of those scholars. The question of "who who has the rightful last word on SGGS in Sikhism" is <i>not something that should be answered here.</i> See <a href="../../../a/b/o/WP%7EABOUT_fc76.html" title="WP:ABOUT">WP:ABOUT</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for more information about what should and shouldn't be put here.

Further, all the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabad.html" title="Shabad">Shabads</a> listed in this article are also very famous quotes from the Sikh Holy Book which are recited frequently by preachers.<br />
<b>2).</b> You say <i>" I challenge you to find me one Christianity-related page that is a collection of quotes"</i> The one above has 5 quotes, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Leaven_0ab2.html" title="Parable of the Leaven">Parable of the Leaven</a> has 4; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Birds_of_Heaven_64f6.html" title="The Birds of Heaven">The Birds of Heaven</a> has 4 some long; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rich_Fool_3ca5.html" title="The Rich Fool">The Rich Fool</a> has 4; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Little_Children_99ef.html" title="The Little Children">The Little Children</a> has 4; etc – Have I won the challenge?<br />
<b>3).</b> You said: <i>"… a list of loosely associated quotations. They should be moved to Wikiquote."</i> These are all list of quotes so shouldn't they be moved as well?<br />
<b>4).</b> You say: <i>"I admit I am not familiar with the Sikh Shabads, but as far I know they aren't considered particularly famous parts of the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Granth_Sahib_3e2a.html" title="Guru Granth Sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</a> - and even if they are, they would need their own articles, each of which discusses the Shabad itself"</i> They are part of the SGGS! The term "Sikh <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabad.html" title="Shabad">Shabads</a>" refers to hymns from the <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> and this article lists a few of them. Then on the Sikh Diet article the relevance or not of these Shabads (hymns) can be discussed. So the SGGS on Meat has a list of hymns from <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a>, the Sikh holy book and the article Sikh Diet discuss the consequences and meaning of these hymns.<br />
<b>So please could someone explain - What really is the difference between the parables and this article?</b> As far as I can work out, both these articles list several verbatim quotes from their respective holy texts! I see more similarity than difference in their basic conceptual design. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 04:57, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've had a think about it. It's a good article because it conforms to orthodox Sikh teaching (over 400 years). If you are a Khalsa Sikh, meat is Strictly forbidden you have to live by the laws in the Guru Granth Sahib but a non Khalsa Sikh does have more flexibilty because they have not taken Amrit (to become Khalsa) so they could take a more of a pick and choose approach. Its only when you take Amrit to become Khalsa, you formally accept (in the Amrit Ceremony) all the laws in the Guru Granth Sahib. It's a good article but.... If we allow this article then will have to allow a lot of other bad articles in to be fair and consistent. Therefore the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Therefore, I think part of it should be merged with the other article already mentioned. This article is good but if we keep it the price might be we have to let another 100 bad articles in to be fair and consistent. Be brave Hari Singh and say "lets part merge it with the other article" for the greater good and put it in wiki quote--<a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh_1_4dbe.html" title="User:Sikh 1">Sikh 1</a> 01:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The main point is, a non Khalsa Sikh is under <b>moral obligation</b> to live by every law in the Guru Granth Sahib. A Khalsa Sikh is under <b>Legal obligation</b> to live by every law in the Guru Granth Sahib because they have taken the oath and Amrit (in the Amrit ceremony). Therefore, there is a distinction between a Khalsa Sikh and non Khalsa Sikh. Now if a non Khalsa Sikh eats meat Sikhism does not condone it (morally wrong and a sin) but they are NOT breaking their oath and Amrit because they have <b>not</b> taken Amrit and the oath- there is <b>no legal obligation</b> on them <b>but</b> there is a moral obligation.--<a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh_1_4dbe.html" title="User:Sikh 1">Sikh 1</a> 19:26, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unencyclopedic and so poorly written as to be almost unreadable. <i>Conceivably</i> an encyclopedic article could be written on the subject, but I've always thought the correct solution to that is to delete now, reconsider later, in the event such an article is written. --04:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment: 1).</b> You say that the article is: <i>"Unencyclopedic"</i> The article consists of important quotations on the subject of meat from the Sikh Holy Book - What is "Unencyclopaedic" about these quotations? Quotations are very frequently used in encyclopaedias and articles– so why are these particular quotations "Unencyclopaedic" while the other ones that appear elsewhere in Wikipedia are OK?<br />
<b>2).</b> You say that: <i>"[The article is] so poorly written as to be almost unreadable"</i> As I have already said, these are quotations from the Holy Text of the Sikh – Clearly, you have no concept of this religion. To you it may appear like a thesis on "Quantum Mechanic" but to a student of <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, these quotations have a deeper and precious meaning and are easily understood. It is for this reason that most Sikhs users have supported the article while non-Sikh generally appear to not support it. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 19:12, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <b>1).</b> The article <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources</a> says: "Copying public domain encyclopedias (such as 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica) and using those articles as a basis for a Wikipedia article on the subject <b>is perfectly OK. Copying specialised encyclopedias may be appropriate</b> in some circumstances….." This original SGGS text forms part of the Public Domain encyclopedias of the Sikhs as it was written in 1708. So, I can see that the above would apply and article based on this text are fine as per the above edict.<br />
<b>2).</b>You say that: <i>"…it is a violation of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines</a>"</i>. Looking at these guidelines, I note that it says: <i>"Most often, vanity edits are edits about the editors themselves, their close relatives or their personal associates"</i> This article has nothing to do with the author or his associates. So how can you say that this is a <b>"Vanity"</b> issue?<br />
<b>3).</b> You say that: <i>"it is written poorly"</i> – The article is primarily a number of quotations from the Sikh Holy Book – When using quotations in an article, you are not allowed to mis-quote and you are not allowed to change these verbatim quotations – So whenever you quote a person or a text in an article, it’s a mandatory practise not to change or interfere with the way the quote was originally stated – whether poorly or otherwise. So, under the circumstances, your statement appears ill-considered and without merit.<br />
<b>4).</b> You also say: <i>" it is not encyclopedic in nature"</i> What is "not encyclopaedic" about these quotations? Quotations are very frequently used in encyclopaedias and articles– so why are these particular quotations "not encyclopaedic" while the other ones that appear elsewhere in Wikipedia are OK? --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 18:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> Cameron Stout has his own page, and nobody remembers him. Pete, on the other hand, has his own band, was already a local cult celebrity in Brighton, had the shortest odds of any Big Brother contestant at the halfway stage (1/8), was the only bookmakers' favourite to win the entire series, is already regarded as being one of the greatest housemates that's ever lived, and is the favourite with Ladbrokes at 2/1 with Daddy Fantastic to have the Christmas Number 1 single, despite not having released a commercial single yet. The idea that he shouldn't have his own page is laughable and is actually giving me a painful stitch due to me laughing so hard at how ridiculous it is. I am in agony but I will continue writing to portray your ignorance on the subject. And anyway, why shouldn't he have his own page? Is there a limited number of pages allowed on this site? Is there a drought? No, there isn't. You're just being idiots. Pete deserves his own page, and there is no reason for having this deleted.

<li>Look, seriously. You know you're wrong. You know this isn't going to be deleted. You have a large number of people telling you to get your head out of your arse and stop pissing all over Pete's achievement and get on with your miserable life. You've got evidence that wanks all over your supposed arguments in the forms of pages for Anthony Hutton and Cameron Stout, who are no longer famous and weren't very well known in the first place, compared to Pete who was the biggest Big Brother favourite in the shows existence, has a highly anticipated band who are favourites for the Christmas Number 1 single...I can't believe, actually, that you are still trying to drag this discussion out. I have single handedly proven that you are an idiot, and a host of others have also stated that they disagree with you, and you are in a minority that shouldn't have existed in the first place. Once again, Pete is staying on here. There is no reason to take him off even if you did believe he wasn't noteworthy. There is no shortage of available Wikipedia pages. All you're doing is trying to ruin Pete's credibility because you probably supported Aisleyne or someone, or maybe you just hate Big Brother and you're a massive hit on the Restoration page or something. Either way, don't bother responding because you just can't win. Take care now, honey.</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> unless better information is dug up and cited for this article, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the garden-variety "we've done the impossible, but we aren't going to tell you how just yet" claims of scam artists. I see two possibilities for the article's continued presence: (A) it is so widely reported (by gullible news agencies more interested in ratings than verifiable truth) that it should be included as a well-known swindle; (B) the company has actually done something that forces a change in the laws of physics, which would require "extraordinary proof", which is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

<li>The "independent company" cited in the above link (which is an alternative-energy wiki, not a reliable publication) is apparently Magnetic Power Inc., which "claims to be close enough to have some demonstration modules, which extracts energy from the vacuum of space, ready for market by end of 2006".

<li><b>Keep</b> They may not have changed the laws of physics; maybe they're just siphoning off some previously unknown energy source. I'm not a physicist, I don't know. However, if they are a legit company and have a legit claim we ought to keep a record of it for history's sake. If they are a scam, we could have a spectacular record of that too. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpahi_b7f5.html" title="User:Spahi">Spahi</a> 22:42, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> My name's Cathal, I think that this article should be kept on Wikipedia. If the whole idea is a hoax(which I think is hard to believe, from what I've seen) having it or not having it on Wikipedia won't change that. Just as many encyclopedias have detailed articles on ideas and things which later turned out to be false (flat-earth, the geocentric Solar System et al.) so too must Wikipedia, another encyclopedia report on this (potential) falsitude.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Steorn very much deserves an article, if not only for the fact that it can link to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_Motion_eba9.html" title="Perpetual Motion">Perpetual Motion</a> and similar articles. It would also be a good place to have the results of their testing, etc.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The strong likelihood is that this "technology" will go the way of all perpetual motion machines thus far, into the dustbin of history; but if anything the manner in which they have laid down their challenge is certainly notable and extraordinary; to advertise in a well-respected magazine like The Economist is probably a first, and may well be embarassing if/when it all turns out to be moonshine; but it does no harm to keep a record of these people on Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is either a major scientific breakthrough or a notable act of kamikaze P.R. which should be a permanent part of the story of free-energy research and claims. The bold, public "challenge" advertisement Steorn has placed in The Economist gives this story political significance, as many people suspect that successful free-energy devices which may have been invented in the past have been suppressed by industry or government interests. Steorn's strategy may be an attempt to circumvent this kind of suppression. RockPoet 19:13, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It appears that the company's claims will be tested in the near future (see <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1854305,00.html" class="external text" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1854305,00.html" rel="nofollow">The Observer</a>). Should the claims be validated, the entry should remain given the obviously extraordinary historical significance of this alleged discovery. Should the claims be refuted (as we all seem to suspect they will be), the degree of attention it has received from both the public and the scientific community will still warrant an entry, though it should be revised to conform to the Wiki's <a href="../../../h/o/a/Wikipedia%7EHoaxes_ebc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Hoaxes">hoax</a> guidelines. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.30.95.182 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.30.95.182_ae26.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.30.95.182">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Keep: nobody believes this is possible because it claims to create energy, and we know that is impossible. We also "knew" the world was flat, until we were proven wrong, we "knew" the atom was indestructible, until we were proven wrong.

<li><b>Delete</b> the two Italian articles mention him only in passing, as an editor of an article. If he is not notable in Italy, why should he be notable here? Obviously there is a severe misunderstanding of how history as a discipline works. Y'see, both general history books and even almanacs tend to focus far more on the recent than on the distant past. In fact, if the (distant) past is considered the base and the present (more accurately recent past) the top we find an inverted pyramid. Is this because fewer notable events happened in the past, or because fewer notable people existed? No, it is because the filter of time has acted to reduce what was once thought of as notable to that which truly is notable.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 22:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. He seems to have been a real parlamentarian and university law professor. Perhaps obscure to most of us, but definitely not bogus. I'm personally not interested enough to rewrite the article, but I'll give some clues for anyone who is. <a href="../../../w/b/i/WBIS_Online_f839.html" title="WBIS Online">WBIS Online</a> (a biographical, or rather bio-bibliographical, database which gives only very summarized data and references to other publications) has two entries for a person of this name. His full, correctly spelt name and title appears to be "Baldassarre Squitti, barone di Palermiti e Guarino". He is described as "barone; giureconsulto; politico; professore di diritto" in one entry and as "barone; sottosegretario di Stato alle Poste e Telegrafi; professore universitario di diritto" in another (but a reasonable guess is that they refer to the same person).

<p>Perfectly accurate article. Quite significant in the area due to the fact that it is where the strike started and it is now a successful retail park providing numerous jobs.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - For all the above and SGGS on Meat - The point of these quotations is to inform the reader of what these Holy texts have to say – that I hope you will agree is an important point; an important issue and a mechanism that needs to be preserved. The job of Encyclopaedias is to correctly inform!! Without quotations you get to a situation when wrong messages of the holy text can be conveyed as is happening with some aspects of Islam. So its is very important that we are allowed to quote these holy text verbatim so that the message is not interfered with – Discussion can be NPOV or POV, etc and these can be added to these articles if required. The quotations in themselves do not have a POV or NPOV – They are a FACT. The quote from the holy Bible is a FACT which has existed for 2000 years. Whether you believe it or not is another matter – Many billions believe in these facts. The writings of the Bible, Koran, SGGS, etc are all FACTS – They are NOT NPOV or POV. If I write that the SGGS says "There is one God" – That is a factual statement. If you go and look in the SGGS, then you will find that statement there. Whether you want to believe the statement or not – is another matter. Verbatim quotations are facts not subject to the POV or NPOV criterion. When we start making our own comments and have discussions on these texts, it can becomes POV or NPOV. I urge all participants here to vote and argue to keep the SGGS on Meat article as well.

<li><b>Keep all</b> - the articles are terrible - some of them need renamed - some could perhaps be merged. But these are notable (and I don't even need to cite <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>). Bad content gets cleaned up - not deleted. I'm willing to work on this when I get some time (not this week). We always end up keeping these things, so I suggest this is withdrawn. If deletion was to proceed, we'd need to debate each seperately, as some of these have had huge imact on art, literature and cuture (leave aside religion). --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 21:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete All or Merge together</b>.

Also, this subject matter is important for them and so I feel there is justification for spreading the parables. - Your personal POV does not come into it. It's what the whole world believes in and thinks - that is significant!<br />
Further, these holy texts have been around for 1000s of years and many millions of Bibles have been printed giving this subject matter inherent magnitude. And finally, the issue of morality and spirituality is very relevant to the world and should be enhanced by coverage in an encyclopaedia. I ask you please, to be objective in your discussion and unbiased in the points that you make. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 00:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What you (or I) believe about the Bible is (or should be) beside the point. These parables (fiction or not) are worthy of distinct articles. However, as it stands, in many cases, the content could be merged for the time being (until proper neutral verifiable information can fill them out - it certainly exists).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 23:40, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The parables by themselves without interpretation belong on Wikisource. If they have interpretation, they need sourcing for that interpretation (which I don't see in the ones I spot checked, didn't look at all of them). <b>Delete or transwiki</b> but they don't belong here, this is not the place for sources. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 00:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This doesn't make much sense. The text themselves will already be on wikisource, so there's no point in a transwiki. So the question is what to do with the articles. We don't delete things because the current content is crap, we generally redirect elsewhere or stubify. Given we've plenty of sub-stubs, on much less noteworthy thing, that such as 'x is a school in New Hampshire' or 'Y is a film directed by Z', there seems little problem in stubifying these to 'is a parrable found in the gospel of Matthew at...' (if there is indeed no other information currently in the article) that allows for someone (perhaps me) to write an article later, without someone deleting it as a recreation. Let's just treat Bible articles like an others. If the closing admin wants to notify me, I'll clean these up myself. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 01:22, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not seeing the strong argument for keeping articles at the individual verse level. When I look at <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> for example, which is an entire book, the article is well sourced and ties themes of the book to other books via theme articles. I can see an article on all the parables, or on specific parables as they are told in several books, but not verses. Verses belong on Wikisource, where they already are, so scratch my suggestion to transwiki and just delete. I don't buy the "a crap article is better than no article" argument. I'm willing to revise my thinking for any of these that are substantially improved (remove the verse itself, point to source, and give cited references to the significance, meaning or connection of the parable) but in this state? No. They must go. We had individual verse articles before, and I remember them being on AfD. I thought they went. I certainly can't find them now, and I spent some time looking. WP is not a bible, and it is not an annotated bible. These must go unless they change a lot before the end of the AfD. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:49, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>These are not merely random biblical verses or "straight quotes" as the nominator calls them, but parables of Jesus. Parables of Jesus are paramount to Christianity and are thereby notable. The articles are stubs, some of them badly written, but with your logic we should delete all stubs. The issue in question is the subject, not the quality of these articles. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 03:23, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm going to run with TJ Spyke's comment here for a second. If were discussing episodes of a TV series, we would be deciding whether there is enough information to go into the article to make it stand on its own. Even if we were talking, say, speeches of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, the standard would be, is the speech individually notable? That's why I see these articles as having been nominated: they are minor parables with either no discussion or only original research about an editor's perceived meaning of the parable. Based on that, the articles do not stand on their own and assert the notability of the individual parables, and that's why I favor deletion. That said, if an editor <i>does</i> have enough information to expand the articles that hasn't been brought to the table yet, then I favor the new, expanded article being allowed to exist. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 03:00, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> - I agree that they seriously need to be improved so that they are more than just quotations from a particular religious source. However, given that these stories and parables are alluded to in all manner of litertaure and art, people will certainly look to an encyclopaedia to find out what the story is rather than try to find it in a Bible. I intend to improve a few of these, for example add an explanation of what the Unjust Steward actually does that is unjust, as well as what his solution actually implies. Whether we merge or keep them, they need to be here for people who will naturally look to an encyclopaedia to tell them in a neutral way what these stories are.--<a href="../../../l/l/o/User%7ELloegr-Cymru_9c46.html" title="User:Lloegr-Cymru"><b><font color="green">Lloegr</font><font color="black">-</font><font color="red">Cymru</font></b></a><sup><b><a href="../../../l/l/o/User_talk%7ELloegr-Cymru_4a9b.html" title="User talk:Lloegr-Cymru">£</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lloegr-Cymru_9d66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lloegr-Cymru">¥</a></b></sup> 12:40, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Procedural nomination — this was inappropriately batched in with the Jennifer Pereira/Nikki Hipkin AFD, but really does need to be considered separately because the claim of notability here (city councillor and deputy mayor of <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatoon%2C_Saskatchewan_cc87.html" title="Saskatoon, Saskatchewan">Saskatoon, Saskatchewan</a>, and major party candidate in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2004">Canadian federal election, 2004</a>) is sufficiently different from the other two as to make it inappropriate to consider them as a group. <b>No vote</b> from me; I'm not entirely convinced of notability, but since others are, since the article is potentially expandable, and since I wouldn't be nominating this outside of this particular situation, I leave it to consensus to decide. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>External links are not references. These indicate that quite markedly. The Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics pages, for example, say <i>nothing at all</i> about what a Yellow Pig Math Day is, and provide nothing to substantiate any of the content of this article. The Jargon File entry for "random numbers" <i>doesn't say anything at all</i> about Yellow Pigs, also, but simply gives a link to the one of the same web pages given as external links here. The Everything2 node at least mentions Yellow Pigs. But if you actually read the entire article, down to the bottom, you'll see that it cites <i>the very same web site as the Jargon File links to</i> as one of its two sources for information, the other being the second external link given in this article. In fact, everything here appears to rely upon those two web pages as their sole sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:47, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the contrary, it shows Spivak to be influential as an educator, though not a research mathematician. His textbooks are in print and have gone through multiple editions. Similarly Kelly is verifiably the founder of a program with hundreds of alumni that is highly regarded among summer math programs.

In addition, Yellow Pigs Day and HCSSiM are very closely linked (Yellow Pigs Day is a big event at HCSSiM) and although HCSSiM gets only about a thousand Google hits it is nevertheless one of the largest summer math programs for high-schoolers.

<li><b>Keep</b> - First: HCSSiM is HARDLY "exceedingly local"; this year, its students ranged from China to California to Atlanta to New York. Second: HCSSiM is a 34-year-old program; let's estimate it to have taken, on average, 40 students a year throughout its existence. (This is a bit low; the program accepts around 40 per year now, but in the past there were closer to 60 per summer.) Then there are at least 1300 alumni of the program who should be familiar with Yellow Pigs Day. Finally, while <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kelly_57b7.html" title="David Kelly">David Kelly</a> is supposedly a "non-notable mathematician," there is a Wikipedia article on him, and I'd argue that he's notable for creating one of the longest-running math programs for high school students, out of which several <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Volokh_4e53.html" title="Eugene Volokh">notable</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lander_377d.html" title="Eric Lander">people</a> emerged. --<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFermatprime_9555.html" title="User:Fermatprime">Fermatprime</a> 12:36, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I don't edit Wikipedia as much as I should, and when I do, it's normally to correct spelling/grammar, etc. If I read more articles that desperately needed that kind of attention, I'd edit them. But I think it's safe to say that a holiday familiar to well over 1000 people qualifies as well-known, and you yourself have linked to a source demonstrating that it's familiar to that many. Perhaps it would be most agreeable to <b>rename</b> to "Yellow Pig" (which returns 32,000 results on Google, so it passes one test) and add more information about yellow pigs in general.

<li>Clearly, this is not a "thing made up in school one day". The <a href="../../../h/c/s/HCSSiM_59f0.html" title="HCSSiM">HCCSiM</a> summer program and the associated <i>Yellow Pigs Day</i> has a long tradition and a long history.</li>
<li>If <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lander_377d.html" title="Eric Lander">Eric_Lander</a>, of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Genome_Project_c567.html" title="Human Genome Project">Human_Genome_Project</a>, thinks it worth attending and presenting at the Yellow Pig Math Days conference, maybe the topic should be kept. [See <a href="http://www.hcssim.org/ypmd.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hcssim.org/ypmd.html" rel="nofollow">[82]</a>.]</li>
<li>If researchers from IBM, Sun Microsystems, and about two dozen major universities think it is worth attending and presenting at the Yellow Pig Math Days conference, maybe the topic should be kept. [See <a href="http://www.hcssim.org/ypmd.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hcssim.org/ypmd.html" rel="nofollow">[83]</a>.]</li>
<li>HCSSiM (and Yellow Pigs Day) has been funded, in part, by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mathematical_Society_8c70.html" title="American Mathematical Society">AMS</a> Epsilon Fund. [See Notices of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mathematical_Society_8c70.html" title="American Mathematical Society">AMS</a>, November 2003, page 1221.] The "Epsilon" fund was created by the mathematical community to honor <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Erdos_19fc.html" title="Paul Erdos">Paul Erdös</a>. I hope nobody considers <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Erdos_19fc.html" title="Paul Erdos">Paul Erdös</a> to be a <i>non-notable mathematician</i>.</li>
<li>I do not consider the references to <i>non-notable mathematicians</i> to be particularly civil, and may actually be libelous.</li>
<li>As far as verifiability and citations, I refer you to <a href="http://www.hcssim.org/ypmd.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hcssim.org/ypmd.html" rel="nofollow">[84]</a>. According to the <i>whois</i> database, the domain is owned by Hampshire College. Therefore, Hampshire College is considered the legal publisher of the Web Site. This site clearly meets the burden of evidence for verifiability, because
<ul>
<li>the information is published by a major university, whose reputation is not in question;</li>
<li>the information is published by legitimate professional researchers; and</li>
<li>even if this is considered to be a <i>self-published or dubious source</i>, as stated in the rules, the information is an acceptable source because it is relevant to an article about the organization, itself.</li>
</ul>

<li>Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. It is my understanding that wikipedia pages should not contain commercial solicitations.

<li><b>Comment</b> and yet <i>another</i> meat puppet whose only contributions to Wikipedia can be read above. This does little to establish the credibility of the article.
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Yes, this is my first post. I tried not to be repetitive. And nobody who has posted in this discussion solicited my comments. I find the term "meat puppet" to be derogatory and offensive. [If this is the culture of Wikipedia, I am disappointed.] A lifetime of work from two fine mathematicians is labeled as "not notable", and several additional Web pages and Web page authors are similarly labeled as "not notable" and/or "another nobody". [If this is the culture of Wikipedia, I am utterly horrified!] My account was created with my real name, and I'm not trying to hide anything. Please tell me why my numbered comments "do little to establish the credibility of the article"? I attempted to answer every issue that was raised by those asking for deletion of this article. I had never heard of Yellow Pigs Day before six months ago. The encyclopedia article was useful to me, and I was able to verify the existence of both the conference and the day. I also note that this article has existed for nearly 2.5 years, if I interpret the History page correctly. Why does it now come under scrutiny? RVerser 02:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Article duration isn't a voting matter. Cruft is cruft no matter how long it takes to find. As per another novice supporter: <i><b>Yellow Pigs Day is an inside joke and a geek holiday (and thus would be unlikely to have reliable sources).</b></i> Once you become familiar with Wikipedia and its policies, you'll undertand why this disqualifies the article. Of course, we don't expect novice editors to understand what Wikipedia is all about, though many of us are willing to help. It's that very fact, that most of this article's supporters are novices and unfamiliar with polices, that I'm bringing to the closing administrator's attention. Read up on the links I posted on your talk page. Read also <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and you'll better understand what topics qualify for an article. The short of it is that one department in one <i>college</i> (not a major university as stated above) has a tradition. That's nice for them. It's also not encyclopedic for us. Read up on our policies, though. We can benefit from editors with your enthusiasm. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 03:02, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>"Hi!</p>
<p>I'm writing regarding the discussion on Wikipedia about the possible deletion of the article on Yellow Pigs Day. (I don't have a wiki login, and it would be silly to create one just to contribute factual information to a discussion there.) I am one of the Co-Directors of the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics, and a faculty member in Mathematics at Smith College. I did a little bit of checking into Wiki's definition of "reliable source"; I count as a reliable source because I am speaking within my fields of expertise, and it's easily verifiable that I have this field of expertise (I'm listed on the faculty at Smith, in the Mathematics Genealogy Project, on my graduate advisor's home page, etc.). Anyone who thinks this email has been falsified may contact me for confirmation of its validity.</p>
<p>I'd like to clarify some issues that seem somewhat murky in the discussion. For example, HCSSiM is not local but national in scope and permeates the American professional mathematics community. We are the second-oldest of the five national-level programs for high-ability high-school students. The program has more than 1550 alumns, all of whom have experienced YP Day. We do not explain YP Day on our webpage just as we do not explain the significance of the yellow pig or the number seventeen; nevertheless it is a holiday which we celebrate each year and about which questions are frequently asked. (Our website is primarily there for recruiting purposes and secondarily for alumn use. We're not in the business of educating the public, unlike encyclopedias which have public edification among their primary purposes.) There are mathematicians outside the HCSSiM community who celebrate Yellow Pigs Day. In fact, most of the time when I run into a colleague who is aware of YP Day, he/she assumes that the primary connection is to Mike Spivak rather than to HCSSiM. Spivak, by the way, is considered a notable mathematician by the mathematics community---in fact, I'd heard of him long before I'd heard of HCSSiM.</p>
<p>Now, this information may not convince anyone that the article is worth keeping, but at least there's now a reliable source to cite.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have added a newspaper reference that verifies the majority of the article's content. I suggest that those who have expressed opinions on this nomination in regard to sourcing and verifiability reconsider them according to notability criteria. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatusRoma_4ae1.html" title="User talk:NatusRoma">Talk</a> 22:05, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Yellow Pigs' Day is verifiably the creation of two notable mathematicians. It is verifiably celebrated, or at least known to, over a thousand HCSSiM alumni (a fair handful of whom are notable by Wikipedia standards) and possibly others. The Harvard Crimson is a reliable published source, and therefore most of the content of this article is verifiable - the details of the HCSSiM celebration of Yellow Pigs' Day can be verified through photos put online by HCSSiM alumni. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESho_Uemura_8e10.html" title="User:Sho Uemura">Sho Uemura</a> 22:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As already noted by others, YP day is celebrated by more than 1000 people, largely within an international academic community of mathematicians.</li>

<p>Six million people in the US alone are "Mensa qualified", although less than 1% (around 50,000) are currently members ... most "famous" people (like anyone who has won a <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> or a <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>) are by definition potential members, but for reasons of their own, they have chosen not to pay the annual dues.</p>
<p>Mensa may be "<i>the largest, oldest, and most well-known <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_IQ_society_5751.html" title="High IQ society">high IQ society</a> in the world,</i>" but there are several others whose requirements are much higher and restrictive (1:1000 as opposed to 1:50), and whose members are more worthy of being considered <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">geniuses</a>.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The titled is too subjective, its basically a list of anyone thats been in Mensa that has a wikipedia article, cant we make it a cat and just put all the members in it?

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Plenty of problems here, like the fact that the hall-of-fame part of the list should actually be under the heading List of famous people Mensa wishes had been members, and the inherently subjective question of how one defines "famous" for the rest of the list.<br />
The existence of citations does make this stand out from most such lists, but the quality of those citations seems to be rather shaky; for example, Stephen Hawking is listed, even though AFAIK he is not a Mensa member, with a "reference" link which leads to something that appears to be an entertainment gossip website (!) that does not make any such claim! <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> this ain't.<br />
So, what do we have? A list that, if kept, must be split and/or retitled, and for which the verification process must be exhaustively repeated because the present citations are demonstrably unreliable, and which, after all that, will still be an original-research magnet and vulnerable to vanity entries and spam.<br />
The usual arguments for keeping lists do also apply. The subject is clearly of interest; Mensa is notable, and people reading up on it will naturally want to get an idea of what kinds of people join, and listing members they have heard of is an effective way of answering that question. And this list does things, like geographical categorisation and centralising citations, that a category could not do. As such, while I think this list should not be kept <i>in its current state</i>, please disregard my "delete" recommendation if a genuine effort to resolve the problems I have cited has begun by the time this debate is closed. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:42, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment/"Vote"</b> Since the topic itself is too subjective to stand on its own legs as a seperate article, an admin should <b>delete</b> the article, but perhaps a bit of this should be readded.

Notability (they're <i>already</i> in Wikipedia) and current membership status (which cannot be verified anyway) then become non-issues. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 03:35, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The difference is (a) there is a <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_with_epilepsy_b8a9.html" title="Category:People with epilepsy">Category:People with epilepsy</a>, (b) each and every person's article has "epilepsy" one or more times in the text (besides the tag), and (c) most of them have a good <b><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citation</a></b>. The articles for most of the people on <i>this</i> list (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Cronauer_732f.html" title="Adrian Cronauer">Adrian Cronauer</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joyce_Carol_Oates_bcc7.html" title="Joyce Carol Oates">Joyce Carol Oates</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_A._Page_c423.html" title="Karen A.

<p>I would like to know how to fix the blocked article so that it can be put back on line after making the relevant corrections. I guess most people of the world have no idea about the broadcast situation in Pakistan that is why it came as a shock. But I am willing to fix it in order to follow guidelines and procedures observed on this forum.</p>
