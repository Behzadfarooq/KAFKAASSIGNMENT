<p>According to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i>. Further, according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, <i>a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other. All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia.</i> It is very, very, unlikely that an article on a character of a computer game will be the the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works unless it is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">very, very famous</a>. Perhaps some useful content of this article could be merged into the articles on <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_%28video_game_series%29.html" title="Halo (video game series)">Halo (video game series)</a>, but this topic is clearly not encyclopedic. As thus, I argue for the <b>deletion</b> of this - and similar article.

<li><b>Incredibly strong keep</b> Are you kidding? What does "indiscriminate collection of info" have to do with this. She's the second-most notable character in one of the biggest game franchises in the world. Cortana+Halo gets 240,000 Google hits. If you think an article needs sources, tag it with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, but don't mark something for deletion that is very clearly significant. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 04:52, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Far from. As a matter of fact, I have not made any mention of references or a lack thereof in my mention.<br />
The question is, how is she significant? Is she notable <i>only</i> because of her position as a character of Halo? That's notability by association, and on those grounds Jobjörn Folkesson could exist because I am related to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolus_Linnaeus_b3d7.html" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> - a quite far-fetched analogy but I do believe you see my point.<br />
Has she been <i>the <b>subject</b> of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other</i> as <b>required</b> by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>? Notice the stressing of <i>subject</i> here - that an publication dealing with <i>Halo</i> mentions Cortana doesn't do it.<br />
<a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>. Cortana, although famous, is neither significant or notable <i>except</i> as for her position as character in a indeed very notable <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_%28video_game_series%29.html" title="Halo (video game series)">game</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 05:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't really understand your final argument; almost <i>every</i> video game character is notable only as a character in a notable video game, just as Holly Golightly is only notable for being a character in <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Cortana is mentioned in independent game reviews, eg <a href="http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=460" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=460" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halo/review.html?mode=gsreview" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halo/review.html?mode=gsreview" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. An <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> review called "Sequel to Video Game 'Halo' Debuts" also discussed Cortana. Cortana is enough of an archetype to be mentioned even in reviews of <i>other games</i>, eg <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/darkmessiahofmightmagic/review.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/darkmessiahofmightmagic/review.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 16:35, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Mentioned, not subject of. The first two deal with <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_%28video_game_series%29.html" title="Halo (video game series)">Halo (video game series)</a> - indeed a notable subject! They merely <i>mention</i> Cortana as <i>part</i> of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_%28video_game_series%29.html" title="Halo (video game series)">Halo (video game series)</a>. The latter mentions Cortana when comparing another video game character to her, but does nothing more - only her name is mentioned (twice). No description, no context, not even a reference to the game - for all we know, that just might another Cortana! <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 06:59, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: And yet, Cortana is notable enough to mention. That "context" is not given in the last reference is a fairly strong argument for notability in itself; it says a character in some other game functions as a Cortana. If I said a character functioned as an "uncle tom" or a "falstaff" I wouldn't need to explain what works of fiction I was referencing. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 04:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - unreferenced, unverifiable, and not notable. "A topic is notable" - per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - "if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." This has not; Gimmetrow's "references" are simply namechecks, not even trivial. Nothing to merge, but could be redirected per Gassyguy. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 17:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reviews demonstrate that Cortana is significant to the storyline, and that the character is used as a reference point to describe other fictional characters. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> supports a separate article for major characters in a work of fiction, if otherwise the article on the main work would become too long. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Halo_series_characters_5d2c.html" title="List of Halo series characters">List of Halo series characters</a>, with its current summary style, is 41k (37k prose). <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 18:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - First of all, current lack of sourcing is NOT a reason to delete an article. I would also like to point out that per policy, items such as the Halo novels are intrisically self-referencing (I.E. they ARE a notable, verifiable source in and of themselves). The only qualifier is whether or not the work passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, and any who would like to dispute the notability of the Halo series may feel free to try. Also, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> it should be noted that major characters in works spanning multiple titles often get their own articles, such as <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_%28character%29_66bc.html" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter (character)</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a>. Any information which could be merged would be needlessly repeated multiple times across a variety of articles including both the games and the novels. With all of that said, I would like to point out that this article <b>does</b> need a lot of work and most of the information here does enter the realm of fancruft. I would change my own vote to a firm <b>Keep</b> if the article could be better cited and made more encyclopedic. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 18:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>Article may need work, but this character is easily the second most important (after the Master Chief, actually she may be more important) in the series and spans all of the titles.

At worst, it is a story spoiler. I can't imagine why there are any notability concerns. We are talking about the main supporting character of a multi-award winning game with sales of nearly 15 million, not some individual generic soldier in a mediocre FPS with a few hundred thousand sales.

<li><b>Comment regarding the objcetions raised above during my sleep:</b><br />
The first line of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is as follows: <i><b>Major characters</b> (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">encyclopedic treatment</a> of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</i> I suppose we can conclude that Cortana is a "major character" - even though the dialogue is quite sparse and that she is NEVER seen in actual gameplay (only in cutscenes, right?). Comparing her to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>, star wars hero spanning three successful feature films and the subject of many many comics, is quite wrong though. But rest assured, I will come to him too - and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_Picard_499e.html" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a> mentioned above.<br />
The <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)</a> discusses how an article on said <i>major character</i> should be treated. It makes some points I'd like to raise here:
<ul>
<li><i>In particular, plot synopses and character biographies should be kept terse.</i></li>
<li><i>Articles should strive to describe the subject matter related to the real world.</i></li>
<li><i>The article should contain no original research</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If all the above points are considered, there is simply no need for an article about Cortana, as it can never ever be more than a stub. You see, even if the <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="Wikipedia:Notability">the primary notability criterion</a></b> is ignored (the one requiring multiple, non-trivial sources dealing with the subject, you know...), it can under secondary guidelines not be written lengthier than a stub as
<ul>
<li>In-universe prose should be kept terse - at the length of a stub, I suppose.</li>
<li>Although the article should strive to describe the subject matter related to the real world, <b>there is nothing to the describe as Cortana has no relation to the real world</b>, unless</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:Original research</a> is applied. Sure, it might be very very tempting to fill up half of the article with a comparison of Cortana and contemporary in-real-life <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligences</a>, but fact remains: <b>there are no <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> able to provide a basis for such a comparison</b> - or any other out-of-universe analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As thus, we might - and <b>should</b> treat Cortana in the same way <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyosha_Karamazov_aacb.html" title="Alyosha Karamazov">Alyosha Karamazov</a> is treated in the example given in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>: <i><a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyosha_Karamazov_aacb.html" title="Alyosha Karamazov">Alyosha Karamazov</a> is a major character from the novel</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brothers_Karamazov_f032.html" title="The Brothers Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a><i>.

<li>Damn, people re-writing the MOS while I am reading it&#160;:( Oh well. It doesn't really invalidate my point - out-of-universe analysis and prose on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortana.html" title="Cortana">Cortana</a> must necessarily be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> except for the OoU depictions of in-universe Cortana, as the primary notability criterion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - requiring that the subject be the subject of multiple, non-trivial, third-party sources - cannot be met. So: while failure to meet the primary notability criterion may <i>according to some</i> not be reason for deletion, the very same failure concludes that an article on Cortana must be either 100% depiction of her in-universe appearances (even if written in OoU style) <b>must be <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_Research_3347.html" title="Wikipedia:Original Research">Wikipedia:Original Research</a></b>. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 20:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Why must any OoU prose necessarily be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>? Who created the character, how the depiction was decided, who did the voice, other games the character appears in or was speculated to appear in, the role of this type of character in games, are all OoU statements. See also <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/halo3/news.html?sid=6149725" class="external text" title="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/halo3/news.html?sid=6149725" rel="nofollow">gamespot</a>, which treats Cortana with more than a passing mention, and <a href="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" class="external text" title="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" rel="nofollow">igniq</a>. The character is a major character in a notable work of fiction, that should be enough to establish notability. Whether it has a separate article or not is then a question of length and summary style. Given that the "list of characters" article <i>alone</i> is 37k of prose and is <i>already in</i> summary style for a lot of characters, it's difficult to imagine merging this. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 04:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that the same version you quoted (granted, not a consensus version) also said: "Major characters in a fictional work or series of works are typically notable." Interesting, no? <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 22:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, not at all interesting - the only major character in the Halo video game series is Master Chief. It's a game, not a movie or something. Cortana's participation is limited to a bunch of cutscenes.<br />
To adress your first point: the gamespot article does indeed not contain merely a passing mention of Cortana - it rather contains three passing mentions of Cortana. Hardly enough for the primary criterion. The <a href="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" class="external text" title="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" rel="nofollow">iqniq "article"</a> then? Well, it says: "Cortana is conspicuously the only character moving." and links to a picture where the silhouettes of the Dead or Alive characters are featured, all still, except one female, who is jumping up and down causing her breasts to wobble. Iqniq jokingly(?) suggests that this is Cortana as a guest character in DoA. Are you seriously trying to claim that as a serious source? Yes, I can see it in the article: <i>The gaming website Iqniq has on one occasion put forward claims that Cortana will be featured as a guest character in Dead or Alive, equipped with a large pair of bouncing breasts.</i> It's so encyclopedic it hurts!<br />
Furthermore - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Halo_series_characters_5d2c.html" title="List of Halo series characters">List of Halo series characters</a> could, and should, be severely trimmed. Even if I could perhaps some time accept Cortana as notable, I will NEVER accept <i>Admiral Whitcomb</i>, <i>Gunnery Sergeant Pete Stacker</i>, <i>Kalmiya</i>, <i>Endless Summer</i>, <i>Yayap The Grunt</i> or any of the countless COMPLETELY USELESS characters listed in there. With those removed, and the so-called major characters left in, the article will be of perfect size - even including Cortana. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 23:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now, this is progress. Iqniq never claims she would be so equipped, so that part would be WP:OR. All other mocking aside, that the Cortana character was considered for appearing in the other game would be legitimate "out of world" content for an article. As for the other characters you mention, you may very have a point, but this is not an AfD on <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tartarus_%28Halo%29_299b.html" title="Tartarus (Halo)">Tartarus (Halo)</a>. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 01:32, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Great thing. That means we have found one <i>non-trivial published work from a source that is reliable and independent of the subject itself</i> - as the guideline I'm invoking requires several, find one more and write them into the article. Then I might consider withdrawing my nomination. (I am not kidding.)<br />
Good thing you appreciate my point on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Halo_series_characters_5d2c.html" title="List of Halo series characters">List of Halo series characters</a>.

<ul>
<li>Did you see the digging I did below, Job? Either way, you cant just arbitrarily say that Master Chief is the only major character. Halo isn't a story about fighting aliens; end; it's got its own plot twists, background, et al. Cutscenes are essentially movies, and there are plenty- you can't be saying that video games do not have the depth of movies. <i>Cortana's participation is limited to a bunch of cutscenes</i>- um... she gives you direction throughout the entire game... In any case, the Master Chief barely speaks five lines, (Two Betrayals is him at his wordiest), so your definition of 'major' seems limited to if he's a protagonist. <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid ƒuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 01:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I didn't notice those, actually. It is a shame that the first one is a blog, the three following are from some sort of forum, and the last one comes from <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungie.html" title="Bungie">Bungie</a>.com. (I'll comment further on them below.)<br />
But as you say, either way, my argumentation isn't really based on whether Cortana and/or Master Chief are major characters or not (as I see it, the plot IS a story of fighting aliens), but on whether an article on Cortana is warranted per the "primary notability criterion" (the one requiring <i>multiple non-...</i> you know the rest). This AfD has for my part raised doubts over whether the "primary" of "primary notability criterion" actually means it is the PRIMARY notability criterion or if it's just there to make it sound cool. (Like the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Directive_6a6d.html" title="Prime Directive">Prime Directive</a> which undeniably sounds cool.

<li>Following the abrupt end of Halo 2, it was unclear if Cortana had been corrupted by the Gravemind or had been destroyed altogether. "Given the variety of character and story arcs at the end of Halo 2, we wanted to boil down our announcement to a few key threads," he said. "Cortana and the Chief being a galaxy apart is a situation we haven't seen before, and is something that is a powerful component to Halo 3. We are using her transmissions in the demo to give the viewer a few subtle clues to her situation and state of mind, without revealing any specifics we want to save for the game itself."</li>

<li>"Obtuse"? After looking that up (I am not a native english speaker), I am wondering whether that is <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">a personal attack</a> or not. Whatever the case, no, I am not making shit up, and I am not being obtuse - not on purpose, not at all. While the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolus_Linnaeus_b3d7.html" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> argument is indeed quite exaggerated, the exaggeration was used to highlight the obvious flaws in the reasoning my argument replied to: namely that just because something is associated with something notable, doesn't mean it is notable. I <i>am</i> related to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolus_Linnaeus_b3d7.html" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> - but I don't claim that as making me notable, newsworthy, famous or whatever.<br />
As for the comment on categories versus lists, I don't get the point. It was apparently a reply on my statement, which in turn was a reply on the suggestion that there were only a handful of video game character biographies.

<li>That you thought the "handful" was a reference to every single article in Category:Computer and video game characters, shows that you misunderstood the point.

<li>Then, <b>instead of calling me obtuse, please clarify the point</b>.

<li>Well, I do know swedish, and as thus I read through the first one. Sadly, it does not discuss Cortana's involvement in the plot: Cortana's role in the essay consists of a bunch of plot summaries for 1) the game, 2) every single level in the game and 3) herself. While the third one, the description of Cortana, could provide some interesting insight, it does not (my translation): <i>Pillar of Autumn's artificial intelligence. The AI runs the ship and navigation per the captain's orders. Takes the form of a hologram picturing a woman with short blonde hair in a circuit board suit. She can enter all computer systems you run into in the game and take care of information. She works both as character in the movie sequences and guide during the gaming sequences. By communicating with other entities and actively seeking information that she then shares with the gaming character she often works as a narrator.</i> The only thing remotely interesting in there is the last sentence. It could very well be included in a shortened List of Halo characters article.<br />
Hey, it turns out the second one is danish. As a Swede, I can read danish to some extent. The analysis is practically the exact same as the one in Swedish, and the Cortana part reads (my translation): ~<i>Cortana is an artificial intelligence, used to run the respective systems of Pillar of Autumn. In addition to this, she is an important part of the ship's navigation system, and it is the Master Chief's task to make sure that she doesn't fall into enemy hands.</i> While this doesn't contain anything of use, it does later on say that Cortana is related to the narrating AI of bungie game Marathon - the only thing of interest to us in this essay.<br />
Well, my conclusion remains: this article should be <b>deleted</b> and interesting contents should be inserted into the list of halo characters article. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 13:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the translations and analysis. Bear in mind, though, that even plot summary in secondary sources is useful; many times, we have to rely on the exception in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> that allows for the use of primary sources for uncontroversial, descriptive facts. And, even though Wikipedia is not a collection for plot summaries, inclusion of <i>some</i> plot summary is necessary for a comprehensiveness — at least, this is the interpretation held by most people who frequwently participate in evaluating <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">featured article candidates</a>. I don't really have an objection to a merge, though. As a note, though, if you do favor a merge, bear in mind that "delete and merge" violates the terms of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a>, in that any text merged needs to have its edit history kept somewhere; this is usually done through keeping the old article as a redirect to the target. "Merge and redirect" is fine. If this is closed as kept, there isn't really a proscription against continuing discussion of "separate article versus merger" on talk pages. — <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<b><a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a></b> 04:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia procedures are odd. As I find it hard to believe any consensus would ever arise on deleting the article WITHOUT including Cortana in the list of characters article, "merge and redirect" is my desired outcome. To me, deleting does in practice mean setting up a redirect - if nothing else so for preventing the article's recreation.

<li>Rampancy.net may be a reasonable source for some content within a Halo-related article, however it is pretty much a pro-Bungie site so it doesn't really qualify as a 3rd party reference of the subject's notability.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I'd assume she'd be notable due to the fact that she is one of the primary characters in both the Halo video games, and Halo novels.

<li><b>Comment:</b> even though I still argue she is not notable at all, I do think even you must agree "extremely notable" is something of an overstatement. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 18:58, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> How is she not notable? She's not a character you see or hear only two times during Halo, or Halo 2, unlike Sergeant Major Avery J. Johnson in Halo 1. I will admit I may have made an overstatement, but my point still stands that she is still a notable character. I however give you kudos in defending your AfD gallantly. I will also make another point that the Cortana article, as stated previously does need to be cleaned up and sourced, but this is not a valid point to delete it. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuillOmega0_94e3.html" title="User:QuillOmega0">QuillOmega0</a> 19:10, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> As I suppose you have read above, I will not go on in great length as to why she is not notable - or, rather, not notable enough for an own article. But basically, it lies in the requirement of non-trivial third-party sources discussing the subject in question as specified in the "primary notability criterion" of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, to some extent). As it has been proven (see discussions above) that an article on Cortana can't go beyond plot summary (or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), I think she would be better off included in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Halo_series_characters_5d2c.html" title="List of Halo series characters">List of Halo series characters</a>, and that article to be severely trimmed (as suggested on that article's talk page, yielding no results). <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 19:50, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep —</b> Passes Notability on its own. Major character in the Halo series. I'd say merge, but there is enough information to keep this. <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 19:08, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I believe that this is either never going to reach consensus, or it's going to end up a weak keep. Personally, I feel that in the context of this being a video game, it is unlikely that there are going to be professional, scholastically written articles like you seem to want in order for it to be kept. This notwithstanding, main characters are allowed an article if putting them in the main article would make it too long. I disagree with the concept that since this is a video game, there can't be main characters besides the playable characters. One, there are novels in which she is a main character. Two, video games can be considered interactive movies, and the Halo series is a great argument for that. It is a classic sci-fi action trilogy, with a plot, antagonists, protagonists, cliffhangers, and epic battles, and Cortana is one of the characters that holds the plot together. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> allows us to give main characters a page even without meeting the general notability guidelines, and we're allowed to use the primary sources of the games and novels to source this where other sources miss things. Also, I feel that this nomination is on the borderline of being a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nomination. I can understand nominating a character that only shows up in one game and isn't as important to the plot like Tartarus, but Cortana is one of the main characters of a massively popular video game trilogy. As for print sources, Cortana has a whole page write-up in one of my official game manuals if we absolutely need a print source, circling back to one of my reasons for keep: it's ok for writings not to focus on her as long as they include enough information on her from which to write an article. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 02:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Let me add that I do not like using Wikipedia's notablity criteria for fictional characters; it is a very common justification to branch off important fictional characters from otherwise bloated lists precisely because information about these characters is extensive and including it, even in condensed format, would unnecessarily draw out the lists. This is <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">commonly accepted</a> in Wikipedia. How many <i>scholarly</i> third-party sources can we find for <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Palmer_4992.html" title="David Palmer">David Palmer</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid_Snake_c8da.html" title="Liquid Snake">Liquid Snake</a>, for example? <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPeptuck_c276.html" title="User:Peptuck">Peptuck</a> 04:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Addendum</b> I've looked over the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> guidelines, and I have noticed a very important part of the guideline that I want to address. Specifically, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe we should be referring to guidelines on fictional characters as grounds for suitability for deletion. Specifically, <i>Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</i> Therefore, I propose that this debate should be shifted to <i>"Is Cortana a major enough character within Halo to warrant an article of her own?"</i> as per these established guidelines regarding fictional material. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPeptuck_c276.html" title="User:Peptuck">Peptuck</a> 04:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC) -Additionally, per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)</a> acceptable sources for fictional characters include:</p>

<li>Websites or <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a> run by the creators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scholarly third party analyses only make up one of many acceptable sources for fictional material. With these facts and elements of Wikipedia's guidelines regarding <b>fictional</b> material, I reaffirm my position to <b>oppose</b> deletion of this article, at least on the grounds Joborn has cited. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPeptuck_c276.html" title="User:Peptuck">Peptuck</a> 04:33, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Comment</i>: Notability must be established by independent third-party sources. If notability of a subject is established independently, self-published sources may be used for content in an article about the subject.
