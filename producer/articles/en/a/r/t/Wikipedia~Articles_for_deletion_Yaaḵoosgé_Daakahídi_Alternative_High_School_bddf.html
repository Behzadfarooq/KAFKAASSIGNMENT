<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It sounds to me like this school "has a substantial and unique program, structure, or technique that differentiates it from similar schools", especially given its <a href="../../../t/l/i/Tlingit_language.html" title="Tlingit language">Tlingit language</a> name, which renders it worthy per the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:27, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> No reliable sources, claim to notability weak at best. A non-English name does not constitute a "unique program" -- if there is in fact such a program (currently the only potential claim of such is "less mainstream high school experience"), it needs to be dealt with in a little more detail and sourced. Currently fails <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 22:37, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> has no basis or justification for use as a Wikipedia guideline as it has never been presented for review and approval by Wikipedia users, let alone reached consensus as a basis for any purpose in Wikipedia. The failure to make the most trivial investigation of this program that is derided as a "unique program" solely because of its non-English name seems to be blatant prejudice. Questioning the existence of teh program only proves that this entire vote is baseless. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 10:12, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Reading prejudice into a factual statement ("A non-English [school] name does not constitute a unique program") is a personal attack, and shows bad faith. Desist. As for the program, as you are very well aware, there was no evidence within the article that one existed at the time I cast my&#160;!vote, and I reject your attempt to obscure the issue through barely-veiled accusations of racism. Furthermore, I do not feel that any reliable sources have yet been provided that show it is in fact a "unique program." Finally, WP:SCHOOLS3 has at least as much justification for use as WP:SCHOOLS. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 10:30, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You can try to spin "A non-English name does not constitute a "unique program" -- if there is in fact such a program" as being a good faith disagreement with the qualifications of the article, but to any reasonable person it comes off as a patronizing dismissal of the schools' program. I sincerely hope it's mere ignorance and not prejudice, and I hope that your protests are justified. Unlike the far more thoroughly developed WP:SCHOOL, WP:SCHOOLS3 has received no review or any consideration whatsoever from Wikipedia users as a guideline. As it has made no attempt at all at reaching consensus within the Wikipedia community, it can't possibly be justified for use as a guideline, and the extreme deletionist bias it demonstrates makes it unlikely to ever be a basis for a consensus guideline. Do the facts provided in the current article satisfy your concerns? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 10:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no spin involved, but since you've already shown you're not prepared to assume good faith, I won't waste my time with you further. I simply ask that you refrain from any and all speculation upon my motives in the future, and repeat my request that you cease to use such terms as "ignorant" and "prejudiced" to describe me. On the other topic, as you realize, SCHOOLS3 is newer than SCHOOLS; this does not mean it is not valid, and, unlike SCHOOLS, it has not been rejected. <i>When</i> it is presented, then we will see. Finally, I thought I had made this clear, but no, the current article does not meet my concerns. I do not feel that reliable sources have been provided that show that the program is "unique." <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 11:00, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The school offers a substantially unique program aimed at serving students at greatest risk of dropping out of high school. A significant part of the program focuses on the <a href="../../../t/l/i/Tlingit.html" title="Tlingit">Tlingit</a> culture and language used by the many Native American students who attend the school and are at greatest risk of falling through the cracks, which addresses criterion 4 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. The school and its programs have also been the subject of several reports in major local newspapers, in fulfillment of criterion 1 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>, with sources that are reliable and verifiable, in compliance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As such, the article meets and exceeds the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria for retention. Use of "scare quotes" for "alternative" in the nomination and "unique program" regarding the non-English name are patently offensive and a sign of ignorance for those who are willing to delete anything they are unwilling to attempt to do the most basic research. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 09:01, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When I say "non-notable", that means non-notable for inclusion.

<dd>In that event, I assume I could have just typed "Notable school" and that would have been a sufficient argument for inclusion. I would ask that in the future you explain in detail what you mean by "non-notable" because I don't have a clue.

<dd>The "news coverage" is all local papers and it's a given that any school is going to get some sort of mention in their community papers. Also, none of the links to them are accessible, but from the titles, it's clear that the school is not even the primary subject of all these articles. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:14, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The coverage is from both the Alaska state capital's largest newspaper and the state's largest publication. Where is this "no local coverage" criteria you've presented come form? There is no mention of it in the "multiple non-trivial coverage" standard that appears throughout Wikipedia and is very well defined at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>Wow! You can't read the articles at all, but you can divine they're content from the titles. Read the article first, and then you can question their validity. I will acknowledge that if any of the sources include constitute trivial coverage, then I would be unable to use them to prove notability. See <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for the definition of trivial coverage as "newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories." I will even add sports scores to the trivial coverage criteria for schools. If any article fails this criteria, please let me know and I will withdraw my claim. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:59, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) First, if you have not read the sources, you should not speculate on their contents. I have read both articles, and the school is either the exclusive or primary focus of both. Second, there is no policy basis for your comment on "local sources". I sugggest you review WP:RS. Third, your characterization of these sources as "local", implying that they are somehow subpar, is inaccurate and highly disrespectful to residents of Alaska. The Anchorage Daily News has the highest circulation of any Alaska newspaper. The Juneau Empire ranks third. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> <i>The school serves students at risk of dropping out, about half of whom are from racial and ethnic minorities</i> and the fact that it teaches <i>the culture and language of the Tlingit</i> make it notable in my opinion.

Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> this needs to be confirmed, and without confirmation the article cannot stand.

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you have a substantive reason why this school is notable? Note that adding exclamation points doesn't make the assertion any more convincing. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:16, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think he meant notable school!!! as per our notability guideline and the lengthy discussion above. Hmmm. Ok, he didn't actually provide a long, detailed explanation of notable school!!!, but then neither did the nom who wrote "<i>Non Notable alternative school</i>". Neither did you when you wrote: <i>Delete per nom. Shimeru and Trusilver</i>. Instead of hassling other editors over their use of punctuation, which is "unhelpful and unproductive", perhaps you would care to provide a "substantive reason", i.e. policy based, why this school, despite the references, fails WP:V!! --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 11:18, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that the nom, Shimeru and Trusilver summarized the matter well? <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> isn't all the matters. If it were we'd have articles on every single common murdered and the victime. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> matters and I have yet to see any independent sources discussing this school in a way that demonstrates notability. If sources that actually say that the language and cultural material is notable then I'll change to keep. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:49, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>:Yes, of course, the nom summarized things well with a comment restricted entirely to google hits and student numbers, both of which have no bearing on inclusion. You are certainly entitled to contest that the references "<i>actually say that the language and cultural material is notable</i>". However, if that is your position, I have to assume that you have not perused the sources, which discuss the infusion and public funding of Tlingit language and cultural studies into a school that consists largely of Alaskan minorities. I encourage you to do so, unless you have decided that WP:V and WP:N are not important here, which is certainly your right. However, in that case, I would ask that you not challlenge users such as Audiobooks who have formulated arguments in keeping with wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:45, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The references are purely routine local coverage. Now, while you may argue that they are in some sense not local that is more because Alaska is large and sparsely populated than anything else. I have seen no indication that anyone outside the immediate area has considered this to matter at all. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I won't address your comment's elitist and vaguely ethnocentric undertones and denigration of large, sparsely populated areas as somehow unworthy of our attention. I will ask that you: (i) point me to the policy, guideline or essay (yes, even including your schools3 essay) that precludes "local" sources; (ii) provide some proof that Alaska's leading newspapers (all available worldwide through the internet) qualify as "local" sources not suitable for wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
