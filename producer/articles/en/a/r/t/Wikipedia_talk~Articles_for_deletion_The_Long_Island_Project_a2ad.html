<p>I went through your guidelines word for word: My article isn't propaganda, it's not just MY point of view on the film--in fact it offers no POV's just the trivial facts--and the importance of it is that it is the first and so far the ONLY film to deal with the subject of secession, to be filmed in the chamber of the senate armed services committee, and to acheive success merely out of its subject matter. I have two more films I'd like to write about, but not until this particular matter is cleared up.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> None of the above has any bearing on the question of notability. How many people have ever seen this movie? How many have even heard of it? Is it being distributed? Is it being shown commercially? Has it been reviewed in any major national media? There's no indication that any of those things have happened. (By the way, Youtube and Myspace are generally not considered notability, as any teenager with a modem can post there.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 04:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Cadebro, it's a very good point about "just because you've never heard of it, doesn't mean it's not worthy of inclusion"--it's an extremist view--a bias view without question.

<p>I agree with the issue of verifiability. You've offered no citations for your arguements. Oh, and because the movie films a scene on the "exorcist steps" does not make the film notable. I used that stairway all the time when I was at Georgetown but I don't consider myself notable because of it. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 00:34, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not asking Wikipedia to PROMOTE The Long Island Project and I'm not saying whether it will be important, of major concern, influential, standing, high regarded, a huge immense success or not, I'm not saying that Wikipedia is a Crystal Ball as some have more than insinunated. But I think you all can confirm the film exists, its trailers and bloopers and cut scenes are scattered all across the internet, ifilm, youtube especially are the most hit pages. It's listed on the Internet Movie Database, which is not an easy website to have and independent film listed on. You want notability and importance--its importance is that without this article, how can the public know whether or not a film of this subject matter exists? Or that it's possible to do what has been done with this film? <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevenlinefeatures_ea37.html" title="User:Sevenlinefeatures">EZZIE</a> 21:12, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

The bottom line is that this is a valid listing, with valid information. To push for deletion is to do several of the things that Wikipedia is <b>not</b>. Now that you have successful pushed several people away from Wikipedia (I'm sure that the creators are proud of your behavior), I would like to ask you why you're doing this. The article's writer is not abusing Wikipedia. You don't know him personally so you <b>can't</b> have a personal vendetta against him. Aren't there people vandalising President Bush's lisiting that you can go push around? Do the little badges on your user pages give you the right to give people a hard time?

<dd>Hey Cadebro, don't bother with them. They're gonna get their way--I say let 'em. If they want to base their faith on google and their other "heavily hit" websites, then by all means. Wikipedia is failing experiment because of them anyway. They state that they welcome "Reasoned Argument" but when you provided that they shot back at you with a hundred and one links to why you're wrong. There's no way to win with these people and the Administrator who red-flagged the page in the first place seems to have it out for my anyway.

<p><a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevenlinefeatures_ea37.html" title="User:Sevenlinefeatures">EZZIE</a> needs to be aware that <b>any</b> editor may update this article. If someone sees <b>his</b> movie, and is less than enthralled by it, they can post this on the main page or worse the talk page (where they can state their <i>opinion" of the movie). See; <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html#Effectiveness_of_vanity_articles" title="WP:VAIN">Effectiveness of Vanity articles</a></i></p>
<p>That being said, I think this article is toast because of the <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">Vanity Article</a> issue. I know he wants to create <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">buzz</a> for his new movie (and I can sympathize with that desire), but Wikipedia is not the place to do it. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> 17:57, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm well aware of people being able to make edits to the page, the idea of this is to dicuss a film and its topics and I'm open to opinon on both. This is not VANITY. Wikipedians are over-using and mis-using the word, this is an article about a film, the only film to be made that really deals with the subject of secession. If it was about VANITY I would have done a special page about the FILMMAKERS AND ACTORS AS WELL--but I didn't do that. It's about the film and the film's subject--nothing more. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevenlinefeatures_ea37.html" title="User:Sevenlinefeatures">EZZIE</a> 18:04, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that he may beyond the point of reasoning.

<dd>I think the solution will be this: <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevenlinefeatures_ea37.html" title="User:Sevenlinefeatures">EZZIE</a>, who is the <b>producer</b> of this film can proudly (and openly) promote his film on his <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevenlinefeatures_ea37.html" title="User:Sevenlinefeatures">user page</a>. It's part of his bio. The main article will have to go. This isn't because some people on wikipedia are mean, it's just the rules against vanity and advertising pages. Wikipedia is a not a promotional venue. It doesn't accept advertising and can't serve as a defacto advertising vehicle for indie films, new bands, etc..</dd>

<dd>No one has seen the movie thus is cannot yet be categorized. If you would like to categorize it as a comedy then please cite IMDB in the article. The burden of proof is on YOU to keep the article. The AfD is a <i>discussion</i> on the merits of the article <b>as it is</b> in Wikipedia regardless of outside sources. If you update the article accordingly and provide the proper citations to back up claims then those will be taken into consideration. The bottom line, however, is that the movie has not been released yet and thus its notability cannot be established. This factor will most likely cause your article's deletion because there is no amount of editing you can do to make up for that fact. Please also note that the only individual responsible for flaming at any point in this process is yourself. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 20:14, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been monitoring several AFD's on Wikipedia and this is one of them, I noticed RasputinAXP put it into the speedy catagory, another user took it out of the speedy catagory, then he put it back into the speedy catagory... not to mention the writer's contributions have all been deleted, reverted, or red-flagged. There's some serious implications happening here and I would very much like it explained to me. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmost_Famous_dfee.html" title="User:Almost Famous">Almost Famous</a> 17:50, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no controversy. All the "speedy delete" tag does is place an alert essentially saying "an administrator should look at this and see if it meets the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>". If an administrator decides it does, then they can delete it immediately. By removing the tag, an editor is saying "I do not feel that this article meets <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">the criteria</a> for immediate deletion." This has nothing to do with this AfD. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 17:57, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Long Island discussion plays off like a pack of wolves on a single prey, I've viewed a lot of AFD discussions before, but nothing like this.

<dd>But, when all's said and done, the primary problem is that the movie's never had any sort of release. It's been shown at a few small indy film festivals, but there's no general distribution.
