<li><b>Keep</b>. I fail to see the POV of the title. Settlers and settlements do exist. And I do know that there is a series of decisions by the European Court of Human Rights vindicating Greek-Cypriot citizens having lost their property. And the fact that the government of the Republic of Cyprus accepts in the not-occupied territoty of Cyprus Turkish-Cypriots but not settlers who came to Cyprus later proves their existence.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 12:51, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And when there is a recommendation by the Parliamentary Assembly of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Europe_83e9.html" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a> named <b><a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/TA03/EREC1608.htm" class="external text" title="http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/TA03/EREC1608.htm" rel="nofollow">Colonisation by Turkish settlers of the occupied part of Cyprus</a></b> ... well ... I don't think that anybody here can question notability.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let's see some of what this Recommendation says: "It is a well-established fact that the demographic structure of the island has been continuously modified since its de facto partition in 1974, as a result of the deliberate policies of the Turkish Cypriot administration and Turkey. Despite the lack of consensus on the exact figures, all parties concerned admit that Turkish nationals have since been systematically arriving in the northern part of the island. According to reliable estimates, their number currently totals 115 000." "The settlers come mainly from the region of Anatolia, one of the least developed regions of Turkey. Their customs and traditions differ significantly from those present in Cyprus. These differences are the main cause of the tensions and dissatisfaction of the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population, who tend to view the settlers as a foreign element" "In particular, the Assembly expresses its concern at the continuous outflow of the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population from the northern part of the island. Their number decreased from 118 000 in 1974 to an estimated 87 600 in 2001. In consequence, the settlers outnumber the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population in the northern part." "In the light of the information available, the Assembly cannot accept the claims that the majority of arriving Turkish nationals are seasonal workers or former inhabitants who had left the island before 1974. Therefore it condemns the policy of “naturalisation” designed to encourage new arrivals which was introduced by the Turkish Cypriot administration with the full support of the Government of Turkey."

<li>Keep the rhetoric to a minimum please and watch for NPA. "Israeli settlements" are commonly used in English by major news organizations.

<li>I would also like to remind everybody here that the issue of settlers was the main reason the Greek Cypriot side and the Republic of Cyprus rejected the Annan Plan.

<dd>The article first makes the claim that "Turkish settlements are communities established by Turkey", as if Turkey is somehow the Ottoman Empire passing a decree to establish overseas colonies. The use of word colonisation again portrays Turkey as orchestrating the movement of Turkish migrants. Turkey does not decide who goes to Cyprus, many Turks go to work over summer in the tourist season and return. Those who do stay are required to have a work permit. But this article does not seem concerned with these details, only in portraying Turkey in a certain light. Furthermore, the article says "such settlements currently exist..." as if this is a common phenomena regarding Turkey, when in fact this an aspect specifically related to the Cyprus problem. These are problems within a few lines, I dont expect this article to get better as it grows in size, but rather become another ugly Cyprus article. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 17:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Responses to your arguments</b>:
<ul>
<li>The settlers are coming from Turkey. Tyrkey allows them to settle in Northern Cyprus by allowing them to go there. If Turkey wanted to impede this phainomenon, it would have done it. Therefore, Turkey may not be Ottoman Empire, but it is a sovereign state tolerating this situation, and showing no will to reverse it. I thus believe that the verb "established" pictures with characteristic accuracy the present situation. After all, if it was not Turkey that "established" the settlement, then why are the Parliamentary Assembly and the European Parliament asking Turkey, in particular, to resolve the problem. I'm afraid, Garnet, that once again your problem is not with the article, but with the clear and sound resolutions of European Organizations and with the publications of UN. And, unfortunately, I can't help with that problem.</li>
<li>The noun "colonisation" is again a NPOV term, also used by the Parliamentary Assembly of the COuncil of Europe. Unless you think, of course, that the great majority of this Parliament, and, therefore, the great majority of the population of Europe are biased against Turkey in this particular issue. But again this is your personal belief and impression. Official documents matter, and official documents of international organization are crystal clear about the ongoing colonisation of occupied Cyprus by Turkey.</li>
<li>I fail to understand your third point. It would be helpful if you could be a bit more clear and specific, so that I can give an accurate answer. Such settlements do exist in Northern Cyprus, their existence is confirmed by all the international organizations, and it is Turkey which is held responsible for their existence. What is exactly your problem here?--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 09:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We do not base articles on parliamentary or any political resolution. This is an encylopedia, we create academic articles based on scholarly research. Resolutions are fine for expressing support for one point of view, but they should not be the basis of any article. To be honest though Yannis, I have given up caring, this article will stay, it will be poor and ugly like a lot of other Cyprus related articles and that will be that. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 10:32, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> So what are Turkish settlements, anywhere in Cyprus, where there is a Turkish flag?

<li>So, there is are no Turkish settlements anywhere but where the Turkish flag is flown? No Turkish settlements in Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Albania, or anywhere else, right? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 23:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The picture on the page was some mosque with a Turkish flag (in Cyprus). I thought it was related to settlements, maybe it's not. So, then what are these settlements? In those Balkan countries we might have some "ghetto"s where Turkish people live and have lived for many hundred years (by the way, are they still called settlers?) Are the Turkish settlements in Cyprus ghettos of people from Turkey? I would rather guess that they would blend in, spread kinda uniformly among the 'original' Turkish Cypriots, not build some ghettos. Are they house by house, like any house owned by a settler is a settlement? What about the students? I think the first sentence of the article might be wrong, it should read "after the invasion" not "established by Turkey". I don't think Turkey established any ghettos there. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 00:29, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Settlements aren't necessarily inhabited by "settlers" in the sense of migrants. I assume you live in a settlement, which the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> uses to refer to any inhabited place. See the long discussion at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28settlements%29_904f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)</a> and its talk page. Since "Turkish" is both a nationality (you can have a Turkish passport and be of e.g. Greek, Armenian, Arab, Jewish, or Kurdish ethnicity) and an ethnicity (you can be ethnically Turkish and hold e.g., a Bosnian, Russian, or US passport), the use of Turkish to modify settlement in the context of Cyprus could well mean settlements in Cyprus inhabited by people of Turkish ethnicity or with Turkish passports. Based on the sources, these groups largely overlap anyway. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:28, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am sorry, but that would be our own interpretation as to what it means.

"Israeli settlements" are regularly used by every news organization in the world, however this is not and poses WP:OR problems, on top of WP:fork..

<dd>I am sorry, but that's rhetoric and such interpretations will simply stay ours. Nearly all impartial voters have agreed that this article was a fork, and it still hasn't been shown where in the English language the term "Turkish settlement" has been used - I can easily do a Google search for "Israel settlements", or in any major news agency's web-site and get hundreds of thousands of hits. None of the keep voters still hasn't been able to show news releases et al where such an expression is used - let alone bring sources per WP:ATT that show or name any of these "Turkish settlement". The title has WP:OR problems, and the article is a WP:FORK of Cyprus dispute. I don't get what the big deal is really, no-one is saying that the content should be deleted.

<dd>Rhetoric? Interpretations? You're not seriously denying that settlers were brought in from Turkey to alter the island's demographic balance after 1974, and occupy properties whose title deeds belong to Greek Cypriots? I simply can't fathom why the Turkish editors are getting their knickers into a knot over such petty semantics. Turkish <i>settlement</i> doesn't have to refer to <i>specific</i> locations - although it could well do - it is an also an <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_noun.html" title="Abstract noun">abstract noun</a> referring to the indisputable <i>act</i> of bringing in those settlers in the first place.

<dd>That "Turkish settlement" as a term is used in the English language like "Israeli settlements" (which was the first line of argument and analogy by the keep voters) - if not, what the term means will be OR since Turkish settlement can also refer to Turkish neighborhoods in Berlin etc. Can you please bring per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> sources that attest that a) The term "Turkish settlement" is used in the English language and b) moreover, that there is an overwhelming concensus in the English language usage that it refers to the Cyprus dispute. You say "Israeli settlements" to any English language speaker, and they will understand what you are referring to, however you say "Turkish settlement" and they will not understand what you are talking about. Come on, prove me wrong: Bring sources per WP:ATT that attest to such a usage in English, and especially in the news media et al.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The word <i>settlement</i> has two quite distinct meanings: (1) a community consisting of a number of dwellings; (2) the process of settling, as the result of migration. The title of the article is accordingly ambiguous. The disputed article as well as the present discussion appear to confuse the two meanings, whether accidentally or not. As defined in the lead of the article, the meaning is unambiguously (1), but in a curiously restricted sense. It is as if we were to have an article "Italian house" starting "An <b>Italian house</b> is a house built by Italians during World War I." Are settlements of Turks in Kos or Bulgaria then not Turkish settlements? Settlements of Turks on Cyprus have existed since the 16th century. In the remainder of the article, the meaning gradually shifts to (2). Although many Turks may have settled on the island after the partition, and the Republic of Turkey has not discouraged this, these migrants did not form <i>new</i> settlements, and no evidence is presented in the article that any communities were established by Turkey in Cyprus <i>after</i> the partition, nor do the cited sources support this contention. Thus, following the restricted definition of the lead, <b>there are no Turkish settlements</b>. The definition in the lead can be relaxed, of course, to refer to any Turkish communities, including those in existence on Cyprus at the time of the EOKA coup, but that defeats the whole purpose of the article, which would have to be completely rewritten to accommodate the new definition. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Chesdovi, those are the letters of readers, you are aware of that, right? Please give the link to the article itself, if it is mentioned there. But you might be right a little bit, once I posted a comment on a Kurdish newspaper (?) website (I don't remember the website now, I found it through Yahoo! Alerts quite a while ago, it was the English version, I bookmarked it but then removed bookmark after like a week), they were bashing Erdoğan for a comment he made, in a few minutes the website was filled with anti-Turkish comments, I wrote something like Talabani said about the same thing, but my comment was not published, even though many other Turkey-bashing ones were published after that. So, having a comment there might reflect the opinion of the journalist as well, but that might be true only for that Kurdish website. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 15:21, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

I changed my vote to delete only, as the current lead claims things with no support and then the article deals with something else, apparently the article won't get better. I am worried it will be anything goes — anytime the editor feels like it. Now we even have the Turkish settle-ment, act of settling. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 21:47, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. So many settlers in the occupied area of Cyprus that outnumber the Turkish Cypriots <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristovoul0s_1a5a.html" title="User:Aristovoul0s">Aristovoul0s</a> 15:35, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per Lambiam. On reading the title I honestly had never even considered the possibility of the concrete as opposed to the abstract meaning of "settlement", but as Lambiam rightly points out, the article thoroughly mixes the two up. In its present form it is ill-defined and muddled, and as such not a suitable sub-article for the main <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_conflict.html" title="Cyprus conflict">Cyprus conflict</a> article - hence, it is a fork. Come back and write a new article on "Turkish settlement on Cyprus" (abstract!) when you've well thought out what the topic and its relation to the superordinate articles is going to be. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:40, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
