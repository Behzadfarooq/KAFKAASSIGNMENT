<li><b>Keep (and cleanup)</b>. This needs attention, ideally by someone familiar with the region, but simple copyediting would help too. For example, it is clear from a closer reading that the subject is not just a road but a district with a number of sub-districts. (In a number of countries, districts, sometimes even towns, are named for their principal roads.) I think that even though the article is probably mis-titled, the subject is geographically notable at least to the extent that such things are included in other areas, and I think <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">countering systemic bias</a> would be served with a <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:25, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The way I read it, it was a road with its sidestreets. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">Howard</a> <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHoward_the_Duck_380d.html" title="User talk:Howard the Duck"><font color="maroon">t</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">he Du</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howard_the_Duck_47a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck"><font color="purple">c</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">k</a> 02:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I believe that the article is not notable. All the roads in <a href="../../../r/o/a/Category%7ERoads_in_the_Philippines_07fe.html" title="Category:Roads in the Philippines">Category:Roads in the Philippines</a> are major "national roads" in the country. Gabon is not a major national road.

<li><b>Keep</b> - closer reading reveals it something like a district in <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abucay%2C_Bataan_1dd3.html" title="Abucay, Bataan">Abucay,_Bataan</a>. It might not be notable for you, however, it might be notable for someone else. <a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckoz_4ac0.html" title="User:Ackoz">ackoz</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" /></a> 13:17, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>So what's next, an article about a street/district on <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bongao%2C_Tawi-Tawi_ba06.html" title="Bongao, Tawi-Tawi">Bongao, Tawi-Tawi</a>? IMHO, instead of this article, we have to have an article on Roman Superhighway, that is more notable than a street on some town, isn't it? --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">Howard</a> <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHoward_the_Duck_380d.html" title="User talk:Howard the Duck"><font color="maroon">t</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">he Du</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howard_the_Duck_47a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck"><font color="purple">c</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">k</a> 02:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. With notability, it's always necessary to also ask "for whom?" There are many Wiki entries whose likely notability exists only for a locality or people connected with that locality. <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abucay.html" title="Abucay">Abucay</a> has 32,000 people; <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottumwa.html" title="Ottumwa">Ottumwa</a>, Iowa has 25,000. In the latter,there's room to mention a railroad and the two stops that passenger trains make each day. Using that as a measure, I think Gabon round has comparable (local) notability and should be kept. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 13:27, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>

<li><b>Delete</b> - do we really need to make every streets and every barangay in the Philippines an article? If we will do these, we should make an article for <i>Kalye Pitong Gatang</i> first.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. We are not familar with Philippines. I think we should invite users from that region to judge on its notability.

<li><b>Leave/Do NOT Delete</b>. Traditional Tantra (as opposed to the sexually focused neo-Tantra most commonly encountered in the West) has always been an esoteric tradition and therefore relatively unknown except to initiates. Gay Tantra is the first attempt to expound and synthesize the essential principles and practices of the esoteric Hindu tradition with western psychotherapy and cutting-edge gay-identity theory. As such it represents a highly significant development if still relatively unknown. Gay persons have been targeted by mainstream religious institutions for condemnation and persecution for centuries on the grounds that homosexual feelings and behaviors are supposedly antithetical to spirituality, and it is not surprising that this article might encounter resistance due to its radical proposition that a well-integrated gay identity is potentially <i>more</i> spiritual than more polarized identities. Because the sources for information about Gay Tantra are limited, the primary way for those interested to get more information is through the resources cited. Note that Ashram West never charges for its services, so this article should not be seen as an advertisement for the ashram but rather as an information resource consistent with the purpose of any encyclopedia.—Br.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being of Lithuanian descent, I've always been curious about such things. Honestly, I'd never seen a list this complete before; textbooks usually mention a small handful (the garden snake, the oak, thunder) and that's it. Besides, nominator may not understand the nature of Lithuanian mythology: the Lithuanian were the last pagans in Europe, being "officially" christianized only in the 14th century, with pagan practices persisting far longer. This is an important part of the Lithuanian culture, something that the culture is proud of, and is typically (if shallowly) taught starting in grade school. BTW Lithuania has the worlds largest museum devoted to this (Velnelio muzejius&#160;?? not sure of english title, I pressume there's a WP article on it.) p.s. There's a joke that the Lithuanians will be the last catholics in Europe.... <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 03:45, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Two voters have said "I can't find it in the reference cited", which <i>is</i> a good reason for deletion. Also, web searches are routinely used as one criterion for notability, and in this case the results not only give no positive support for a "keep", they give evidence that this is a hoax.

<li><b>Keep</b> Give it a chance, someone (not me) suggested it was wrong to devote an article entitled "Narcissism" entirely to the clinical condition, and I find I agree, BUT if you try to incorporate the general useage into the clincial condition it becomes grossly inaccurate and misleading. All that is here, as yet, are a few lines I copied from someone else's radical attempt to generalise the clinical article, by no means intended to represent the full article. The fact is that when people use the word "Narcissism" they do not always, or even mostly, mean the clinical condition and that warrants recognition.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 08:14, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Noteworthy and until yesterday in need of a complete rethink. No merge due to the immense amount of irrelevant Freudian theory in the psychology article - this content and the actual definition of narcissism as a character trait MUST at all costs be kept separate. Upon commencing work on the narcissism article the sheer mismash of fluffily written, trumped up text and jumbled theorem was astounding; the article was in clear need of extensive work. Thus, the mainstay article and the (psychology) subsidiary article should be separate; our combined energies must be vested in improving and perhaps thinning down the (psychology) area as it is in dire need of attention. A detailed critique made on the day of editing can be found on the talk page - it could be used as a guide of sorts for future editors. -- <a href="../../../d/-/k/User%7ED-Katana_ca0b.html" title="User:D-Katana">D-Katana</a>) 20:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>By "salvage" I mean extracting whatever sourceable and relevant facts are in there (which are <i>not</i> all that many) and add them to whatever article is most appropriate for them. That doesn't mean the wording has to be preserved. If it did, this would be a more general problem, since we can't really maintain articles that should be deleted because someone copied a sentence from it to put in another article. In short, I propose that we salvage facts (such as there are), not the words. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:34, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep/split/move</b> - as per Avenue. This isn't entirely original research, it's a more than occasional subject of news articles in NZ. The fact that new Zealand is more frequently compared with Canada that with Australia in itself says something about the strength of the similarities - I doubt it would lead to a rah of other "comparison" articles. The fact that it has been here over a year with remarkably few of these other articles appearing is also indicative of this. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's been a whole year since the last nomination to improve the article. Not much seems to be happening. If it's so easy to remove all the original research, stick in references, and obtain a respectable article, why hasn't it been done?</li>
<li>"If this article is deleted so should X, Y and Z be" has never been a valid argument for preserving an article (or for deleting one, for that matter). It's rather more instructive to see why the articles you mention are not in danger of deletion while this one is. The issue is not that we can't have articles which compare things-of course we can. We just have to report on comparisons <i>as made by others</i>, with proper references. "Similarities between Canada and New Zealand" is way too general a topic, and the original research runs rampant. Comparisons between politics, health care systems and economies of countries that can be meaningfully compared are much more concrete topics, and if you'll care to look, the articles you mention are much better referenced. "Similarities between X and Y" is a non-topic. If there were lots of scholarly works specifically comparing George W. Bush and Tony Blair, then that would make it a valid topic, and we could have a "George W. Bush and Tony Blair compared" article. But it's not very likely that there are credible sources doing that, and that's why it's not an article. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:31, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's just a list of people who have done narration with no comments. If it's useful at all, it should be a category, which is what I suggested in the prot but it was removed with an edit summary comment of "(Please do not delete!!! Narrator is a category already. Some of these people act and narrate, so I feel the list is useful here!))"- there is no category Narrator or Narrators. I think the article editor (User:AtlBo) means well but is just a bit confused - he's not very experienced. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamoche_0708.html" title="User:Jamoche">Jamoche</a> 04:48, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONGLY Do NOT Delete</b> Jomoche is correct, I do not have much experience, sorry. However, to me it doesn't matter, really, whether this listing is a category or a listing. My problem is that I am having a hard time moving from one narrator to another without the list. I feel that the list will get lost in the article "Narrators." At any rate, I really feel, although I am not experienced, that the list is very helpful. Thanks! (AtlBo 00:26, 19 June 2006 (UTC)=AtlBo)

<li>I don't think you quite understand. The alternative to deleting this is not to put these people into the article <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrator.html" title="Narrator">Narrator</a>, but into a category. The difference between an article containing a list and a category is that an article gets added to a category by putting a category tag at the bottom, and then the list is maintained automatically, whereas if there's an article with a list, the editor has to edit two different places. That's why people say lists can be unmaintainable. Look at <a href="../../../a/c/t/Category%7EActors_5e27.html" title="Category:Actors">Category:Actors</a>; articles get on that list when someone puts [[Category:Actors]] on the page. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamoche_0708.html" title="User:Jamoche">Jamoche</a> 22:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'll just shamefully copy and alter the reasons from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_titles_of_Harry_Potter_books_in_other_languages_%282nd_nomination%29_cfb2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of titles of Harry Potter books in other languages (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of titles of Harry Potter books in other languages (2nd nomination)</a> (credit goes to Mangojuice), as I'm in a hurry.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, most Disney films have articles in many other wikis, so the titles of the books in other languages can be obtained there.</li>
<li>Second, I don't think Wikipedia should be in the business of having articles like this -- WP isn't babelfish.com and it isn't a dictionary either; I think this is unencyclopedic... I know Disney is popular, but if we keep this it's a slippery slope.</li>
<li>Third, and perhaps most importantly, if the article <i>were</i> properly sourced, it would look suspiciously like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, I think: unless someone ELSE has ever written an article or book about the translation of Disney films, we're going to be using entirely primary sources.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>,
<ul>
<li>1. The presence of information in other wikis is not a criteria for deletion from Wikipedia. Quite the opposite - "no original research" demands that info in Wikipedia has to appear somewhere else, so the nominator's first argument is actually evidence that the article is not original research.</li>
<li>2. Invoking the <a href="http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/lf.extrapolation.html" class="external text" title="http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/lf.extrapolation.html" rel="nofollow">slippery slope fallacy</a> does not support the deletion of any article. All articles on AfD should be evaluated against the criteria for deletion and not against any other standards.</li>
<li>3. Evidence against original research was presented in point 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the article is voted for deletion, at least move it to another wiki that supports film-trivia, such as <a href="http://www.film-flam.com" class="external text" title="http://www.film-flam.com" rel="nofollow">Film-Flam</a>.

The blue ribbon award they won is probably significant for their field. The arrangement with Malletech is suggestive of notability, especially in percussion circles. Finally, depending on which KDKA components broadcast the telethon, they may have played to a national radio audience. The article could use more independent sources, yes. However, it's a well-written article, it's on a group worthy of encyclopedic coverage, and Wikipedia is certainly not hurt by leaving this article in. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 03:03, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm still not convinced that the group is notable enough to warrant inclusion. To begin, I don't think <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> is the proper guideline to use as we're talking about a school group. I'm sure there are hundreds of school bands across the nation who could make similar claims (ie appearing on a telethon, performing at education conferences, winning competitions, etc.). Think about it this way; probably a band a year is chosen to perform at education conferences. Say there's one per state and at least one national conference. That's 51 high school groups per year. Over the course of 20 years, there have been over a thousand groups that have done the same thing as this one. - The relationship with Malletech is somewhat intriguing, but again, I'm sure that hundreds of bands across the nation have similar relationships with instrument manufacturers. Again, not necessarily notable enough for this single group. Finally, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> which states "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia."

If there's already an article on Astrophysicist, it could be merged into Physicist, along with other X-physicist, if there's some strong reason, but there's no problem having separate articles, as far as I can see. A physicist is a person, and physics is a science. They're not the same, and they deserve separate articles, so it's natural that Wikipedia would have them in separate articles. The article on the person can discuss education, career, noteworthy individuals etc. The article on the science can concentrate on science. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 14:57, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>. Hoax. I happen to live nearby. Eiland is a street which starts in the centre (!) of Sint-Lievens-Houtem, then turns circularly right to keep the Eilandmolen (Island Mill - a water mill from 1480 which still exists, just google) on its left and then turns sharply left again into development NE of the same water mill. Despite this new development I doubt whether there are more than 100 houses in this street. There is an online Belgian street finder: www.mappy.be. Checking "Eiland 26" and "Eiland 27" in Sint-Lievens-Houtem (unfortunalety, the site does not like completely quoted urls) should give you a good idea of what we are talking about in reality. As Fram said, I would advise everyone here to have a look at Polfbroekstraat and Kottem where the same people are active. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a> --pgp 21:25, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Originally listed as {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}, but tag deleted without reason. The only "improvement" was to add categories, stub tag. It is with a bit of a <i>sigh</i> that I nominate this, knowing the division out there about schools, but I do so only because the prod was removed without any reason or improving the article in any way. Schools are <i>not</i> inherently notable, and elementary schools even less so. Until there is an agreed policy on schools, each article ought to be considered on its own merits and in this case there appears to be none.

<li>There is no such policy and no such precedent. I've asked repeatedly to be pointed to the policy page that says this and nobody has done so. School AfDs are case by case. By all means present arguments for keeping individual schools, but do not cite nonexisting blanket decisions for all schools, because no such decisions have ever been made. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:35, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where is the policy page that says we keep all municipalties, regardless of size (note: there are pages that mention it, but not as policy per se)? Precedent comes from a collection of individual decisions, and doesn't have to be written in one spot. Following precedent allows us to attempt to be consistant. An article should not be deleted arbitrarily, when almost all similiar articles are kept, merely because of the "lottery" of who shows up at AFDs. Participants in each AFD should look at the general past practice. Deletion should be based on policy, guidelines, and precedent. This allows contributors to know, in advance, what they should, and should not create; thus avoiding wasted effort. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:51, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Given that many editors supported deletion, then later arguments for keeping were presented, there is a question here - which I believe Drat is calling attention to below - over whether those arguments have been adequately addressed. I believe they have been. Most of Basscomm's arguments were well responded to by Drat. There are several awards won which are cited in the article, other than that linked to here, but they were already in the article when it was nominated and do not appear to have persuaded editors, which seems a reasonable conclusion to me. A lot, and I mean <i>a lot</i> of people make short films, very few are widely seen, but whenever a sufficient number of people do stuff, they will start giving each other prizes for it. An award has to be notable itself to confer notability.</p>
<p>Given that and the self-promotional nature of this article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Korandder" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Korandder" rel="nofollow">Korandder</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Basscomm" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Basscomm" rel="nofollow">Basscomm</a>, the only two arguing for keep, have edited very little apart from this article and its AfD), I believe this discussion shows a consensus among editors that this group does not merit coverage in an encyclopaedia (AfD is not a vote, in case it wasn't clear already). Although not all editors have responded to the arguments presented directly, I believe it is more likely that they agreed with Drat's counter-arguments and did not feel the need to dogpile, rather than that they have simply been ignoring this discussion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> Websites do not require much traffic to have influence or be notable. In fact, if one were to accept the film industry as a metaphor, many people saw "Wedding Crashers" a year ago, but that movie is non-notable in comparison to something like "The Battleship Potemkin" which has been watched by relatively few people. Now LoadingReadyRun is no Sergei Eisenstein directed enterprise, but insofar as it has (or could be argued to have) a cult following, has won numerous awards, and has repeatedly caught the interests of several larger sites, it is notable. <a href="http://www.loadingreadyrun.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1666&amp;start=75#24618" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.loadingreadyrun.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1666&amp;start=75#24618" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasscomm_86d7.html" title="User:Basscomm">Basscomm</a> 16:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Don’t get me wrong, I said delete, but any of you who think that it doesn’t meet the notability standards probably are just not familiar with LoadingReadyRun. That’s understandable, as many of you probably would reject an article on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Van_Winkle_b686.html" title="Robert Van Winkle">Robert Van Winkle</a> for the same reason. No offense to LoadingReadyRun, but my point with the Robert Van Winkle analogy is that probably the only thing that makes them noteworthy (via Wikipedia’s standards) is a single video hosted all over the net, that appears to be by “64K” and not LoadingReadyRun, who are lucky if they even get a link on the page. Of course, a Google search for 1337, which should probably be the basis for this article’s notability, and not LoadingReadyRun itself, obviously yields confounded results that include way more than the video in question. I don’t know if I can do this, but I move for deletions based solely on the website’s nonnotability to be stricken from the record. The video was linked to by some big sites (e.g. BBSpot) and can be found on tons of video hosting sites (e.g. Google Video, YouTube, etc.) if people want to go down this road, I say they should be forced to at least change their reasoning to the fact that the popularity is so difficult to verify. Either way, I still can’t say that this article should stay. It’s apparent that Wikipedia’s focus is shifting. Whatever Wikibastards are running it now clearly want to increase its reliability at the expense of its usefulness. Perhaps you can tell by the non-neutral POV that I liked it better when Wikipedia was actually good for something, but since I alone can’t change Wikipedia’s direction, it is obvious that due to these new standards, the LoadingReadyRun article cannot stay. I’m not good with the Wikispeak, but I guess this mouthful comes down to that there are few facts or other things that the said Wikibastards consider verifiable. Again, I’m not sure how to say that in a Wikipedia way, but I figured I’d at least attempt to supply an actual reason to delete this article. Even if I don’t like the rules, I still think that the AFDs should play by them. Delete. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedNitrogen_c88f.html" title="User:RedNitrogen">RedNitrogen</a> 23:01, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> 64k is LoadingReadyRun. Having a page about just them and not the other work LoadingReadyRun has done is a bit of a waste. I agree with the idea that it should be in wikipedia but I can also see how it does not agree with the letter of wikipedia's "law". I have to say wikipedia has come across a tad bit autocratic to me.--<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorandder_9407.html" title="User:Korandder">Korandder</a> 05:47, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

You're right on the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> argument though, if there are only a handful of questionable sites that can even confirm its existence, then perhaps this is an article we really don't need around.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'll first of all start off with a translation of the word. "Dhol" means a drum (the musical instrument) (also called <a href="../../../d/h/o/Dholak.html" title="Dholak">Dholak</a>) &amp; "bajja" means player. So "Dholbajja" roughly translates to "drum player". Now there seem to be two separate versions created about the word in the article, one about a village (which is the article's current version) &amp; a caste. Now the village most probably does exist (although I couldn't locate it on Google Earth or the Encarta Atlas) but seems to be thoroughly non-notable as there are no less than a million such quite insignificant villages in India &amp; the state of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhya_Pradesh_a149.html" title="Madhya Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> itself having several thousands. As for the caste, although I have never heard of it, may exist. Although it may be a colloquial slur to certain people living in the particular area. But there are no credible ways of verifying that. So this article can be deleted on the basis of being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">non-notable</a> &amp; being a possible <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">attack page</a>. --<a href="../../../s/r/i/User%7ESrikeit_d1d6.html" title="User:Srikeit">Srikeit</a> <b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../s/r/i/User_talk%7ESrikeit_6c22.html" title="User talk:Srikeit">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Srikeit_067e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Srikeit">Email</a>)</small></sup></b> 10:28, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Now, listen, gentlemen. I am the one who applied for its deletion and let me explain why. Dholbajja literally means drum-player but it's a profession taken up by one of the lowest <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">castes</a> of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamar.html" title="Chamar">Chamar</a>. The Chamars are shoemakers but the word <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamar.html" title="Chamar">Chamar</a> has become an ethnic slur and it's very common to abuse someone by calling him/her a 'Chamar'.</dd>
<dd>Now, the main point is that this article Dholbajja was created to attack an influential upper caste, <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhumihar.html" title="Bhumihar">Bhumihar</a>. This article first claimed that the Bhumihars are Dholbajja but I found it fale and derogatory so I edited it to its current version (geographical locations) only to save it from getting reverted back to the false version.</dd>
<dd>Remember, there is no sub<a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> of <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhumihar.html" title="Bhumihar">Bhumihars</a> called Dholbajja so I think this article must be deleted as soon as possible. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 59.94.41.178 (<a href="../../../5/9/2E/User_talk%7E59.94.41.178.html" title="User talk:59.94.41.178">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.94.41.178_b4b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.94.41.178">contribs</a>) 19 June 2006.</small></dd>

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> The FSC-1 vehicle is real and as close to a Flying Car as you will ever see today. If fact, Popular Science and 60 Minutes are doing articles on this vehicle. The company, LaBiche Aerospace is showing vehicle models at Oshkosh in July 2006. MLaBiche did not put the price tag in the Wiki article, it was someone named Anders. The Wiki article as entered by LaBiche is true and accurate. The vehicle exist and if you remove this article, it would be a dis-service to the wiki community. Check out the News section at www.labicheaerospace.com for the actual latest info. Not these "Nay-saying" people who haven't got a clue. If you remove this article, you have to remove Moller, Terrefugia, Volutee and others. None of these people have a real flying car, just an airplane, teathered pilot-less vehicles, etc. --Mlabiche 18:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Showing a model is not the same as having an actual product. I respect your efforts but until there is some verifiable external coverage of your company, or you have an actual product to sell, Wikipedia is not in the business of being a crystal ball. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:33, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> And Moller's vehicle is a Flying Car because he has a BIG MODEL and calls it a SkyCar? I can go sit in my garage and say I'm a car all day long, but that doesn't make me a car.--Mlabiche 18:14, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't have the fun IP tools that some have, but it seems to me the top anonymous argument comes from Houston, Texas, wherefore is LaBiche Aerospace. Interestingly, their website lists a telephone number which Google says actually belongs to an Eagle Engineering, whose business coincidentally enough is computer simulations. My vote would remain delete, and you can repost the story when the FSC-1 becomes notable, e.g., real. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 17:13, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, Eagle Engineers is one of my companies that specializes in Oil &amp; Gas Industry. For a list of other companies see www.labiche.ws. I have to say that it is sad that we live in a dark time when skepticism and sarcasm is more valued than honesty, integrity, and optimism.--Mlabiche 18:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> First off, full disclosure, for sock-puppeting purposes. I fully admit that I am affiliated with the FSC-1 vehicle. I have worked for several years on the vehicle with the vehicle’s creator, and know of its existence in Houston, TX first-hand. In fact, I’m the one that encouraged MLabiche to create the article in question here in the first place.<br />
<br />
That being said, I have several comments to bring to the table. Firstly, self-promotion is not the motivation for the article’s creation. This article actually stemmed from our discussion of the pre-existing <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_car.html" title="Flying car">Flying Car</a> article. Before MLabiche or I made any modifications to the Flying Car article, it incorrectly discussed <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_air_vehicle.html" title="Personal air vehicle">Personal Air Vehicles</a> (PAVs) and Roadable Aircraft (RAs) in the same breath. When, in actuality, RAs are an entirely separate group of vehicle from PAVs, with their own set of design goals and challenges not necessarily met by all other PAVs. So we set about differentiating Flying Cars/ RAs and their increased number of capabilities from that of PAVs in said article.<br />
<br />
We also took notice that the Moller “<a href="../../../m/o/l/Moller_Skycar_2824.html" title="Moller Skycar">Skycar</a>” [sic] was predominantly over-represented in the Flying Car article. A disturbing fact, since the Moller vehicle is neither a flying car, nor is it a PAV. It is a Powered Lift VTOL aircraft that has the same road-going and door-to-door capabilities of a Cessna 172. It has zero merit as a Roadable Vehicle. So MLabiche and myself decided to rewrite the Flying Car article under more clearly defined terms, in hopes of eradicating this confusion of the two types of vehicle (PAV vs. RA).<br />
<br />
We felt this change would also necessitate the creation of an article about our own vehicle, in order to show the general public that there are other options beyond the “Skycar” [sic] coming to market that meet the actual definition of a RA. We will be at Oshkosh in a month, and we will be generating the kind of “verifiable” ink Wikipedia finds so factual quite soon. And just because we haven’t been working on an aircraft for over 40 years, and sunk over $200 million of our own and many other people’s dollars into it, and generated sensational press over an SEC fraud scandal, doesn’t mean we’re making this up. Also, per the comment about “those pesky FAA clearances”, our vehicle faces only standard regulatory hurdles passed by hundreds of small aircraft manufacturers when compared to that of the poor “Skycar” [sic]. Can you imagine what your neighbor taking off in an 8 engine VTOL jet aircraft would sound like at 7 in the morning as he heads to work? It would sound a lot like an 8 engine jet aircraft taking off in your bedroom. i.e. LOUD This is not something the FAA is about to clear for any populated areas any time soon. Therefore, the misleading idea that you will be seeing these vehicles parked in garages any day now is quite silly, and detrimental to the general public’s concept of “Flying Cars”.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I understand that even photos of our vehicle will be unconvincing, so we will respect your decision. We will wait a month or so, and once enough press has been generated, we’ll revive the article. Until then, thank you for your time and consideration.<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcktsRGr8_0389.html" title="User:RcktsRGr8">Danny</a> 17:31, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you have a very good grasp of the issue, Danny. Once there are some verifiable external sources available that discuss the FSC-1, such as an article in the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experimental_Aircraft_Association_f8fd.html" title="Experimental Aircraft Association">Experimental Aircraft Association</a> magazine, as might be gotten at Oshkosh, I think clearly this can be revisited and a neutral, dispassionate article written on the aircraft. The problem is that right now, all we have is speculation and your company's claims - which, while undoubtedly made in good faith, cannot be taken at face value by a dispassionate encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 21:25, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No such thing, actually.</p>
<p>There are two incidents in this short article that don't justify having a whole entry for them.</p>
<p>The first one (the bombing of the USS Liberty) was not a terror attack. It was an army operation, either made by mistake (as I believe) or deliberately. In any case, it does not qualify as an act of terrorism.</p>
<p>The second, an amateur operation in Egypt with no casualties and negligible damage, <i>was</i> a terror attack, but not against the United States as the title suggests. It was a controversial operation with most Israeli population being against it, and surely was not "state terrorism" or on the same scale as other acts of terrorism. In any case, it has <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lavon_Affair_0357.html" title="Lavon Affair">its own article</a>.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 11:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Rename</b> <i>Teorrorism</i> tends to be stronlgy POV except for those groups who openly use the word to describe their own actions. I still think the article is notable, and it makes sense to have a short article that 1) mentions the Liberty and the Lavon events, and 2) which could include other similar events that people want to write about. As for the Lavon operation, Gabi calls it <i>amateur</i> but that term's quite ambiguous. <i>Amatuerish</i> perhaps, but it was directed (according to the article) by a colonel in the army who was head of military intelligence: that sounds quite professional to me. Also an attack on USIA libraries was probably an attack against property in US diplomatic compounds and, hence, an attack on what was technically US territory. Gabi rightly points out that this is hardly the same scale of many other acts of terrorism, but it does seem to be an example of state-supported terrorism (on a small scale) against the US. As a title, how about <i>Israeli Attacks on the United States</i>? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 13:50, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Although I would point out that the second incident is, from the details of the article, 1) not an amateur operation, but directed by state intelligence services 2) indeed a state-sponsored terrorist attack targetting US government targets. There may have been no casualties, but that's beside the point - the essential goal of terrorism is to promote an atmosphere of terror, not necessarily to inflict casualties (for instance the 1996 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_04d7.html" title="Provisional IRA">Provisional IRA</a>] bombing of London's <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canary_Wharf_b1fa.html" title="Canary Wharf">Canary Wharf</a> financial centre was not intended to inflict casualties but to cause maximum economic damage and uncertainty, and to symbolize the end of a ceasefire<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/10/newsid_2539000/2539265.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/10/newsid_2539000/2539265.stm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>; but it's still considered a major terrorist attack). Unless the article is factually wrong, I'm not sure where Gabi S. is getting his impression of the attack from <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:02, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>for non-NPOV. The two incidents, while very interesting historical events, have their own detailed articles so grouping them under this headline can only be to make some kind of political or moral (or other) point. That said, while I do believe this should be deleted, the noms arguments are themselves non-NPOV (and yes, my saying that is also non-NPOV...). Disagreeing with the premise of an article does not mean it gets deleted. It's kept or deleted based on the value (or lack thereof) of the article itself. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename &amp; Keep</b> I think the list has considerable value, as much as those that show per capita income in $PPP, for example. It also has notability: globalization, concentration, networking are all very notable. I made a few changes to it to try to increase its chances of surviving. I'm not the author but just stumbled on this article while reviewing the AfD discussion. Yes, it is based on OR (original research) but then again, all articles here are going to be based, directly or indirectly, on such OR. As I understand it, they cannot BE original research but should ideally be verifiable, most often in terms of a chain of citations that lead back to OR. I added the references (but not citations) to two of Saskia Sassen's two books, each of which establishes the importance of measures/ranks like those in the article. But I think the article needs to be renamed. I chose <b>concentration of major corporatate headquarters</b> for my intro, which I think is a compromise between reasonable fidelity to the original title and sufficient generality for future contributions. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 14:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First up, yes I'm partisan. Ok, so both the female list and the male need attention, which is what they've been getting. They were badly thought out when they were started, long before I came to them, but they're being shaken down albeit slowly. "Horribly incomplete" is not, I contend, a justification deleting the thing, it's a reason for fulfilling its potential. And "unmaintainable" is surely a judgement call for whoever's prepared to undergo the maintenance. It takes time, and that's <i>also</i> what it's been getting. I both have a useful <i>aide memoire</i> and cross-reference (otherwise clearly wouldn't have waste time on them). I would have thought that this is exactly the organic process that WP thrives on. I do have an issue with the inclusion of selected portraits which have recently appeared (along similar policy lines of not embellishing disambiguation pages). <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 15:31, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You can't be serious. Perhaps I should elaborate:
<dl>
<dd>"Horribly incomplete" means "this article only lists a minor fraction of the male singers who already have Wikipedia articles. Not to mention the fact that there are scores upon scores of male singers who don't yet have Wikipedia articles, but should because of notability. Therefore, the list is grossly incomplete."</dd>
<dd>"Highly unmaintainable" means "it goes against the logic of common sense to suppose that theis list will ever be anything approaching complete; it wouldn't even be able to keep up with the rate at which new articles are added ot the Wikipedia. Therefore, it is very much unmaintainable." --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 15:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> First up, yes I'm partisan. Ok, so both the female list and the male need attention, which is what they've been getting. They were badly thought out when they were started, long before I came to them, but they're being shaken down albeit slowly. "Horribly incomplete" is not, I contend, a justification deleting the thing, it's a reason for fulfilling its potential. And "unmaintainable" is surely a judgement call for whoever's prepared to undergo the maintenance. It takes time, and that's <i>also</i> what it's been getting. I both have a useful <i>aide memoire</i> and cross-reference (otherwise clearly wouldn't have waste time on them). Categories do not prvide the simple two-dimensional cross-reference that a list does. I would have thought that this is exactly the organic process that WP thrives on. I do have an issue with the inclusion of selected portraits which have recently appeared (along similar policy lines of not embellishing disambiguation pages). <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 15:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, they don't. Often a singer is only mentioned in the article on a band, and doesn't have an individual bio. If you just know the singer's name, you won't find them in a category, but may find them on this page. Wikipedia's categories are somewhat limiting (with a restricted number of entries appearing on a page at a time). Essentially, you must know the first letter(s) of the article title to be able to find the article. That's tough when you have singers working under both full names and short names. With a category, I must know if a singer "Jane Dough", with a stage name of just "Jane" is sorted in a category under "Jane" or "Dough, Jane". With a large list, I just search ("in page" with my browser) for "Jane" and find it. We can even include a person twice on a list, if its really necessary. Theoretically, of course, manually maintained lists are terrible, but categories, as currently implemented, have their own problems. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This be a non-argument - if the person has no article yet and is only part of a band article, you will likely find them there with a search (more than likely with a Google of Wikipedia at most). When a page is created for them, they can be added to the category. Even if we accept the above argument, the page is still too long. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 04:14, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The major problem here is that the concept - songs with numbers in the title - is not probvably significant; if it were a list of ballads, there would be an encyclopaedic topic to back it up, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballad.html" title="Ballad">ballad</a>; in this case there is no evident encyclopaedic significance for the concept of a song with a number in the title.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The current state of contributions to the page (inconsistent criteria or not) isn't really reason to delete the whole thing. How does this nomination differ from the previous rejected one? How is absence of a topic to backup <i>the existence of a number in a song title</i> a 'major problem' with the concept's significance? Certainly you don't need a page to tell you a song <i>you already know</i> has a number in its title, but if you need to find songs you <i>don't know</i> (or have forgotten) with a certain number in the title, this is a handy page and it would be annoying to find it removed.

<p>This is an article about the message board for the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>' fan website, and it's a kind of a mess. I don't think the website itself is particularly notable; it's obviously pretty popular, and it gets over 100 000 Google hits, the vast, vast majority of them are simply hits for the site itself, not references in other media or the like. Size does matter, but I don't think this one really meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I almost was bold and just did a redirect Denver Broncos, but first of all, I kind of anticipated a lot of argument about that so I decided to skip that and go straight for the AfD, and secondly, it seems a little untidy to redirect something that has to do with a website to an article that is not at all about the website. Anyway, in addition to all this, the article has serious POV problems, it includes weird lists and usage instructions, has a thoroughly unencyclopedic tone of voice, and is generally pretty much a mess. I'm sure it could be salvaged if the topic was noteworthy enough, but I don't think it is. Perhaps an article on the Broncos' website would be more appropriate, and the discussion boards could certainly be dealt with there, but apparently one doesn't exist at the moment. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 14:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, expand and rename</b>. I respectfully disagree. I think there's a good deal of interesting material here that's worth including - I've expanded the article accordingly. As for notability, the fact that she was married to Hubbard in the first place makes her notable - if we have articles on Joseph Smith Jr's wives (see <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._and_Polygamy_cfc6.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr. and Polygamy">Joseph Smith, Jr. and Polygamy</a>) I think that provides ample precedent for an equivalent account of Hubbard's wives' lives. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 19:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I dunno. Beyond the general theme of "Hubbard was a jerk to her" ... I'm not sure what light it sheds on anything notable. I mean, Sara Northrup Hubbard doesn't have an article, and she was much more intricately involved with the whole Dianetics/Scientology story, being one of the three world's first Clears (as opposed to one of the world's first three Clears...) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:42, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sara Northrup Hubbard <i>should</i> have an article (and I intend to do one on her next); an article on Margaret Grubb would round off the "trilogy". Her notability is, I think, really on two grounds: she was married to a notable person during a notable period in his life, and the breakdown of the marriage gives an important insight into Hubbard's character. You might also want to consider <i>why</i> you consider her a minor figure. Until Russell Miller wrote <i>Bare-Faced Messiah</i>, for which he interviewed several people who had known Grubb, virtually nothing had been published about her. She's a major figure in terms of the book (significantly more references than most of his children) and by his account she played a significant part in his life - they were married for 14 years after all. But she has been systematically omitted by Hubbard and the CoS in their respective biographical accounts. That's the real reason for her relative obscurity - they've systematically avoided talking about her. Most Scientologists probably don't know she even existed. The expanded version of this article brings together the various published sources into one article. As far as I know, that's not been done before, so I think this article also serves a useful purpose as a possibly unique biographical reference. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:34, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Although it might just be a small corner of the internet where few will dare tread you might take a sentence to look at what wikipedia currently is. It's a vast hole of information on just about anything imaginable. A veritable archive of articles, subjects, and topics.

It's one thing to delete an article on one person for being false, unsupported, or incoherent but it's quite another to delete an account of something. If this is allowed it would open up the door to many deletions as one saw fit due to opinion or other such stances. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Elsapo (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elsapo_0aa6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elsapo">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think the user above me was spot on. It appears a number of people are dismissing this article based on its superficial nature, without actually taking a look at the content. I am a regular poster at the RR message board, and with confidence I can say that many others will agree that it is one of the most unique (and controversial) forums on the internet. But that is irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>The real issue here is the sense of community. This isn't an advertisement promoting an individual, organisation or business in vain. The wiki has only existed for a couple of days, and it that time there have been large amounts of edits, contributions and expansions by a wide range of users. A good number of people are getting a significant amount of entertainment from this article, and if you actually bothered to browse it yourself, you'll more than likely find that it makes for a pretty interesting read. A lot of work has gone into producing it, and will do into the future. There is no need to delete this page just because you feel as though it isn't overly "encylopaedic". The beauty of Wikipedia is that it is very progressive, and thanks to the hard efforts of the people it is moving away from traditional textbook monotony towards the spectrum of social issues. Not only do I think this should be kept, I think Wikipedia needs more articles like this in general. Keep it. Harkonnen665 04:05, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> There are several issues here, but I don't think a "sense of community" is among them. The posters at RRMB have a community: the message board in question. There is no reason to make Wikipedia an extension of that board. I <i>have</i> read the entire article, and the contents violate several guidelines that have been in place at Wikipedia for a long time: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">website standards</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biographical article standards</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">guidelines that discourage vanity articles</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">concepts of verifiability</a> come to mind immediately. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 04:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are wiki's for several other message boards (eg, Slashdot and some others that I cant remember the name of right now), so what makes the RR article any less worthy than those? Surely if you think the 'community' thing should stay at the message board, then the articles for Slashdot etc should be deleted as well? It sounds to me like it's one rule for us, another for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in the first post here it was mentioned that each user has a detailed history, if you read the article this is clearly not the case. The majority of the members on RR are featured in the memberlist in the article, while only a handful have had a paragraph or two devoted to them. If each member decided to write their own mini-bio, then yes I would agree that this is overstepping the mark, but they haven't, and won't, so it's hardly clogging up the article. If anything, it adds to it.</p>
<p>Having said that, I would be in favour of editing the article to conform to the standards deemed acceptable, but a complete and total deletion of it is, in my opinion, unnecessary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Onikage93 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Onikage93_df7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Onikage93">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I don't see why such a fuss is being created over a relatively small article on a site booming with free data-space. As for the article not being encyclopaedic, I completely disagree. It may be a trivial article to some of you but that doesn't dispute the fact that the information provided is true on a relevant material which one may want to read about (and already many have). Some parts may include a bias, but every wikipedia page created shows bias (and history in general) as they are written by people.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You may feel that it is unimportant and it may be to you but as previously mentioned there are plenty of users who enjoy this article. It is not merely an extension of the board as discussions are not occurring on the page. And before you dismiss it as a tirade of vanity, I'd like to point out that at least two of you against keeping this page have wikipedia pages based entirely on yourselves.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Throughout history we have faced censorship from administrational authorities who furthermore decide what is relevant and what isn't. As everything is filtered, our scope of knowledge becomes tubular and we remained confined to anything that doesn't deviate from a pre-decided norm. It's silly that I even should be writing something like this for the sake of a wiki article on a message board. My point is, please try to have an open mind regarding articles such as these as otherwise the material your website allows will remained confined to the opinions of a few in a boring state of static.

<li><b>Keep</b> In relation to other message boards, the RR Message board, has a rich sense of culture, history, and ethos. It is not 'just another message board'. There could be some changes, for instance the 'RR Board Party' section appears too trival.

<li><b>Re: comment (Joyous!)</b> You can go ahead and quote the "constitution", meticulously pointing out all detailed "breeches of terms" and whatnot, and to this, quite frankly, I agree. Due to the haste with which large amounts of information were thrown on the drawing board initially, the execution of formatting and literary perspective was haphazard at times, but measures are being taken to rectify this. The only thing I firmly disagree with on your little list is the "vanity" notion (but more on this later). Today I spent a good half-hour going over the entire article with a fine-toothed comb; correcting inaccuracies, paraphrasing to convert the colloquialisms into more formal tones, and changing a few things around to ensure a strict neutral point-of-view. I believe it's pretty much within all the Wikipedia guidelines now, although once again this really is digressing from the matter at hand (as there are a lot of Wikis around that are far worse in this respect).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to expand on a point I touched on earlier (as did a few others), concerning the notability and level of prominence of the RR board. To make an abrupt assumption that it's "just another message board" is asinine. The board is very notorious and unique. As mentioned by VikingBeserk, members from a few well-known metal bands have visited the board and got themselves involved in the flame-wars and general controversy (<a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile_%28band%29.html" title="Nile (band)">Nile</a> and <a href="../../../3/6/_/36_Crazyfists_8c65.html" title="36 Crazyfists">36 Crazyfists</a> being a couple of examples), making for some memorable incidents. The other big issue is that the RR Board has absolutely no censorship, no rules or regulations, and no administration whatsoever. It's one of the only affiliated/endorsed forums on the internet to be like this (others may have limited control of content, but not zero). As a result, it's extremely controversial. The internet in general is pretty authoritarian, but RR has contained any and every racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, hateful, slanderous, threatening and foul-tasted post you could imagine. This makes it noteworthy. Some arrive on the board and find it incredibly offensive, but the view held by most of the regulars is that the concept of absolute freedom of expression is preferable. It is a hallmark of libertarianism, a protest to the "powers that be", and a very prominant example of internet anarchy. A few people have suggested that this particular article contains too much trivial information, and that's a fair argument. But, in providing a detailed description of this board as a point of reference on the wider issue, people can read into its underlying connotations and that's great for public opinion (and at the same time, it isn't biased and is not attempting to force any particular viewpoints down their throats). There are also a lot of philosophical undertones that can be referenced from examples on the Roadrunner board. However, this article is still very much unfinished, and a lot of the authors a still throwing ideas around on what information to include, where to put it and how to word it, so as to make it most appropriate for the context of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I must once again state that there is no vanity involved here. I am not promoting myself, nor are any of the other writers. Neither are we promoting ourselves as a group in general. No one has any business or commercial interents here. The point of this article is, a) to provide information on the board's history and major events, and b) to reflect on the social themes as a whole, and tie it all in to the themes of the bigger picture, so casual readers can get more out of it than just a giggle at the amusing anecdotes.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am very impressed with the effort that has been put into the page, there is now an endnote system, defying all doubts regarding notability, verifiability, it even puts the notion of 'vanity' into context.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Fair enough, it's true that this is not a vote. If you (VikingBerserk) have any further things to state in favor of the article, you should still post them but you should probably start them with the word "Comment" instead. However, it seems to me that this article is mostly a record of personal attacks made by pseudonymous people against other pseudonymous people. There is nothing in the article about the involvement of the bands Nile or 36 Crazyfists with the message board. Also, given the wide variety of content on the Internet, I am doubtful that this message board is noteworthy merely because it has included "racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, hateful, slanderous, threatening and foul-tasted" content. I am actually surprised that more editors have not joined in to express opinions in favor of deletion. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 13:52, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Re: Metropolitan90</b> The Nile incident is a complex one to explain, so it would require its own paragraph in order to give a suitably comprehensive account.

<li>Comments like this, and your user page, indicate that you're not stepping far enough away from the subject at hand (Sonic hacks) and considering how Wikipedia works as a whole. While something may be very, very important to you, if it isn't notable enough to have been reported in the media or <i>at least</i> earn itself a massive Google index, it's just not encyclopedia worthy. This is where niche Wikis come in handy - why not find or start a Wiki devoted to video game hacking? Information like this would be much more at home there, where verifiable media sources aren't an issue. They are here, and it's only a matter of time before content like this gets purged. You should concentrate your efforts somewhere where they aren't violating guidelines and constantly in danger of deletion. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastic_editor_1eff.html" title="User:Plastic editor">relaxathon</a> 21:41, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete (and Anti-Merge)</b>: At most, it would belong - briefly - in an article about video game hacking, which itself would be a contentious Wikipedia entry. I know, if you care about Sonic the Hedghog hacking, it's quite notable. However, think of how many people care about video game emulation...now reduce that to the people concerned with Genesis emulation specifically...now the people concerned with Genesis game hacking...and so on. It's a cold way of approaching things, but you kind of have to when theres not a single verifiable media source behind it all. This doesn't even belong in the Sonic article. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastic_editor_1eff.html" title="User:Plastic editor">relaxathon</a> 00:11, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> SRB2 not only is one of the best, most bug-free and fun Sonic fan-games of them all, it's also a notable DOOM mod. The article is also updated often with good information by a large active community, so there are really no reasons for deletion. Also, do note that this game is still in production, has a fanbase which increases every day, and is a rather solid project, arguably more solid than the current status of the series it is based on, probably unlike most projects of the same kind. However, were another project to meet these circumstances, I'd see that keeping an article on it would be reasonable as well. However, I do not believe you may run across projects of this magnitude too often. -Neo Chaotikal

<li><s>"So, hey. If you give a crap about the Wikipedia entry (and you should, there's quite a lot of information on it)".

<li>We have our own Wiki for tutorials, specific information, and fancruft, so it's not like we use Wikipedia as a free host. I completely agree with Wikipedia's ideals and policies, and use the site as a reference on a regular basis. Honestly, I think the article on SRB2 kinda sucks, and needs to be reworked quite a bit, as it's accumulated a fair amount of useless garbage over time. I just don't think it should be outright deleted, as this is not a vanity article, and there is interest in the game beyond the overly vocal core fanbase. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 06:42, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Regarding <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDarkArchon_0516.html" title="User:TheDarkArchon">TheDarkArchon</a>'s post, "Sonic Robo Blast 2" is often misspelled on websites as "Sonic Robo Blaster 2", "Sonic Robot Blast 2", and similar variations. It is also often referred to by its four-digit acronym, "SRB2". A better method might be to search "SRB2" OR "Sonic Robo Blast 2", which returns 84,900 results. As the co-creator and head of this game, I could honestly care less if this Wikipedia article stayed or not - the game does not need a wiki article to be notable or popular. This article was even created without our permission by a fan of the game - we did not post this ourselves. It's fine if it stays, but we really won't care if it's gone.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This game is one of the most in-depth modifications of the DOOM engine, the only massively multiplayer and 3D Sonic fangame, and (as far as MysticEsper is concerned) has press coverage. The article itself needs to be reworked since WP:ISNOT a web guide. But out of all the fangame articles at Wikipedia, this one deserves to stay. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>&lt;Sp</sup></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><sup>e</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>ak|on|it!&gt;</sup></a> 04:54, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Was prodded as hoax and nonsense but was removed. Seems to fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as the only claim to "fame" is that "John Mac Street has many descendents, and many live in Buchanan County, Virginia. At least Three forths (3/4) of the population there are related to John Mac Street." And a question that arises from this...if this is actually real and not a hoax, does writing about one's ancestors qualify as vanity? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 15:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How so if I have many Sources for it that point out to a John Mac Street of the Second Virginia Charter of London? Also, here is a web site that points out to him, <a href="http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/vchart2.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/vchart2.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/vchart2.shtml</a>. This is no hoax, after all, its just good o'l history. And also, many people have articles that have ancestors that point to far back royalty like for say, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Conqueror_976a.html" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> but does that make it vanity? No. Also, type in a google search (with quotations) "John Streate" or "Second Virginia Charter"+"John Streate". There might not be enough searches but its the same as not having enough seaches for "1st monarch of Ireland". I don't mean to start a fight but I'm just showing you the truth.</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> - his is unforgiveable - a clear example of misrepresentation - I have NOT been trolling - I was temporarily blocked by an "admin" who has a history of having a go at me and a report will soon be filed about this. Please retract your above statement and removbe it.My problem is, as stated above, these teams are not notable - we do not need something about every team only the notable ones. This, and many others should be removed. And speedily. I still do not understand why SOMEONE was allowed to remove my speedy delete tag which was totally appropriate.

<li><b>Comment</b> No retraction. And this is not your first time. You have been on the warpath for no apparent reason and it is truly annoying. And your speedy deletion tag? It was an obsolete tag, are you shocked? If you don't believe it is an obsolete tag... look it up, it says right on the tag. The reason you didn't want a discussion was simple, you wanted another uncontested deleted page for your user page. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 06:06, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Junior "B" teams ARE notable teams. Also this is a stub, meaning it will be expanded -- I have put forth countless hours of research towards stats and history. Also, hockey is very new to the wikipedia, and more and more members are joining the Wikiproject on a daily basis... the chances of interest and further development are great. I believe that to delete this article before it has fully been written (as it is a stub) is a travesty. Let the Wikiproject do its work. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 00:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Canadian towns with a Junior B team pay a lot of attention to their teams. In the Canadian context, this is a notable team. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> 00:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> DMighton has obviously been doing a lot of research on these teams, and I believe that he deserves the chance to flesh out the article into something that is worthwhile for inclusion. While my personal preference is not to create an article unless I can expand it into something of meaningful length, the use of stubs is a long accepted practice on Wikipedia. I vote that we let the wikiproject finish its work here, then decide if there is enough to retain an individual page, or if the team articles should be merged into the league page. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As an encyclopedia, we should strive for completeness whenever possible. Some of the information is difficult to find; this does not relegate it to unnecessary. This entire discussion validates just how necessary it is to include these types of pages in Wikipedia. If users have found these stubs, it goes to show that interest has been generated in them. Furthermore, if a user has put the amount of time into this as DMighton has, then it obviously has some value. Finally, what does it hurt to put up more information than less? If the information is accurate (which I assume it is), then what is happening is that a user has spent a great deal of time locating information across many disparate sources, and this only helps the Wikipedia community. (All this from someone who doesn't have much interest personally in junior hockey, but I am aware of many others who do.) --<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermitmorningstar_2754.html" title="User:Kermitmorningstar">Kermitmorningstar</a> 03:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> mainly per Resolute but also kermitmorningstar.

<li><b>Comment</b> -perhaps "stubs" of non-notable teams should be usefied instead then? I cannot believe that so many want to retain sopmething about a non-notable team - but then when he has be calling on others to help out (as above) abd trying to sway the decision. The argument that WP should strive for completeness if untrue - it should strive to represent notability. This is non-notable and needs to be removed. It SHOULD have been speedy deleted but that tag was removed for no good reason. Robertsteadman 05:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To anyone interested, the official name of the team is the "Northern Hawks". I have chosen to STUB them as the "Thunder Bay Northern Hawks" in an attempt to dissuade confusion with college teams or any type of animal... and so on. This is a common practice in sports. Often though, you'll see the team being called: "Team Name" of "Team City"; but I was not expecting someone to AfD a simple stub. If, let's say, a user here was to search for the "Thunder Bay Northern Hawks", you would get about a tenth of the official documentation about the team that is on the net as you would if you searched the "Northern Hawks". I am looking at those search results right now. They are plentiful. I hope this clears up any confusion that may occur.

<dd><b>Additional Note to Closing Admin</b> The subject in question is a weighty one. The use of Stubs for wikiprojects and the importance of someone on the outside who does not know much on the subject at hand. Although we do not believe a person outside of the WP's reach is irrelevant... we do believe that if it will effect the long term health of the WP, that it is important. I was attempting to encourage open debate from people that this will actually matter too... nothing else. I now have the administrator with the above notice raining fire and brimstone upon me while he stands by and allows the person who raised this question to taunt me. This is perfectly ok, I can handle this. But this alleged "SPAM" was only a means to include the community inwhich this decision matters.

<li><b>Comment</b> not at all - it has nothing to do with whether I am interested or not - and I am interested in ice hockey - it has to do with notability.

That said, though he did spam, he didn't say "come and vote keep." Verbatim, from my Talk page: "Hello, a user has decided that he does not want us placing hockey stubs on Wikipedia to expand later into teams. In particular he doesn't like Junior teams... I was wondering if you could please voice your opinion." What's more, this professional hockey team is no less notable than many of the high schools we have on Wikipedia, and every one of those are kept. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasputinAXP_2a9a.html" title="User talk:RasputinAXP"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;RasputinAXP&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RasputinAXP_8e7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RasputinAXP"><small>c</small></a> 11:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Well, if you knew anything about sports, you would know that anything below major pro: NHL, MLB, or NFL; is not fulltime professional. On the other hand, most Junior teams have legal base salaries -- at all levels. Junior teams also sign players to contract, just like pro.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, I am new in this “wikipedian world”. I am the author of the Nicto page and I didn’t knew exactly how it works when I wrote the description. I apologize and I understand your concern with the deletion of this page. By doing some research on a few of our competitor, I discovered they were presenting there company on Wikipedia. So I decided to post a small description of the company I am working for. A few hours after, I noticed the “Speedy tag” on the Nicto page and I decided to start over from the beginning with a shorter description without doing any advertisement … just explaining what we do and what is the major point of differentiation between Nicto and the other companies from the Wikipedia Commercial product list. The traffic on the official Nicto web site is low because it is a new service and the web site have only been running since a few months. Can you tell me what I should do to keep the Nicto page running on Wikipedia&#160;? Write a better presentation of the company from a more neutral position&#160;? Increase the presence of Nicto on Google&#160;? Any other suggestion&#160;? Thanks
<dl>
<dd>For your company to justify an article it would require notability in some form. A popular website, lots of google traffic, major notable clients, etc. Good summary, history etc make a nice article, but wikipedia is not a collection of every piece of trivia on the planet. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:39, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Publications devoted to a notable sub-culture</i> and <i>multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media</i> that may not have an online presence or just haven't been cited yet. I am not familiar with this group, but that doesn't mean there isn't press coverage about them. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 19:14, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>No <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources have been cited, or even mentioned. Wikipedia policy is not satisfied by the possibility that <i>there might be</i> articles about them that aren't on line.

<li>I believe the nomination was not made in good faith, considering the article was submitted for deletion a mere two minutes after its creation. I am not saying articles do not need notable subjects or verifiable data, merely that not every editor new to Wikipedia has their articles completed before they post it. This article should have been tagged with a notability notice, and more time should have been given. Yes, the editor has had time now to pull together resources, but I wonder if they were scared off having been bitten so quickly. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 20:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>None of which is relevant to the fact that there is absolutely nothing to support any notability for this group. You don't get a free pass to keep a page on your unknown band just because someone nominated it too quickly. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:48, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not my band, not neccessarily the band of the editor who originated the article, either. And again, I stress that there may be a wealth of material to support notability for this band, and YES, the editor needs to provide it. But I want to add my voice to the record, and that voice is saying, TWO MINUTES?! <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 20:59, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And there's still three more days to find any "wealth of material" that may exist. If you really think there is reason to keep it, I suggest you start looking for it. Based on what I can find on this group, and what I can't find, it looks like the editor who tagged it in two minutes was right. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:06, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No need to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">snippy</a>, and I have other articles I am working on, so NO, I'm not going to research on Crackfiller.

<ul>
<li>Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. I hate to say it but sometimes, with articles like this, two minutes is enough. That's long enough to try a google search, find nothing but myspace.com, and draw some conclusions. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 22:03, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> (vote transfered to more recent comment) it is referenced in 60+ articles on the Wikipedia. The LFS site (which is non-commercial) as a whole attracts 25K page views a date with the wipipedia making up 6K of those. Alexa.com is OK for ranking the major sites but not relaible for medium sized sites as it has a limited reach with it’s toolbar so a small change in site visitors can represent a huge change in Alexa rating. Alternate sexuality has a large presence on the Wikipedia, supports this and provides a useful complementary service. It also published its own orginal articles and does not only republish Wikipedia stuff. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 22:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm. I'd contest that assertion - there's no real indication that this "Informed Consent" site qualifies as a <i>well-known newspaper, publisher or broadcaster</i>. I understand what is meant by that is more in the way of traditional mainstream media outlets. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Within the BDSM community Informed Consent is a highly regarded and popular website dealing with serious issues about the lifestyle. Also, this is alternative sexuality we are talking about. I would think it highly unlikely that the New York Times would ever run a major feature on bondage safety and then cite the Wipipedia as a source&#160;:-) You have to look for notability with the the community who will make use of the the knowledge. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 16:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You could create the article Informed Consent (website), then - with proof of notability, as required per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As it is, we have only assertions regarding the notability of either site - but what we need are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. And, no, we do not look for notability in an arbitrarily defined "community" - everything would be notable, then, depending on the definition of the community. We look for encyclopedic knowledge notable to the world at large, as measured by, again, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</dd>
<dd>Forgive me if I am making an unwarrented assumption but I assume you have very little personal experience of the BDSM lifestyle or its resources. Surely it should be for editors with knowledge in this area to pass judgement on if a site is notable. The fact that Informed Consent is in the top 15,000 sites on the web should at the very least make it a serious canditate. You seem to be rejecting it without giving it a fair consideration. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 23:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Final Thought: I can understand the basis for wanting to delete this article. As has been stated, the Wikipedia is not a repository for every scrap of informtion however obscure, there needs to be a standard by which articles can be considered of sufficient merit for inclusion. If not then the Wikipedia risks drowning in a sea of trivia. The advantage of specialist Wikis like the Wipipedia is that they provide a repository for articles which, while being relevent to the community to which they apply, would not otherwise be considered notible enough for inclusion in the main Wikipedia. If they are to fulfill this function then people should be aware of their existance and links should be fostered between the Wikipedia and the specialist wikis. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 08:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I understand your point, too, but it's not the purpose of Wikipedia to foster the growth or success of external content providers, regardless of whether or not they are also wikis, and regardless of their content. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for advertisement. However, a mention of Wipipedia in an article on specialist wikis might be quite appropriate, and we could even redirect the "Wipipedia" link there. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the key issue is is the wikipedia making a valid contributon to the BDSM store of knowledge. If the wider audience feels that it is then commonsense might suggest that background article about the Wipipedia would be a legitimate entry on the Wikipeda. I think your point about being part of a wider article on specialist wikis is a valid one but would it be as much help to those readers wanting to exploring the BDSM subject matter? I think the rules need to be applied with a degree of flexibility. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 16:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The issue here is not whether Wikipedia is contributing (or ought to contribute) to BDSM knowledge. The issue is only whether Wipipedia is notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as attested by reliable sources. BDSM knowledge, or any knowledge for that matter, is not furthered by Wikipedia becoming an accumulation of non-notable trivia. Please understand, we do have to look at it that narrowly - otherwise any random accumulation of bytes is worth keeping as being somehow interesting or useful to someone. We, however, <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W">are a general encyclopedia</a>, and no more. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 19:03, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You would not ask a non mathamatician if a mathamatical site was notable, the 'community' of mathamaticians would have to make that call. Within the sphere of BDSM you would be hard pressed to find a more non trivial site than Informed Consent with comparable reach. I accept that it does not have the same gravitas as Nature or the Times, but again this is AltSex we are talking about, if you applied the same rigour to the body of work on the topic as you are applying to this article you would loose 90% of the content and Wikipedia (in my opinion) would be the poorer for it. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 07:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, sort of. There's two schools of thought about making a bolded <i>recommendation</i> in your nomination. One is that it's silly, encourages poor nominations, makes the nominator look a bit of a twit, and most importantly, earns the Official Fuddlemark Stamp of Disapproval. The other school says "well, I saw a newbie do it the other day, why shouldn't I?". I know the latter argument is a powerful one; it's the primary reason behind the celebrated Chinese Whispers Method of Policy Creation. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 12:10, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is clear that these arguments are not valid, stating that in your humble whatever the students should spend the holiday writing is not an argument about the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> despite ackoz's insistent dissent, there is no notability asserted, and the facts asserted are not verified or sources provided. How can a 50+ only production run of DVDs raise the profile of this event sufficiently for it to deserve its own page? If and when this does happen, it can be recreated. As at the moment, this is a localised and non-notable school ritual that does not belong here. More people got on my train this morning than have attended this event in its existence by the admission of the editors, but I don't create the page Travelling from Nerang to Robina Station on QR CityTrain service UG06 every morning, do I? For it is as equally a non-notable event. I earnestly wish you every success in promoting your event, but come back when you have succeeded.

<li><b>Yeah, Strong Keep</b>, I find it ironic that if this gets deleted for Toews not being notable enough, then a day or two after it is deleted he then becomes notable because of the draft. It'd save everyone a hassle if this is kept, just because it'll be re-created anyways on Saturday or Sunday by someone. Teterenko!

<li><b>Comment</b> No offense taken. What I like about the AfD process, is that it is a relatively reliable way of finding out the notability and importance of a person. If I suspect vanity, I often aggressively pursue deletion. As in this case, articles where the subject has legitimate merit have more than the original creator to defend them. Such articles get kept, while the trash is deleted. The system works. &#160;:) Also, <a href="../../../h/e/y/WP%7EHEY_63b4.html" title="WP:HEY">WP:HEY</a>. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 02:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>It does not comply with WP:NOR and WP:V because it assumes many things to be to be "cultural references". While it may seem obvious, we don't know for sure what the writers intended. There needs to be a source that says "this was intended as a reference to..." or some such.</li>

Rough Trade is probably THE most noteworthy British indie label. "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable", this holds true as well.

<li>IPs should not vote in AfD debates. The first point makes no sense - we simply believe that "The 1990s" is a likely search term for the decade and we wouldn't want people searching for that to come up with some Scottish band they've probably never heard of, especially if they don't care for rock music.

There is a partial consensus that <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a> is for "legitmate, debatable" opposition to the doctrines, practices and actions of the Catholic Church whereas <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a> was to be for the more "rabid, irrational" hatred of the Catholic Church "along the lines of anti-Semitism".

<p>Generally it looks as if the "Anti-.." articles deals with <i><a href="../../../b/i/a/Bias.html" title="Bias">bias</a> against a religion.</i> (Cartoons depicting stereotypes would be appropriate in such an article, IMO, as would any expression of irrational, emotional feelings.)</p>
<p>The "Criticism of.." articles (should!) examine the more scholarly criticism of a religion through the ages. What other (religious) scholars write about Judaism would be very relevant and appropriate in this article. <a href="../../../h/s/h/User%7EHshhh%2C_I%C2%B4m_not_really_here_da16.html" title="User:Hshhh, I´m not really here">Hshhh, I´m not really here</a> 19:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. Generic mullahs ranting against the 'Jews' or Falwell ranting against the Muslims would be addressed in the 'anti' articles. Scholarly criticism of particular religions should go in the 'criticism' articles. Since religions make such broad (and frequently exclusive) claims on the human experience, it is all the more important that good-faith criticism of them not be stifled. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 20:35, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think <i>Criticism of</i> for any major religion is a lame concept. Any religion that's been around for a thousand years has its theological ducks in a row. All the criticism boils down to hateful nonsense, misunderstanding, or a different set of pre-logical choices. Parcel out the content to the appropriate articles, redirect the title to wherever; maybe to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, or maybe we should just have one page, Criticism of other people's beliefs. And yes, I do support this approach for all the other <i>Criticism of...</i> pages.

<li>Tom, why criticism, by nature, is a bad thing? Some criticisms can be quite helpful (but not all of them of course). All our progress is because of criticisms. But aside this, the articles like "criticism of ..." save many people's time who are trying to find such unbiased religous dialog. And also, it is a reality after all. Tom , I believe our understanding of a religon will not become complete unless we see how people have criticized it. There is a lot of hateful nonsense, misunderstanding there. True! But there is a positive side to the matter as well. Some people criticize another religon to satify their own hateful feelings. But there are some who are willing to hear the criticisms just to make life happier for themselves and others. <i>As long as a page supports conversation among people from different religons, I will strongly support it.</i> All this world needs is a place in which people <i>talk to each other</i> and share their view points with each other. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:45, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Writing such an article could be a great exercise for the writers. The replies to the criticisms would be the best part. It might also be an effective format for the presentation of basic facts about each religion. Although they all have answers, I guess rational criticisms do exist; and different people will be persuaded by different answers to those criticisms. I guess I can imagine how high-quality articles like what you describe could add a lot to our coverage of religion. I have doubts about our ability to do that here, but I think your approach, deleting most of it and starting over, is a legitimate way to go. If not that, maybe it could start as a section, <i>Replies to common criticisms</i>. It could lead to good results. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 01:39, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Besides you haven’t exactly assumed good faith towards the original creator of the article who created this article as a stub, <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a>… and why he created it… as seen above.
<dl>
<dd>I fail to see how I've assumed bad faith regarding the creator of the article or the reasons why he created it. (You can see from the article's talkpage that I think the rationale was fundamentally flawed, but that's a very different thing from a failure to assume good faith.) As far as your desire for "outside input", I'm not exactly certain to what you might be referring. "As seen above"? Please provide a relevant diff that supports your point. Regarding your apparently completely unrelated "point", what does this have to do with Macedonian or Greek biases? The assertion that Jews are inherently biased against an article entitled "Criticism of Judaism" is perhaps <i>understandable</i>, but without actual evidence, <i>saying</i> Jews are biased is at least a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, if not bordering on a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 03:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b>. While the article as it is is quite laughable, other major religions have a criticism article and this one should probably have to.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b>. Arguments that such articles shouldn't exist because they are inherently POV are pure politically correct nonsense. There is nothing special about any religion per se that makes it immune to notable criticism, and once there is enough notable criticism of a subject, it deserves at first a Wikipedia section in the main subject article, and eventually perhaps a separate article. Me and Aminz have been busting our asses lately making <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a> informative and NPOV, for example. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 17:37, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's a valid argument to make. One may argue that there is not yet enough criticism to warrant a separate article, or that perhaps the criticisms should better be incorporated as pieces into other articles. What I'm objecting to is the argument that 'criticism' articles are wrong on principle. An article 'Criticism of X' is no more pushing a POV than is the 'X' main article pushing the POV of X. The only thing that an article named 'Criticism of X' is advocating is the fact that there is enough notable criticism of X to warrant a discussion of it. That's all. In this particular case I find it extremely hard to believe that over almost 4000 years of history there has not yet been generated enough notable criticism of Judaism to warrant an article on it, which is why I think that despite the article currently being mostly a stub it deserves a chance to live. (And yes, I am talking about good-faith criticism, not anti-semitic garbage). - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 04:58, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just want to point out that while there are some citations, as of right now the article says almost nothing. In an apparent effort to whittle it down to statements that approach "scholarly criticism, it has been reduced to eight sentences, and they aren't very long sentences.

<p>The majority of the symbols are chineese, and unreadable on English computers without additional language packs, so placing this on en.wikipedia is pointless. Not to mention the majority of the links no longer work. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt.Hoy_37b1.html" title="User:Matt.Hoy">Matt</a> 00:01, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, they're transliterated too, though. At most just get rid of the Chinese characters. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 00:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Actually the Chinese is in only 2 of the 5 columns, and a good number of cells in these two columns are empty. I'd guess that no more than 25-30% of the words on this page are in Chinese characters. In each case, there are two differnt transcriptions of the Chinese characters. I'm not sure if it's the case that many links no longer work or if they don't yet work. I know that Wiki policy discourages the creation of red (empty) links but they can serve a purpose of guiding editors to write articles for these as yet uncovered topics. The page needs work, but rather than delete it, I'd favor letting people continue to work on, and through, it. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 00:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't have the problem described by the nominator. As my computer is not made in England (it is assembled in Sweden from parts made in Japan and Taiwan), it is capable of accepting additional language packs. (Comment to Interlingua: As far as I know, Wiki policy does not discourage the creation of red (empty) links when they lead to notable topics that should be covered.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 10:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's standard practice to write names written in non-Roman scripts in both their romanized and native forms. The list is readable without them, but they should absolutely not be removed if the article is kept. I'm not a big list fan, but it's a notable subject. If there <i>were</i> a reason to delete this article, it'd be that there are probably millions of Chinese painters. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></a> 14:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful reference. Wikipedia is supposed to be a reference, right? This list makes it easy to find articles on painters. If you're looking for a Ming Dynasty painter and you can't spell the name, you can search this list and browse for the right one. It makes the encyclopedia easy to use. Readers who care about the Chinese characters will have them installed, and readers who don't care can ignore them and click the link to get to the article (when one is created). Please note that Wikipedia does not require all links to be blue (although to reach featured status, as on article in a thousand does, it might be necessary). <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 15:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
