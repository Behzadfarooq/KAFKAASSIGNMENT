<li><b>Strong keep</b> What makes Agnes Broun notable is the enormity of Burns' place in Scottish culture. She's not just the mother of any old poet. Burns is the poet of a nation. Agnes Broun may not be on the level of John Shakespeare, but from a reseacher's and literary scholar's point of view, her story is a valuable side-note, a fact confirmed by the archival interest in her life. For the record, I am not related to Agnes Broun. Finally, because of Burns' demi-god status, Agnes Broun has become a folk figure.--<a href="../../../w/b/r/User%7EWbroun_9d2a.html" title="User:Wbroun">Wbroun</a> 06:50, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>She <i>may</i> get through on the last one, but I just have a feeling that the majority of people out there who'll be after information on her would be happy with a paragraph or two in her son's article. As it's currently written (and I'll accept it as a work in progress) the only thing anyone could gain from reading the article is that she was Robbie's mother and outlived him - the second point of which is mildly interesting in itself. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:51, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A "paragraph or two" on the main Burns article would be digressive and, frankly, disruptive of the narrative of the poet's life. As far as the article not appealing to a majority of info-gatherers, I stand guilty as charged. The piece, which is well-supported, is aimed at Burns scholars and serious enthusiasts, those who wish to "dig deeper" than the standard Burns-o-pedia entry. --<a href="../../../w/b/r/User%7EWbroun_9d2a.html" title="User:Wbroun">Wbroun</a> 05:34, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One cannot be too surprised not to find any academic paper on Agnes Broun, esp. of those listed on Google scholar search. She will always be a minor figure of literary history and folklore, not the sort of person on which academic careers are built. Still, those academics and lay-scholars wanting to learn more about Burns will find joy and interest in learning more about his mother. If not on Wiki, where else? It's a little hard to grasp why one would want to suppress such information, tho I am totally new to Wiki, so I probably am misunderstanding some aspect of protocol.--<a href="../../../w/b/r/User%7EWbroun_9d2a.html" title="User:Wbroun">Wbroun</a> 05:44, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps the best place to put information on her is into an article on her son at the moment. There are other examples of historical figures with peripherally interesting family members having their biographies expanded with information on the family member. That way the information itself remains "unsuppressed". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I hear you, but I respectfully disagree. Some of the info would certainly work in Robbie's article, but much of it just doesn't fit. There is a great spectrum of notability, and Agnes is on the lighter side, but Burns' scholars and enthustiasts will take interest nonetheless in these small gems. Anyway, I don't want to repeat myself and wear out my welcome -- I think I've said all I can in this debate. I appreciate people's interest in Burns and his family.--<a href="../../../w/b/r/User%7EWbroun_9d2a.html" title="User:Wbroun">Wbroun</a> 08:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>—<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> is not a formal policy, and the concept of notability is always contentious. A fair test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without original research. Am comfortable that this meets the criterion. That the article's author may be related does not invalidate the material; it only invites closer scrutiny. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 05:16, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
