<p><b>Delete</b>. Three reasons - first, I can find no evidence that the term 'slow glass' is commonly used in scientific literature as a name for BEC. The physics categorisation is therefore invalid. Secondly, the article is currently inaccurate. The concept of slow glass was specifically not that of a BEC - rather, it was a real piece of glass through which photons travelled by a spiral trajectory, increasing the distance they had to go. Thirdly, I don't think a device in a short story really needs an article of its own, especially when the entry for the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Light_of_Other_Days_b05c.html" title="The Light of Other Days">short story itself</a> is only a one-liner disambig.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 21:45, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but drastically rewrite. <i>If</i> the term is being used for a BEC, then this nickname has come about because of Shaw's stories (plural), not the other way round. The concept of slow glass is widely used in science fiction. For the record, the novel "Other days, other eyes" was based on four different slow glass stories ("The light of other days", "Burden of Proof", "A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass" and "Other days, other eyes"), and a later novel by Arthur C Clarke and Stephen baxter (also confusingly titled "The light of other days") also made use of the concept, as have Marvel Comics (with "Sandson O.

<li><b>Delete</b>. An associate professor with a few publications is not notable. There are thousands of these people--and yes, thousands more who are deceased. Also, since obscure academic publication is a requirement for an academic job, using publication as a "reason" for "notability" is a tautalogical argument. It's like saying a dog is notable for barking. C W Merchant 18:50, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Question just how much input did Ahn and Hopper have in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captcha.html" title="Captcha">captcha</a> project?

<li><b>Delete</b>. His website lists one journal paper that has merely been submitted, rather than accepted. Being published isn't adequate, being significantly published with papers that are attracting a high number of citations is the requirement. If you're judging on journal publications, I'd require a fairly hefty number of papers or citations - say 50 journal papers or one (as first author) with 100 citations as a minimum to consider being published (note, this is from a physics viewpoint, other subject areas may vary). Although even this can be well surpassed - one professor I've co-authored papers with has over 3000 papers to his name. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 20:55, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having read your user page, you are an inclusionist, and I accept that. The section here is not aimed to be POV, in fact, it was merely me writing what I believe to be true. An anonymous user creating numerous subpages about a small-scale college is not Wikipedia, because it doesn't add anything. I would be fine with this info being included on the main <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walla_Walla_College_34eb.html" title="Walla Walla College">Walla Walla College</a> article page, but the anon doesn't believe that should happen.

<dd>Yes, it is (for the moment) an emdash in the title, the problem being that hyphens and emdashes have distinct meaning and usage in the name of electoral districts (<i>i.e.</i> St-Henri—St-Denis).

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Real places, most contemporary ones with well over 100,000 people, but almost all within or overlapping other geographic divisions. Articles on Canadian members of parliament will link to a description of where they're from, and you simply can't describe every riding in detail this way. Btw, I've also seen many British parliamentary districts appearing on Newpages lately. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 03:29, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Riding articles are important and will be expanded to show voting results from former federal elections, issues, history, and demographics.

<li>"Somebody" (actually a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_UK_Parliament_constituencies_d271.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject UK Parliament constituencies">whole Wikiproject</a>'s worth of people) created separate articles for every United Kingdom parliamentary constituency, past and present.

<li>Delete: Yes, we should wait for neologisms. Why? Verification. It's easy to get Google hits overnight with a term that few people are using. However, the best thing is to see usage.

<li>It takes only a simple majority or three people to get an article undeleted. The undeletion policy hinges upon the deletion policy. Articles are deleted by the deletion policy, and they are only kept by the deletion policy. In other words, no article's value has ever been or ever will be proven by the fact that it was able to get undeleted. —<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrockert_5ba4.html" title="User:Brockert">Ben Brockert</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrockert_bf66.html" title="User talk:Brockert">(42)</a> <small><small><a href="http://usufructer.livejournal.com/" class="external text" title="http://usufructer.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">UE News</a></small></small> 03:00, May 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. It's only a stub rather than a substub because it waffles (its age is vague, that it's been used as a polling station is true of thousands of schools, so is not significant). The article essentially says: "The <b>Mahajana High School</b> is a school in Erode"; that just about qualifies it for speedy deletion. The support for undeletion was based largely on the fact that it was speedily deleted in error (<i>mea culpa</i>), so was procedural not substantive. The claim that most schools are notable is an odd one, but even if I accepted it, there's no indication that this school is one of that majority. If just one of the people who think that it should be kept would actually add some information, then I'd be convinced, and change my vote. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:45, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. That it's a stub is evident, because it correctly identifies the location of the school. The bit about it's supposed age is indeed waffle, but that's not relevant to whether the article is a good school stub--that is to say, an article that defines its subject matter well enough to be expandable by someone who has information about the subject. The claim that undeletion was merely procedural is a falsehood; there was no consensus that the article was deletable in the last vote, it was speedied because someone claimed falsely that no such school existed under that name, and the admin who performed the deletion failed to check that this claim was true.</li>
<li>Finally the statement that an article consisting of "Mahajana High School is a school in Erode" would qualify for speedy deletion is absolutely false. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:55, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

It was speedied <i>because it was a redirect</i>, and the undeletion <i>was</i> a procedural one because it was a redirect with editing history and speedied by mistake.

<li>Nitpicking. Because of your false claim it was redirected to Erode and then deleted. In essence, the article was mugged.

I still consider the blanket claim that all schools are notable to be absurd, and this school seems to be an ordinary, common-or-garden, bog-standard school of interest to no-one but the local community — but there's enough in the article to raise it above the substub/stub that it was. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:40, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment - sneering at people whose first language is not English for a miss-spelling is beneath contempt. The issue is whether we can verify the school's existence, which I can with reference to this electoral site and I have referenced the verification for the benefit of other Wikipedians. I did not write the site and am not responsible for the spelling errors contained within. I did not need a street address, I needed to establish whether there was such a high school in Erode - for my purposes this web reference attests to that fact and also the content of the article referring to the use of the school as a polling booth. There is now a more adequate reference with <i>The Hindu</i> article referred to on the school's wikipedia page. That there are two addresses does not phase me, many institutions operate out of more than one site - for example <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avans_Hogescholen_306c.html" title="Avans Hogescholen">Avans Hogescholen</a>. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 08:54, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How much more time do you need? It's been around since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">11-02</a> and twice had the attentions of people who have actively tried to expand it. The first time, the article actually <i>shrunk to nothing</i>, as it was discovered that none of the information in it could be verified, not even that a school by the name <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maha_Jana_High_School_891c.html" title="Maha Jana High School">Maha Jana High School</a> existed in Erode. During the VFU discussion it was moved to a different name, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahajana_High_School_3229.html" title="Mahajana High School">Mahajana High School</a>, but so far the purported evidence that <i>that</i> school merits an article in its own right has in fact demonstrated exactly the opposite. The evidence presented for having an individual article about this school is a long list of schools used as polling stations, which actually shows that it's identical to <i>lots</i> of schools in this respect (probably hundreds of thousands, worldwide), and doesn't stand out from the crowd in any way whatever. Similarly, the ration card news article tells us that "various schools" are used as ration card distribution centres, too. The remaining minutia in the article is in fact about a person named Shri R. Soundara Rajan, and not about the school at all. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>, but the only things that are in this article are: effectively a paraphrase of its directory listing in a (clearly less than 100% reliable, given the number of glaring errors that leap from the page when reading it) list of schools used as polling stations and an paraphrase of its (implied) directory listing in a list of schools used as ration card distribution centres. As a criterion for encyclopaedia-worthiness, the trivium about people being moved into a back yard really <i>is</i> at the level that would establish the infamous shed in my back garden as encyclopaedia-worthy. I find it saddening that the level of desperation to prove a plainly unsupportable assertion has risen to such an extent that people are willing to employ criteria that actually present a significant danger of the shed in my back garden getting an article. It's amazing that <i>even when</i> the prime reference being waved around is a long list of schools about which exactly the same thing can be said, the point that large numbers of schools are identical, and intentionally so (as a matter of public policy in many countries), still seems to be missed, even when it is glaring right in one's face as here. As per <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a>, mention in <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erode.html" title="Erode">Erode</a> that schools are used as polling stations and ration card distribution centres (albeit that the former fact is so general that it could be mentioned in <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_India_0d2c.html" title="Education in India">Education in India</a>) and <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:06, 2005 May 17 (UTC)

As a freestanding article, this lacks context to explain that it is <i>about a book</i>, and it's a reasonable mistake to make to think that this is the beginnings of an actual wikibook on the history of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> (which indeed would not be an encyclopaedia article, and I suspect is what <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> thought this was).

<li>I think it is a mistake to see this as just an index. <i>Decline and Fall</i> is one of the great works of historical scholarship in Western civilization. It spans about 1500 years and runs about 2500 pages. It is not just a treatise on <i>why</i> the empire fell, it is an extremely detailed history of <i>how</i> it fell. A few paragraphs are simply not adequate to summarize this work. The comparison with the Bible is appropriate: there are pages and pages on Wikipedia about the Bible, including lists of chapters and books. I think a listing of the chapter titles of <i>Decline and Fall</i> is an efficient way to summarize the text, and also provides a very useful reference for anyone who is interested in learning more about it.--<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 03:35, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for supporting the vision of iHUB.</p>
<p>We realize that at this point we might not have enough credibility. But we are mentioned on <a href="http://www.trentu.ca/news/daily/archive/050301mankindunited.html" class="external text" title="http://www.trentu.ca/news/daily/archive/050301mankindunited.html" rel="nofollow">Trent University Daily News Page.</a> This is important, because we are acknowledged at Trent.</p>
<p>Further, I should mention that WikiPedia holds articles not only about organizations. For example take any existing word. “iHUB” was not mentioned anywhere in WikiPedia before.</p>
<p><i>WikiPedia is described by its founder Jimmy Wales as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language."</i> Our organization is not a fraud, but a grassroots effort, which sooner or later works and achieves its objectives. Therefore, <b>it IS worthwhile mentioning in this great project</b>. On YOUR decisions will depend how fast we will be able to spread our message across and make a change. --IHUB.org Founder 06:42, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

If you have a look around, you'll notice that precious few forums are notable enough to be included in the wikipedia.

<p>Under current title the article has incurable problems with POV. The claim that all territories which were part of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the first half of the 20th century, but are not part of those countries now, are to be considered occupied territories is highly controversial to say the least. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 17:11, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well the territorial expansion did happen, and it is mentioned on the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Empire_c5a6.html" title="Soviet Empire">Soviet Empire</a> page. So perhaps <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Empire_c5a6.html" title="Soviet Empire">Soviet Empire</a> should be expanded to include acquisitions during the same time frame? I'll vote to <b>Merge</b> there with no redirect, along with suitable editing for neutrality. (There are plenty of other Russian border states that lost territory, in addition to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. So those could be covered in more detail as well.) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 17:23, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>But Estonia could not have lost territory to Russia because it was not a country that could lose any territory. Until Bolsheviks, it did not exist or existed merely as a geographical concept (no encyclopedia or any source define Estonia as a country until 1920s. Pre WWI Encyclopedia Britannica has no entry on this non-country country). The question of territorial loss or gain or of occupation or annexation is of irrelevance if other, fully legitimate viewpoints are to be considered.</p>
<p>In essence - the Estonian ethnocratic state claims that it is miraculous reincarnation of the ethnofascist dictatorship named Estonia or Estonian Republic between its recognition by Bolsheviks and the grant of independence by Gorbachev in 1991. Now only from this totally preposterous standpoint can one claim that Estonia (or Latvia) was occuppied or any territory gained. Even if the USA supported that claim during the Cold War for obvious political reasons the claim, the claim is fairly preposterous.</p>
<p>The current Russian Federation official view is that Estonia is a brand new entity that emerged from the Soviet Union - hence its borders are the borders of Estonian Soviet Republic. The case closed.</p>
<p>The third point (the one I adhere to) that the overthrow of Russian Republic by the Bolsheviks in 1917 was illegal (and the Russia's Council of State issued its last proclamation to that regard) and all treaties concerned border changes therefrom are illegal since the parties who signed them had no authority to do so. Hence Estonia or Latvia are illegitmate statelets, illegal today as they were 1920s. Those statelets could not have lost any territory since there was none to lose. Territory of Estonia is two Russian provinces or governments (Estland, Estlandia or Esthonia - <a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Esthonia" class="external free" title="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Esthonia" rel="nofollow">http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Esthonia</a> and the northern portion of Livlandia or Livonia - <a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Livonia" class="external free" title="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Livonia" rel="nofollow">http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Livonia</a>). The only treaty that can possibly govern Russia's relations with those provinces is that of the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. Occupation of Estonia and Latvia by the USSR is hence an annexation of own territory by less than legitimate entity. Unfortunately this viewpoint is not shared by the current Russian administration because they can't - they would have to carry out restitution inside Russia and de-privatize a humongous number of assets if they recognized the fact that 1991 was not a fresh beginning as they claim.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> seems to be like a vfd to prove a point maybe. I myself suggested in the discution that the rename might be needed. However, the subject itself is encyclopedic, there are really territories which were part of Baltic States during interwar, but were detached from their Soviet Socialist Republics when they got occupied by Russia, and up till now these territories causes certain troubles, e.g. certain people protests against recognising them as part of Russia; this owas the main reason why the Latvian-Russian border treaty wasn't ratified recently, as <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Putin_50b8.html" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> himself said (he said that treaty would be ratified in case Latvians would drop "claims which does not correspond to European spirit"; Latvians required to put into the document that the document is based on the interwar boundary treaty, adn the interwar boundary treaty between Russia and Latvia included <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrene_region.html" title="Abrene region">Abrene region</a> as part of Latvia. In Estonia same things exists too with Petseri region and the East Coast of Narva. In Estonia even the maps are frequently drawn to mark these territories as occupied Estonian lands (type "Eesti" in google and see pictures, many maps will be like that). In Lithuania the situation is that government refused all claims to such territories which were claimed in the interwar. The article is a very good way to compare the stance towards these lost territories in all three countries; as the reasons for loosing them and situations were similar. Also, it is at the same time as the list of those territories with links to their respective artciles; so person who needs this infor but does not know well what territories of Baltic States were lost, could see this to get the info (as there are links back from the articles baout the respective territories to this article). BTW, to all who does not know the history of region too well, all Baltic States were occupied by Soviet Union for the firts time in start of WW2, and for the second time at the end of WW2, and the detaching of territories happened during first years of occupation in all cases (I mean, each of the Baltic States was made into an Soviet Socialist Republic, part of USSR, while these territories, despite of being part of independent states previously, were attached to other Soviet Socialist Republics instead; after indeependence was redeclared in 1990/1991 therefore these territories did not became part of Baltic States again). During the interwar period, all three countries were independent states for whole period.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 17:33, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Vilnius wasn't Lithuanian at the start of century but was Lithuanian once (before XVII age), territory of Lithuanian nation retrated over the time because Old Byelorussian at first and then Polish were written official languages and so people in cities started to learn them and even speak as native, same happened e.g. in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> with English changing Irish. But however, this does not matters, the fact is the fact that all the regions mentioned in article belonged to the said countries during interwar (at least for some time, and these borders were officially defined). Interwar was already tiime of national states, and current Baltic States, at least officially, are the same states as they were iinterwar (officially the independence ws not declared, but restated: i.e. this was similar to e.g. France regaining independence after WW2; that's why in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a> articles we have two indepndence days). What happened in medieval when there were no national countries and such is one thing, what happened in the interwar is another. If you say nationality is the onkly important thing than e.g. Anschluss was right too and such. Anyways, this article is eligible about an eligible subject. If you want to add info about more point of views, feel free to do so but that is no reason for deletion.

<dd>My reason for deletion is an arbitrary grouping three states into one. I suspect, to make losses more impressive.

<dd>Because, it is not only history. As I said, both in Estonia and (especially) Latvia this place it's role in politics, relations with Russia. the situations of all the lost lands were practically the same, detached by same power at similar time at same circumstances. In all cases states reconises themselves to be same states as were in the interwar, and all what occupational governemnt done is considered to be against laws as they according to this view had no right for that. In Lithuania the role in politics is less of course, but still because everything happened under same circumstances, it is an eligible comparement. Sam eyou could write e.g. an article on Changes of state boundaries because of WW2 in Europe - would be an encyclopedic subject, even though it includes only European countries.</dd>

<dd>Also, territorial loss differs from territorial loss; in some cases, as in this one, it is done by occupying power and was done quite recently. In medieval period when everybody was grabbing lands and such is another thing. Also in this case the mentioned territories are important now too; I understand that some people might find terirtorial claims in general to be stupid for one reason or another, or territorial disputes and such, but that does not makes them any less encyclopedic. And there are many articles about not exactly claimed territories which some people imagines as independent state or as part of another state, e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_New_Africa_e279.html" title="Republic of New Africa">Republic of New Africa</a>.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 08:55, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. Lithuanian part needs at least improvement.

<dd>Exactly right. There is considerable contrast between the treatment of border issues in Lithuania as opposed to in Latvia and Estonia. In a nutshell, Lithuania has officially settled all border claims with its neighbours, while Latvia and Estonia still have some outstanding issues. This lumping of Lithuania with the other two countries, done by Lithuanian editors, leads me to suspect that there is a bit of a hidden agenda here, possibly subconscious. Just maybe the authors are not happy that Lithuania recognised its current borders, and so they want to talk about Lithuanian border issues in the same article as they talk about Latvian and Estonian issues. This might then create the impression that Lithuania is still claiming territories like Latvia and Estonia, which is not the case! <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 20:48, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I dislike this idea very much. Both You, booth Belarusian colleagues look at the situation very formally. Belarus is an independent sovereign state now and our treaties with Belarus couldn't be presupposed with treaties with former Soviet Union (i. e. with Russia presently, which doesn't rule this part of Vilnius region). I appeal to Lithuanians, that they shouldn't make Belaruses to increase this flush of formalities. There are many aspects of every state, not linguistic alone. When ones base the citizenship of Lithuania on being not Slavic, it's rather his idee fixe than reality. I doubt , if Belarusians don't know that census of Belarusians in Vilnius is about 1 percent only? Or that such nationality as Slaves doesn't exist? But they say all this mostly because they are offended and made to defend some ideas. But even such avoidable points are possible to be presented in more acceptable form, than it's in the present version.

<dd>I agree with you that Vilnius nor the part of region which was given back to Lithuania never had significant portion of Belarussians, it was first Lithuanian, then parts of it were polonized. As for the Eastern Vilnis region (part of Vilnius region no win Belarus), parts of it originally had Lithuanian majority, parts of it had Belorussian majority; parts of regions with both majorities were polonized later. The opinion of some nationalist Belorussians is however, that Lithuanian Great Duchy was a Belorussian creation and therefore Belarus supposedly has historical right to claim some territories which were in LGD, and especially polonized Lithuanian territories as it is easier to claim then that those are actually polonized Belarussian territories, because Belarussians were supposedly major nation of LGD. Anyways, I do not support such opinion of course, I rather said, that if this opinion is popular in Belarus (and taht is up for Belorussian wikipedians to say, I haven't been to Belarus so I don't know), it might deserve an inclusion as an <i>opinion</i> not as a fact of course. Both arguements supporting it and arguemens against it would be written, I think there would be more of later, that is my opinion however. There are many such articles on opinons, e.g. about antisemitism - now it is generally agreed that Jews aren't lower than other people, but some are still antisemitic and this had influence in history, therefore there is an article about it. Same for any significant ideas; I don't know if that idea about Vilnius supposedly being occupied by Lithuania is really significant however, or just held by a bunch of Belorussian nationalists. If the it is held by a bunch of people only, it shouldn't be included, because I am sure there are various opinions, even most stupid, which are held by few people, maybe even e.g. opinion that all the world should belong to for example Russia or USA, but those do not merits articles. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 17:20, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Vilnius did not have Belarussian majority though, and parts of what is currently northwest Belarus certainly did had Lithuanian majority once (as for real information, in fact up till slavinisation (which happened due to Polish and Old Byelorussian being more prestigious languages at the time than Lithuanian) XVII age more than 50% of what is called Eastern Vilnius region was Lithuanian - I'll agree however that for example <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardinas.html" title="Gardinas">Gardinas</a>/<a href="../../../h/r/o/Hrodna.html" title="Hrodna">Hrodna</a> was not ethnically Lithuanian, at least not in XVII age, I don't have earlier information. If we count what nation lived where historically, that is where claim over that region, or at least big parts of it, might arise. As for XX age between world wars however, you are right that the region around Vilnius was not Lithuanian-speaking - however, that is just immediate region around Vilnisu, regions around <a href="../../../%C5%A1/v/e/%C5%A0ven%C4%8Dionys.html" title="Švenčionys">Švenčionys</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Druskininkai.html" title="Druskininkai">Druskininkai</a> for example were Lithuanian speaking then too, and same for some towns (Lazdūnai, Gervėčiai, Pelesa) in current day Belarus, which were russianised by Soviets and now only some old people speaks Lithuanian in the area (in 70s there were around 50,000). In other words, according to XX age situation Soviets distributed the region with some Lithuanian-spekaing enclaves getting into Belarus, and Polish-speaking areas distributed between both SSRs. However, historically Lithuanians has rights to more territories, theoretically, and has historical rights to all territories of current Lithuania, because in every territory of it once there was a majority of Lithuanian speakers). Anyways, the idea that Vilnius is occupied by Lithuania supposedly, if that is widespread, might be represented in same way: maybe you could write an article about territories which some Belarussian groups (if those are influential groups) considers should belong to their state and such (and reasons for these claims, and opinion about them of other people and various facts). Wikipedia is big, as long as it will be NPOV and tell it as an opinion with reasons instead of a fact, it is ok IMO. Same as e.g. even most radical believes such as neo-nazism are written about, and their views are given, that does not mean showever that teh article about neo-nazism is automatically neo-nazi. And this article is about Baltic States. If there is an article like "History of Europe" someone maybe say "Why this tells only about Europe?" but well, there are different articles in different scopes, you can create an article about Belarus. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 19:17, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- This article have a strong POV regarding Anti-pole, anti-german, and anti-russian sentiments. For example, the claim that <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East Prussia</a> should count as historicaly/ethnical lithuanian I found it ridicuous, since it has been under German/Prussian control for centuries and at any moment (not even in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) control of other country. Memel was annexed by Lithuania against the decition of the <i>League of Nations</i> (wich mandate a referendum that could decide the fate of the city) and taking the oportunity that the Republic of Weimar was weak. So at least in this cases, The Baltic state of Lithuania, as a independent nation, took over a territory that did not belong to it. Also, the remarks of <i>facist</i> poles only show intolerance and completely ignorance of the historical picture of the time: If we start talking about <i>historicaly/ethnical</i> territories that should be in control of their republics, then Poland has a historical claim over half of Ukraine or almost all Belarus, and almost all the baltic region. Another example (sort of out of topic, but it helps) could be the claim that Mexico should have control over Texas, Arizona and California, since it has <i>historicaly/ethnical</i> claim to have those territories. Regarding Russia, Vilnus was reestablished as the capital of the Lithuanian SSR, and I believe that the soviets manage to gave some territory to the baltics and remove some others. The USSR is now a difunct entity, and claiming those areas already under russian jurisdiction (at least in my opinion) is something that is not only wrong, but also that in some way doesn't help to heal the wounds that the USSR left. If we start creating articles like this one, then Wikipedia would be overfloded with territorial claims: My country, Peru, could label <i>Tarapaca</i> as Disputed territory with Chile, since they took it over after war or occupation. Lets walk to the futur, and individual claims (if the persistence to have them in wiki is strong) should be on their respective country. This article only shows a clearly xenofobic POV and fail to give a fair treatment to the countries accused. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 19:47, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>East part of East Prussia historically had majority of Lithuanians, that was the only thing which was said, and that zone ws not included as an occupied part of Lithuania because ethnicity is not a legitimate reason to consider it occupation, as you said yourself. And Wikipedia has to have info about past as well, not only future, and about all opinions, even radical ones. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 20:25, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That doesn't contradict the fact that Memel and most of it was under German/Prussian control for centuries (dating back even for the days of the Teutonic Order States). That the territory is under lithuanian occupation doesn't mean that IT should be in that way, that reminds me of the ill fated attempts by the Soviet Government to "sell" the idea that indeed those were slavic lands. Also, Wikipedia is a NPOV enciclopedia, and not a heaven for radicalism or extreme nationalism: your argument is wrong in that sence. About the past, Wikipedia has indeed a lot, but we must be carefully enought (and not to be fool in some cases) to prevent any attemp to rewrite it. This article clearly modify the history in favor of a group of countries, withouth looking at the hole geopolitical sphere and also disregarding the history of the other countries involved. Once again, I support delete this article. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 20:52, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Make it NPOV then. The fact is that whoever supports the opinion, it is still a valid opinion, especially in Latvian and Estonain cases where it plays even a role in politics. That nazism was a bad ideology does not means that we shouldnt write anything about it on wikipedia; your own personal believe sthat we must get over claims and look to future does not means we should ignore claims. As for the easitern part of East Prussia, it was under Lithuanian control at first, during the rule of king Mindaugas in 13th centure the order conquered it - however, yet again I will state a fact, it is not claimed in the article that eastern part of East Prussia is occupied, I know that 700 year old events aren't reason to include it there lol. It is merely explained why it is not included; this article is not about nationalist claims, that's why. It is rather about the real historical events where territories were detached by Soviets, and in 2 out of 3 countries this influences politics and foreign relations even up till now (not signing the border treaty with Russia), therefore it is significant and important IMO. POV is not reason for deletion, and anybody can edit wikipedia and make it NPOV. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 21:12, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Trying to sort out "ethnic control" of these areas is a fruitless argument: they were tremendously multi-ethnic for centuries. Eastern East Prussia (including Memel) and western Lithuania had Lithuanians, Germans, Austrians (from the Salzburg refugees of 1731) and Jews all mixed together in large quantities. The big coastal trading cities (Konigsberg, Memel) were more German, the rural areas often more Lithuanian. Go south or east and you add other nationalities as well. Some families intermarried. The Nazis destroyed the Jewish communities, some of the largest in Europe, in the Holocaust. After 1944 the Soviets (and occasionally others) started killing or moving people -- including all the Germans and Austrians -- to create neater boundaries along the lines they wanted. They imported Russians to replace the purged peoples (i.e. in East Prussia) or to "Russify" areas like the Baltics. But for centuries before that it was not relatively "neat" as it is today. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColl7_e5fb.html" title="User:Coll7">Coll7</a></dd>

<dd>If you read this article <a href="http://worldatwar.net/nations/other/memel/" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldatwar.net/nations/other/memel/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> it clearly shows that the french were in charge of the territory so a plesbicite could be realice. The fact that Lithuania used force to control the territory may imply its changes to lose it. Also, ironicaly, it was the soviet who award it once again to Lithuania. <a href="http://psychcentral.com/mwiki/index.php/Memel" class="external autonumber" title="http://psychcentral.com/mwiki/index.php/Memel" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> This is another page that talk about this.

<li>Just today Estonia and Russia finally signed a pact confirming their borders <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/05/19/017.html" class="external text" title="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/05/19/017.html" rel="nofollow">(see news story)</a>. The treaty did not change in any way the borders drawn during the Soviet times between the republics of the USSR. This means that the only Baltic country left whose borders are in any way contested is Latvia. Even there the solution is likely within a few months, with likelihood of any territory changing hands vanishingly small. In short, the case for deleting this article or at the very least renaming it just got stronger today. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 18:26, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>That is not a reason to delete this article IMO; even if Latvia would have signed it as well, this article is still about a clear fact: territories of Baltic States, which were detached during Soviet occupation. It influenced politics of Estonia and other things were for 14 years, as for Latvia, up until now. There are things like maps with those territories included and such, and in each of states the reaction towards such things is different. Historical disputed, and historical claims has a place in Wikipedia; if e.g. Pakistan, India and China would sign a treaty delimiting borders in <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmir.html" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> tomorrow, I don't think that would mean that the information about the dispute should be removed altogether from Wikipedia.

<li>What is said is true, but the articles should not be created arbitrarily. The current article must be deleted. Its content must go in two directions:
<ol>
<li>Into histories/geographies of each Baltic state.</li>
<li>Into Territorial changes of the Soviet Union. This is a very interesting topic. It includes both annexions and redistribution of territories between the Union republics. This happened not only in Baltic states. For example, <a href="../../../k/h/r/Khrushchev.html" title="Khrushchev">Khrushchev</a> gave <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimea.html" title="Crimea">Crimea</a> to <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and now it also a source of trouble. The same happened in <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus.html" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>. IMO all this deserves a single article, from a common perspective; a good addition to the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union_d6fd.html" title="Population transfer in the Soviet Union">Population transfer in the Soviet Union</a>, still another light on the internal works of this huge empire. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:59, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The comments by Mikkalai above sound sensible and even-handed to me, and I support such a <b>Merge</b>. Current text is too POV. Realistically, these areas were annexed by the Soviet Union as Stalin came back in 1939-45 for border areas they lost during the civil and ethnic wars over the breakup of Imperial and Republican Russia in 1918-21. This doesn't mean what happened wasn't unjust or accompanied by murder and ethnic cleansing, but our anger at those things can't color our discussion of the facts. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColl7_e5fb.html" title="User:Coll7">Coll7</a></dd>

<li>Maybe one such article could be made, but I still think there should be articles for each region of Soviet Union too, because the situation was different everywhere. While as for Baltic States, their respective borders were clearly defined in interwar by deals between said Baltic States and Soviet Russia, for example in Central Asia, formerly populated by nomads in many cases, boundaries between SSRs were drawn anew actually, that way including some territories of one central Asian nations to otehr antion's SSR because it was probably impossible otherwise, there are many exclaves too. In Caucasus it was another case also. Another case with Crimea too as Crimea historically was Crimean Tatar, neither Russian nor Ukrainean, it was not the case with territories mentioned in this article and such. So there should probably be such articles on these regions: Baltic States (changes compared to the recognised boundaries of interwar), Ukraine/Belarus/Moldavia (changes compared to boundaries of short lived Belarus and Ukranean states and to the Bessarabia (detached territory of Romania)), Caucassus (smaller nations attached to larger SSRs, history of Transcaucasian USSR, etc.), Central Asia (new boundaries drawn). This article should remain then as the information abot the Baltic States region IMO. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 19:57, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe that the article about the territorial changes of the USSR can be much more usefull that this one. Also, claiming that the secession of those territories definied the foreign policy of those 2 countries, I found hard to believe: territories go, territories come, that's history. And with the signing of the treaty between the Russian Federation and Estonia is a clear example that this issues are more related with the history of each country rather than for a hole region. Lithuania and Latvia must solve their own borders by their own. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 20:48, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Number of articles is not limited though, there can be several different ones as I said above, one about changes in general and others more specific ones; it is this way about many subjects and then sub-subjects. And yes it surely influenced foreign policy, Latvian-Russian border treaty wasn'tsigned exactly for the reason of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrene_region.html" title="Abrene region">Abrene region</a>. It is your personal POV that "territories come, territories go" and people shouldn't care: in fact, in the world there are many conflicts over territories, such as <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmir.html" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno_Karabagh_5337.html" title="Nagorno Karabagh">Nagorno Karabagh</a> (probably spelled incorrectly here) and so on, and also many conflicts on small areas, islands and such. All these cases are encyclopedic and has articles about them. Your POV would be good in ideal world where no countries would attack others or annex territories illegally, but currently it is clearly not the case so applying that POV it would be "the one who is the strongest has rights to territories of weaker nations in case he decides the territories should belong to him". <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 21:06, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, maybe my POV is utopic for some. but at any moment I'm implaying that it should be stated in the page. My point for using that line was that excusing some of the Lithuan/Estonian/Latvian problems on territories is totally out of the context. Also, you can't blame all those problems on the Russian Federation, in the same way that the Arab states cannot justify their backwards as fault of Israel. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 03:29, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice try, but accusing me of Nazi pages or something like that is clearly innapropiate and out of the topic. Those sites are locate in the first pages if you search for Memel in Google, and gave stadistic of Memel. As for reunited, you must refer to the Lithuanian SSR, a contituent of the USSR. Also, several history books in the US also teach that Memel was annexed unilateraly by Lithuania, a fact that even you acknowledge to "speed" the proceses. I'm not german, so those accusations of "Lies" or something, disscuss them with a german wikipedist.

<dd>National minorities inside a country doesn't mean that they should be part of their respective country: another example is the one of Azerbaiyan, wich has a considerable ammount of population in Iran northener provinces, this does not imply that they should be part of the Republic of Azerbaiyan itself.

<dd>Yes, national minorities inside country doesn't mean that they should be part of their respective country. That is why Polish actions in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> were occupation, as the eastern border of Lithuania was set by treaty. And that is the point of this whole article, about those detached territories from all Baltic States. And IMO the grouping is needed as events were very similar, practically same, in all three countries, and people frequently consider these three countries to be one group anyways, they has common history and such, so this is a good place for someone who e.g. just recenntly heard about conflict on <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrene_region.html" title="Abrene region">Abrene region</a> to find out more about this problem and how it is/was dealt with in the Baltic States. And it can be covered in particular country histories too of course. Wikipedia is big, same as there are for example list of various states by both populations and sizes and such, and same as for example there are separate articles for Colonialism in America, Colonialism in Africa, etc. and as well on Colonialism in general; at the same time there can be articles on e.g. colonialism by country such as Spanish Colonialism, English Colonialism, etc. Same there could be articles on this issue - it as included in countries histories, and it as a separate issue. We are not deleting e.g. Colonialism in America article just because all what itsays might be covered in histories of all the American countries.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 22:58, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't think that Petseri and the eastern bank of the Narva River - which were part of Estonian territory from 1920-1944, should be considered 'occupied territories.' Estonia and Russia agree on their borders - Russia just refuses to ratify the border treaty because Estonia's preamble to the treaty mentions documents that mention the Soviet occupation. Estonia no longer claims those territories. There are some right wing parties in Estonia that do - but there are some right wing politicians in Russia (Zhiranovsky) that think Alaska really belongs to Russia. They are not of importance because neither has officially disputed this territory. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that Russia is willing to sign the agreement with Estonia, so long as there is no political declaration attached. There is no contest over territory.</li>
</ul>
<p>My opinion on the article is this - it should include information on Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania - the eastern front of Operation Barbarossa from World War II, and it should discuss the territorial shifts in those four states in the aftermath of World War II. And that's that. It can be linked to a larger article on Operation Barbarossa, or Soviet Empire, or whatever. The information deserves discussion, but only within the larger context.</p>

<p>First off, it needs quite a bit of attention, and read so much like <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copy_%28written%29.html" title="Copy (written)">advertising copy</a> that I slapped an NPOV on it. But that's not the point.</p>
<p>The concern is that, reading the history of the article, that it's being used for a "rapper's war" instead of an article. I can't find anything significant on "Lo'Down" or "LJ" (except for the name of another artist) or anything of the sort on the web...or, for that matter, anything in regards to a New Mexico rap scene. Comments like "growing up in a Christian home" and "was the 2005 champion at Mortal Kombat Domination" have no real bearing on the article. Also, there are a lot of quotes listed, and there's no article references of any kind.</p>
<p>I find it enough to remove the NPOV and attention tags and am sending it to <b>Delete.</b> --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 18:56, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>We work by consensus. The consensus seems to be heading for much less stringent requirements for an article than the ones you suggest. Personally I see no reason why all school entries should be somehow especially distinguished. It is possible to give useful information about a school without seeking out a famous alumnus, an unusual history, or the like (which are really as superficial as the chipmunk when all is said and done). A SAT results table, a list of curriculum subjects, and so on would quite useful to someone considering sending a child to a school or attending it themselves. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:43, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>The current "consensus" is that there are about a dozen well-organized school inclusionists in Wikipedia who vote without considering either policy or article content, and that's really all it takes to save almost any article. As for "less stringent requirements", why only for schools? I see no reason why all biographies should be somehow especially distinguished. It is possible to give useful information about a person without seeking out notable achievements, interesting occupations, unique abilities. There are 6 billion people in this world, and they're all special and different in some way. Maybe we could have an article about every one of them. It would be useful for someone considering marrying off their child, or buying insurance, or ... <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:45, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

Article removal is simply the removing of an article and its history from wikipedia following a vote on the issue in which a consensus to remove the article is made.

<p>-What a crock. You are treating this site with so much disrespect, ironic considering how much Smallville TWoP boarders critisize the morality of characters. You cannot honestly justify this article serves any other purpose than to get a laugh. Just look at these quotes.</p>
<p>"If the Wikipedia people don't care to share and inform others about the growing danger of SFS, then fuck 'em. They'll be doing the world a disservice by not educating us about the health hazard that is Season Four."</p>
<p>"I think the Wikipedia people just wanna keep their cred as some sort of "legitimately educational" source. But really, how seriously will we ever take something that starts with "wiki?"</p>
<p>"Okay, if the person who posted the Wikipedia definition of SFS lurks in these forums, show yourself. YOU ARE A FUCKING GENIUS. I laughed for at least ten minutes after reading that."</p>
<p>"Some snobbish jackasses over there have taken issue with the biased nature of my research, asking for the entry to be deleted. I argue that, while I am somewhat biased, the condition of SFS is indeed real and documented, therefore the entry still keeps its core integrity, which is simply providing the nature, etiology, and symptoms of SFS. Hopefully the good people at Wikipedia will understand this."'</p>
<p>"Man, those people who post on the 'Pages for deletion' area are assholes."</p>
<p>"They don't even like, "Assclown." Who doesn't like, "Assclown?!" I just heard it on "O.C." last week!"'</p>

<p>Random attack by Jtdirl</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Jtdirl is intent on sabotaging any content on Wikipedia that doesn't promote a position he has on addressing the pope with a strongly pro-Catholic POV (including vandalism, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>, personal attacks, VfD abuse, etc). He's also gotten to adding malicious {{VFD}} tag on a different page I created recently (<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_and_Journalistic_Use_of_Honorifics_800f.html" title="Academic and Journalistic Use of Honorifics">Academic and Journalistic Use of Honorifics</a>). This particular page was created back on September 2004, long before the survey prompting Jtdirl. <i>However, for reasons I can't quite discern, Jtdirl seems to believe I wrote the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorific.html" title="Honorific">Honorific</a> page, and therefore wants it VfD'd just out of spite.</i> <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 19:11, 2005 May 18 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>do not</i> have a position on addressing the Pope, let alone a strongly pro-Catholic POV. I have a stand on using styles. And I don't care whether that style is for the Dalai Lama, the Pope, the Prince of Wales or anyone else. But standing by principles of NPOV does not make one "strongly pro-Catholic", whereas you have made it quite clear that you have an issue not with styles but with calling the Pope <i>His Holiness</i>. That is your right to hold that view. But it isn't your right to expect that NPOV entries reflect your POV. And my argument would be <i>exactly</i> the same if the flashpoint on styles occurred on the page of the Dalai Lama, the Queen of the United Kingdom or anywhere else. That it is the Pope is irrelevant to me. You however have made it clear on talk pages that is an issue to you.</dd>

<dd>Re this page - the issue is already dealt with in far greater detail and far greater accuracy elsewhere. This is a poorly written, inaccurate alternative to a well written accurate page elsewhere that covers the information already. And it was created to give the author of it a place to push <i>his</i> POV on styles. The article qualifies for deletion on three grounds - malicious creation, inaccurate content and accurate in-depth content already on its own page on wikipedia. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">07:42, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></dd>

<li>It doesn't need to be an essay. Rewritten as an article, it'll be a compilation of editorial styles with a summary. It can become purely factual and is thus eligible to be an article.

<li>James, that's an abuse of the original intention of the "no original research" rule; it was intended to exclude bizarre physics theories, etc. This is hardly that: it's common sense that publications may have some form of guidelines on the use of titles. It's not original research, anymore than a category or "list of..." page is original research. <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 11:00, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
