<li><b>Neutral</b> I agree with the statements above in general about the quality of the article, but... this isn't technically original research. <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Sim_8ec4.html" title="Dave Sim">Dave Sim</a>, who is a major figure in the comics world, wrote this article a number of years ago, published it in his comic book series <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebus.html" title="Cerebus">Cerebus</a> and released it to the public domain. As you can imagine, it caused a stir, mostly of the "Dave Sim needs to be put back on his meds. Stat!" variety. So the question is: what should Wikipedia do with a piece like this written by a notable figure?

<li><b>Comment</b> - added intro if that makes a difference. I understand this may not fit Wiki's definition of an encyclopedic entry, but the claim that this is "pure original research" is demonstrably false. All you have to do is read the article. If deleted, I'll just take a couple (and only a couple!) of quotes and provide it as an addendum to the Sim page. Antihostile 16:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've been a big fan of this group's work ever since the release of their 1990 LP Super 8!, their most accomplished album. Its commercial sounds with deep pop grooves were appealing in a narrower way than their great, great live concerts, but still deeply satisfying. I think their rendition of "I Do" was the most moving a capella song of the 1990s about monogamy and committment. As far as I'm concerned it was the greatest achievement in pop music to date. But lately their work has become too artsy, too intellectual. Students at Middlebury College, which I still attend, have lost interest in this group, which has lost touch with its base. The back-to-back departures of Kevin Manfredi and Erik Carleton in 2000 and 2001 really destroyed the group's moral. They want to fit in, but they can't. Their site should be deleted unless they can facilitate a return to the traditional moral values that they so strongly held on to for their first 40 years.<span class="user-sig user-Slackerman"><i>—Slackerman <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">01-25</a>&#160;12:06<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>

<p>A river with no references that probably didn't exist. There is just one google hit for doodool River (hich is basically what this article says). What it doesn't say is that that hit was for <a href="http://www.homestayfinder.com/Dictionary.aspx?q=Gold_Coast,_Queensland" class="external text" title="http://www.homestayfinder.com/Dictionary.aspx?q=Gold_Coast,_Queensland" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and that page has since changed the river name to Nerang River.

<p>I have been an anymouse user of Wikipedia and find it very interesting so only recently have started contributing. Overall, there is very little information about the people that have helped to build the commercial internet. For example, there is no entry for internet advertising agency. These firms create the experiences that direct billions of advertising dollars and create sites used by hundreds of millions of users. As a category, its certainly a non-trivial professional group. Should I move this entry to my personal page and create a stub entry for Interactive Agency or Internet Agency to start capturing information about the class of companies&#160;? --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewbernardini_9df1.html" title="User:Matthewbernardini">Matthewbernardini</a> 02:41, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This articles describes 2003 computer science research (see <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=904031.904042&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM" class="external autonumber" title="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=904031.904042&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>) -- so it is verifiable and definitely not a hoax. However, it is a far cry from a standardized query language such as SQL. Given that there is <i>one</i> citation for the linked paper, and the fact that there are as many Google scholar hits for "FSQL" about "functional SQL" papers as for "fuzzy SQL" (i.e. one each), this is not notable.

<li>I'm switching to just <b>keep</b>. It might not be doing it now, but a history of this word and of its use could have value. I've heard of entire papers on this word. I think there are words and phrases that can merit an article rather than just a dictionary entry. And although Wiktionary is not paper, Wikipedia isn't paper either. Looking at <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlang_a752.html" title="Category:Slang">Category:Slang</a> many words that less deserve an article have one. For example <a href="../../../h/u/z/Huzzah.html" title="Huzzah">Huzzah</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowabunga.html" title="Cowabunga">Cowabunga</a>.

<ul>
<li>A "history of this word" belongs in the dictionary, in the etymology section of the dictionary article about the word. Wiktionary is not paper. <i>Wiktionary has "real articles" too!</i> You are conflating "short" with "dictionary article". That's wrong. The two are not synonymous. Please do not support the waste of time and effort that is the creation of dictionary articles in the encyclopaedia. Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia, and Wiktionary is the dictionary. Please do dictionary work in the project that has the goal of creating a dictionary. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:16, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Don't lecture me, especially as you don't do it very well. A long page on the use, history, and controversy over this word would not belong in a dictionary or wiktionary. I don't want to write that article at 5:25 AM Central Standard Time, but I'm sure I can write it at some point. We have articles on all kinds of words, something you failed to acknowledge or respond to. So tell me why issues concerning this word merit an article less than the other words in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlang_a752.html" title="Category:Slang">Category:Slang</a>.

<ul>
<li><i>A long page on the use, history, and controversy over this word would not belong in a dictionary or wiktionary.</i> — Rubbish. Articles on words that discuss their etymologies and their usages are <i>exactly</i> what Wiktionary is for and explicitly <i>wants</i>. Yet again, you are conflating "dictionary article" and "short". Wiktionary is not paper, and welcomes long discussions of etymologies. Furthermore: I've already told you about <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlang_a752.html" title="Category:Slang">Category:Slang</a>, its mis-use, and the Wiktionary category where dictionary articles on slang words properly belong, below. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:51, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I still think you are being a snot, but I'm no longer as certain this belongs in Wikipedia. In an Encyclopedia perhaps it would, in Wikipedia perhaps not. Whether you like it or not there are cases of issues/history concerning words being of historical enough importance to merit an encyclopedic article. You can whine and pout against that all you want, but it doesn't really change that. Or change that there are numerous such word/articles already. I think this word does merit that, but admittedly just barely. This is a case though of Wiki versus reality. In this case "What Wikipedians can do or find interesting" maybe does make this invalid.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><i>Wiktionary is a dictionary. It's not set up to deal with issues concerning the political/history controversies over words.</i> — Rubbish.

<p>Hi folks. Sorry I did not read the "no original research" restriction before posting this entry to Wikipedia. The hododyne is not a hoax but it is original research and new terminology so I guess it has to get the axe. I can verify the hododyne if a Wikipedia editor in astronomy and physics is willing to contact me. The proof of the hododyne and its role in celestial mechanics is a rather large file of 3 mb but I can send it if it would help to get the hododyne entry here. I'm a big fan of Wikipedia and completely understand the need for strict criteria. - D.S. Marlin, Marlsda@aol.com</p>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> - illegal content. Regardles of whether or not the info can be used to create a global plague. If not, that would conceivably be a reason to "improve".

<ul>
<li>Nitpick: When describing content as "illegal", it is usually considered proper to mention which laws in which jurisdictions you believe the content to violate. It's not necessary to cite the relevant section and paragraph, but something more precise than "Well, if it isn't, it sure ought to be!" is generally expected. (Or, if that <i>is</i> your rationale, it is better to state it as such rather than merely stating your opinion as law.) While successfully carrying out the activities described in the article may indeed be illegal in many jurisdictions, I believe that in most places merely describing them isn't. For one thing, the U.S., where Wikipedia's servers reside, has something called the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7435.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment</a>, which may be relevant. (That said, it's still not encyclopedic, being merely a how-to guide.) —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 14:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was NO CONSENSUS. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 02:59, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>DO NOT TAKE THIS AFD CLOSING AS A MANDATE TO KEEP, MERGE, REDIRECT, DELETE, BLANK, OR ANY OTHER SUCH ACTION. No consensus means exactly that: there is no consensus.</p>
<ul>
<li>My findings from the commentary in this AfD debate:
<ul>
<li>This article is just as contentious as any other anarchism-related article.</li>
<li>An NPOV, sourced, objective comparison/contrast can be created.
<ul>
<li>Such a comparison/contrast is difficult to create.</li>
<li>There will always be disagreements about whether it <i>actually is</i> NPOV, properly sourced, and objective, whether it is or not.</li>
<li>This article might well permanently have cleanup tags indicating disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A primary objection to the article is that it contains pairwise comparison rather than discussion of the span of forms of anarchism.
<ul>
<li>A "See also" section including links to any other pairwise or spectrum analysis articles, or a rightsidebar template or other solution to that effect, would draw attention to other comparison/contrasts.</li>
<li>Alternatively, this article could be merged into an article that deals with the entire spectrum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The article is US-centric.</li>
<li>This AfD is extremely poisonous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My actions and reasoning (these actions, are of course, subject to the normal editing process):
<ul>
<li>I am adding a {{<a href="../../../g/l/o/Template%7EGlobalize_49bb.html" title="Template:Globalize">Globalize</a>}} tag, as the page is US-centric.
<ul>
<li>This tag should remain until either the page is moved to a title that identifies it as relating to American individualist anarchism or it is given an international perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am adding a {{<a href="../../../o/r/i/Template%7EOriginalResearch_5c79.html" title="Template:OriginalResearch">OriginalResearch</a>}} tag.
<ul>
<li>This is not because the article is inherently OR, but because it is prone to have OR inserted into it. This article needs copious citations of <i>specific arguments</i> as well as a general reference list. Please add such citations before removing the OR tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am adding a {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EControversial3_b7fa.html" title="Template:Controversial3">Controversial3</a>}} tag to the talk page.
<ul>
<li>That this subject is controversial is beyond doubt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am blanking this AfD.
<ul>
<li>There are a few compelling, well-thought-out comments made in it, but they are dwarfed by the attacks from both sides. If anyone has a need of or interest in reading it, please refer to page history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am leaving the page where it is.
<ul>
<li>Feel free to consider merging, redirecting, or nominating for deletion again; do so on the article's talk page. I am recusing myself from any further decisions regarding the page's future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I have found NO CONSENSUS in this debate.</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> needs a serious cleanup ... but he did perform at Carnegie Hall in 2000. That alone warrants at least SOME information on the guy. Claims "first place in the yearly annual Nankin Er-Hu competition" that would probably pass as "Has won or placed in a major music competition." He also appears to have collaborated with several independant bands/musicians one of which was signed to Polydor... Per my standards this just barely squeeks by. Of course this all hinges on whether or not this can be verified.</s> Cant be verified ... <b>nuke it.</b> &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 22:12, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Performing at Carnegie Hall is impressive, but lots of people perform there as <i>members</i> of an orchestra or band, and surely Wikipedia needn't have an individual article for every one of them. The article doesn't assert that this isn't the case for Hsu; on the contrary, it implies that he was there as a member of the NYC Opera Orchestral program. If he performed there <i>solo</i>, then yeah, that would be another story. Also, I agree with your point about verifiability; thanks for bringing it up. –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 16:34, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, BadSeed, Surely the definition of encyclopedia ("A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically.") entirely disproves your notion that pub crawls are "inherently non-encyclopedic". The phrase "wide range of subjects" surely encompasses that of pub-crawling which isn't exactly unknown of in the wider community! Robin Johnson I'm sad to inform you that you are entirely incorrect in your presumption that this article was made by schoolboys. It was made by a bunch of Cambridge students; who believe it definitely has a right to be publicised as it is simply <i>renowned</i> in Cambridge. As for James084; try and make a cogent point next time. I hope you take this information into account when choosing whether it should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a student from cambridge and i have heard of the Jazz and Dave pub crawl. This crawl is in its early stages, but is quickly growing in success. The article is hilarious and what more could we want from a pub crawl.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Jazz and Dave have been rapidly growing in popularity throughout both Cambridge and the surrounding villages. This crawl has become one of Cambridge's weekly highlights and as such deserves a place in such a distinguished body of information.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Deletion isn't the solution to this situation. It's for articles that shouldn't exist, not those that need fixing (or even a complete rewrite if that were necessary). The subject is notable and an appropriate topic for an article, and the solution to problems with the <i>content</i> of the article lie in the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolution</a> realm. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 14:50, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This entry is not autobiographical.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It does need some rearranging, to give more prominence to his comic book work, but I fail to see why it was nominated in the first place. Hama is fairly well-known, has a long career, and worked on famous characters. <a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc13_2b27.html" title="User:Pc13">Pc13</a> 20:59, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This from the editor who had brought it up as a deletion request, since <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">User:Tverbeek</a>, others and I did huge amounts of work on it in the past day or two to clean it up. To answer <a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc13_2b27.html" title="User:Pc13">User:Pc13</a>'s wondering about why it was nominated, I cited four major specifics. You'll be amused and amazed if you go back and read the original Hama article; as someone other than me wrote of it, "The whole 'legacy' section was an inappropriate strokefest, and the rest of the article frequently ventured off into 'fannish celebrity profile' territory". I hadn't thought it was salvageable — but then I went and helped salvage it, so what do I know!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 10:35, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>None of that justifies freaking out and listing an article for <i>deletion!</i> Read the <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html#Procedure_for_deletion" title="WP:DEL">deletion policy</a>. This AfD listing has been a thoughtless waste of people's time. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 21:59, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wrote the original article, and I am both a friend and fan of Larry Hama. I opted to do this on my own but I had Mr. Hama review the biography section for accuracy. The Legacy section was 100% my personal contribution. Seeing how many comic book writers Mr. Tenebrae has written about and/or edited makes me question if his claims are based on his own bias. Overall, the "self stroking" only appears to be his own. To questions its appropriateness for Wikipedia blows my mind. "Fannish celebrity profile" This is an encyclopedia that gives the life history for video game charaters not exactly high-brow educational material. And this is a website where anyone with a pompous ego can re-write history. To my amazement some "editor" changed Mr. Hama's ethnicity! It takes some unique individuals to rewrite an authorized biography - give yourselves a pat on the back.</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> if somebody promises they are going to work on it in the near future. According to its talk page, it's intended as part of a a rhetorics wikiportal, so I suppose there must be some previously established contributor interest? Delimitation of the topic area is not a problem; rhetorics is a very well-defined scholarly area with a long tradition, and "lists of rhetorical terms" abound in the literature. There are even specialist dictionaries of rhetorical terms. This is definitely a useful idea for a page, and I think the list page is also superior to a category-based alternative in this case, as per <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 08:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not certain why this page was nominated for deletion, but perhaps the issue can be resolved if I explain my rationale for creating the page. I am Matt Barton, an English professor who has been using wikis in teaching for some years now. This semester, I had the idea of having the graduate students in my rhetorical theory course build a <a href="../../../r/h/e/Portal%7ERhetoric_7f93.html" title="Portal:Rhetoric">Rhetoric Portal</a> for wikipedia--one that would match the quality of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Portal%7EPhilosophy_d8c5.html" title="Portal:Philosophy">Philosophy</a> philosophy wikiportal. As part of the project, I wanted the class to create a glossary of terms that are frequently found in rhetorical treatises. This glossary would consist of rhetorical terms with brief, one-line definitions, with all the terms linking to full-page articles (that the class will work to develop as the semester progresses). My plan is to use the Rhetoric Wikiportal as a "homebase," if you will, for developing and extending the rhetorical theory coverage at the wikipedia. If this page is deleted, it may negatively impact a class that is already struggling with "the whole wiki thing," if you will, and probably undercut their confidence in me.</p>

If there's one scholarly discipline that's really pre-destined to have such a thing, it's classical rhetorics (a closed body of established, classical knowledge; terminology in widespread use across several neighbouring disciplines but partly inaccessible to the non-specialist due to its Latinate/Greek roots; useful combination of short definition within list page with more detailed explanation in main articles; pure listing of article titles on a category page would be opaque to the non-specialist.) - And why "unmanagable", for heaven's sake? It's a closed, stable, well-circumscribed field, and many of the articles are already there. It took me twenty minutes this morning to add half a dozen entries.

<dd>True, but two, Ohio and California are not major avenues. Perhaps the distinction needs to be make clearer in the article but that is a cleanup question. Another advantage of the list format is that as new roads get their own articles, they are automatically linked. I'm not saying an article format might not be a better way to treat this subject, but if so let someone write it and redirect the list.

Just mention in the DC article that there's a street for each state (which I bet it already does) and those that are significant enough to have article can be in the Streets of DC category.

<li>I do not agree that your logic is entirely correct. Someone <i>was</i> doing a lot of work on it (but the animosity toward a worthwhile contributor here seems to have gotten rid of him), there probably <i>should be</i> a list of numbered Avenues in New York, and there's no reason to delete listy articles out of hand. This one is more than a little useful and Wikipedia can handle it. And putting rebuttals to every single "Keep" vote, especially from those of us who have been here a while, is not going to bring anyone over to your side of the argument. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><font size="+1" color="#008800"><b><span class="Unicode">ℬ</span></b></font>astique</a><font style="color:#FF72E3;"><span class="Unicode">▼</span></font><b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">par<span class="Unicode">ℓ</span>er</a></sup></b><font color="#FF0000" size="+1"><span class="Unicode">♥</span></font><sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bastique_7452.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bastique">voir</a></b></sup><font color="#5500FF" size="+1"><b><span class="Unicode">♑</span></b></font> 22:26, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A useful article would be Notable streets of Washington, D.C. or State-named Avenues in Washington D.C. that establishes <i>why</i> these streets are interesting for anything other than a common characteristic of their name. I work just off Maryland Avenue and I have to tell you, Maryland Avenue is not notable. This is indiscriminate, it is a list for the sake of having a list, like List of sports teams with singular team names or List of buildings with their own ZIP code or [[List of world leaders mentioned on <i>Family Guy</i>]].-<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoster_075d.html" title="User:Choster">choster</a> 02:10, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Categories are better suited for this kind of thing. Streets and avenues in all cities are named following a pattern after all, that's an inherent part of city planning. It seems that the majority of the avenues in this list are notable because they follow this particular pattern, not the other way around. I support articles on individual avenues/streets that are notable, but this particular brand of "notability by association" is pushing it a bit too far IMHO. -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Run</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">e</font></a> <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> 02:51, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> i dont understand why everyone wants to delete this. mr malament may not be albert einstein, but his contributions to biz strategy are fairly widely recognized, and is a giant in the field among his peers. everything in the article checks out, is completely factually accurate. this is more than worthwhile. also, the ultimate championship of the longest running quiz show is pretty significant. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmx3_0d46.html" title="User:Dmmx3">Dmmx3</a> (<a href="../../../d/m/m/User_talk%7EDmmx3_7028.html" title="User talk:Dmmx3">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmmx3_8eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmmx3">contribs</a>) 27 January 2006.</small>

<li>Well, help us <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that everything in the article checks out. The big problem is that the article presently <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cites</a> no sources at all. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> specifically says that the burden is <i>on the contributor</i> to provide those citations.

<li><b>Comment.</b> It's quite evident that Matt and Daniel M. Maggin (also up for deletion, and more than likely one and the same as User <a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmx3_0d46.html" title="User:Dmmx3">Dmmx3</a> (<a href="../../../d/m/m/User_talk%7EDmmx3_7028.html" title="User talk:Dmmx3">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmmx3_8eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmmx3">contribs</a>) to judge by the contribs) are simply a couple of mates having a go. I don't actually doubt the veracity of the biographical details provided for either; but when stripped of the unsupportable grandiose claims, they don't amount to encyclopaedic notability or even notoriety any which way you slice it. If truly a "giant in the field" other than in his own lunchtime, there would be commentary and recognition of the same from a variety of independent notable sources — but these are completey lacking. Being an employee of, or a consultant to, Fortune500 companies is not an automatic qualifier for mention here.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 03:48, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> I agree. Further, 69.180.14.172 has defended both articles against deletion, but signed different names ("S. Wootton" here, "Dean Kang" there).

<p><b>Delete</b>. This article is a student essay on a topic already covered by a more extensive article at Wikipedia. It violates the principle of "no original material".

<dd>True, someone probably won't come to Wikipedia and look for "modern business ethics," but if they do, they're probably looking for the content found in <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_ethics.html" title="Business ethics">Business ethics</a>, so I don't see a problem with a redirect, just in case.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. It has been argued that the <i>subject</i> of the article is notable, but the article was too poor (substub/advertising). The deletion is therefore without prejudice against a better article, and I will let the redlinks stay.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the second time I've voted keep on this + two keep votes for Seth Ravin. Given the amount of votes we have had concerning the life and times of Seth Ravin, I have come to believe that Seth Ravin is the most important businessman in the world, perhaps since business was invented. No start-up is small if Seth Ravin did the starting up. Life takes on new meaning when Seth Ravin is in the picture. Are there are other companies that Seth Ravin was involved with that are not yet covered here? Many of us now feel that we need articles on everything that Seth Ravin has ever touched. I wish I lived on Rimini Street with Seth Ravin. Thanks for letting me vote again to keep Seth Ravin. I feel all warm and tingly.

<li><b>Keep</b>,obviously. I wrote it myself so I know it isn't an ad.

<li><b>Delete</b>, because there is no assertion how it would meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or any other notability standard. The article merely notes that it's a startup founded by the exodus of some employees, and that they are now buying up other companies. Companies get founded, and they sometimes buy others together with their customer base. That is common. Maybe come back in five years, when the dust has settled. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 18:26, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Pilatus, my friend, are you familiar with WP:CORP #1? "<i>A company or corporation is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: 1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</i> Excludes ads, reprints of press releases, op ed pieces and the like. There are three press references on the artice already, including one from eWeek and one from Forbes. One of them has as its main subject litigious-sounding noises made at the company by Siebel and the other has as its main subject the acquisition of an ERP/CRM company by Rimini Street. Thus the article passes WP:CORP #1 --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:19, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did consult WP:CORP, and one article in <i>Forbes</i> and a short paragraph in <i>eWeek</i> doesn't pass the "non-trivial" bar and goes against the spirit of that guideline. You may disagree. Employee exoduses are not uncommon, as are corporate acquisitions. Once <i>Rimini Street</i> has extablished itself somewhat and gets its second round of funding we can look again, but now it really doesn't deserve more than a footnote. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 21:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both articles are specifically <i>about</i> Rimini Street and are non-trivial in size and in coverage. This alone passes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Why would we need to know whether the company will thrive? This isn't a business directory, it's an encyclopedia and we write about what other people are writing about. As far as Forbes and sWeek, neither of them negligible sources, are concerned, that includes Rimini Street. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:53, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact of it having been previously deleted does not make it notable, per JJay's amusing and ingeniously self-referential reasoning, but the fact of it passing <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> through significant media coverage does - even if I do think that at this stage it's "just another startup, just like all the rest". I still think nothing should be added to the 'pedia until at leasta year after it happens, to allow for proper perspective. The scrabble by companies to get on Wikipedia as part of their startup marketing program is a real concern to me. But Tony wrote this, and Tony has better things to do with his time than do other people's spamming for them, so in the end I'm trusting to his judgment re the company even if it looks to me like a close call.

<li><b>Delete</b> A well researched article regarding the Mystical Seven Society <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/weshistory/mystical7/mystical7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wesleyan.edu/weshistory/mystical7/mystical7.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> in part, states: <i>In 1884 the Virginia Mystics started two new temples, the Temple of the Sword and Shield at Davidson College, North Carolina and the Star of the South at the University of North Carolina. It is obvious that the name of the southern branch of the society had further evolved as the two new temples were commissioned as the Mystic Seven Fraternity and the Davidson Mystics took on the Greek name Alethia, meaning truth.</i> A google search for "Alethia, University, Davidson" yields no results either, except for the citation noted, yet according to this apparently well researched article, this branch of "7" does/did exist. It is not unreasonable to assume that many secret organizations remain so purposefully, and have no written record, but are known colloquially.<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESuMadre_3911.html" title="User:SuMadre">SuMadre</a> 17:48, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

Though I have personally heard of such, it is only anectdotal evidence. One would expect something as important as administration of a Trust would be referenced in the UNC Library exhibits. It should be noted that there <i>are</i> agreements with the Gorgon's Head Lodge noted (per League of Societies entry), but no reference whatsoever is made in regard to the ECU Society of Seven. Consequently, I have changed my vote from Keep to Delete. In light of these findings, it might be prudent to consider removing The League of Societies entry, and amending the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Gimghoul_7853.html" title="Order of Gimghoul">Order of Gimghoul</a> article as well. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESuMadre_3911.html" title="User:SuMadre">SuMadre</a> 15:12, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>1/24/2006 from the contributor: I erased everything aside from the vital statistics that can be verified. If spoomusic.com is considered non-notable then we have to go through the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_independent_record_labels.html" title="List of independent record labels">list of independant record labels</a> and delete a huge majority of them. Please consider that notability for an independant record label differs than a mainstream label. The funding usually isn't there but the listeners are. Spoomusic.com doesn't sell CDs, but gives the music away free, so there won't ever be a gold or platinum acknowledgement to base notability on... This is a progressive record label in that respect, and I thought it notable for this reason. But I even erased this information, just leaving vitals which can be confirmed through an Arizona government web site listed in the discussion section of this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.3.81.251 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.3.81.251_5d92.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.3.81.251">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>I agree with the contributor regarding <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_independent_record_labels.html" title="List of independent record labels">List of independent record labels</a>. However I believe the contributor confuses <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> with <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Verifiability" class="extiw" title="wikt:Verifiability">Wikt:Verifiability</a> (c.f. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_Essay_b9da.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability/Essay">Wikipedia:Notability/Essay</a>). Since "record label" directly establishes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">notability for musicians</a> which indirectly establishes <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_Songs_5d80.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines/Songs">notability for songs</a>, thousands of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> labels, musicians, albums and songs have articles.
