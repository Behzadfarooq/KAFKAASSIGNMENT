Since this sort of thing happens with TV shows all the time, I think it's relevant and encyclopedic in some way.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have some <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> problems with this nomination. Wikipediatrix has been engaged in a heated argument on the Chuck Cunningham syndrome talk page, arguing that no one knows what it is (although <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Chuck+Cunningham+syndrome%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Chuck+Cunningham+syndrome%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">13,000 Google hits</a> would seem to demonstrate otherwise) and that therefore it should be renamed (despite no good alternatives being available). Is this nomination just a way of trying to gain some advantage there? There are a few other descendant articles (Lazarus Cunningham) whose titles might need work but don't really fit in to the main CCS article; I don't see though that they merit deletion. I really wonder if Wikipediatrix is trying to get the whole thing deleted; <s>his</s> her rather abusive language (either "contrived" or "made-up" would make the point alone) in the nomination tends to suggest that.</p>
<p>I don't see how this "definition" can never be proven (and how do you "prove" a definition anyway?): A character is suddenly introduced into a TV series without explanation, yet treated as if he or she has always been part of it. Is it any less clear-cut? Any fan of <i><a href="../../../1/9/9/Space%7E1999.html" title="Space:1999">Space:1999</a></i> can't argue that's not what happened with Tony Verdeschi, and didn't happen with Maya. Ditto with Sondra Huxtable. I am not familiar with many of the other shows listed, but assuming the information given is correct it meets the definition. I really have no idea what Wikipediatrix is talking about when <s>he</s> she says it would be a dumping ground for any information anyone wants to put there, or even what <s>he</s> she could be talking about.</p>
<p>I really think both of the above editors might want to reconsider their votes. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 18:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the fundamental <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem of the article speaks for itself. I have never made it a secret that I oppose all of these articles you speak of, and others like Lazarus Cunningham and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cousin_Oliver_e438.html" title="Cousin Oliver">Cousin Oliver</a>, all for the same reason: <b>these articles begin with a contrived TV-show-related concept that is based on making an Original Research observation about a TV show, and then, like some sort of a parlor game, readers try and think of TV shows that (supposedly) fit the pattern described by this non-existent "syndrome".</b> Since there can be no true fixed definition of these "syndromes" to turn to in matters of dispute, the article will endlessly be a dumping ground for junk data, opinions, fancruft on a colossal scale, and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I'm sorry you say you don't understand what I mean by that, but I've stated it in the plainest English I know. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 18:42, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OR shmo-R. The fact that there are or will be potential problems with an article should not deter us from including them if they are notable enough to be discussed among television fans.

<dd>There can indeed be ... we wouldn't have <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_the_shark.html" title="Jump the shark">jump the shark</a> by your standards if Jon Hein hadn't written a book and started a website where most of that fancruft can be hashed out (and that's a much more nebulous definition than these, IMO).</dd>
<dd>Do not <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">insult my intelligence</a> by pompously claiming I don't understand you. I do realize encountering actual counterarguments can be troublesome. If you're upset that this little discussion has increased the likelihood that this will result in "no consensus" and the article will be kept, then I'm sorry. But what you're doing feels far too much like <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a> to me.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps your energies would be better spent creating websites devoted to these phenomena so that we could have independent sources and better places for the OR. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:40, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let's stick to the point. I don't see that there is any element of OR to this article - it merely describes a known phenomenon. I can also make no sense of the objection that the definition cannot be "proven" - in fact this is a bit like complaining that there's no OR! The same could be said of any article about non-empirical phenomena (there is no "proof" of a definition of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google_bomb</a> for example, but it's a valid article). It's also quite clear what the term does and doesn't describe, so I don't see how it can be a dumping ground for irrelevant information.</li>

<dd>I don't see a connection between original research and a reader's ability to understand something after having it explained to them. I think if I made up a bogus "syndrome" article called Fried Bacon syndrome and applied it to any TV show where characters ate bacon, the average reader would understand that too. But that doesn't mean that my "syndrome" had any validity. Even if my "syndrome" became a popular meme and people started mentioning it in their blogs, that still doesn't make Fried Bacon syndrome any more real. Nor would it automatically infer any validity to anyone who made up Reverse Fried Bacon syndrome one day in <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">school</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you created Fried Bacon syndrome and applied it to any TV show where characters ate bacon, you would find three things occuring: your contributions to Wikipedia on the subject would be deleted without discussion, you would find that people looked at you funny whenever you brought it up in conversation, and you would find that people would go out of their way not to talk to you. I don't mean anything personal by this â this is just what happens when you start talking about a topic that those around you do not believe exists. I've seen it happen when someone brings up ghosts, bigfoot, Scientology, etc., in a group that is not even remotely well disposed to these subjects. To make up a syndrome based on a false observation would produce similar results. You cannot spontaneously create a concept on an arbitrary basis and expect the culture to agree with you as if they were sheep. However, if you applied a logical (or at least catchy) name to something that everyone knows exists if only in vague terms, then there is a chance that the name might stick. The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Cunningham_Syndrome_bb3f.html" title="Chuck Cunningham Syndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a> (CCS) existed as a name &amp; concept before it appeared as an article in Wikipedia to desribe phenomena that likewise existed before Wikipedia. It has at least one major variation, a reversal, with examples found throughout decades of television history. The article on the subject contains none of the chaos that would ensue if a cabal of contributors had faked up a concept and tried to shoe-horn it into Wikipedia through falsification and brute force. Clearly, Reverse CSS exists just as CSS exists. Maybe it's the name that rubs you the wrong way. If you have another way to describe the phenomena in a manner that you think better adheres to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, please let us know. I am against this information being deleted, but I am not against it being renamed or rewritten. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus71_15e9.html" title="User:Proteus71">proteus71</a> 17:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(If another term is also used, then a descriptive term might be used for the name of the article, and "Reverse Cunningham" <i>might</i> redirect to it. I <i>don't</i> think this particular term is even used among serial drama fans; but, even if it were, a redirect to CCS or whereever it ends up would be appropriate.) Furthermore, the content of the article (at the time of nomination) consisted primarily of a list of examples, which is clearly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</dd>

<dd>I can see your point for merging. In fact, I think it's a good idea. However, the reason <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> exists is to prevent single, isolated opinions from being represented as fact. Now, consider the case where someone writes a book and claims, "I had a private meeting with the late such-and-such celebrity or political figure. No one else was present." Because of this person's credentials, his or her book gets printed; so, we have what WP considers a reliable source even though we have only the word of the author. Compare that situation to this, where several thousand independent witnesses watch the same TV show and note that some new character is being treated as if he or she had been around from the beginning when this was not the case. How exactly is this original research in the sense that it is an isolated opinion? Are not several thousand independent witnesses better than a single witness, whether or not he or she can get a book published? (And we are talking about <i>independent</i> witnesses, not members of a cabal attempting to rewrite history.)</dd>

<dd>CCS is all over the web. Since RCCS is not, your point to merge the two articles is well taken. However, RCCS is a subtype of an existing concept, so with a little rewriting (calling it "a type of reverse Chuck Cunningham Syndrome", for example), there should be no problem.</dd>
