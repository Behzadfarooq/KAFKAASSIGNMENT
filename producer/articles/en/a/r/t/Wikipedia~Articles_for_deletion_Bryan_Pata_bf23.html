<li>Of course not, but the fact that he would have made the NFL draft if he was still alive and his uncommon death and it's reports in the media make him definately more notible compared to those tons of players you are referring to. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 07:37, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. If he was notable before death, then why was there no article? Second, making the NFL draft is not notable...many are drafted and never amount to a hill of beans. Wikipedia is NOT A CRYSTAL BALL. Future predictions of notability are irrelevant. Thus, the only notable thing about him is, he was shot and killed. Also, the Hurricanes are 5-5, clearly not a great team this year. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 04:56, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There are many notible people who don't have an article yet, so that's not a reason for deletion. How come Paul Baltes did not have an article as of today? Wasn't he notible before? Wikipedia is indeed not a crystal ball, I agree with that. I don't know much about NFL drafts, but from what I've read about this subject is that it was a <i>fact</i> that Pata was selected to be in this draft if he was still alive. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 08:27, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Notability is notability. How is being notable for one's death less valid than being notable for achievements during one's life? Even putting aside my opinion that all Division 1-A scholarship football players have a case for notability, this guy was not only a star player for one of the premier college teams in the country, but he got massive press coverage. Does it matter WHY he got press coverage? I know of no Wikipedia policy limiting the "reasons for notability" that are considered valid. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 20:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. He is on a notable college football team and was a veteran player who by most accounts was of NFL caliber, and his death caused widespread media coverage. There is nothing wrong, unencyclopaedic, or non-noteable about becoming more well-known in death -- it just allows more verifiable, reliable sources to be used in the article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 02:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, ..." He clearly fits into <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is also notable due to the fact that one can expect to see his name appear in the years to come, whether it be on <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> or in the newspaper. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMateoCorazon_ac68.html" title="User:MateoCorazon">MateoCorazon</a> 03:20, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can you come up with policies that support your deletion vote?

<ul>
<li>It's a single event. Event-based coverage has generally not been held to count as "multiple" coverages just because the story is carried in multiple papers. The stories are not really independent of each other and don't demonstrate that the subject is encyclopedic (as opposed to just newsworthy). <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 17:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would actually dispute the contention that a single incident cannot confer encyclopedic noteworthiness; that is certainly an <i>argument</i>, but it isn't one I believe to be consensus-supported. Apart from the notorious examples like <a href="../../../j/o/n/JonBenet_Ramsey_daa2.html" title="JonBenet Ramsey">JonBenet Ramsey</a>, Wikipedia has accepted many little gems on folks like <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Hagaman_9a08.html" title="Allen Hagaman">Allen Hagaman</a>; and no paper encyclopedia would ignore <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crispus_Attucks_36be.html" title="Crispus Attucks">Crispus Attucks</a>, yet these people are notable for the single event of their death only. The difference in the last two is, of course, the passage of a great deal of time; but, given the popularity of collegiate sports in America, it is all but certain that Pata won't be forgotten by a large segment of US males. This is, perhaps, a sad social commentary, but that isn't our concern. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:17, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clarification: I didn't say that a single incident couldn't be notable. What I said was that news coverage of a single event does not count as "multiple coverages" when measuring against the "multiple non-trivial coverages" criterion. Whether the single event itself is sufficient to qualify the biography under one of the other criteria is a separate question. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> You are completely wrong, and ignorant. Crispus Attuck's death was notable as he was perceived as 'defending his country' and became a symbol of the Revolution, said by some to be the 'first to die' for the Revolution. In any case, he was part of the "Boston Massacre" and so is directly relevant to the root causes of the Revolution. Bryan Pata's death was a random event. Also, Attucks died in 1770 and is still remembered. It's pathetic you would even compare the two.

<li><b>Comment</b> Geez, no personal attacks please. There was no need for <i>that</i>. And at any rate, what Xoloz said <i>did</i> make sense, you are misunderstanding. Rossami argued that being notable for one thing - your death - constitutes failure of "multiple non-trivial coverages" (which, incidentally, is untrue - that policy is referring to multiple SOURCES covering the topic, not necessarily the topic being covered for multiple reasons). Xoloz was citing Crispus Attucks as an example of someone who is clearly notable, yet is known only for his death. <i>Of course</i> Attucks should be kept; the absurdity of deleting his article was his point exactly. Regardless of the merits of this article, Rossami's theory does not seem to be correct. Your attack was both unprovoked and misguided and I think an apology would be in order... -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 23:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think his point is that his lasting fame came from his death, as did Pata's. I still do not understand why a notable death does not notable make? Could someone clarify that? -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 04:32, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wouldn't call this 'lasting' fame, but temporary fame fueled by a media story. One would think that to qualify, out of the 6.3 billion people on this Earth, that one would have to do or be someone notable to get an encyclopedia article. Simply a combination of a non-star collegiate player and an unfortunate event does not make 'lasting' fame. Ok, maybe this vote will lose right now, because people are 'appealing to emotion' instead of logic. But as we see from the other, outdated stories, after a while, what is so notable about being a backup quarterback on a team that didn't win? Or someone made 13 tackles in 43 starts, not even one tackle a game? On a team that didn't win. It's not notable. The only thing notable is how young people over-value things they see on TV and undervalue things read in books.131.96.70.164 00:55, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you, Elmer. That is certainly what I was getting at. I think this debate is silly. Brian Pata was a notable sports figure who died in a notorious way.

<li>I would agree with the deletions of Berringer and Dennehy, in particular Dennehy, which has more about his murderer than about him, but Stenson barely qualifies, as having played in the major leagues. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 00:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, relist in a few months to see if coverage continues or if this was just a three-day newsflash.
