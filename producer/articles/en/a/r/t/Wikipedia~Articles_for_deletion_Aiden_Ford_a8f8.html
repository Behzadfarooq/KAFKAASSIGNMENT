<dd>I refer you to the page you referred me to, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>. It is very clear: "Major and notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article." The problem with the articles on Aiden Ford, et al, is that they are not encyclopedic treatments: they are plot summaries, which do not assert the notability of the characters. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:38, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

The solution: the 2 lines of character description should be merged into the main article on <i>Stargate Atlantis</i>, and the rest should be deleted.

<dd>Having just taken a quick look at all of these, I would say this: Spock has become part of the broader culture, and the article makes this point. I would definitely keep that. (Maybe in 10 years the same will properly be said of the nominees for deletion.) The article on Danny Tanner is a (somewhat) compelling analysis of the character--not just a summary of his actions on the show--so I would keep that. The Bartlet article is also a (somewhat) compelling portrayal--and, as the actions of Bartlet invite comparisons with real life, the article could potentially be expanded. Valerii and Brass--I would argue those do need to be deleted, as they are not compelling, nor do I see any potential for them to be expanded. Those articles are just a description of the characters' doings--like the present nominees for deletion. A description of the characters themselves could be summed up in 2 sentences, and are. So I would insert those 2 sentences into the main articles for the TV shows, and delete the rest. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:50, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Articles on episodes of television series, or fictional characters in movies are more likely to be labeled fancruft if they are primarily summaries, biographies of made-up people, or collections of trivia that relate to the continuity of a series rather than its critical or social reception."

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Therefore these articles aren't encyclopedic treatments of the characters. So the articles also fail to satisfy <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>--"If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article."</dd>

This is why deletion, not tags, is appropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Third,</b> on fancruft: Even though these articles are obviously fancruft, that's not a good reason for them to be deleted. But the fact that these articles have a fan base is a diagnosis of the reason why, despite their lack of encyclopedic content, these articles can be found on WP.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Fourth,</b> it is obvious that I've touched a nerve with some fans of Stargate. I understand what it must be like to have articles you've worked on very hard, and for a very long time, to be considered for deletion. I am truly sorry for that. But the fact remains that WP is not a place for fans of X to collect indiscriminate information about X. There are <i>plenty</i> of other places on the Internet for fanclubs.</dd>

<dd>I just think this nomination is funny. Out of about 25 voters, the nominator is the only one who thinks this is fancruft. Many of the voters have argued at length about why the nominator is wrong. Never before have I seen a AFD with such overwhelming resistance to the deletion. Usualy, even if there is consensus to keep there are at least one or two people who agree with the nominator. Here there is unanamous consensus.

<dd>Thanks for the laugh, 207.234.147.96 (I mean that). As to the serious point you are making, narratives of the exploits of WWII heroes are appropriate for WP.

<dd>1) As it states, the presence of a plot summary is not grounds for deletion. Even if these articles consisted only of plot summary, which they don't, it would not be grounds for deletion, only cleanup/revision.</dd>
<dd>2) These articles pass the 100 year test. Probably. The very nature of the test makes it hard to say with 100% certainty.</dd>
<dd>3) As it states, major characters get their own articles if proper treatment of them would cause the main article to become overlong.</dd>

<dd>Re: your point #1, The "expansion and cleanup" required by no. 7 is not possible w/ these articles b/c it is not possible to give them "real-world context and sourced analysis" (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>). By the way, I note that the explicitly stated "Plot summaries are not grounds for deletion" (paraphrasing) was added <i>today</i>--probably in good faith, but that does sort of change the meaning of the policy, and maybe sd be reverted (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWhat_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;diff=73506100&amp;oldid=73428962" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWhat_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;diff=73506100&amp;oldid=73428962" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWhat_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;diff=73506100&amp;oldid=73428962</a>). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>From the nominator.</b> If this were a chess game, now would be the time to say "I resign." I gave it my best shot. Now (after more than 40K!) I want to <b>withdraw the nomination.</b> I apologize for what is now clear to me was an ill-advised nom as rootology said, since it had zero chance of succeeding, although that was certainly not clear to me when I made the nom. In fact I thought it wd be so uncontroversial that I used PROD before someone removed it.</p>
<p>Now that the debate is over, I want first to concede what I think are the three best arguments <i>against</i> my nom:</p>
<p>1. Inertia. These articles are so extensive, and have been on WP for so long, and are even part of a Stargate portal (God save us all!), that to delete them now would be disruptive to the portal and unfair to a relatively small but very hard-working chunk of the WP community.</p>
<p>2. Precedent. I assume discussions like these have come up before, whether formally in deletion nominations, or informally on talk pages, or both. The fact that articles like these have survived for such a long time despite such discussions, is precedent-setting, I suppose.</p>
<p>3. Fairness. If these articles were yanked, it would not be fair that hundreds, if not thousands (if not tens of thousands?--God save us all!) of comparable articles would remain, like the article on Soong which rootology mentioned.</p>
<p>I still think my basic argument is right: that WP is not an appropriate place for articles like these, including the Soong article, and WP would have a much better reputation if it cracked down on them. The fact that these articles are 95% plot narratives and 5% character analyses attests to their lack of significance to the real world today, lack of any artistic, philosophical, or literary merit, and certain lack of significance to anybody at all 100 years from now. So it's obvious to me that they're unencyclopedic faddish fancruft.</p>
<p>Worse, I get the impression that allowing these articles makes the WP community sort of like a high school student body, in that both are divided into cliques devoted to fads, rather than a cohesive community devoted to the whole WP project/high school sports &amp; academics. There is a clique devoted to Stargate, and a clique devoted to Pokemon, and a clique devoted to Survivor, and a clique devoted to Goth. Leaving high school aside, whether I'm right about the existence of cliques on WP or not, I'm probably right that Stargate et al are fads which will be forgotten 100 years from now. And it seems to me that at WP, the proponents of fad projects should take them off of WP and go elsewhere on the World Wide Web, which is pretty darn wide and would accommodate, and certainly already does accommodate, each one of these fads.</p>
<p>So again, I apologize for the nom. I also apologize for being blunt about what I called "fads," which may offend some people. Especially, I apologize for the rant you just read, because I know now (thanks rootology) that the appropriate place for that rant is in a discussion like the one at WP:FICT, not here. I just want to say, thanks to all of you who have contributed to this debate. Thanks especially to those of you who thoughtfully engaged me in some particulars of the debate, even though you could have just cited WP:SNOW and walked off. Y'all probably feel this debate was largely a waste of your time, and you may be right, but for me this has been an educational experience as I am new to the procedural part of WP (though I have been contributing substantively to WP for quite some time as described on <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">User:Pan Dan</a>, ahem, Matt and rootology). I have no hard feelings towards anybody here (yes, even you Matt, though next time a newcomer adopts a snowball-in-hell position, don't assume bad faith), although I understand if some of you have hard feelings towards me. Anyway, see you around WP! May the force be with you! or whatever. &#160;:-)</p>

<li>Will Stargate be forgotten a hundred years from now? Maybe so. But <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. Whether something will be notable a century from now is inherently unknowable, and thus not a criteria for determining whether it's notable now. Assuming that Wikipedia still exists in 2106, these articles will be deleted by then if they've ceased to be notable. Currently, however, they are notable. Oh, and <b>Strong Keep</b>. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 03:28, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>With respect, you're way off base here. My argument that "Stargate will be forgotten 100 years from now" appeals to the 100-year test at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#Alternative_tests" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO#Alternative_tests</a>.
