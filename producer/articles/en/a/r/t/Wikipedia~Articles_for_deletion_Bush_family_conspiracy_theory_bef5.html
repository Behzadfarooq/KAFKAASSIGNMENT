<dd><b>Comment</b> Rules can be established, yes, and we already have one: No "new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas that serves to advance a position." But most pages like this one are full of original research. They rely far too heavily on primary sources and become link farms. For many of these things, there just aren't a whole lot of secondary sources anyway. What can we do? The pages are followed by the people who care most about them, and this is what we get. Wikipedia seems to have, de facto, two tiers: Real encyclopedia articles, and sandbox articles. This is one of the latter. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:02, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Sure we can't just repeat any old tripe that anyone has ever said, but it seems obvious that people <i>have</i> alleged conspiracy theories about the Bush family, so why can't we detail the popular or common ones?

<li><b>Delete</b> or break out the tin foil hats. Bush Senior killed JFK. The Bush family orchestrated 9/11. Give me a break. Our current President may not be the best we've ever had, but that doesn't mean that everyone in the family is into satan-worship and that they knock off foreign leaders in their spare time. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:59, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The theory is <b>not</b> that "Bush killed JFK." I think it is that right-wing anti-Castro extremists did so, and that Bush knew them for both business (oil drilling between Florida and Cuba) and political reasons. I don't share this view, but it is one of many theories about the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination</a>. Btw, are you suggesting that Bush Sr had <b>no</b> prior experience with the CIA before he became CIA Director on 30 January 1976 (until 20 January 1977),<a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/bush.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/bush.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and that based on this mere 355 days on the job the CIA Headquarters in Langley, VA was permanently named after him? Just curious. No-one credible suggests that "Bush orchestrated 9/11" -- but this false belief is widely held, hence it is important to debunk.</dd>

<li>After thinking about this a while I'm starting to think this is really best classified as original research. The individual claims that suggest conspiracies can be verified — in the sense that the claims have been made in someone's blog or wherever, not that the claims are true. But collecting them into a list that suggests a far-reaching web of systematic conspiracies is unsourced and appears to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. This article suggests that a credible source believes there is such a list of systematic conspiracy. This is misleading to the reader, as well as being original research. If there is a TV documentary that discusses seven Bush family conspiracies then documenting that documentary would be encyclopedic; picking seven(ty) <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28radio%29_d83f.html" title="Alex Jones (radio)">random whining idiots'</a> blog entries into an article is just <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article clearly and expressly presents these as conspiracy theories, it does not assert that all are true. (Indeed, it seems to go overboard in this.) Many are widely-believed. This is a great place to debunk any false charges. Actual conspiracies do abound, "tin-hat" pejoratives notwithstanding. Every accusation of a criminal or covert operation is initially a "conspiracy theory" until, bit by bit, the evidence mounts that it is likely true or false. (Some die-hards will always deny this truth, so it is almost never black-and-white. Many actual conspiracies are never proven -- false negatives. So there will always remain a grey area.) Some proven examples include the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Contra_Affair_3376.html" title="Iran-Contra Affair">Iran-Contra Affair</a> (illegal arms sales to Iran as an attempt to free hostages from Hezbollah and obtain money to illegally fund the Nicaraguan contras); the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_of_Pigs_2c0b.html" title="Bay of Pigs">Bay of Pigs</a>; the CIA-supported overthrow of Iran's democratically-elected leader, <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Mossadegh_24b7.html" title="Mohammed Mossadegh">Mossadegh</a> (who was replaced by Shah Pahlavi, whose repression led to the Iranian revolution of 1979 and current rule by mullahs); the CIA-supported overthrow of Guatemala's democratically-elected <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobo_Arbenz_Guzm%C3%A1n_48fa.html" title="Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán">Arbenz</a> (who won Guatemala's first universal-suffrage election with 60% of the vote, marking the first peaceful transition of power in Guatemala's history); the CIA-supported overthrow (and murder) of Chile's democratically-elected <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Allende_6d40.html" title="Salvador Allende">Allende</a>; <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enron.html" title="Enron">Enron</a>'s manipulation of energy markets with fraudulent business practices like "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_%28Business%29_2fb1.html" title="Death Star (Business)">Death Star</a>"; the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Incident_a0b8.html" title="Gulf of Tonkin Incident">Gulf of Tonkin Incident</a> (a fabrication which prompted <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> to dramatically increase US troop levels in Vietnam; etc. <b>All</b> of these were denounced as "conspiracy theories," for many years. All are now known to be true. Given the role of GHW Bush as CIA Director, it strains credulity to believe that the full truth is yet known about operations he supported then and as President. The revolutionary beauty of Wikipedia is that it is both a repository of knowledge developed from the grass-roots (unlike top-down knowledge which stems from goverment- or corporate-funded research), and a platform for the development of that grass-roots knowledge. Go ahead and debunk all false claims, this is part of Wikipedia's mission. But please do NOT delete this page.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Some of the theories are nonesense, like alien reptile ancestry of the Bushes, but there are many serious and well substantiated historical facts here. The Bush family membership in <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a>, the manipulation of the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections via bogus "felon" disenfranchised in Fla, where brother Jeb is Governor and questionable vote counting and vote suppression, whre the Secretaries of State in key states Ohio and Florida were also the Bush Campaign Chairs, the extension of executive power, Neil and the savings and loan scandal, Rumsfeld meeting with Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war, Cheney's ties to Halliburton, which gets most large military contracts, the Project for a New American Century involvement of many administration officials, GHW Bush employment by the CIA at the time of the Bay of Pigs, and Prescott Bush's involvement with and profiting from being a banker for the Nazis, are as well established as the Teapot Dome scandal duting the Harding adminintration, or Clintons dalliance with Ms. Lewinski. They are issues of history, not speculation. Put them right onto the main article pages if they are removed from here. Why aren't they on the main pages for the appropriate Bush?

His clan deserves more scrutiny, given the role of his father (both with the CIA and as President), brother Jeb (esp. in Florida 2000), brother Neil (in the Savings &amp; Loan scandal), Uncle Jonathan (in the Riggs Bank money-laundering scandal), and grandfather Prescott. Contrast that family network with Bill: you have Hillary and Roger. That's it. This article belongs here precisely because of the power the Bush family has exercised.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Regardless of whether you agree with the theories, some of the theories mentioned have been taken seriously in the world's media. And in particular the linking of Oil to the Iraq invasion is accepted my almost everyone in the UK regardless of whether they support the war or not, certainly friends of the Bush family if not the Bush family itself will profit from Iraqi oil. I think it is accepted that there are links between the Bush family and some relatives of Osma Bin Laden in Saudi Arabia too. So even if its all rubbish it probably deserves a page, even if it is there to debunk these theories.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 22:29, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Clearly the article would need a lot of work. The nom complains WP "is NOT a repository of all things conspiracy" which is true, though there would seem to be notable conspiracy theories about the Bushes. Nom also complains "article presents them as reality" but this could be dealt with by differentiating fact from allegations. Also <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_crime_family.html" title="Bush crime family">Bush crime family</a> which redirects to this seems to be a more common term (187,000 hits on Google for +"bush crime family" -wikipedia). The concept of a <a href="../../../g/u/c/GUCT_303b.html" title="GUCT">Unified Conspiracy Theory</a> linking all the crimes and alleged crimes committed by or connected to the Bushes, as the title suggests, would appear to be a less common concept. Even the introduction indicates that's not what it's about though by stating "various conspiracy theory allegations."
