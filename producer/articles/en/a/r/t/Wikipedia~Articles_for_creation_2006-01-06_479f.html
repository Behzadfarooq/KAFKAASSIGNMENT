<p>Heather Sit, an average citizen of Raleigh, North Carolina, will be the next female president of the United States of America.

She has great plans for her future, including teaching, law, political advisorship, and of course, politics.

However, her responsibilities will not corrupt her, as they have Karl Rove. A revolution in governmental policy is sure to come.</p>

<p>Marakweta of Kenya</p>
<p>There are no such people as “Marakwet”. The word is a corruption of Markweta. It is a sub-tribe of the larger Kalenjin group with an estimated population of 200 000. It is made up of the sub-dialects Almoo, Cherangany (Sengwer or Kimaala), Endoow, Markweta (the sub-dialect giving rise to the common name), Sombirir (Borokot) and Kiptaani who presently predominantly live in Marakwet District in the North Rift Valley Province of Kenya. Some now live in Trans Nzoia East and Uasin Gishu North districts and indeed in other towns in Kenya. A few more have moved to live in as far away places as Australia, Southern Africa and even Washington / New York in the USA. Some of the greatest long distance and especially steeplechase runners in the world have come from amongst these people.</p>
<p>They lead a simple rural life characterised by mixed small scale farming and keeping of dairy cows, sheep, and chicken. They grow mostly maize, potatoes, beans and vegetables in the highlands. Those who live along the escarpment and the Kerio Valley keep mostly goats and beef zebu cows and grow millet, sorghum, cassava, vegetables and fruits mostly mangoes and oranges. There is a sophisticated pre-historic irrigation furrow system that supports this crop cultivation along the Kerio Valley that is thought to be over 500 years old.</p>
<p>The Marakwet were formed in groups/sections/clans characterised by their recognition of no authority higher than the asiswo (the assembly of all adult males of the section). They forged a form of association through their common residence along the Kerio Valley and the slopes of the Cherang’any hills.</p>
<p>The territory occupied by the Marakwet is one of the most beautiful and picturesque parts of Kenya, bounded to the east by the Kerio River at 1000 m above sea level, which runs through a small branch of the Great Rift Valley. To the west it includes almost the entire Cherang’any hills which rise to 3 300 m above sea level west of the Marakwet escarpment.</p>
<p>The Marakwet district headquarters is at the hilly town of Kapsowar. Other rural centres/towns are Chebiemit, Kapcherop, Cheptongei, Arroor, Chesongoch, Chesoi, Kapyego, Tot, Sangach and Embobut Mosop.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Vicki Shiran</b> (February 28th 1947, Cairo, Egypt- March 15th 2003 Telaviv, Israel) was defined as an Israeli "Sephardic feminist warrior". She was a leader of the intergenerational struggle for Mizrahi Jews consciousness, a multi-faceted activist, a feminist, journalist, scholar, poet, film maker. she never stopped challenging the foundations of Israeli governmental and ideological domination and hegemony. Her fresh thinking, articulated in activist and scholarly writings.</p>
<p>Vicki Shiran immigrated to Israel when she was 4. She spent her childhood in the HaTikva (Hope in Hebrew)slum. When 13, she was forced to leave school and provide for her family. She therefore continued her studies through evening adult education. She received her B.A. and M.A.from Tel Aviv University, and a doctorate in Criminology from the John Jay University of New York. In the last decade she taught at the Beit Berl Teachers' College and the Hebrew University. Last year she has founded Israel's most original Gender Studies program at the Beit Berl College. 57 years of age, she died on March 15, 2004, after several years of struggling with breast cancer.</p>
<p>Vicki Shiran, an advocate of equal rights of men and women alike, played a key role in the fight for the advancement of Mizrahim - Jews who immigrated to Israel from the Arab World and other Third World countries. She embarked her political activism in the early 1970s, taking part in the political theater of Jaffa. In 1981 she initiated the highly original "Israel-That's Me!" conference, discussing the rifts between the Ashkenazi establishment and Mizrahi and Palestinian-Israeli citizens of Israel in the open for the first time. This led her to establish the New Direction Stage at the HaTikva slum, where she and her activist friends invited Ashkenazi politicians and public figures so that they hear their criticism about the overlap between Israel's ethnic and class divides. She sued the Israeli broadcast authorities in the Supreme Court for the exclusion of Mizrahi representation in the fancy anniversary TV series, "The Pillar of Fire". She was from the inception of Israel's feminist movement, she joined, always criticizing its exclusion of Mizrahi women, however. In 1991 she and friends initiated the Mizrahi Women's Group, that lead to the 2001 establishment of Ahoti (Sister) - For Women in Israel. In 1996 she was among the foundersof the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow, who sued the government of Israel in the Supreme Court, and won, on issues of public housing and land ownership. During the last years of her life she led the successful legislation drive and lost Supreme Court suit against the broadcast of pornography on public TV.</p>

<p>There is a section of Brussels, Belgium, called "Les Marolles" that dates back to the Spanish occupation of the Belgian Provinces at the time of the Inquisition (circa 1500). That region of the Capital of Belgium has retained its own identity and a language of its own "Marollien". Recent new constructions are destroying parts of the "Marolles" and its language is fading fast. It was a patois combining French, Flemish and Spanish (i.e.Moukere for woman).</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any reference or literature that petains to "Les Marolles"?</p>

<p>Ixwa (or Iklwa) was the name given to a short-handled stabbing spear ("assegai") developed by Shaka, King of the Zulu tribe in what is now South Africa. The spear was named for the sound it made as it was pulled from the living flesh of its victim.</p>
<p>Developed specifically for man-to-man combat (a necessity brought about by an offensive formation called "the horns of the buffalo" which flanked the enemy on both sides), it played a key role in the dominance of the Zulu military during the 19th century before Europeans were to settle the region.</p>

<p>you should do a little thing about control unit prisons now! i cant believe you do not have anything about these places yet this is just absolutley ridiculous. tell someone to do an article on one because i write like a 3rd grader</p>
<p>all i can tell you about control unit prisons is that they are supermax prisons in which prisoners are tortured psychologically through means like starvation, sleep deprivation, and lack of social contact iwht other prisoners. These prisons are supposed to brainwash the prisoners until they become zombies that walk around and do what ever they want them to do.</p>

<p>Burchell Alternative School, formerly known as Mat-su Alternative School, was christend after Peter Burchell, a retired former principal of Mat-Su Alternative School. The idea of an alternative school was considered insulting to the "traditional" schooling of "traditional pupils". Peter Burchell had the notion towards improving students with difficulties in their daily life. Some were considered as failures, or high school dropouts, or even worse, those who couldn't cut it in real school. There was a heated debate between the Mat- Su School District on wether the alternative schools should even exist. Burchell is a unique school that tailors to the educational needs of some, to the compromised schedule of others, or to the one-on-one teacher-student needs of the rest.</p>

<p>Etensive Inc. specializes in multimedia services. The company will launch many services in 2006 each serving a distinct professional field that currently lacks a centralized medium for the advertising marketplace.

<p>Grey Daze, nowadays more populair because of the presence of Chester Bennington than the musical content of the band, was formed in 94' and released a first album shortly after. 'No Sun Today' features 12 songs and can best be described as a mix of elegant instrumental play and the influential voice of Bennington. The tracks on the album mostly represent Bennington's childhood pain, which can be heard in songs like 'Just Like Heroin' and 'The Down Syndrome'. After the second album, 'Wake Me', Grey Daze split up.</p>

<p>The Pussy Football League is a padless football league that came from humble beginnings. Started in August of 2002 by a group of New Orleans teenagers looking to play pickup football, the league has since grown to dozens of players with weekly drafts and games. The league is commissioned by Yinchen Li and vice commissioners Kirk Wessman and Richard Talens. The name "PFL" was coined by Richard "Dick" Talens through a process in which he created an analysis of characteristics between the league and the National Football League.</p>
<p>The league includes a formal Big Board, a draft of players, an All-Pro Roster, and a Hall of Fame. The PFL is well known by New Orleans residents who love the game of smash-mouth padlesss football. Games are commenced on Mithun Field, across from the University of New Orleans.</p>

<p>National Skyline is a band from Champaign, Illinois, originally formed in 1996 by Jeff Dimpsey (former bassist for Hum) and Jeff Garber (formerly of Castor) with Garber on vocals. The music features lush synth and electronic sequencing layered with often complex rhythms and melodies from acoustic instruments. In 1996, the group appeared with a track titled "Euroak" on the "Sweet Sixteen Volume 2" compilation on Parasol. Their 1999 seven-track, self-titled debut was recorded at Dimpsey's home studio and released on the Hidden Agenda label. However, Dimpsey departed soon after. In 2001, the group released a four-song EP titled "Exit Now" on the File 13 label. Several months later, the "This=Everything" LP was also released. Although not officially disbanded, National Skyline has yet to record any other material. In the meantime, Garber has started another project called Year of the Rabbit, who released an album and toured in 2003, but has been inactive since that time.</p>

<p>Breath Weapon is a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> ability of several monsters in Dungeons and Dragons - dragons, half-dragons, dragon turtles, dragonnes, chimeras, hydras (<a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyro.html" title="Pyro">pyro</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryo.html" title="Cryo">cryo</a>), hell hounds, certain demons, and other creatures. However, it is most often associated with the dragons and half dragon monsters.</p>
<p>The Breath Weapon ability is the power to exhale some sort of deadly energy (fire, electricity, acid, etc) or a gas (metallic dragons only?) that <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paralyses.html" title="Paralyses">paralyses</a>, confuses, or otherwise incapacitates an opponent (stuns him).

<p>A Breath Weapon is imagined as either a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Cone.html" title="Cone">cone</a> or a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line.html" title="Line">line</a> of the above-mentioned energy or gas. Other supernatural and spell-like abilities (like mind blast) also use the cone or line shape to indicate the affected areas. However, the Draconomicon introduces a number of breath-weapon-related feats and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spells.html" title="Spells">spells</a> that allows more options about the area, affected by the breath weapon.</p>
