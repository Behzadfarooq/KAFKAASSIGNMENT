<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-28_f82e.html" title="Edit section: Pachislo (Japanese slot machine)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pachislo (Japanese slot machine)</span></h2>
<p>Pachislo is a Japanese slot machine. The Japanese pronounce it 'Pa-Chi-Su-Ro'. In English, it is pronounced ‚ÄòPachi-Slo.‚Äô Pachislo is really a combination of two words, ‚ÄúPachinko‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlot.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pachislos are authentic casino machines. Some Pachislo machines have video LCD screens and/or an additional reel, called the 4th reel, to enhance play. Pachislo machines can have up to five different lines of play and accept 1-3 tokens per play. Pachislo machines are designed to use and dispense tokens, but most can be converted to accept US quarters. However, converting your Pachislo machine to accept quarters may be illegal in your state, even if it is intended for home use only.</p>
<p>Las Vegas style slots are auto-stop machines, meaning the spinning reels stop automatically. Pachislos are referred to as skill stop machines because the player has to manually stop each of the spinning reels, by pressing the corresponding button under each reel line. This gives the player a sense of being able to control the outcome. (This small difference is also why Pachislos, or skill-stops, are legal in most states.)</p>
<p>Ironically, there is no skill involved with Pachislo. The moment you spin the reels, a random number generator on the main board determines whether your particular play is a winner.</p>
<p>Another difference between traditional slot machines and Pachislo is the Pachislo has a knob on the front instead of the traditional side pull chrome handle that is seen on the Las Vegas style one-armed bandits.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest difference is with Payouts. In Vegas style slots, if you hit the "Jackpot", the entire jackpot is immediately dispensed in the coin tray. If you hit the Pachislo version of the jackpot, called the "Big Chance," you are guaranteed to win a certain number of tokens, usually 360 tokens. However, you are awarded the tokens over a series of subsequent spins during the "Big Chance" or bonus period, depending on the Type.</p>
<p>TYPE A - In the "Big Chance" round you have 24 guaranteed winning spins that will total 360 tokens. The "Big Chance" round is broken down into 3 sets of 8 guaranteed wins, between rounds 1 and 2; and again between 2 and 3, you will notice the music changes; this is a bonus period where the odds of hitting a higher combination increases. This bonus period continues until you hit a free spin or "replay" combination. It is possible to win up to 500 tokens in the "Big Chance" play mode based on your skill level when stopping the reels in the bonus period between rounds.</p>
<p>TYPE B - (Challenge Game)- The "Big Chance" round operates the same as a TYPE A machine, except that if the "Bonus" light is lit when you enter the "Big Chance", you will have up to 201 consecutive spins. Your payout can be up to 750 tokens and it may take 15-20 minutes to play out the entire "Big Chance" round.</p>
<p>SETTING PAYOUT ODDS</p>
<p>You can adjust the payout levels (odds) for your Pachislo. There are 6 different settings. The actual payout percentage will vary from model to model, but generally are within the ranges listed below:</p>
<pre>
     Level #1:   65%-67%
     Level #2:   72%-74%
     Level #3:   79%-81%
     Level #4:    88%-95%
     Level #5:   105%-107%
     Level #6:   115%-125%

It was 1965 when Edgar‚Äôs parents came to the USA from Bani, Dominican Republic. They only planned on staying a couple years before returning, but he was born. Growing up, he heard his dad walk around the house speaking in one of the many languages he had learned throughout his life. Everyday, Edgar would see him studying French, Italian, and even Chinese on the living room couch, always emphasizing how important education is. He told him and his brothers and sister how he loved to learn, but beyond that, he wanted them to have a good example when it came to studying so that they will love to learn as he does.</p>
<p>Both, Edgar‚Äôs father and mother taught through examples. Every time Edgar spoke something incorrectly, regardless of the language, his parents corrected him in a quiet and respectful way. As usual, he made the same mistake many times over and they patiently corrected him, until the day I got it right. They also applied this with religion. They believe highly in integrity, the Church, and are quite God-fearing people.</p>
<p>As a kid, Edgar and his brother were the only Hispanics in their elementary school. Although they were accepted by most, there were always those few that could not show tolerance for what they did not understand. They were constantly trying to assimilate. Because they moved so often, they had to start over many times during their childhood.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1980s, Edgar‚Äôs parents bought their first home. It would only be a few months into 1987 when they discovered the house needed more repairs than anticipated. One thing lead to another and he and his brother found themselves working to help their parents through financial hardship rather than going off to college. In 1989, he traveled to the Dominican Republic and saw the poverty that exists in certain areas of his parents‚Äô country. Although poor, people were happy. Edgar learned then that family, more than anything else, is what is most important in life. This lesson was valuable and put their situation into perspective.</p>
<p>He spent the next five years working in factories to help his family get by. He recalls friends telling him that he should move out as to keep the money to himself, but he insisted that his parents would make the same sacrifice had the roles been reversed and that someday he would be repaid for that sacrifice somehow. Although thankful, he still sees the regret in their eyes when they realized the sacrifice his brother and he made to keep them all under their own roof.</p>
<p>After that he leaped to the computers world and he did a great working first with a state hospital and then managing the network of Lynn city. Then, he decided to work with real estate, field in which he currently works for a government company and becoming an entrepreneur in real estate buying lands and building houses to sell later, starting successfully with a reconditioned condominium in Lynn. He know lots of people and practically everyone knows him and is glad to know him.</p>
<p>As a traveler, he‚Äôs visited many countries and could trace his family back to Extremadura, Spain on the Peguero side and Madrid, Spain via Santiago, Cuba on the Heredia side. Jose Maria Heredia y Heredia, french poet, is his relative as is Nicolas Heredia, writer, exiled from Cuba in 1898, died in NY.</p>
<p>Edgar‚Äôs father was once worked in the US Embassy in his country and had been a teacher. He gave all that up to come to this country. He worked in factories, leather mills, and metal shops to support his family in this new land. Edgar feels not only owe it to himself to finish, but also to them.</p>
<p>Now, with only a few subjects and credits ahead to get his Bachelor‚Äôs degree and many people proud of him, Edgar is a great living example of a good man, old fashioned, familiar, kind to everyone, respectful, intelligent and God-fearing. He‚Äôs an excellent role model to follow for his Godsons and soon for his own children.</p>

They started back in September of 2006 as part of a <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Enterprise_70d2.html" title="Young Enterprise">Young Enterprise</a> project encouraging young people to set up their own business. Sadly they left the competition on 26th March 2007.

<p>The Team go into schools around the Wigan borough and perform 20 minute presentations to children. Their presentation consists of sketches, videos, music, facts and games which makes recycling very relevant to the children of today.</p>

<p>Renowned for his dynamic soul-winning activities, Prophet T.B. Joshua, popularly called The Man In The Synagogue, is the Founder and General Overseer of The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations. The ministry started with eight members but today, the Lord has added to that number - through His Word by His Spirit - and the church has grown far beyond the shores of Nigeria. "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him..." (John 6:44). The flock is comprised of an overwhelming multitude of national and international worshippers. ‚Äú‚Ä¶And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved‚Äù (Acts 2:47). There is not enough space to record the miraculous manifestation of God‚Äôs power in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua. God's river of life - salvation and all of God's blessings - flow out from his innermost being to meet the needs of mankind. The miracles of Jesus Christ through Prophet T.B. Joshua are unlimited. They include the healing of HIV/AIDS, cancer, barrenness, deliverance from demonic spirits, restoration of sight to the blind, life to the limbs of the crippled and many others. NEVER A HEALER LIKE JESUS CHRIST (Matthew 8:16).</p>
<pre>
John 3:34-36: ‚ÄúFor the one whom God has sent speaks the Words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. The  Father loves the Son and has placed everything in His hands. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life‚Ä¶‚Äù 
</pre>

<p>Sidney Vincent Arbour, IV was born in Manchester, England, November 4, 1977. The first son of a third-generation textile worker, Arbour spent an uneventful childhood in Northwest England developing a strong work ethic and nurturing his signature obsession for all things alcoholic. He served for four years in the Royal Navy (mostly aboard the HMS Upton) before returning home to pursue academics. After a brief period of study at the University of Salford, Arbour was expelled for misconduct (allegedly with the 15 year-old daughter of a certain prominent member of the Hall√© Orchestra). Upon achieving a somewhat legendary reputation, he finally settled with an Irish wench and works as a clerk at the famed John Rylands Library. Arbour recently became an Honorary Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Brewers and has two children.</p>

<p>Joshua Mohoboob is a notable entrepreneur of great success, yet with little recognition. He grew up in 'Petts Wood' in Sidcup, Kent. Born in the late eighties, he had a deprived background, but was able to get a good education through a bursary grant that he was awarded. He attended Colfe's School from pre-school through to his sixth form education. Mr. Mohoboob was always acedemically proficient and especially exceeded in maths, for which he has won various awards in competitions. However he found his calling when he first studied Business Studies at G.C.S.E. Level. He continued to excel at this subject and really started to have high aspirations. Aiming for a place at an Oxbridge University, he started for looking for ways to further his business credentials. He was successful at gaining work, and work experience at various successful establishments. These include the international ebay personal auctions firm, auctioning4u.com, where he worked with the CEO Christian Braun, and also the exclusive high street tailoring firm Hawes &amp; Curtis on Jermyn Street. During his time at auctioning4u.com, he noticed he had a talent for dot com entrepreneurship. He has since set up two companies under his '4now' name: systems4now.com where he marketed his own written systems for stockbrokers and also website designers; and wholesale4now.com and retail4now.com where he marketed branded clothing to the public. At A Level he studied Business Studies, Economics, Politics and Design and Technology. His business talents were now clear and his tutors and peers all had high expectations. Mr. Mohoboob combined his Design talents and his Business prowess to produce his latest venture. After earning money from previous ventures and trading in the foreign exchange market he managed to form enough funding to invest in the 'Hugbot'. The hugbot is a silicone gel sleeve used primarily to protect 500ml soft drinks' bottles. However it has various other properties and features; it is insulating, it acts as a comfotable ergonomic grip, it is a fashion statement and has a clip to safely attach the bottle to bags etc. Joshua is currently in talks with international mineral water firms to market his product to them. This product also appeared briefly in an edition of 'Wired' magazine.</p>

<p>The Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles (DCHP) was published in 1967 in Canada's Centennial Year and was the first scholarly, historical dictionary on a non-dominant (Clyne 1992) variety of English. As such, the editors, Walter S. Avis (ed.-in-chief), Charles Crate, Patrick Drysdale, Douglas Leechman, Matthew H. Scargill and Charles J. Lovell, tread new ground in the field of historical lexicography.</p>
<p>While basing their work on the principles established by the Oxford English Dictionary (which in turn relied on some principles from Samuel Johnsons's 1755 dictionary and scholarly dictionaries of other languages, above all the Grimm brother's Deutsches Woerterbuch), the editors contributed a definition of an "-ism" that is now found in other historical dictonaries of non-dominant English varieties, such as Ramson et al. (1988) for Australian English, Silva et al. (1996) for South African English, and Orsman (1997) for New Zealand English; other historical dictionaries of regional varietes such as the Dictionary of Newfoundland English or the Dictionary of Prince Edward Island English always built from that base laid in the 1967 DCHP edition (DCHP-1).</p>
<p>Since 2006, the DCHP, which has not been updated in 40 years, is undergoing an extensive revision and update. This project, the DCHP-2 project (www.dchp.ca), is based in Vancouver at the University of British Columbia and aims to completely revise and update the DCHP-1 by 2013 (Dollinger 2006). This means that the ongoing revision of the Oxford English Dictionary (www.oed.com, whose revision started with the letter M in 2000, see Simpson (ed.) 2000) will be aided by the project on Canadian English in important ways, increasing the coverage and scope of English in North-America, with a pronounced focus on the much short-shrifted national variety of Canadian English (Brinton and Fee 2001) - a focus in its historical development.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-28_f82e.html" title="Edit section: Chaoyi Fanhuan Qigong">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chaoyi Fanhuan Qigong</span></h2>
<p>Chaoyi Fanhuan Qigong (CFQ) {pronounced: chow-yee fan-wahn chee-gong} is a simple meridian energy method (based on traditional Chinese medicine techniques) to drain stale qi (chi) and improve your health. It is a set of easy, gentle movements that look similar to Tai Chi, but are much easier to learn and do. CFQ was developed by Master <a href="../../../y/a/p/Yap_Soon-Yeong_0032.html" title="Yap Soon-Yeong">Yap Soon-Yeong</a> of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penang.html" title="Penang">Penang</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>.</p>
<p>"Chaoyi" means "above mental, superconscious, or psychic". "Fanhuan" means to "return to the original or rejuvenated state". "Qigong" means ‚Äúenergy work‚Äù or ‚Äúenergy method‚Äù.</p>
<p>In the context of CFQ, Qigong is defined as practical methods of dealing with consciousness in order to enhance our inherent resilience and the self-repair response and thus optimize health. Therapeutic benefits have been observed by participants in healing workshops within reasonably short periods of practicing CFQ. Practitioners learn how to neutralize and switch off stress responses, release energy blockages and unburden themselves of mental and emotional reactions that traumatize mind and body. For participants who trained from a few days to several weeks, health problems remedied include: insomnia, low energy, flexibility, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, chronic back, knee and ankle pains, gastrointestinal disorders and multiple environmental sensitivities. CFQ also aids in weight loss and problems caused by the processes of aging.</p>
<p>Most Qi practices fabricate a state of relaxation and calmness called "Qi energy" within the functional ability of the mind. Such a fabricated effect will not be able to cancel out the tension burdens that exist due to the stress of everyday life. Qigong is an art that has been practiced for over 5000 years. Different ideas have been introduced by different groups at different times, some sources estimate that there exist at least 20,000 types of Qigong practices and as many masters.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-28_f82e.html" title="Edit section: Relaxation Stillness Naturalness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relaxation Stillness Naturalness</span></h3>
<p>"Relaxation" means to "let loose" or to let go. It literally means "to do away with" or undo something that has been fabricated or created" or "dropping off one's strength". For example, if you hold a pen to write, your hand is not relaxed. To relax, you just have to open your hand out and let the pen drop. The concept of relaxation should be about doing away with what is not relaxed rather than creating a state of relaxation.</p>
<p>"Stillness" occurs at the mental level as well as at the consciousness level itself. When the body is truly relaxed, the person has a peaceful consciousness.</p>
<p>"Natural" means that one should not be fabricating disharmony that conflicts with nature, such as the greedy absorption of energy. It simply means to relax, open or loosen oneself and find peace.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-28_f82e.html" title="Edit section: Regulation of Body, Breathing and Heart">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Regulation of Body, Breathing and Heart</span></h3>
<p>Over emphasis on any single aspect can be dangerously misleading. Emphasizing the body suggests that one should make oneself strong. But strength contradicts looseness. An emphasis on breathing suggests that one must absorb nourishment from the air, but that conflicts with nature. Emphasis on the heart would not lead to peace, but to an inclination to overwork the mind with thinking and visualization. These elements need to be regulated and be in balance. CFQ will do this.</p>
<p>Loose Movements - Performing the exercises without strain or strength ensures the smooth flow of bio-energy and blood.</p>
<p>Relaxing the Hamstring - Song kua - "Kua" is the region where the hamstring meets the groin at the hip. The most helpful stance for proper execution of "Song kua" is achieved by placing both feet one foot apart and parallel to each other. Then bend at the knees and hips in order to drop your body weight. The angle of the bends should be about 15 degrees. Bending beyond 15 degrees will render the loosening ineffective. (It is a subtle bend only.)</p>
<p>Releasing Inner Strength ‚Äì Fajing - Begin with the body relaxed, arms hanging loosely at your sides. Lift the hands to the upper end of the pelvis with hands hanging loosely. Press down to straighten your elbows. At the same time, arch the hands so that the palms are horizontal to the ground. Hold for two to five seconds. (You may not be able to have your arms straight and palms horizontal. In case this happens, straighten your arm as much as is easily possible and raise your palms without creating tension in your palm, wrist or arm.</p>
<p>Method of the Heart ‚Äì Xin-fa - The unmoved heart is achieved when the mind is not attached to any conditions. There are no objectives, no pressures, no thoughts of right or wrong, success or failure. I need, I want, I must - no longer matter.</p>
<p>Calmness cannot be achieved by directing the mind, which will only rebel against such pressure. To demand calm will only provoke more restless thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>To be at peace, you have no motives or intentions. You are not perturbed by anything, not even the desire to heal yourself. This is the greatest secret of healing.</p>
<p>The hexagram is a sacred symbol of ancient origin from the "<a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a>" the book of the laws of changes. The Hexagram Dance is named for this.</p>
