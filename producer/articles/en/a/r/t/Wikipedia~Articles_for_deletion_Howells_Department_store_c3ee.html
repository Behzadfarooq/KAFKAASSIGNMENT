<p>Not notable; it's just a store. Full disclosure: I live near it, I shop at it, I like the place, but I don't see how it's notable. <a href="../../../s/t/l/User%7EStlemur_8a12.html" title="User:Stlemur">Stlemur</a> 06:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, English cities had these department stores and in at least some cases they had a real impact on the history of the place. Perhaps they are notable. In this case, the article is so bad, I can not tell, but let us not jump to conclusions. I suspect a lot of these major stores are really notable if the information is found. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:11, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It can be <s>recreating</s> recreated if something is found that is notable. Otherwise we'd have hundreds of stubs about non notable topics that we don't want to delete, because something <b>might</b> be found one day. We have to draw the line somewhere, and in this article's current state, it really means nothing. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGelston_4229.html" title="User:Gelston">Gelston</a> 12:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added that the store was used as a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a> filming location. I still don't think that makes it notable enough to merit an article though. --<a href="../../../s/t/l/User%7EStlemur_8a12.html" title="User:Stlemur">Stlemur</a> 17:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Added new information about the store history and one of its idiosyncrasies. This store is unique and deserves its own page. If, however, it is to be deleted then perhaps some of the information could be transfered to the main <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> article? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheep21_68f5.html" title="User:Sheep21">Sheep21</a> 18:26, 17 March 2007</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm seeing all these additions, but they need references. Without reliable sources these items could be taken as original research. I don't believe this store deserves anymore of a mention then a regular Food Lion in St. Petersburg, Florida would. Maybe a mention on the article concerning the company that owns it or the city its in. It just doesn't seem to have enough to be its own article. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGelston_4229.html" title="User:Gelston">Gelston</a> 18:53, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sources can be found for these additions, if you give me time to find the relevant books then I can provide page refs, titles and ISBN numbers.I can assure whats there is fact. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheep21_68f5.html" title="User:Sheep21">Sheep21</a> 19:2, 17 March 2007
<dl>
<dd>Then by all means, thats what Wikipedia is about. If you can create a good article with reliable sources about a notable topic, then more power to you. The article in its current state, however, doesn't present anything notable about this department store. Think of it from my view, its one of literally thousands of department stores. What makes this one stand out? Why does it deserve its own article? Although it may be notable in Wales, is it notable to someone living in Hawaii? Or Texas? Or New South Wales? I wish you the best of luck, but at this current time, I'm going to have to stick to my vote for delete. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGelston_4229.html" title="User:Gelston">Gelston</a> 20:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then perhaps this article ( Kicks Hawaii ) about a Hawaiian shoe shop should be deleted too, after all, I don't see why it would be notable to people in London, Moscow or Sydney although I don't deny it must be a notable store in Hawaii, much the same as Howells is a notable department store in Cardiff. Do you see my point? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheep21_68f5.html" title="User:Sheep21">Sheep21</a> 20:19, 17th March 2007.
<dl>
<dd>Its not notable, someone beat me to posting an AfD. What I mean by notable to other parts of the world, is that its a place that would be mentioned in a world travel guide. Somewhere you would want to go, specifically, when you go to that location. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGelston_4229.html" title="User:Gelston">Gelston</a> 09:44, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I only commented above. With the new material it is coming along to be notable. This is a store with history that I think has had an important role in the life of Cardiff. That is what makes this one stand out. And no, a store does not have to be notable to someone living in Hawaii. As Sheep21 says, there is virtually nothing in Hawaii that I think is notable, but that does not mean these things and people should not have articles. Keep adding the sources though. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thankyou for the support Bduke. This article has come along way in a short amount of time and I believe in a longer time frame can be expanded further again.
