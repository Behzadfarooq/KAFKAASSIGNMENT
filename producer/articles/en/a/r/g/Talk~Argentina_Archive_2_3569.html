<p>Map's caption says "<i>[...]including Argentina's claimed territorial sovereignty over the British Falklands (Malvinas) Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands[...]". That part of the sentence could be read as stating that Falkland Islands (Malvinas) are otherwise undisputed British territory. I would suggest changing the wording to "</i>[...] including Argentina's claims over the Falklands (Malvinas), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (disputed with the United Kingdom) [...]<i>". That wording would follow more closely the UN standards (see <a href="http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/WebView/6BB8B7912AB061D985256D1F006124AA?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/WebView/6BB8B7912AB061D985256D1F006124AA?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">this link</a>.

<dd>I think we are mixing 2 different things. The fact that "56% possess at least some Amerindian ancestry" doesn't mean much by it self. It doesn't mean that 44% are <i>"pure"</i> European, but not that the other 56% are <i>"pure"</i> aboriginals. If of your 16 grand-grand-grand parents one was an aboriginal and the rest pure Europeans, you will (almost) definitely <b>look</b> pure European. If instead of 4 generations we look further behind, this grows exponentially.</dd>
<dd>Can you call <i>"aboriginal"</i> to someone who had a single aboriginal ancestor 6 generations back?? I don't think so.</dd>
<dd>Then, it is true that in Argentina, and specially in Buenos Aires, there is a majority of European <i>"looking"</i> people, 44% of which are <b>pure</b> European.</dd>

<dd>Unlike most of its neighbouring countries, Argentina's population descends overwhelmingly from Europeans.

<dd>Unlike most of its neighbouring countries, Argentina's population descends overwhelmingly from Europeans. The basic demographic stock (88% of the population) is made up of descendants of the colonial Spanish settlers, augmented by descendants of later <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> immigrants. Around 56% of Argentinians possess at least some <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerindian.html" title="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> ancestry, due to mixing during the colonial period.</dd>

<p><i>[Back from indentation]</i> Just a few remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mixing of genetical stocks ("<i>mestizaje</i>") did not happen exlusively during colonial times, but also (and prominently) during the heavy foreign immigration waves of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. If you take the immigration stats, you will see that male immigrants grossly exceeded female ones. In the northeast of the country is quite common to see people with blond hair and blue/gray eyes, whose faces clearly recall their Guarani ancestors. Corach's 2004 study shows that aboriginal ancestry is more predominant in mitocondrial ADN traces, i.e., in inheritance from <i>maternal</i> lines. Two other factors contribute to genetic mixing: internal migrations from rural areas to the cities during 20th century, since many of the migrants came from areas where indigenous population was above the general average, and migrations from neighboring countries witn significant indigenous populations, as Bolivia and Paraguay.</li>
<li>Please note that we are talking about genetic stock here. Therefore, if just one of your 32 5th generation ancestors (let's say, your grandgrandgrandgrandmother) belonged to an aboriginal people, the trace is still present... and coincides quite well with the current estimates of an indigenous population of about 3%&#160;:)</li>
<li>Both Corach's studies are not contradictory. The fact that 44% of the population has no indigenous ancestry at all shows an overwhelming presence of the "foreign" element, consistent with the relatively low numbers of indigenous peoples. Take into account that the number of individuals in the sample showing genetic traces of indigenous ancestry is around 5.6%, and that figure means that the individual got that genetic stock both from his/her mother's maternal line and his/her father's paternal line (but still half of his/her ancestors could be non-indigenous).</li>

<p>"Around 56% of Argentinians, however, possess at least some indigenous Amerindian ancestry (as discovered by genetic research).

<dl>
<dd>One half-Amerindian 'great-great-great grandfather' over 700 years (or the less than 500 that Europeans have been in the Rio de la Plata area) would not be statistically significant in the genetic testing, I think the threshold is around 2% of one's ancestry. So the figure may actually be higher. This is a matter of interest precisely because some people seem to be so offended by the thought that not all Argentines are pure-bred Europeans. Personally I'd be only too happy to find that my criollo ancestors came from a variety of backgrounds and can give me an interesting range of stories and histories to claim as my own.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Middle class</span></h2>
<p><i>Compared to most Latin American countries, and even today, while it is recovering from an economic crisis, Argentina has a very large middle class. Many of these middle class people work in industry, own small businesses, or have government or professional jobs. They live in tall modern apartment buildings or bungalows that have small yards or gardens. Wealthy Argentines and business executives live in mansions and luxurious apartments in the cities or in fashionable suburbs.</i></p>
<p>I strongly disagree with this statement, as it fails to see the economic reality in Argentina. Before editing it, though, I decided to provide some data to prove my point, and to have a discussion. Qualitatively speaking, Argentina had a strong middle class, and a very strong economy (one of the strongest in the world)which attracted immigration in the early 20th century. After WWII, however, the economy stagnated at first, and receded in the 70's and 80's. When comparing poverty in Latin America to that in Argentina, it does have, on appearance, a different look, as poverty in Argentina is urban (while in LA it is mostly rural), it affects the former middle class (which means, they live in apartment buildings as oposed to rural indigenous communities in LA). That is the OUTLOOK of poverty, not the LEVEL of poverty. How can it be said that Argentina, compared to other LA countries has a strong middle class when, using <a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html" rel="nofollow">CIA Factbook data</a>, <b>43%</b> of Argentines live below poverty line, while it is 40% Mexico, 22% in Brazil, 21% Uruguay, 20.6% in Chile, 18% in Costa Rica? Don't trust CIA data, let's go the World Bank: in 2004, poverty in Argentina had been "reduced" to 40.2% <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/ARGENTINAEXTN/0,,menuPK:316034~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:316024,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/ARGENTINAEXTN/0,,menuPK:316034~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:316024,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, while in Mexico rural porverty in 2004 had been drastically reduced to 27.9%, and urban poverty to 11.3% <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/MEXICOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20626825~menuPK:338403~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:338397,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/MEXICOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20626825~menuPK:338403~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:338397,00.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and in Chile overall poverty to 17% <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/CHILEEXTN/0,,menuPK:325283~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:325273,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/CHILEEXTN/0,,menuPK:325283~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:325273,00.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. When using this data, the "strong middle class that lives in apartment buildings and owns their own businesses" represents only a SMALL percentage of the total population that lives pretty good, while 43% of them live under poverty.</p>
<p>Do you want qualitative data? Fine. Percentage of cell phone lines with respect to total population: Argentina 16.6%, Mexico 26.5%, Brazil 24.8%, Chile 40.2%. Percentage of internet users with respect to total population: Chile 22.6%, Brazil 7.7% (quite low), Mexico 10.3%, Argentina 10.5% (while it is not lower than the rest of LA countries, it is on average... no difference, not better).</p>
<p>There would be more data to support my point, even though percentage of population below the poverty line should be enough. How can a country have a strong middle class when 40.2 percent to the population lives under poverty? How can it be "stronger" than the rest of LA if population under poverty is half in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Costa Rica according to CIA, and we should include Mexico, according the new data for 2004 provided by the World Bank! <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 129.119.32.17 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.119.32.17_7acc.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.119.32.17">contribs</a>) 14:47, 3 November 2005.</small></p>

<dd>I've often thought that paragraph was misleading as well as a bit overgeneralizing. I must note that the definitions of poverty may differ from country to country, though. I'd prefer the following:
<dl>
<dd><i>Argentina has a middle class that has been decimated in the successive economic crises that afflicted the country. In times past, however, the Argentine middle class was very large compared to that of other Latin American countries. Today, while a significant segment of the population is financially well-off, they stay in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it. Most middle class people work in industry, own small businesses, or have government or professional jobs.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>We should mention upper-middle and upper-class people living in <i>countries</i>, closed neighbourhoods and suburbia, as well as the phenomenon of countryside landowners suddenly enriched by the agricultural exports boom. I don't have reliable figures on that.</dd>
<dd>It's very difficult to characterize a whole country in a few paragraphs. For sure, you can walk around some places in Argentina and see a flourishing middle class with spots of poverty here and there. The poverty figures can misleading; distribution of income, and geographic distribution of poverty, may be more important. I believe we have the <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gini_coefficient.html" title="Gini coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> somewhere, no? I think we can also get data on poverty by province or region, at least in order to mention them in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">Economy of Argentina</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Argentina_c41c.html" title="Demographics of Argentina">Demographics of Argentina</a>. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would agree with your suggested paragraph, with a few changes, though. Definitions of poverty used by the World Bank are universal: percentage of the population that lives under $2 a day. For extreme poverty the definition is percentage of population that lives under $1 a day. Poverty figures are not misleading, they are, in fact, very precise. (I must admit that CIA takes into account each country's own measurment of poverty, that is why I would trust World Bank figures better). Flourishing middle class with spots of poverty here and there... I assume you haven't been to Jujuy, to Salta, or to the villas miseria of Buenos Aires, where people are living in precarious conditions with no sewage systems, no paved roads, brick houses with aluminum roofs (if at all), and a great number living by searching food on garbage dumps. The Clarin newspaper provided a while ago a nice graph with poverty figures across provinces: in Capital Federal poverty was 24%, while in the Buenos Aires Province it was 56%, and in the Northern Provinces 70%.</dd>
<dd>Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that there is no middle class in Argentina. There is, and in fact, it has been flourishing with the impressive recovery of 2003-2004. But to say that this small middle class is representative of the whole population is misleading. If 40.2% of the population lives under $2 a day... I can't say it is "spots of poverty here and there", when they are actually "everywhere".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please, edit my suggestions as you see fit. You have the data at your fingertips already, and that's what is needed. In any case, I do see a problem with the WB definition, since 2 USD is not the same everywhere. Relative prices are different and exchange rates can be severely distorted on purpose (as is painfully obvious to us Argentinians). I'm more than aware of poverty; I live 30 minutes from the centre of Rosario and I only need to walk five blocks to be <i>inside</i> a villa miseria; however, walk another ten or so blocks, and you'll be in a nice avenue, and a few more blocks and you'll find a massive shopping mall always full of well-off customers. That's why I said "some places".</dd>
<dd>If we quote the poverty figures alone, it looks as if Argentina hosts a mass of terribly poor people, plus many others struggling not to fall into poverty, and everyone is ruled by a small upper-class elite (as is the case in some regions). If we mention the traditional strength of the middle class (which was never lost completely), we give the impression of a country that is more or less OK (which is true of other, much smaller regions). A better idea would be to mark the difference between old and new poor (historically marginal people vs. former middle-class people), and talk a bit about upwards social mobility (i. e. how many of those poor people have a chance of leaving poverty behind). Maybe too much for this article, though. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<dd>All discussions on economic stuff are quite controversial, and non-economists love comparative (and competitive)jargon: they love to talk about the "richest", the "poorest", the "highest GDP", the "best" country etc. As an economist I can say that it is hard to make a qualitative analysis and comparison of the economies of different countries, especially in Latin America. Let me give you my opinion on the matter.</dd>
<dd>Pablo, you are right, 2 dollars can buy a lot more stuff in Argentina than in the US, but ALSO, wages are much lower in Argentina that in the US. In other words, you might adjust for price differences (as with a <a href="../../../p/p/p/PPP_b55e.html" title="PPP">PPP</a> method if you want to avoid the sometimes "unrealistic" exchange rates), but if you also adjust for wages, it might be the case that even a greater percentage of the population would be under poverty line. The <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_Factbook_bfe4.html" title="CIA Factbook">CIA Factbook</a>, for example, uses the PPP method, which means they adjust <a href="../../../g/d/p/GDP_35c9.html" title="GDP">GDP</a> for price differences: that is why GDP per capita in Argentina is so high with this method (above $12,000), while GNI per capita as provided by the World Bank is less than $4,000. World Bank uses the Atlas method, an average over exchange rate history, in order to avoid differences caused by temporary fluctuations. Also GDP accounts for all production/income within the country (even if foreigners recieve the benefits) while GNI makes and adjustment for income in terms of nationality (after all, foreign firms take the money out of the country, don't they?). Which method is better? I guess there is no answer for that. With the PPP method non-economists say Argentina is the "richest" nation in LA (in fact this figure alone is the most quoted figure when "proving" that Argentines are better-off compared to LA). On the other hand, with the Athlas GNI Method, Argentina would be ranked fourth, and with only half the income per capita that Mexico has (and this income figure is the most quoted figure when "proving" Mexicans are better-off). Who is "better", Mexico, Argentina... or Chile, Costa Rica, Brazil...? I've visited many LA countries and your description of Rosario could very well fit a Mexican city, or a Brazilian city: walk a couple of blocks, and you are in a <i>villa miseria</i>, walk another 10 blocks, and you'll see an impressive shopping mall and beautiful buildings that could rival any American/European city.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I would suggest avoiding competitive jargon ("this country is better than that...", "These live better that those..."), and rather provide neutral and diverse data such as<a href="../../../g/d/p/GDP_35c9.html" title="GDP">GDP</a>, <a href="../../../g/n/i/GNI_9076.html" title="GNI">GNI</a>, <a href="../../../h/d/i/HDI_67d9.html" title="HDI">HDI</a>, the Gini Index, population below poverty line, population in indigence (extreme poverty), access to education, literacy rate, access to health care, labor by sector, unemployement rate, inflation rate, interest rates, access to private loans and equity, even corruption indices and law enforcement, given the fact all these can hinder/enhance the economic progress of a nation, and let the reader have a complete picture of the economic and social situation of each country. A section on history of the middle-class seems a very good idea too, though it would fit better in the article of the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">Economy of Argentina</a>. --129.119.25.30 15:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have taken my paragraph above, changed into something more linear and probably more correct, and moved it to the economy section. The previous version was in "urbanization", because of that mention of bungalows and mansions which was rather misplaced. I'll be trying to do some minor work on the article; then we can work on <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">Economy of Argentina</a> with the figures you cited. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Independence recognition</span></h2>
<p>The infobox tells us that Argentinian independence was first recognized by Portugal in 1821. There is, however, a prior recognition: King Kamehameha I of Hawaii would have signed a treaty of "Peace, Friendship and Commerce" with the then "Provincias Unidas del Rio de la Plata" in 1819. French privateer Hyppolite Bouchard, under the flag of the United Provinces, arrived there in August 1818, and remained in the islands during several months. Unfortunately, we have no direct evidence of this: the original treaty is lost, and the only extant piece of evidence appears in Jose Piris' memories. Piris sailed with Bouchard during his 4-year expedition around the world. But the fact is widely cited: it is mentioned by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolom%C3%A9_Mitre_5d73.html" title="Bartolomé Mitre">Bartolomé Mitre</a> in his "Historia de San Martín", in "La historia Argentina que muchos argentinos no conocen" by Armando Alonso Piñeiro (chapter 33), etc. Should we change it? Does anyone have any additional information? <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECinabrium_5144.html" title="User:Cinabrium">Cinabrium</a> 19:15, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Attested <i>official</i> recognition was by Portugal, but the above is very interesting and the source is clearly there, so it should be mentioned (as a note, maybe). A bio article about Armando Alonso Piñeiro, if possible, would add weight to the reference, too. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<dd>I'll try to found some biographical data on Armand Alonso Piñeiro. He's a well known historian, having published 70-something books, and director-founder of the "Historia" journal since 1981. The Hawaiian recognition is also cited by other well reputed historians (beyond Mitre and Alonso Piñeiro), as <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felipe_Pigna_8992.html" title="Felipe Pigna">Felipe Pigna</a> (<a href="http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/b/bouchard.php" class="external text" title="http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/b/bouchard.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>, a wonderful site BTW).</dd>

<dd>I made a mistake quoting Mitre. The right source is "El crucero de la Argentina 1817-1819", included in "Páginas de Historia" (freely available online <a href="http://www.e-libro.net/E-libro-viejo/gratis/paginas.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.e-libro.net/E-libro-viejo/gratis/paginas.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</dd>

<dd>There is also a good reason for the original treaty documents not being in the Argentinian archives: Bouchard never came back to Buenos Aires. He arrived on July, 1819, to <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valpara%C3%ADso.html" title="Valparaíso">Valparaíso</a> and immediately joined San Martín's expedition to Peru. Then Bouchard became the first admiral of the Peruvian fleet organized by San Martin with captured Spanish vessels, and served the Peruvian navy until 1828. Once retired from the seas, he remained in Peru until his death in 1837. BTW, Bouchard deserves a better article: when you walk on Santa Barbara's pier (Santa Barbara, CA; I use to go there very often because of academical activities at UCSB), you see a set of flags together with the Republic of California one. Those flags are a memory and a tribute to the powers that once held California, or part of it. And it is indeed a strange feeling to see the flags of the United States, Spain, Mexico, Russia and ... Argentina&#160;:). <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECinabrium_5144.html" title="User:Cinabrium">Cinabrium</a> 04:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Immigration from Latin America</span></h2>
<p>Besides the fact that the figures should read "between 2 and 4 million" rather than the full numbers with periods instead of commas... What is the source of the estimate of immigrants from other LA countries? I remember seeing this already, maybe in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Argentina_c41c.html" title="Demographics of Argentina">Demographics of Argentina</a>? Even 1 million seems a very large figure. If there's a source among the extlinks, maybe we should also name it in the text ("According to XXX, between 2 and 4 million..."). --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>The audio file which gives the pronunciation of "República Argentina" is wrong according to this:</p>
<p>[<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Es-Argentina.ogg#filelinks" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Es-Argentina.ogg#filelinks" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]</p>
<p>What's in the audio file is actually "Argentina, Capital&#160;: Buenos Aires", not "República Argentina". Can someone record that again?</p>

<dd>Official and unofficial numers very terrible. For instance: there are officially some 230.000 bolivians, but unofficial sources claim a million and a half.
