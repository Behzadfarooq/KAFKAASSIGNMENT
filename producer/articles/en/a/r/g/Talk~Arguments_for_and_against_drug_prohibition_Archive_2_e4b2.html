I removed it not becuase I doubt it is true but because it needs a citation. I am removing this again until it can be verified. Also, taking two cited facts and using them to create a third fact is considered original reaseach.

<dd>I should have said before, wikipedia cannot refer to itself for a reference as the point of a reference is to verify with an <i>outside</i> source. An enclyclopedia is a collection of previously published and accepted information, not a place for new information.

<p>I think you are a little too caught up in this whole citation thing; it's rather obvious and doesn't need citations. Or should it read: "Drugs can be used spiritually, medicinally, and recreationally, improving users' physical and mental health.<a href="http://erowid.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://erowid.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>"? 68.40.167.60 19:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, got it to resolve, that is a general landing page, a citation should lead you to the specific page that has the information backup up your claim. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 22:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, <a href="http://erowid.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://erowid.org" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> does not seem to be a <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">Reliable source</a> as they are not a primary source, and as a secondary source does not have any independent primary sources listed in their references, they have no references at all from what I can see.</dd>

<dd>Hey, excellent example of a citation<a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/medical/meduse.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/medical/meduse.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> of a secondary source that references to multiple independent primary sources.

<dd>ilegal drugs prerequisite an ilegal trader, so it's a truth of it's own, your further deduction implies a subjective opnion, and Should be delted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recreation</span></h2>
<p>why move recreation under personal freedom but not religion or medicine? The way I see it, recreation is one of the main ways to use drugs, and really the only reason drugs should be legal is so we can use them. 68.40.167.60 16:27, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since the content was so short it needed to be put somewhere, and recreational use means you use it for recreation. Medicine and religion are different than recreationg, so I put it under personal freedom. Personal freedom seems to match recreational use rather well to me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Small snipits of information should be worked into sections that encompass them until they are too large to fit. This is not a rule, but more of a guide in the manual of style(<a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>) used to give the encyclopedia a unified look. You can add valid information as you see fit and other editors will copyedit it, so you don't have to worry about this part too much. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 16:30, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What I meant was: the religious use snippit could be moved under personal freedom in the same way. Recreation isn't just a personal freedom thing, and everything is a personal freedom thing. Personal freedom could just as well be an argument for prohibition. 68.40.167.60 16:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I see now. Religion is a group activity, and while it does fall well within the range of personal freedom I think it also goes beyond it as a community issue. I don't see how personal freedom can be an argument for prohibition as personal freedom does not mean freedom over other people, it means freedom over oneself. I suppose one could claim they used their personal freedom to prohibit drugs, but I think that would be an abuse of the term. I could be wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would say that some arguement for moving the religeon information to the personal freedom section could be made. But I cannot agree that personal freedom can be seen as an argument for prohibition. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 16:48, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If drugs were legalized, we would gain the freedom to use drugs but lose other freedoms, so says the 'for' section. There is a cost to society as a whole as detailed in the economic section (money is freedom), and there would be more addicts who are slaves to their drug use. 68.40.167.60 17:28, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure what you are refering to, if the article is contradictory then seek citations to show whichc is right, and remove the wrong. It has not been shown here yet that legalization would increase addicts. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 18:48, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Legalisation is thus likely to increase drug-taking in society" "Proponents of drug prohibition fear a society with more addicts..." "If these same companies were able to sell drugs that were arguably more addictive and pleasurable, then chances are even more people would become addicted." It sure looks to me like "more addicts" is a reason for drug prohibition. 68.40.167.60 19:16, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like I said, nobody has found a citation showing that legalization would cause more addicts. Any statement to that effect needs to be attributed to the person saying it or removed. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 19:35, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Legalisation is thus likely to increase drug-taking in society" is original research, I have removed it. "Proponents of drug prohibition fear a society with more addicts..." is true, it is something proponents fear. "If these same companies were able to sell drugs that were arguably more addictive and pleasurable, then chances are even more people would become addicted." is also original research and has been removed.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for finding those, keep up the good work. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 19:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would just like to note here that the last one, "If these same..." has been reverted and is back in the article, apparently as unsourced as it was before. 68.40.167.60 16:23, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It has been reworded by another editor to attribute the statement to 'critics'. By attributing a statement to a person you can make it acceptable, as the encyclopedia is not saying "This is true", but is instead saying "This person says this is true". In this case the person is a hypothetical critics without a name. It would not be hard to find a citation for someone holding this view. I am not going to remove it again, but I am also not going to defend it. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 17:07, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If an unfounded claim is going to be presented here, it should be accompanied with a note saying that it is unfounded. 68.40.167.60 18:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, unless the statement can be attributed to a real person with a citation it should not be included as it can be mistken for a declaration of fact. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 21:52, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even if the statement is attributed to a real person with a citation, if what they are saying is wrong, the article should mention this also. 68.40.167.60 22:08, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, lots of things we consume are toxic to some degree, I think less toxic is a valid arguement against the prohibition of consuming an item.

<p>The facts are good, although the name of this section is a bit silly. Obviously anyone arguing against prohibition believes it causes more harm than good. It's just that instead of "Despite increasing amounts of money being spent on prohibition, drugs have become more accessable, cheaper, and more potent," it should say: "In the US, despite increasing amounts of money being spent on prohibition, drugs have become more accessable, cheaper, and more potent."

<p>For: Drug prohibition prevents harmful use.</p>
<p>Against: Drug prohibition prevents beneficial use.</p>
<p>The question is whether the harmful use prevented is worse than the beneficial use prevented is good and whether the difference warrants the energy spent on (or lost by) enforcing prohibition. 68.40.167.60 04:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree it was not vandalism. But it was harmful to the article. It is better to repair than destroy here. The problem is many people can share the same IP, so when an IP user does something that is harmful(such as removing vast amount of content) it is often assumed to be a vandal sharing the same IP as other editors. Basically, we have no way of knowing if you are the same person from one edit to another.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">invalid arguments</span></h2>
<p>Opponents of prohibition do often use foolish and invalid arguments such as 'alcohol and tobacco are bad for you and are legal, thus drugs should be legal.' Thus, there is a place in this article for them. However, the article should also mention that these arguments make no sense. 68.40.167.60 19:46, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The arguement is that the laws are inconsistent with the declared motives. This is relevent. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 20:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The argument 'The laws are inconsistent with the declared motives, thus drugs should be legal.' is also invalid. Here's an analogy: let's say I am policymaker for a country. I make shooting people illegal under the premise that firearms cause pollution, yet I allow use of firearms for other purposes such as hunting. Does this mean that shooting people should be legal? In short: Just because the declared motives make no sense doesn't mean the laws make no sense. 68.40.167.60 20:15, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The topic is not should drugs be legal. The topic is should drugs be prohibited. Thus the motive behind prohibition is relevent.

<p>Also, let me make sure I heard you right. You would support legalizing murder if the declared motives for making it a crime were 'cause it causes pollution?' 68.40.167.60 21:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And what exactly are the declared motives in this case that laws are incosistent with? 68.40.167.60 21:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I will take this on. While the argument that "drugs should be legal because some things worse for your health are legal" is incomplete, it's not invalid. Specifically, it can combined with the argument that "adults, as intelligent individuals, should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to engage in activities which may damage their health, and not be treated as children, who are presumed to be incapable of making such decisions". This argument has been used successfully to keep alcohol, tobacco, firearms, etc., legal, despite their obvious health risks. Thus, the same argument is being made on behalf of drugs which are currently prohibited. To state it more concisely: "If adults are presumed capable of making health decisions regarding the risks of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, then they should also be presumed capable of making similar decisions regarding currently illegal drugs". <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 07:36, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As the article states (I belive I put that in) A LOT more people die from over eating annually than Anything Else. yet overeating is not just totally legal, it's an innate cultural property of some western society--<a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDiza_c901.html" title="User:Diza"><font color="DarkGreen">Procrastinating<b>@</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/i/z/User_talk%7EDiza_270b.html" title="User talk:Diza">talk2me</a></sup> 09:46, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"If adults are presumed...then they should also be presumed capable of making similar decisions regarding currently illegal drugs." Why? Illegal drugs are not the same thing as alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. What qualifies as a 'similar' decision? What prevents me from substituting 'illegal homicide' or 'nuclear weapons' for 'illegal drugs'? 68.40.167.60 15:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's so obvious I don't know why you need to ask. Homicide and nuclear weapons have the potential to kill millions of people other than the decision makers, whereas drugs, if legal, would mainly only kill those who decide to use them. There might be a few "innocent victims", but certainly nowhere near the number who currently die from drunk driving and as a result of drugs being illegal (shot by drug dealers, etc.). <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 01:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We tried making alcohol illegal in the US during prohibition. It was an unmitigated disaster, giving rise to a Mafia culture that is only now starting to dissipate.

<dd>The argument that adults should not be protected from self-harm is already in the 'personal freedom' section, and stands on its own without statistics like "alcohol kills 80,000 people a year."

<p>Good point...I will drop this argument for 'inconsistency'.</p>
<p>I just think that this article should answer the question "why are drugs illegal?"</p>
<p>This is basically my thing with this article:</p>
<p>"The majority of the world's nations (everyone except the Netherlands) must have a reason more substantive than the few words currently in the wiki for their stance on drugs. What are those reasons? Personally I am against prohibition so I struggle to think of reasons for but there must some and they must be good.

<p>68.40.167.60 03:06, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are many reasons why certain drugs were prohibited but others weren't:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) The naive notion that "everything bad should be illegal" is common among young governments and young voters. Later, more experienced governments and voters tend to realize that some bad things, like divorce, should be legal, because the alternatives are even worse.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Drugs used in other cultures, like opium, were seen as "an evil foreign influence", while drugs with a widespread historical presence in the US were accepted as "normal" (such as alcohol and tobacco). Those with a business interest in the legal drugs, also lobby the government to eliminate the competition.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Those with a business interest..." I have been searching for evidence of this on the internet, and have found that it is a common claim, but have not found a way to confirm it. I think it's important because it implies that illegal drugs can help, medically, more than the legal ones. The drug companies know this, thus they lobby "to eliminate the competition." Anyone care to help? Where should I be looking? 68.40.167.60 14:42, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Or does "legal drugs" in this case mean alcohol and tobacco, and not pharmaceuticals? 68.40.167.60 14:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) After the initial prohibition, a self-perpetuating circular logic figures in: "if they are illegal, they must be bad, and if they are bad, they should be illegal". Thus, "anything that is currently illegal should forever remain illegal". <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 04:45, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think lots of people want a good reason for prohibition, but the worlds governments are not held to the standards of wikipedia, so it is only natural that we come to different conclusions. World leaders do not have to worry about <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> so they are able to make laws based on arguments that will not hold here. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 03:19, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But on that subject, Wikipedia can (and should) document the arguments they do make. Considering leaders and lawmakers are the ones actually enacting or upholding prohibition, their arguments should be fully reflected in this article.
