<p>"History of "Dubrovnik Republic...you keep it from being totally rewritten in bad English by an Italian and a Croatian nationalist??<br />
Sorry, Argyriou. Maybe some users have bad knowledge of English, bad you have bad knowledge of Croatian history, as well as of it's smallest independent republic, as well as of functioning of feudal system.<br />
You've never learned that <u>in feudal system, higher social classes spoke some other language, to distinguish themselves from lower classes</u>? That was the case all over Europe (this is a topic for an big article).<br />
So, you're messing with things that you don't understand.<br />
You haven't studied the matter properly. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubura_32cd.html" title="User:Kubura">Kubura</a> 13:28, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And please, don't stigmate Croatian users with words like "nationalists". This is a heavy word.<br />
Don't expect from people to be calm when someone is trying through perfidious ways to deny your country's right to existence, your country's history, and same those denyings pointed against your own people.<br />
If you simpathize Italy and Italians, that your business, but don't do that over the back of other peoples. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubura_32cd.html" title="User:Kubura">Kubura</a> 13:39, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Argyriou.<br />
I have to draw your attention on one thing here.<br />
Did you notice what user Giovanni Giove did?<br />
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Ragusa&amp;oldid=109842569" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Ragusa&amp;oldid=109842569" rel="nofollow">this</a> change on Talk page of Dubrovnik Republic.<br />
He was very selective in removing the sections. He removed the section he didn't want to be read. Other sections, that were (as I said myself) out of context, off-topic, weren't removed.<br />
If he removed all off-topic sections, I wouldn't make any fuss. But, he was selective.<br />
"Very neutral" attitude from that user. Have that in mind.<br />
Sincerely, <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubura_32cd.html" title="User:Kubura">Kubura</a> 10:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Revisionism_and_imperialism" id="Revisionism_and_imperialism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_Archive3_4aac.html" title="Edit section: Revisionism and imperialism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revisionism and imperialism</span></h2>
<p>Hi, again.<br />
Look what Giovanni Giove did here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Ragusa&amp;oldid=109842144" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Ragusa&amp;oldid=109842144" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.<br />
What should I do in this case?<br />
Report him to council of UN?<br />
Do ten more reverts? And get a title of "vandal, extremist"? And earn a warning from Wikipedia's top governing bodies, that I might earn a permanent expulsion from wiki? And actually be expulsed?<br />
Or Wikipedia doesn't care if some users (I won't tell names, no etiquetting policy) spread Italian imperialism and revisionism? <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubura_32cd.html" title="User:Kubura">Kubura</a> 10:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are the one being an extremist. Changing the titles of books and websites from Ragusa to Dubrovnik, when they clearly use "Ragusa" in the title is engaging in falsification. Removing mentions of the Italian heritage of Ragusa is falsifying history. Until you are willing to accept that history does not neatly fit your Croatian nationalist fantasies, and that spreading Croat imperialism and revisionism is contrary to the mission of Wikipedia, you should step back and not edit contentious articles. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 16:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Book titles were "changed"?<br />
Listen. Book "in Italian", but with English title? If you look better, the user who put the link, put a title "Ragusa: history and coins (in Italian)", but the book title is "Storia e monetazione di Ragusa, oggi Dubrovnik (Dalmazia). Interesting, the author avoids name Croatia.<br />
The second book, the contributor wrote a title "Book:Ragusa: the Fifth Maritime Republic (in Italian", but the book title is "Ragusa, la quinta repubblica marinara".<br />
Similar is the case with Dubrovnikan flags. The page is in Italian, so at least the contributor could put the page title in Italian. But no, he/she suggests the Italian cityname within the page title, "Ragusean flags".<br />
If we are going to write all in English, than respect <u>native</u> names.<br />
Second, this change and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Ragusa&amp;oldid=110188839" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Ragusa&amp;oldid=110188839" rel="nofollow">comment</a> is really problematic.<br />
Your previous answer even more. How can you say such things? You've lost any credibility here.<br />
Funny thing is, that someone wrote on the page "The Croatian language name was Dubrovačka Republika.[citation needed]"? Citation needed? But on that Italian page with the flags, you have Croat name also. Who's playing dumb on that page?<br />
<u>You were not reading the links on the books I've posted on the talk page.</u> "Translated from the Italian on the language of Dubrovnik" (<i>Istomaceno iz yezikka italianskoga u dubrovacki po D. Mauru Orbinu Dubrovcaninu</i>). Have you read that? If Dubrovnik was so "Italian", why the book needed translation? (the book is from 1621), see the section: "Croathood of Dubrovnik and translations".<br />
Dear child, you think that Republic of Dubrovnik was so Italian, that during the times of national awakenings in Europe, all their citizens stood by Croathood?<br />
Do you find Greece as German country, because of origins of their recent royal family? <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubura_32cd.html" title="User:Kubura">Kubura</a> 08:51, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no interest in dealing with fanatical nationalists who are unable to communicate civilly or to recognize that other points of view, for example, historical facts, have any validity. <b>You are not welcome to post on my talk page any more.</b> <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 16:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
