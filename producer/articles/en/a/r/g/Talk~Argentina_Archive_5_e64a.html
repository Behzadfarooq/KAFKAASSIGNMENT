<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethnicity</span></h2>
<p>I am sick and tired of those who constantly correct the paragraphs on Argentina's demographics to state that Argentina is a completely white country. Are they daltonic or what? Can't they see that in northern provinces there is a vast majority of people who are, directly or indirectly, of indian descent? Where the hell did they get that piece of info that Argentina is 97% white? May be those who wrote the World Fact Book just paid a short visit to Buenos Aires, looked around, asked a few questions and got the usual "Have you realised that Buenos Aires looks like Paris? Don't you think Argentine women are the most beautiful?" comments. But why doesn't it surprise me at all? Not recognizing that Argentina is a multicultural country is very typical of <i>porteños</i>.</p>
<p>Marcelo</p>
<p>Salta</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say some of us are also getting sick and tired of being attacked by your unconstructive, aggressive comments. As you may have seen (or not), we've been discussing this particular problem. I don't like the CIA WF but they <i>must</i> have used <i>some</i> method to get to that 97% figure. Buenos Aires + Capital + Córdoba + Santa Fe are mostly "European" and 2/3 of Argentina lives there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that you calm down and contribute instead of accusing. Up to this point this has been a content dispute. That's fine. If you continue to push your POV into the article without serious discussion, or just using insults, it will become vandalism, and treated as such. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

</dl>
<p>Yeah your arugments are very much flawed. All of the CIA world fact book information is VERY creditable. I agree with Pablo-Flores I am also sick and tired of being attacked by your unhelpful incorrect information The Northern Provinces are also still mostly European also So calm down. Stop trying to put your POV across and insulting other users. (<a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDJBenny_8514.html" title="User:DJBenny">DJBenny</a> 02:39, 4 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>The parameters of the CIA World Book published after the year 2000 relating to Argentina's population were changed to deem all Argentines as White, including native mestizos (ie. those who are and always have been Argentines, and are not mestizo immigrants or their descendants). The CIA today only considers the foreign mestizo population in Argentina as mestizo, bringing mestizos down to 2%. 1% is said to be Amerindian, and together they are supposedly the "3% non-Whites".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The Northern Provinces are also still mostly European also"? You must be kiding. Right? This is beyond a joke. To what lengths will you go? As the user said, go to Salta, go to Jujuy, go to Santiago del Estero, go to Corrientes, and many other provinces and the most common faces are those of mestizos. Buenos Aires is NOT representative of all Argentina. The mestizo element (I mean phenotypically mestizo, not just genetically) in the Argentine interior is the most predominant element, which is only THEN followed by whites (whether pure or perhaps merely phenotypically white), and to a much lesser degree Amerindians. These regions together may only hold 35% of the country's total population, but that is no small proportion. I will concede, however, that when I say that these regions are majority mestizo, I mean majority in the sense of anything over 50% (could be be 90%, could be 80%, or 60%, or just over the 50%) and the whites, depending on which area of the Argentina interior, may themselves go to close to 50%.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Statistic from Argentine institutions have never stated, and still don't state (other than those that merely regurgetate CIA stats), anything less than 15% as native Argentine (ie. not immigrant or descendants) mestizos. This 15% mestizo is what the CIA also cited until a few years ago, after which they decided on their own that the parameters would change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/a/14510.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/a/14510.htm" rel="nofollow">Ethnic groups: European 85%, mostly of Spanish and Italian descent. Mestizo, Amerindian or other nonwhite groups 15%.</a> (source: CIA)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given the fact that a simple visit to the country would easily prove that mestizos easily surpass 15%, I think it is just a grotesc and distorted POV to quote an obviously erred source which has taken upon itself to fabricate the figure of 97% based on parameters that it saw fit to apply for whatever reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, we already know that genetic findings of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Buenos_Aires_378b.html" title="University of Buenos Aires">University of Buenos Aires</a> have shown that the majority of the population also has some degree of admixture, even it for the majority of these those markers do not manifest phenotypically. I see that the findings have been removed from the article, yet again, with one users argument that the findings are flawed. The user based his argument on questioning the uniqueness of the markers used as indicators of Amerindian descent. With the aid of one website which I will discredit in the following paragraphs, the user argued that the markers used were not unique to Amerindian and were found in Southern European populations (a population that represents most of the European element in Argnetina).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if the user is aware, but <a href="../../../h/a/p/Haplogroup_Q3_%28Y-DNA%29_1e2d.html" title="Haplogroup Q3 (Y-DNA)">Haplogroup Q3</a> is indeed unique to the Americas, not found even in North Asia (from where the first Americans entered the New World), and much less Europe, or Southern Europe as he specified. I'm surprised the lengths people will go to deny the Amerindian heritage of Argentina. The mutation ocured in the New World, and is present by almost every indigenous South American, and most indigenous North Americans with the exception of the <a href="../../../n/a/-/Na-Den%C3%A9_languages_846a.html" title="Na-Dené languages">Na-Dené</a> ethno-linguistic groups (such as <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navajo.html" title="Navajo">Navajo</a>) and indigenous Arctic American and Canadians (Inuit, Aleut, etc) which are relatively recent entries into the American continent (around 8,000 years ago) and posess only Eurasian markers (which are common to Asians and some Europeans).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other markers (earlier Eurasian clusters) that are found in Amerindian populations but may also be found to a lesser degree in some Asian and European populations were not those used as he claims.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, the <a href="http://www.ipcb.org" class="external text" title="http://www.ipcb.org" rel="nofollow">website</a> which authored and hosts the <a href="http://www.ipcb.org/publications/briefing_papers/files/identity.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ipcb.org/publications/briefing_papers/files/identity.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> where he got his boloney, is an unscientific fring Native American group which has posted deceptive and purpusfull misinterpretations in the attempt to distort genetic research on Native American. There is a reason why they do this. The mere name of the group gives their neutrality a battergin; Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB). Their aim of discrediting Native American genetic reaserch, by their use of unsupposted and scientifically discredited claims is to discourage Native Americans from being solicited or seeking genetic testing, citing an abuse of Native American genetic heritage. They state indigenous people do not need the affirmation for their identity, and they then wrote article such as the one used as a source to fasely discredit the genetic works of the world's leadingg scientists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Noble as their mission statement may sound, <i>"The IPCB is organized to assist indigenous peoples in the protection of their genetic resources, indigenous knowledge, cultural and human rights from the negative effects of biotechnology"</i>, if you research the site a little, you will come to learn that a large slant of the groups motives is not so much a noble fight against "biocolonialsm", but to prevent science undermining indigenous mythology and oral history of the ancient populating of lands and their calims over property, ancient remains, and all economic benefits that derive from these.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, now I would like to once again insist that the genetic findings be reinstated in it's sumarised form as so tenuasly discussed and consensed here previously. <b><a href="../../../a/l/-/User%7EAl-Andalus_6db0.html" title="User:Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> 11:46, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Al Andalus, can you please state which academic journal the Corach et al study is published and peer reviewed? I would be interested to read the whole study rather than a brief summary of the results in a tabloid article, thanks. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColdheartedman_9d6c.html" title="User:Coldheartedman">Coldheartedman</a> 13:00, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Haplogroup Q3 is a Y chromosome which of course is only past on from the fathers side. Not of much interest when were are talking about 'mestizos' because according to Dr Corach over 85% of people with Amerindian ancestry are genetically Amerindian from their maternal side like elsewhere in Latin America. However, the fact that Argentina is overwhelmingly European in descent is something Dr Daniel Corach has scientifically validated. <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/62003474/ABSTRACT" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/62003474/ABSTRACT" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColdheartedman_9d6c.html" title="User:Coldheartedman">Coldheartedman</a> 13:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Will try. Till then, the concern is also about the "97% white" figure, and the fact that it is quoted in the article at all; considering the controversy over its accuracy.</p>
<p>While a simple visit to the country would confirm the true proportion of mestizos and whites, not everyone is as fortunate as us to have been to Argentina and know from experience. In common everyday perceptions for those who have been or live in Argentina, and a population history which corroborates it, the true ethnic distribution of Argentina more closely resembles the earlier data given by the CIA (the one which states 85% white, 15% mestizos, amerindian and others). All estimates given by Argentine institutions (which don't merely repeat the latest CIA figure) also estimates no less than 15% mestizos. So the concern should not be with these earlier CIA figures. BTW, even those earlied CIA figures a a bit conservative (Argentines who are discernably mestizo would be closer to 18 out of every 100 argentines).</p>
<p>The concern in fact lies with the data that states 97% white and only 3% non-white (ie. mestizo, amerindian) because they do not coincide with common perceptions of the country's true ethnic distribution. Independant of this, the fact that the CIA's current 97% "estimate" conficts with its own ealier estimate provided only a couple of years earlier (and greatly so, 15% down to 3% is no small margin) should be reason enough to make it a questionable source that shouldn't be used, for the sake of accuracy and verifiability.</p>
<p>Having said all that, at the end of it, both earlier and latter CIA figures state that Argentina had a white majority. If you really don't wanna use the 85% figure (which was originally cited by the CIA, agreed by Argentine institutions, and is the figure that most cloesly comes to reflecting the reailty as percieved by actually being in Argentina) then basically all the article should say is that Argentina has a white majority, and leave it at that without a figure being given. The problem is really only the citation of 97% in the actual article. <b><a href="../../../a/l/-/User%7EAl-Andalus_6db0.html" title="User:Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> 14:30, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>It's great the way the large Arab community, that even President Menem was a member of, is constantly deleted from the demographics section. And it is sited that figures from Islam in Argentina disputes the numbers of Arabs in Argentina. Not all Arabs are Muslims, especially the Arabs in Argentina, 70% of which are said to be Christians.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's awesome that I took it out, actually, because unless you find a creditable source to back up what you say, it's considered <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a> and doesn't have a place in Wikipedia. Pl ease find a source or stop adding it to the article. <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> has a "Good Article" status, let's try to keep it that way. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 20:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: And if you bothered to read the article I pointed you to, you'll see that the fact that not arabs are muslims is very clearly outlined in there. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 20:37, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we should remove the 3%-15% mestizo thing the more accurate rating is the 3 precent because the northerneast provinces are lowly populated. Al-Andalus calm down too you always try to stress your points way too much and it is clear there is some sort of biast behind them. Also you are comepletly wrong about the source not being creitable, It is very creitable. This is not the article that states that the Q3 (M3) is not solely found in Native Americans research done above by others also verify the vadilitly of the Indigenous Peoples Council article. It still stands. Also the gene the Clarin.com article is talking is also mentioned in Coldheartedman source <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/62003474/ABSTRACT" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/62003474/ABSTRACT" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>I've added it again because it was removed without good reason. You cannot simply put it in the userbox as it was, that is a highly ambigious way of wording the additional land to such an extent as to make it seem like the land is actually governed by Argentina when it isn't. Whether or not is been 'annexed' by the UK doesn't change the fact that Argentina doesn't have control over the islands at present. If that changes i'll be sure to remove that comment from the Argentina page and add it to the UK page. I will now be watching this article to ensure it sticks this time, or that there is a full and proper discussionn if people want to remove it. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 19:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Picture matter</span></h3>
<p>Hi y'all... as I said before, (<big>↑</big>Up there<big>↑</big>) I think that what would make this article a bit more 'good looking' is if we arrange some of the pictures. Most of the right side of this page is filled with images, it makes it kinda dull, there should be at least a touch of design creativity when making this sort of articles. To see exactly what im talking about check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CROWDUDE/Sandbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CROWDUDE/Sandbox" rel="nofollow">my sandbox</a>, isn't that just fine-looking? <i>Oh articolo bello! Mama mia!</i>... Alright alright, now other things that I noticed, there's a big blank space at the start of the History topic, I believe the Flag Memorial pic is causing it, doesn't looks pretty. Also if you see in 'Administrative divisions' and 'Geography' sections, the exact same map is being shown (except for the numbers), and they are practically very close together, when the reader is reading (Yes, readers read!), he'll scroll down and see the same picture, same color and division. I think that the image in 'Geography' should be changed with a satellite one, check the German version and you'll find one. And... that's about it.</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself... <i>Well, why don't you do it CROWDUDE?!</i>, the thing is, I dont dare to edit an article like this, too big and important, and if I do and then most of y'all don't like it, I'll be known as <b>the dude that screw up the article</b> or <b>the dude that sticks his finger on someone else's hard work</b>... so I'll leave it to you guys.

<dd>I should mention, I couldn't fit anywhere the picture of the Flag Memorial, it was making that awful blank space; if someone knows where to put it, go for it. Also, I was going to use the aerial topographic image that can be found on the German version, but I don't even know how to say Hi in german, so I couldn't understand the licence tag. If someone can help with that, it will be great. Or at least get a similar one to replace the image in 'Geography' section.

<p>I have placed the Urbanization section under 'Demographics', and out of Administrative Divisions. Administrative divisions should only deal with how the country is politically divided (as in all the other country articles I saw), and not with city populations and trends in demographics.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
<p>I have been trying to streamline the section I wrote on Music (probably my strongest area of contribution along with geography and demographics), to the point where I cannot trim any further and keep the information currently there readable. I have noticed that the article on Music in Argentina could use further expansion and I am willing to contribute to it. But I have a question:</p>
<p>Can I just transfer some of what I wrote here under 'Music', there? (cut and paste). They are my own words, of that you can be assured. All the information there basically came off my years of study and hundreds of articles and books that I have read, and of course general 2nd hand kwowledge. So is can I just do that? Of course, I would expand upon them significantly, and have the ability to do so, once I paste to that article (it's just to help me by simply just expanding upon what I wrote, and eventually the final product would look different anyways)</p>
<p>By doing this I could further cut down on the size of the paragraphs in this main Argentina article. A speedy reply would really be appreciated, as I would like to undertake this ASAP, while I have the leisure time to do so.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lowest elevation point: Valdez Peninsula or San Julian?</span></h2>
<p>For as long as I can remember I have read in argentine and international fact articles that the lowest point in Argentina is located at the Peninsula Valdes area, about 40 meters below sea level, which also is the lowest point in South America. But in the Geography of Argentina article (and the Santa Cruz Province article), it claims that the lowest point is at a location in Santa Cruz Province, -100 meters below sea level. I for one never heard of this.</p>
<p>I have been checking my hard copy sources and online and cannot find any independent substantiation for this, except the two wikipedia articles. This is a notice that if I cannot find any other verification, I will correct both articles and put the lowest elevation point in Argentina (and South America) as the Peninsula Valdez location.</p>
<p>EDIT: AMAZINGLY, at the website graphicmaps.com, the South America page indicates the lowest point as the Valdez peninsula at -105 feet or -40 meters below sea level ( <a href="http://www.graphicmaps.com/webimage/countrys/sa.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.graphicmaps.com/webimage/countrys/sa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.graphicmaps.com/webimage/countrys/sa.htm</a> ). But the Argentina page indicates the lowest point as 'Laguna del Carbo, just to the north of Puerto Santa Cruz - 344 ft. (105 m)'&#160;!!!!!!! ( <a href="http://www.graphicmaps.com/webimage/countrys/samerica/ar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.graphicmaps.com/webimage/countrys/samerica/ar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.graphicmaps.com/webimage/countrys/samerica/ar.htm</a> ) Unbelievable!! This reminds me of that joke that goes 'Maradona was the best football player in the world, and in Argentina he was among the top 10'.... LMAO.</p>
<p>It would appear we have a minor mystery developing... Obviously they both cannot be correct, and it's amazing this website has not caugtht this contradiction.</p>
<p>Every single other source is saying it's peninsula Valdez, and makes no mention of the other site in Santa Cruz. So... either that is an amazing coincidence and they are all wrong (as are my hard sources and what I had believed ), or the one site is wrong (well, half wrong as they did put Valdez in the South America part). I have to go with what I knew, my books say and all the sources say (even the one with the contradiction), and conclude Valdez and not Santa Cruz is the correct lowest point... but I wont make any changes based on the fact that Wikipedia claims it has been PROVEN not to be the lowest point (in the extremes on Earth article)...</p>
<p>This is all quite puzzling.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">South American cultural influence and Afro-Argentines</span></h2>
<p>I know this is a bit of a sensitive subject judging by previous discussion in this page about similar issues (though, quite frankly I don't see why), but the culture sections states Argentina's culture is primarily based on European culture. Now this is 100% correct, but to not also say that gaucho culture is firmly a mixture of european and native american, and that in the north of Argentina some native american or 'South American' customs are prevalent is somewhat misinformative in my view.</p>
<p>Along these same lines, no mention at all is made of the afro-argentines, of the past and today. This subject in particular is the focus of MUCH debate I know, even in intellectual and research circles, but I would like to add a few things about their contributions to Argentine culture and history. I just wanted to get some feedback here about both suggestions before I proceed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleaning up</span></h2>
<p>This article is in need of a major cleanup. I've started removing some content that was obsolete, or too detailed, or unsourced/unverifiable. In particular, I've taken out the issue of mestizo population, mostly, since <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mestizo.html" title="Mestizo">mestizo</a> is not well defined, and stats are not tuned for that (but there <i>are</i> stats about ethnicity, if not in the main census). I also took out the "beggars in the street" sentence, which is sentimentalish and irrelevant for the big picture. The discussion about Martín Fierro and Facundo is OK but seems too detailed; I removed the expression "<a href="../../../f/a/i/Failed_state.html" title="Failed state">failed state</a>" because it's a modern term and politically controversial, and unless somebody has analyzed the dichotomy using those terms, it's also <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</p>
<p>We need to source everything clearly and abundantly.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Flora/Fauna and Economy</span></h2>
<p>As you can see, I'm working almost full time during my off-period to improve this article! I'm somewhat shy of being 'bold' as they tell me, so it was hard to move 'urbanization' fro Administrative Regions to Demographics, but I think it ties in much better there and is in line with all other country articles, and with Argentina's own population and demographics section.</p>
<p>I want to expand a little on the vegetation and animals of Argentina, as the current section is seems whoefully inadequate for the size and variety of the country (I'm a believer that certain countries need bigger sections in one thing than in others: for example, European countries should have a longer history section than American nations, on the other hand American nations are much larger and deserve extended geography sections).</p>
<p>Also, the economy section dwells too much in the 'argentine crisis', to which there is already a devoted article to and several other mentions in this article. In fact, Argentina's economy section on this page has ABSOLUTELY NO information on what the country produces, what it's major industries are, and it's exports, etc, etc. To me that is a diservice. So I will expand Economy to include such information, which perhaps will mean trimming a bit the current information there (or creating a new subsection for transportation with highway, railway and waterway info). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_dugout_1b18.html" title="User:The dugout">The dugout</a> 15:36, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Argentina</span></h2>
<p>As you can see, the article is far more 'complete' than it was just a week ago. It had major holes such as no mention on education, science, print and media, a very poor plant and animal section. It also suffered from poor headings, topics under wrong headings, and poor flow (going from say, administrative regions to urbanization). Pictures did not match the topic discussed next to them.</p>
<p>Not that I like bragging, but the article now is looking much more robust and well constructed, subdivided, and complete with facts.</p>
<p>It is also about 85kb long. I have trimmed off all the sections unnecesary words (Like turning something like "The southern regions of the country are more inhabited by several species of animal life" to "The southern regions are inhabited by more species"), sentences with irrelevant information, etc. I will continue trimming things I don't see as fundamental.</p>
<p>But it is also a fact that many of the sections are cut down the near basic info already.</p>
<p>So the next step is first to create new articles for sections that have been created here that have no articles. The 2nd step would be to expand those sections that have good info here but their main articles are stubs. A third step would be to harmonize or expand the remaining articles. Of course this would all take a while to do, so in the immediate this article will not get much smaller. That said, I'm basically done with my contributions to this article (with only a brief overview of painters and sculputors, a mention of theater in Argentina which is very developed, and basic info on the military and fashion the only other things that are uncovered here).</p>
<p>I have seen that the policy of Wikepedia is for articles to not go much beyond 40 or 50kb. Many country articles however clearly surpass this. I generally agree with the Wikipedia policy, but some leniency for country articles should be given, considering that even stripping all the sections of the bare info (if the country has a long enough history, quite varied geography, and a very important cultural contribution), may yield articles longer than this. I know, (from my own experience too!) that many people, if they want info on a country, will ONLY go to the country article and if they need info on geography or music will go to the appropriate subsection and WONT bother much on going to the particular article. Out of lazyness really... I have been guilty of that myself. When people need info they believe that whatever is on the main country article is what really matters, so in my humble opinion sometimes trimming the sections too much and hoping for people to go to the specific articles is not always the case.</p>
<p>But let me state that it is my goal to eventually downsize this article, once appropriate separate articles for the larger sections have been updated, expanded, and harmonized. Everyone's opinion is welcome and sought&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_dugout_1b18.html" title="User:The dugout">The dugout</a> 02:36, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wanted to add: Canada would seem a good model to follow for this article. The Canada article is a star article, and it's 72kb long. That tells me that even though it is longer than what Wikipedia suggests, it is a robust and concise article which covers virtually all sectors of Canada, it's geography and culture. So that's a model we can follow, but it's not my suggestion we imitate it bit by bit. Argentina I think has a more expansive culture, and a more turbulent (sometimes depressing) history than Canada's, so clearly those sections might be longer in this article. But in general terms, it's a good model article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_dugout_1b18.html" title="User:The dugout">The dugout</a> 02:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>En realidad me parece que San Martin NO es la figura mas importante. En el año 1950 fue el centenario de la muerte de San Martin y Peron lo proclamo por ley como el "Año del Libertador Gral. San Martín". Estabas obligado a mencionarlo en cualquier publicacion. Trataba de esta forma que se asocie al Gral. Peron con el Gral. San Martin. Desde ahi que se lo considera como "el libertador" y se engrandece su figura. Pero en realidad pensemos que la unica batalla que San Martin peleo en Argentina fue la de San Lorenzo, que segun varios historiadores, como por ejemplo Felipe Pigna fue "una escaramuza".</p>

<p>Who change the estimation of mestizos from 3 to 15 to 3 to 20 there is any official source woth an estimation of 20%?? I change it again. If you add it please say the source and i won't change it.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>To the person that removed my citation regarding the 15% mestizo minority on the grounds it's 'old' information (because it cited the country as having 33 million people):</p>
<p>I can very very distantly 'accept' your reason for axing my citation (that it's old).</p>
<p>But do you honestly BELIEVE the mestizo population has gone down since then?</p>
<p>Let's be clear, in my opinion your reasons are ulterior, and I'm sorry if I sound like I am casting aspertions, but I am. I will find a CURRENT documented and peer-reviewed source for that number for you. Then, you will have to accept it.</p>
<p>Having an article that says Argentina has a 3% mestizo population as the only quoted citation dilutes credibility to the article, is that what we are trying to do?</p>
<p>If Argentina is 3% mestizo, then I also inherited the Golden Gate Bridge, Big Ben, the Colon Theater and the leaning tower of Pisa. Let's get real folks... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_dugout_1b18.html" title="User:The dugout">The dugout</a> 01:38, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

You know whats annoying people who try to prove there points like you do...

Dude I live in Argentina too... si asi es. No me vas a decir que la población es 97% 'blanca'. Me dicen eso de Islandia y me les río en la cara (por experiencia de mi tio que visitó y dice que ahora casi el 10% son asiaticos de origen 'groenlandes', y hasta algun que otro africano. Esa información de la CIA es ridícula, la misma organización que decia con seguridad que hay bombas atómicas en Irak.</p>

<dd>Dugout, as we say, estás gastando pólvora en chimangos. The CIA figure is clearly wrong; they don't explain how they got it, and we have better sources. On the other hand, if we don't know how many mestizos (whatever that means) are in Argentina, then we don't need to give numbers.</dd>

<dd>Every once in a while there comes an editor who doesn't like the fact that Argentina is part of Latin America, and "debate" ensues. Don't bother. If both good sources and your common sense coincide, just revert to the prior version; if it's been there for a while, it's because it's probably OK. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mancabia</span></h2>
<p>I was surprised to see at region in Argentina named Mancabia, which I not only never heard of, but of which there's is not references in the Internet. The region seams to overlap the northern Patagonia and the humid pampas. I'm not sure if this is what is sometimes called the <i>Temperate</i> Pampas, but in either case I suggest we change the name to this section, or merge it with the Pampa one.</p>
<p>Also article <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_Argentina_ed40.html" title="Regions of Argentina">Regions of Argentina</a> should be updated (it's just a stub), and referenced from this one. Perhaps we could also just move all the regions' information to the specific article and leave just a short reference here.

You are correct. I have searched online and not found references. So until that is the case it has been taken off.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding the size of the article</span></h2>
<p>Regarding the size of the article, I am always working to make the article more succint. But while Wikipedia's general rule is that articles should not be longer than a certain amount, they are more leniant with country articles. We can shrink all the sections to the bare bone and still the article will be 'longer' than suggested. We don't want to cut so much that people have to constantly open some other page. Trust me, from my personal experience, many of us are just too lazy and don't do it at all.</p>
<p>If I'm doing a research, or just want info, I want to have it all in one central article and not have to be opening dozens of pages to find relevant info (and have to read through so much detail!!). I agree those specific articles should be expanded, and I will help in Geography and Music, but the other ones I can use some help! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_dugout_1b18.html" title="User:The dugout">The dugout</a> 14:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree countries might have a bit longer articles, andthe size policy is a suggestion, not a rule. Nevertheless, being 3 times the suggested size, it is true that people trying to get a glipse of the country will get soon bored. Usually is best to have a short general briefing on the section, and leave the gross part for the sub-article. Of course, the more important the section, the longer it could be, never the less, sections such as <i>History</i>, <i>Economy</i>, <i>Demographics</i> (probably to merge with population), <i>Culture</i> (specially Music) could/should be compacted. I will atack now the Public Holidays section, since we already have <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_holidays_in_Argentina_8e36.html" title="Public holidays in Argentina">Public holidays in Argentina</a>.</dd>
