<p>(copied from my talk page at <a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">User talk:Deville</a>)</p>
<p><i>Why'd you revert "social democracy" to "social liberalism"? "Social liberalism" is generally a U.S.-centric term which means supporting the sorts of social positions the Democrats do, without reference to being economically liberal or conservative (or to being a foreign-policy liberal or conservative). In Europe, most of the parties whose platform is closest to the Democrats tend to call themselves "Social Democrats". The article social liberalism is rather confused, though the statement Social democrats believe in the moral right of the majority to regulate everyone and everything. Social liberals see democracy and parliamentarianism as mere political systems which legitimize themselves only through the amount of liberty they promote make it seem that the "social liberal" label should apply more to a tendency within the Republican Party rather than the Democratic Party, as that statement makes social liberalism sound much more capitalist than the Democrats.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a good question. I could be convinced that <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a> is a more appropriate label for the Democrats than <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_liberalism.html" title="Social liberalism">social liberalism</a> (BTW, you're right, that article is a bit opaque). But if you check my edit summary you'll see that my main objection is that the change makes the sentence no longer make sense. As written, one point of that sentence is to contrast the two liberal philosophies mentioned with <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_liberalism.html" title="Classical liberalism">classical liberalism</a>. In any case, I'm ok with you rewriting the sentence and putting a appropriate link to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a>, but I definitely think that simply making the change <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_liberal.html" title="Social liberal">social liberal</a> --&gt; <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a> makes the sentence weird. In short, I've no objection to a reference to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a> given that it fits into the article.

<p>The Anarcho-Capitalist page is already disputed, as you will see in the gray box in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> article. Someone keeps removing the POV tag from the page when it is quite obvious from the talk page that it is a disputed article. that is another obvious indication that that article is NPOV. why don't you send a message to the person who keeps removing that appropriate tag. is that person you? thanks for your concern, <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 20:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that some anarchists don't believe that anarcho-capitalism is actually a species of anarchism is not proof that the anarcho-capitalism article is written from a non-neutral perspective. Go read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and show me where the article is displaying a non-neutral POV. There's an old dispute on the talk page, after which the article was cleaned up significantly. There's an existing dispute on the talk page over whether AC is A, but that dispute is reported in the article. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> 21:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Regarding your comment on my talk page: please re-read my edit summaries and the talk page (over the last few months) for the article.

<p>Howdy, I noticed that you and I seem to post in one or two articles dealing with progressive issues in political science/sociology. There's currently a debate beginning in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Tea_Party_3189.html" title="Boston Tea Party">Boston Tea Party</a> as to whether the article should include the category <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Terrorist_incidents_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Terrorist_incidents_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It meets definitions set in the articles <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">Definition of terrorism</a>, however, there are several self-proclaimed patriots who watch BTP who refuse to recognise the fact. The simple criteria for terrorism generally seem to be <i>intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared</i>. Some users would rather use recent acts of terrorism as a yardstick, rather than using a firm definition, and hence lose their ability to discuss matters calmly. Would you be able to pop in to the Talk page and join in the discussion?

<p>Okay, I guess there's a dispute here. I recently edited a section on the Republican Party page because it was stated that Perot drained Republican votes. This was a GOP talking point for eight years, and no one has presented any evidence that it's true. In fact, the Democrats claim that Perot drained votes from both sides; if anything, in '92, he seemed to take a larger share from Clinton (the "change" vote). You edited the page, supposedly "removing POV" to restore the orignal (biased) contention that Perot drained Republican votes. Neither of us, it should be noted, has cited any source. I'm editing the page again, to suggest that this is an ongoing debate (which, apparently, it is). Fair enough? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.229.133.128 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.229.133.128.html" title="User talk:72.229.133.128">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.229.133.128_0cda.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.229.133.128">contribs</a>) 08:43, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I think your revised edit is much more fair than your earlier edits. I've seen estimates that, aside from voters who would have not voted (or voter for other third-party candidates), Bush 41 would have received from 50% to 80% of Perot's votes, had Perot not run, though neither the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot</a> article nor a quick Google search turned up anything so definitive. If I run across reliable citations for any of those, I'll add them to both the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party (United States)</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot</a> articles. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> 13:45, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>First of all, this was my first full revert of the section, so I hardly think I'm in any danger of violating anybody's policy.</p>
<p>Moreover, I reverted only as a salve for the violence being done to political discourse and the English language. If you start ruining articles, you can fully expect your work to be reverted.</p>
<p>I did what I did because the article had been edited to boast such phenomenal writing as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"On social issues, Republicans believe there should be a "safety net" to assist the less fortunate which, compared to their opponents, favors a greater degree of private funding, less expense, and stricter requirements for eligibility."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I dare you to diagram this sentence. The antecedents are so hilariously out of place that the sentence ends up "compar(ing)" "the less fortunate" to Democrats ("their opponents"). Similarly, the sentence states that a "safety net" favors "less expense." A safety net, being an abstract concept, cannot favor anything. Republicans can favor things, certainly, and that's what the sentence is trying to say--but if you diagram the sentence, you'll notice that it involves the "safety net" ITSELF favoring all sorts of things!</p>
<p>As if that weren't enough, safety nets are NOT a "social issue." Restributing wealth (via social spending) is, by definition, an economic issue. "Social issues" are things like flag burning and abortion. This is just a childish and rudimentary misunderstanding of public policy.</p>
<p>To continue:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Since 2001, the party has demanded much stronger accountability in the public schools starting with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can accountability be strong? I posit that it cannot. That's like saying that a certain form of energy has a "stronger renewability" than other forms--it's simply an abusrd thing to write. Clearly, one can propose a "stronger system of accountability" or one can make "a stronger push for accountability," but accountability itself cannot be "stronger."</p>
<p>Aside from those sections, the only major changes my revert involved were restoring the number of signatories to the Kyoto Protocol (Wikipedia policy suggests that factual, cited evidence should never be deleted) and deleting the unsourced claim that a majority of Democrats oppose the Protocol; it also involved reverting a POV edit which changed the word "aggressive" to "strong."</p>
<p>If you have another take--that is, if you think that important, well-written content was destroyed during the revert--I will be happy to listen to your side of the story. Alternatively, if you can explain why terrible writing, unsourced claims, and fact suppression is important to protect, I'll be happy to stop reverting. Let me know.</p>

<p>MacDonald's position is his position (and that of many others, including mine). Whether you consider him a reliable source or not is irrelevant.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look through the history of the Neoconsrevatism article - there seems to be a consensus that MacDonald is not a reliable source for anything. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 01:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The "consensus" is little more than the usual bullying tactics that call to mind schoolyard namecalling. Where are the concrete charges? But to get back to the point of my edit: The position of MacDonald, AdBusters, and others is A POSITION that this section completely leaves out. Regard that David Duke's position -- I sincerely hope that you don't find him any more credible -- and those of others with transparent agendas (e.g., David Brooks) are left in.WashCali 02:25, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would you be interested in a meetup in San Jose? I was thinking late summer of 2007. Let me know if you would be interested - I'm not trying to recruit you for the planning of it, just trying to take a temperature. I'm not interested in spamming talk pages, so I'm feeling out semi-local parties before I do anything. In case you don't see the connection right away - it was at that Afd.

<p>By global standards, the Republican party is a very far-right party, and those are the standards that wikipedia is created under so that there is a sense of perspective throughout all of the political articles. I can see you donate to extreme right-wing organisations, so I hate to break to you the kind of people you're supporting. You've already been told about posting authoritarian POV rubbish in articles, and I will be informing an administrator of your continued arrogant vandalism.

<dd>If you believe the Republican Party is of the same sort of ilk as the Aryan Nations, you need a severe perspective adjustment. Now go away. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 22:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My Grandfather was an African-American, and life-long Republican. There are plenty of black Republicans who will never stop being so because it was the party of Abraham Lincoln. Many Libertarians are Republicans too - not because they agree with everything the Party says, but because they agree with most of it. We live in an imperfect two-Party-heard-only system. Until that changes, compromises are all we've got. That said, please stop harassing this user on his talk page.

<p>Honestly I was expecting some editor might do this.

<dd>I mentioned the POV issue in a post on the talk page, replying to the article's creator. I think there was some value in having the list within the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">Far right</a> article, so long as people don't keep trying to add <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party (United States)</a> to the list. I don't think there's any value in having it as a separate article, particularly with the modified title. And what's with the horrid “” quotation marks in the title? <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 20:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
