<p>...In the past few decades, the mestizo population has increased due mostly to internal migrations from the Argentine interior to Buenos Aires and other large urban districts.</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense If We're talking about an internal migration then the population would remain intact.</p>
<p>Demographics info is very far from scientific rigurosity (Your sources are newspapers for god sake!!) Only offical studies should be included in an encyclopedia otherwise the article is not neutral. Chelardo 08:21, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The paragraph you quoted above refers to mestizo population in the larger urban centers. It should be corrected, but it's not difficult to see what's wrong and it's rather rude to call it nonsense.

<dd>Sorry ,I didn't mean to be rude but I still think is far from scientific rigurosity, we're talking about more than 20 million people, and that my friend is a whole bunch of people.You should specify in the same paragraph the amount of individuals that were studied. In the USA no one would ever make that kind of statement because DNA studies are unethical and related to hate groups.</dd>
<dd>By the way, I think the paragraph meant to say the following:</dd>

<dd>Buenos Aires is the capital and its metropolitan area is home to one-third of all Argentinians; a (disproportionately) large part of <i>everything</i> Argentine (except the natural landscapes) is located there, or nearby. That's objectively true, so it's not surprising that we have more pictures from there. However, it's also true that the article should show more diversity. Like Argentino said, it would be nice if you took pictures of your place (or got someone else to take pictures) and uploaded them (try the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">Commons</a>, see e. g. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Salta" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Salta" rel="nofollow">this</a>). I've been doing this with <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosario.html" title="Rosario">Rosario</a> and places I've been to, such as Córdoba (regretfully I've never been to Salta, though I eventually will). This is a collaborative encyclopedia, which is wonderful because instead of asking others to do something, you can <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">go on and do it yourself</a>. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<p>True, <i>poteños</i> make up one third of Argentina's population (12 million people or so). Then, how come they don't even remotely think of the two thirds who don't live there? (roughly speaking, some 24 million people). Taking into account the proportion of people living in BA and comparing it to that of the rest of the country, any <i>porteño</i> contributor to this page would immediately have to realize that the article should show some balance, with no need to be reminded by that from a <i>provinciano</i> at all. But, of course, since the <i>hinterland</i> always comes last in your priorities, we have to sort of shout so as to make ourselves be heard.</p>

<dd>That is not true, more than half of us has something to do with the provinces, and has relatives there. We are one united nation based on work and friendship. If what you what you want is that we travel one thousand and a half kilometers to take a picture and upload it for free, you are asking too much. Come on it, is not that difficult. I've been to Salta but haven't got digital pictures, perhaps you can take a picture of Salta's cathedral or government house at night, they look beautiful. If you are ever going south you could take some pictures of the Calchaqui valleys and if you want to help us a lot you could take a picture of Cafayate's cathedral. But if you don't want to help even with <i>one</i> picture, don't blame us for the lack of photos. —<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentino_e642.html" title="User:Argentino">Argentino</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgentino_ed06.html" title="User talk:Argentino">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Argentino_e64d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Argentino">cont.</a>)</small> 22:27, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand the complains, but what you [Marcelo] say is not fair. We contribute to several provincial articles and pictures. Unluckily, its hard to obtain pictures from place far from where we are, and what's worse, many of us aren't even in Argentina.

<dd>There are users that hunt for copyrighted images and delete them, because they don't comply with the GNU license of Wikipedia.

<p>yes Marcelo you a wrong most Argentines live within Buenos Aires or the province so of course we are going to have a lot of pictures of it. Also it is the capital... and Buenos Aires has the almost same look as most other cities in Argentina even Salta except it is more colonial but still European nonetheless. You should also really calm down about all this you are getting angry over something not that big of deal. We are all one country. You speak like if Salta is a complete other country.(<a href="../../../x/g/u/User%7EXGustaX_feab.html" title="User:XGustaX">XGustaX</a> 04:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

In fact, when applied to large populations, it probably <i>underestimates</i> the number of people with NA heritage, especially since many of the false positives can be readily discarded by asking the person about its heritage (if they say they have a Samoan or Japanese female ancestor, for example). I think the observation is valuable, but it belongs in the article about genetic testing, not here. In any case one must assume that the scientists who conducted the tests <i>know</i> about these things and didn't just release a raw number without taking them into account.</dd>

<p>I never said it was impossible, just nearly impossible, sorry about that. Anyways, they have found that many Southern Europeans have these "Markers" and this matchs exactally to Argentina, since many are from Spain and Italy (Southern European countries). So therefore if a vast number of people where surveyed they could yield the results found in the testing. These "markers" would most likely show up in many Argentines since many are of Southern European decent. The "Clarin" article states very clearly what "markers" they used. All this matches the article I posted. The article clearly says many scientist simply just don't enough about these markers and only a few do. The Clarin article does not state that they know about how many people throughout the world share these same "halogroups" or "Markers" and therefore there is no proof that they knew about this. Also The article states for Native Americans testing and they compare to many different kinds of people in the world, so in context you can assume its not just the Native Americans in the US. So I hardly dought that also. Since there were also Native Americans that lived on the boarders of what is now the Canada and Mexico.

I am not why? because it hasnt been proven yet 100 why make an article that isnt 100 precent and that has many flaws? I agree that people have a right to make up there mind about opionion subjects the Demographics of Argentina are not this case however. The research reported by Clarin, althought it was professional it's was flawed. No point on adding flawed information or disproven imformation.(<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.60.161.63.html" title="User:24.60.161.63">24.60.161.63</a> 13:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Could you tell us where you're getting all these data from? You mentioned only one article, and that's what I criticized. It doesn't say that many Southern Europeans have the same genetic markers as Native Americans. The genetic study must mean something, or else no respected scientist would use it... Also, nothing is 100% certain, but neither is it true that people "have a right to make up their opinion" in every case. We should only present reputable opinions based on good science. Neither you nor I have the credentials to disqualify a scientific study based on our opinions. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<p>Pablo, you have not read the article very carefully it seems, I QUOTE now: "Some of the haplotypes attributed to Native Americans are also found in people from other parts of the world.Å A, B, C, and D are found in North Asia, and X is found in southern Europe and Turkey. In fact, the principal marker of haplotype B is called the "9 base pair deletion," and is found in some Japanese and almost all Samoans. Could they then be classified as genetically Native American?Å These tests cannot even establish with certainty that, for example, someoneªs motherªs motherªs mother was Native American‚they can at best establish a certain probability that this was the case." This makes it very clear. This is also a genetic study so this also must mean something, and yes your genetic study does mean something, but it does not mean that 56 precent of Argentines have Native American hertiage. It most likely means that 56 precent carry this "marker". So it does mean something I am not trying to say it doesn't mean anything. However, it is incorrect. That is all I am saying. Not to put down your Clarin article and make it seem useless but I dont think it belongs in the Argentine Demographics section. I presented this article to show you that it has been proven that Genetic testing for Native Americans is Faultly at best. Also, you say it does not support Native Americans from South America... Really then how come also do testing on Native Americans from South America? They state on there website they are for all Native Americans and have collected there genetical studies also from South American natives. Your right we don't we can only look at the facts, but these are both genetical studys and one clearly gives more detail about why the other is faulty.

Wow! This study is very interesting! This clearly disproves the Clarin.com article, that the way sciencists find Native American Ancestry is still flawed. I would have never known. I agree however, the Genetic study on Clarin.com should not be mentioned as this seems to be a newer study. I can see why such a high precentage of Argentines had the "Marker" as it occurs in Southern Europe,Turkey and Northern Asia. I don't think we should include old imformation on this article. The Demographics of Argentina should be factual not based on opinion of the reader as most sources will tell you.(209.150.51.78 01:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I repeat, the paper doesn't say that <i>many</i> Southern Europeans have the same genetic markers as Native Americans. The Clarín article is not "disproved"; the genetic study gives results that must be interpreted. The cited paper is not a newer study, it's just criticism of the method employed to identify Amerindian heritage. In light of the above, I've changed the relevant information in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Argentina_c41c.html" title="Demographics of Argentina">Demographics of Argentina</a> and here.

<p>Okay your right it doesnt say "many" but it does say Southern Europeans do. So just on the merit it must be atleast present to some common degree if they were able to find it in Southern European populations. Which would yield such closely results as 56 precent and not lets say 75 precent or so. Okay I agree about removing the genetic study because it is clearly too unclear if its 100 precent correct or not.</p>

I am not sure about this I mean I understand it gives it says nothing to reader, but however all the other Nation pages are like this. Okay how about something like "97 precent of Argentines are of European decent or so" . I can Understand your position though. It did anger me however, that Germans weren't even considered on the top 3. We all know as Argentines,Pablo-Flores, that Germans in Argentina are not all uncommon, in fact they are very common. The 2 precent Jewish estaminate comes from the CIA world fact book and is already a part of the Demographics of Argentina page so I just put that there instead of having the articles saying two different things. I hope your not critizing me for putting bogus stuff up this was all from the previous Argentina page with the exception to the 2 precent Jewish estimate. I am sorry if my changes were very drastic, however Al-Andalus changed much and did the same and if I remember correctly you weren't to happy with it either. haha its okay I have had those days myself =P (<a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDJBenny_8514.html" title="User:DJBenny">DJBenny</a> 01:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

Alright, glad to see a conclusionm. I would have to disagree with you on that one Pablo Germans have been a very important group moving to Argentina however most of them came after world war II so that be from 1945 all the way from 1955 around there. Even though we can not find an number of people who are German we know from our "common Argentine exprience" Germans are very common in Argentina. Many of the numbers I found were to varied so I really don't trust them. I found this one article: <a href="http://www.geographia.com/argentina/buenosaires/Index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geographia.com/argentina/buenosaires/Index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geographia.com/argentina/buenosaires/Index.htm</a> saying that Italian and German names today outnumber Spanish names. So Germans must be, and I know just from living in Argentina pratically all my life that finding out Argentines with a German Ancestry. Also remember to be "German" back in 1800's and early 1900's was a very loose term most of since many <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volga_Germans_b92e.html" title="Volga Germans">Volga Germans</a> came from Russia, which made up the bulk of Russian immigration to Argentina during the 1800's and early 1900's. Also from the Austrian-Hungrian Empire which much of there resident were also German. The reason I put German as the thrid because I feel that it is part of the "big three" for say obviously Italians and Spaniards are more. Tell me Pablo-Flores How is it learning Japanese?(<a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDJBenny_8514.html" title="User:DJBenny">DJBenny</a> 15:10, 24 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">I strongly disagree with the removal</span></h3>
<p>The study by Corach et al. is not wrong: the data in the article at <a href="http://www.ipcb.org/publications/briefing_papers/files/identity.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ipcb.org/publications/briefing_papers/files/identity.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (which, BTW, incurs in a lamentable confusion between haplogroups and haplotypes) is by no means "new research" invalidating the study. The characteristic distribution of A, B, C, D and X haplogroups is well known to human geneticists, and I'll be greatly surprised if Corach's team hadn't take that into account. But let's start from the beginning...</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the study say?
<ul>
<li>That 56% of the a 12000-people sample shows american aboriginal genetic markers from female or male lineage, or both (in 10% of "positive" cases).</li>
<li>The study shows that 53,3% of mtDNA samples didn't show Amerindian markers (the 56% result is obtained by the combination of the results on Y chromosome DYS199 marker [male lineage] and mtDNA [female lineage]).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who did it?
<ul>
<li>"Servicio de Huellas Digitales Genéticas" (Genetic Fingerprints Service), Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Universidad de Buenos Aires. The main researcher, Dr. Daniel Corach, is a widely known human geneticist, having published dozens of papers on genetic identification of human groups (just google for his name); his main aide, Dr. Andrea Sala, has also wide experience in the field and has published a number of studies on the same subjects (Sala A., Penacino G., Goycoechea A., Carnese R., Tomeo A. and Corach D. (1996). The Genetic Structure of Four Argentine Ethnic Groups Reflected by the Analysis of Ten STRs. Advances in Forensic Haemogenetics 6&#160;:662-664; Sala A., Penacino G. and Corach D.(1997) VNTR Polymorphism in the Buenos Aires-Argentina Metropolitan Population.

Reference Database of Hypervariable Genetic Markers of Argentina: Applications for Molecular Anthropology and Forensic Casework. Electrophoresis (1999).208):1733-1739. to cite a few).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What does IPCB's article say?
<ul>
<li>"<i>The concept of using genetic tests to prove Native American ancestry is of relatively recent origin, but there are many problems with it. Perhaps foremost of these problems is that to make a genetic test the arbiter of whether someone is Native American is to give up a tribe’s sovereign ability to determine its own membership and relations. But, even taken on their own scientific terms, these tests cannot do much to identify who is and who is not Native American, because they yield many false negatives and false positives. Therefore, they readily misidentify non-Native people as Native, and misidentifying Native people as non-Native, and the positive results they do yield are at best only probabilities. If these were medical diagnostic tests, they would never be approved or adopted.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>But the most important argument against this type of testing to establish tribal affiliations is that biology (and genetics) track just part of our tribal inheritance. These DNA tests treat “Native American biology” as though all Indians were essentially the same. But in reality, it is our traditions that make us who we are, not just our biology.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Who wrote it?
<ul>
<li>Brett Lee Shelton, J.D., Director of Policy and Research for IPCB, and Jonathan Marks, Ph.D., Professor of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina and a member of IPCB's Board of Directors. None of them is a geneticist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there any contradiction?
<ul>
<li>No, None at all. Corach's study indicates that a certain percentage of a population shows some established genetic markers.</li>
<li>Most specifically, they analyzed DYS199 marker in Y chromosome, and then the presence of haplogroups A, B, C, D and X2 in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).</li>
<li>The analysis of DYS199 marker differs from the search for haplotypes M3 and M43 that, according to Shelton and Marks, yields "false negatives". But even if the former yields any rate of false negatives, that would say that 56% is the lower bound of Argentinians with <u>some</u> (and I undrline "some") indigenous inheritance.</li>
<li>Haplogroups A, B, C and D are also present in Altaic populations; haplogroup B is present among Japanese and is prevalent among Samoans. In fact, the presence of that haplogroups is one of the main arguments in support of the theory of Asian origin of amerindians through Bering Strait. We should agree that Altaic and/or Samoan immigration in Argentina lacks any statistical significance that would yield to "false positives".</li>
<li>Haplogroup X is quite different. In fact there are three variants of this group (<a href="../../../h/a/p/Haplogroup_X_%28mtDNA%29_0bf1.html" title="Haplogroup X (mtDNA)">see</a>). X1 is not very significant, and is limited to North and East Africa and the Middle East. X2 is present in about 2% of European population, with a slightly higher proportion in Mediterranean Europe and Turkey, and higher concentrations in Georgia (8%), Orkney Islands (7%) and among Israeli Druses (24%). X2a is present among 3% of Native Americans, particularly among Ojibwa (25%), Sioux (15%) and Navajo (7%). "Distance" from X2a to X2 is similar to that from X2 to X1.</li>
<li>These data regarding mtDNA haplogroups geographical distribution is well known since long time, and of course known to Corach and his team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now let's make some assumptions...
<ul>
<li>If we assume that well known scientists became suddenly stupid and ignored the well known percentage of X haplogroup among European peoples, the Corach's study has a 2% range of error (do your own math!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusions
<ul>
<li>Corach et al.'s study and Shelton and Marks article point into different directions. The first studies human genotypes among Argentinian population. The second goes in subsidy of a political thesis (to which I strogly agree): that belonging to an aboriginal people is not a genetic, but a cultural issue.</li>
<li>Unless new research gives a counterproof to Corach's results, we should still consider them scientifically valid.</li>
<li>This is not a matter of "whiteness", "blackness", "brownness" or "pinkness" (for the Argentinians, and particularly those of Cordoba reading this, please remember the Cordobese chromatic scale: "verde botea, amarío patito y nero culíao" x-D). <i>Fenotypical" Amerindian inheritance in Argentina is not very significant, but by no means could lead to the ridiculous 97% CIA figure;</i> genotypical" Amerindian inheritance is significant. The great difference among the figures of population having Amerindian markers from paternal or maternal lineage and those having them from both shows the little numerical significance of aboriginal peoples in current Argentina's population and its development thorugh the last century.</li>
<li>Please bring the study data back (perhaps with a better wording, as "<i>a study [ref] shows that about 56% of current Argentinian population have at least one Amerindian ancestor</i>".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me do a final remark: we're speaking of genotypes, not fenotypes. We are speaking of genetics, a useful manner to trace our ancestry and the places from where they came. We are not speaking of "races", whatever that word means. "Race" is not a scientific concept, but a political one. And, as said in the <i>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</i>, "any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous."</p>

<p>Not at all Just because they have these markers doesnt mean they have Native American blood. if 56 precent of the population has them that is still be determined as some and not all. So why is that any different? They are both creitable sources and they contrdict eachother the Clarin.com article does not state they looked over these halogroups either so you can not simply put it back. It is not a 100 precent genetic research study. Where are your sources stating that sciencist know about this also? The Clarin.com Article doesnt state this infact it states the same 5 Halogroups used, that this very article is saying proves negative results.

<p>Well, i thought we agreed with the removal... What is your point? Your argument does not disprove or make the Clarin study any more convincing.

<dd>It is not the case that we can leave something out just because it doesn't look right. Cinabrium has provided us with a lot of information we didn't have before. Try to read it. I form my opinions with the information I have, and I have absolutely no problem with changing them. The study mentioned in Clarín <i>is</i> significant, and in fact I'd be glad to put it back somewhere, provided the possible problems are also mentioned, as discussed above. DJBenny, Clarín doesn't say that Corach et al knew this or that, but since he's an authority we should assume he didn't forget such important issues. Let me make myself clear: <b>I couldn't care less what the final result is, as long as it is both correct and correctly expressed.</b> —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

At least for me, I am sure they are saying the same thing,I dont think they are trying to leave anything out "just because it doesn't look right. I am not also saying the clarin article is worthless it is sigfiance but what does it prove? However your arugment is flawed because the Clarin article does mention they used Y-Chromsomes for research and Maternal DNA here where they say it: "En esa larga hilera de combinaciones que forman al Cromosoma Y, hay un marcador conocido con siglas y números: DYS199." You did not include the whole sentance it seems. This is exactally what the the other article is going against. You also said Johantan Marks has no genetic exprienece? You are mistaken then because if you click his name on the page it states that he is indeed an expert "Jonathan Marks, Ph.D., Vice-Chairman, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Charlotte. He brings expertise in molecular anthropology, evolutionary theory, history, human genetics, and sociology and philosophy of science." None of your information gathered however states what precentage is found in the Y-Chromsomes. And since they found that most Woman lacked this marker it does not determine that those 56 precent of Argenitnes had a Ameridian father. So your arguemnt is some what flawed.

Yeah to say Jonathan Marks is not a genetics experts and not finding out first is ridiculous. Also the M3 halogroup is linked with the DYS199. Known as M3/DYS199. <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1180698" class="external free" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1180698" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1180698</a> So yeah this does relate to the Idigenious peoples page because they say spefically this halogroup is not reilable. Another article i found states this "Seven biallelic polymorphisms (M3 or DYS199, M19, 92R7, M9, YAP, M2 or DYS271, and RPS4Y711)" So they are the same gene M3 and DYS199. So it is still not only a Native American trait just like what the Idigenious peoples website.

<p>Also might I add X2 is not found in only 2 precent of Europeans: "Virtually all (97.2%) haplogroup X mtDNAs from the Near East, the South Caucasus, and Europe were found to belong to subhaplogroup X2...." <a href="http://dienekes.ifreepages.com/blog/archives/000402.html" class="external free" title="http://dienekes.ifreepages.com/blog/archives/000402.html" rel="nofollow">http://dienekes.ifreepages.com/blog/archives/000402.html</a> it goes on to say once again what the IPBC said "Overall, it appears that the populations of the Near East, the Caucasus, and Mediterranean Europe harbor subhaplogroup X2 at higher frequencies than those of northern and northeastern Europe (P &lt; .05) and that X2 is rare in Eastern European as well as Central Asian, Siberian, and Indian populations and is virtually absent in the Finno-Ugric and Turkic-speaking people of the Volga-Ural region".(<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.60.161.63.html" title="User:24.60.161.63">24.60.161.63</a> 05:21, 30 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>24.60.161.63,<br />
Please read again what you have written. X haplogroup <i>is</i> found in about 2% of that population (however, you may find other figures up to 5%; statiscally good samples are rare). As I said above, X1 is quite uncommon, and your figure validates my judgement: 97.2% of X-haplogroup population belongs to the X2 subgroup. If you are really interested in this matter, let me suggest you a reading of the very article you are citing, Maere Reidla et al., "Origin and Diffusion of mtDNA Haplogroup X", Am J Hum Genet. November 2003; 73(5): 1178–1190.</p>
<p>69.16.84.36,<br />
I have not said that Dr. Marks has no genetics expertise; I've just said he's no a geneticist. His field of research is Anthropology, including the amazing field of Molecular Anthropology. If you take a look to the <a href="http://personal.uncc.edu/jmarks/pubs/main.html" class="external text" title="http://personal.uncc.edu/jmarks/pubs/main.html" rel="nofollow">list of papers</a> he published since 1991, you will see that they are mostly devoted to anthropological issues. On the other hand, neither I nor the Corach's paper are trying to say that 56% of Argentinians have an Amerindian <i>father</i> or <i>mother</i>, but that they have some (at least one) Amerindian <i>ancestors</i>. The marker will be present if the grand-grand-grand-mother of a subject's grand-grand-grand-mother was Amerindian, even if all the other 255 ancestors of the same generation were not. Unfortunately, I don't have the precise figures for Y chromosome tests (I couldn't put my eyes on the original paper yet) but some simple math helps&#160;:). If 47.7% of women had the markers, and the total figure is 56%, and 5.6% of the sampled populations show both paternal and maternal markers, men with Amerindian markers must be 13.9%. Anyways, this discussion is turning somewhat byzantine; I oppose the very concept of "race", and am just trying to point out that the hybridation between Aboriginal peoples and European immigrants was higher than the "common wisdom" might reflect.</p>
<p>DJBenny,<br />
Please excuse me, but I don't understand your point. Not being a native speaker, I have some difficulties for reading your English. Could you please state it again? Thankyou!</p>

Well, He can still be trust of course because of his background, it also states very clearly he is an expert in genetics so there is no arguing that point. All the research I have done it just validates his point even more. Yeah I am sorry I hope this is better, basically you said that the Idigenious peoples article only talks about the M3 and M45 haplogroup. yes this is true however, the clarin.com article spefically mentions very clearly that it used the DYS199 as you said. However, Cinabrium these are the same as you can see from the sources I looked up the M3 or DYS199 as it is also called. So the articles do contridict and one clearly shows why Native American testing is not reliable. So I think we shouldn't put up an article that is that clearly has strong research back behind it. I agree with you on the opppsition of "race" however, I don't believe putting up conflicting articles will make it any better.

<p>Not at all many he's has many papers on the that website that are about genetics. I agree with your point there DJBenny and Pablo-Flores maybe we could say something different instead of saying 97 precent of Argentines are white. However, the Clarin article is faulty , which this kind of thing happens in science often.
