If your interested you can check out the project at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gaelic_Games_2371.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gaelic Games">Wikipedia:WikiProject Gaelic Games</a>, and if you have any questions about the project feel free to drop a line on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Gaelic_Games_780c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gaelic Games">project talk page</a>, or you can drop me a line directly.

<dd>Hello Boothy443 and thank you for the invitation. I'd be happy to help with your effort, but I don't really have any specific knowledge about Gaelic Games; I was just editing those articles because they showed up on one or both of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_that_need_to_be_wikified" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_that_need_to_be_wikified" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_cleanup" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_cleanup" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> lists. Mostly what I did with my contribs on those articles was help with fairly mundane formatting &amp; cleanup task. I'm not sure what more I can do to help with this category of articles, but I'll take a look at the project page and see.

<p>Hi there. I was just wondering, could you possibly reduce the number of things in your signature? It is really hard to edit a page (AID maitaining) when I have to try to decode which part of you signature is causing the problem with our bot.

<dd>Sorry, I wasn't trying to cause anyone difficulties; I was just looking for a way to eligantly display several elements on the screen in a small &amp; compact area behind my screenname. The only way I found that I could make this work was to use what you ran across. The "coding" to make the sup &amp; sub text appear over each other is especially long, but it is as short as I know how to make it and still display as you see it. I'd be very happy to learn a better/smaller/cleaner way to display the same elements in basicly the same way. I’ve spent hours on the sigs found at <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgon233_sandbox1_ac15.html" title="User:Argon233/sandbox1">User:Argon233/sandbox1</a> trying to make this work better, but I'm still learning how to make the markup work the way I want. Feel free to added a better/smaller/cleaner version there, but please leave my current experiments too, if you don’t mind. Thanks,<br clear="all" />

<dd>I was thinking maybe you don't need so many different links on your signature? For example, you really don't ened another link to your userpage, or a link to a random page. I don't know, just a suggestion. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 02:41, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I kind of like the elements I have in my sig (which is why they are there). I reworked it this evening. I'll go &amp; replace my former sigs on the (AID) page with this new (hopefully) cleaner version.

<dd>Well, after I gave this more thought, I decided that you were right; I really don't need the random article link (though it was one on the features that I credit with my early addiction with Wikipedia), and the userboxes link was just redundant. Thanks,<br clear="all" />

<p>I see today you reverted the article on <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison.html" title="Poison">Poison</a>, removing what you identified as 'linkspam'. Can you tell me why you thought that link was a spam? I did not place it, but it struck me as an appropriate link for an article on poisons. It was a link to a US government statistical page where many poisons were listed along with the number of deaths by year they had caused. <a href="../../../p/z/a/User%7EPzavon_ab25.html" title="User:Pzavon">Pzavon</a> 03:04, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Pzavon, I'd be happy to explain what I did &amp; why. On on 2006-04-14 between 18:15:37 and 18:54:42 UTC, an anonymous user (62.1.125.94 (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.1.125.94.html" title="User talk:62.1.125.94">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.1.125.94_2364.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.1.125.94">contribs</a>)) placed one or more link to the <b>allcountries.org</b> website on the following articles: <i>Medicare (United States)</i>; <i>Cancer</i>; <i>Cardiovascular disease</i>; <i>Accident</i>; <i>Firearm</i>; <i>AIDS</i>; <i>Alcoholism</i>; <i>Poison</i>; <i>Abortion</i>. This anonymous user has not made any other contributions to wikipedia before or since.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I examined the site being linked to in all of these cases and discovered several things:
<ul>
<li>This is not an official US Government website
<ul>
<li>It is actually produced by "Photius Coutsoukis" and "Information Technology Associates"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The site includes google ads and links to other websites created/maintained/promoted by those listed above
<ul>
<li>The site appears to have either have been created by a hobbyist, a self promoter, &amp;/or in order to provide a revenue stream (the google ads) by reproducing the US Census data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While the site claims this material is from the US Census data, they do not clearly document how they obtained this data
<ul>
<li>The site does not properly cite their sources</li>
<li>The site does not properly describe how the accuracy of the material found there was/can be verified</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My conclusions:
<ul>
<li>For the site to qualify as a link from Wikipedia, I fell that the website needed to do a better job of demonstrating the accuracy &amp; verifiability of the material</li>
<li>For the site to qualify as a link from Wikipedia, I fell that the website needed to be more obvious that their page is not a official government website</li>
<li>US Census data is freely available at <a href="http://www.census.gov/" class="external free" title="http://www.census.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/</a> and a more appropriate link would be directly to the source material, instead to a derivative website of questionable value to the Wikipedia project</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>After reviewing the appropriate Wikipedia guidance, I removed the link you are referring to as part of a more general cleanup effort, which removed the links to allcountries.org placed on all of the articles listed above.

<p>This is a response to the info below. Not being an experienced Wikipedia editor, I am not sure how else to respond, so I used edit. Forgive me for not knowing otherwise, and go ahead and delete this if you so wish:</p>
<p>Dear Argon233,</p>
<p>This is a response to all the nasty talk about the external links to US census data that I placed on Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>Please consider the following:</p>
<p>1) My US census data web site has the exact data that I obtained from the US Census Bureau on CD-ROM.</p>
<p>2) I programmatically produced the web pages from the data, exactly "as is". Not an iota was changed, so, there should be no doubt about its authenticity.</p>
<p>3) There are significant advantages of my web pages over the official government US Census web site, but in terms of the ability to deep link to specific data, there is the obvious (and huge) advantage that you cannot readily do so on the government site. Theirs operates by means of presenting search results. That means that, whereas a link to a specific type of statistic is a click away to my specific US census web page, whereas in the case of the gov. web site, the link takes you where you have to do some work before you even find out that there is such a statistic.</p>
<p>4) The links that I placed in Wikipedia articles are only to pages that, as the editor of the POISON article pointed out, are totally relevant to the topic.</p>
<p>5) The fact that I have google ads on the pages should not be a deterrent to visiting or linking to my pages, because the content matters more than the ads. The ads help pay for maintaining those pages, just like ads help pay the bills in all sorts of excellent web pages and other excellent publications.</p>
<p>6) The notion of wholesale removal of the links to my US census data pages reminds me a bit of Senator McCarthy's wholesale persecution of well intentioned artists. The whole idea of a Wikipedia police motivated by such nastiness is somewhat frighteing.</p>
<p>7) Regarding the quality of my web pages and my own qualifications, I will just mention advanced age, long experience and exceptional education, and invite you to visit my page at www.theodora.com/wfb/about.html in order to see what I do, and to also let you know that there are thousands of unsolicited links to my web sites from universities, schools, government and corporate web sites, because they are so rich in useful content. All my web pages are absolutely child-friendly, without even a hint of anything that is adult-minded. Finally, you may want to do a search on Google.com for "Photius Coutsoukis", which may help you realize that perhaps I am a better critic of web page quality than yourselves.</p>

<dd>Photiusc, given that you are admittedly a new contributor, for now I am going to temporarily defer commenting on some of the unfortunate characterizations that you chose to include with your post. Likewise, I will not yet question if you are in fact Photius Coutsoukis, or possibly someone posing as him. Similarly, I am not currently going to engage in a debate about how Mr. Photius Coutsoukis apparently runs his website, what his qualifications are, or whither the material presented on that website is useful in other settings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The heart of this matter is whether (1) links to the website in question belong on articles here at Wikipedia, and (2) should they have been added in the manner they were. Initially limiting the conversation to those two specific issues is the only way I can see that this discussion will be of any real value. I am going to start with the second issue first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since I have previously explained why I did what I did in my post above, and given that you (Photiusc) might be unfamiliar with the Wikipedia standards and guidelines my actions were based on, I am going to ask that you first review the following articles and then re-read my response above, before we continue this conversation:

<dd>Photiusc, since you mentioned that you are not familiar with how we use talk pages here at Wikipedia, I have added a section at the very top of this talk page where you will find links to the official policies and guidelines for talk pages. I would respectfully request that you carefully read each of these articles before you add your next post to my talk page. I will not accept a claim of ignorance of these matters after this point.<br clear="all" />

<dl>
<dd>Dear Argon233,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pardon my noncompliance with your exacting guidelines. You are questioning whether the links I had added to the POISON and other articles properly belong there. Also, you characterized me as "a hobbyist, a self promoter etc.". So, first, let's make it clear, that I do not need Wikipedia to promote my web sites, which are viewed by hundereds of millions of visitors, and to which there are thousands of unsolicited links from the web sites of libraries, universities, government, etc.</p>
<p>Second, if I am a hobbyist, I must be very good at this web site hobby, having produced many reputable web sites, including the oldest continuously money-making web site in the world, and I have been at it since before most of you proud and strict fellows became aware that there was such as thing as the Internet.</p>
<p>You question wheter I am Photius Coutsoukis. You are welcome to call me on the telephone for an in-person verification at +30-23920-23920, while keeping in mind that we (in Greece) are 7 hours ahead of you.</p>
<p>As for the links, given that presumably you want to serve Wikipedia users, do you think that having removed the link, for example, from the POISON article to the related statistic page of my US Census web site makes your page better for the Wikipedia users?</p>
<p>The fact that I have not had the time to familiarize myself with your way of doing things does not change the value of that information, or lack thereof, to your web visitors. There is plenty of misinformation on Wikipedia, added by many "hobyists", my links certainly not being in that category, and I challenge you to find even the slightest hint of misinformation on any of my web sites.</p>
<p>More greetings form Thessaloniki.</p>
<p>Photius Coutsoukis www.photius.com</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry if you took offense when I included the word "hobbyist" in the list of possibilities for the type of personality behind the websites in question. In the end it really makes no difference to the point I was trying to make, and so it is extraneous, and in retrospect did not need to be included. If you prefer I can call you a business man, and refer to your websites as businesses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Additional discussion about your identity is really not that critical; for now I'll assume you are who you say you are as a matter of good faith, but please remember you had the option to save face by declining to establish your identity. As the owner of a website who is taking credit for adding links to Wikipedia that point to his own websites, there are rules that apply to you here on Wikipedia. Also I will not be calling you, and anyone that calls claiming to be me is trying to deceive you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to emphasize that all of my comments about the websites in question have been narrowly focused specifically on the question of whether the websites are appropriate links for inclusion in Wikipedia. I have not and will not discuss how useful the websites are outside of that context. That broader issue is not my concern at this time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad that you say you don't need to have your links in Wikipedia, because I believe the inverse to be true, and this would seem to be the closest that we are likely get to agreeing on that topic. If I had believed that the links were useful where they were, I wouldn't have removed them. Please keep in mind that my definition of usefulness also includes consideration you have indicated you have not yet be interesting in educating yourself about. Please see the guidance links I have mentioned in my earlier post for more details. One that you might find especially instructive is <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam#How not to be a spammer</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is about building a online encyclopedia, and of necessity there are rules and cultural norms that have developed around that. I would gladly continue discussing that with you but please note that intentionally uncivil remarks on talk pages here at Wikipedia are counter productive to that goal and should be avoided. Both of us should bare in mind that we really have know idea who else is paying attention to this discussion, and what the future consequences of this might be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Until you do review that material I have suggested, and as my attempts to engage in useful discussion based on <a href="../../../d/e/d/Deductive_reasoning.html" title="Deductive reasoning">deductive reasoning</a> appear to have failed so far, I will make use of a different method to address the material in your posts, this time using less exact and more problematic symbolic reasoning. I offer the following imperfect <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable.html" title="Parable">parable</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A distinguished professor of English Literature from Oxford visits Japan for a series of lectures at a prestigious university there. He has been there many times before, and has a good reputation for how well he teaches his specific subject of expertise, but he rarely goes beyond university grounds and the western style hotel he is so comfortable with. He has given this some though, and decides he needs to see more of the "real" Japan. Late one afternoon, after concluding one of his lectures, this professor mentions to one of the university staff that he wishes to visit a <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sento.html" title="Sento">sento</a> that evening, and needs a translator to accompany him.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The regular translator the university provides for his lectures is unavailable, so the professor is assigned a graduate student as a courtesy. Unfortunately the student has many of the common pronunciation issues that the professor has grown to dislike during his stay, and so when the student begins to describe how a sento works, the professor cuts him short. "Why do you presume that you can tell me how to behave? I've been bathing myself since before your mother was born. Now show me how to get to the bathhouse!" The student silently gestures for the professor to follow, and when they arrive, he for pays for the professor with the money that university provided.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When the professor realizes that the student is following him into the bathhouse, he warns him to stay out of his way and keep silent. The professor figures out where to disrobe by watching the student, but when he sees the student quickly beginning the traditional clean process, he mutters to himself "This is ludicrous; why is that boy washing oneself from that bucket and that ugly spigot on the wall when there is that big Jacuzzi at the far end of the room?" Shaking his head and grumbling about how the university has provided him a complete idiot to guide him, and to a third-rate bathhouse that is too cheep to even install proper shower heads, the professor makes his way over to the "Jacuzzi" while attempting cover himself with a towel that is not quite big enough for the job.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As the professor reaches the far end of the room, sets down the soap and other items he is carrying, and gestures as if to get in, he hears a voice cry out "Professor, STOP!" Startled, he glances over to where his guide is busying himself by vigorously scrubbing himself, pretending to not notice what is going on. The professor makes again as if to get in and again hears someone call out "Professor, stop, don't get in!"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The professor spins around to face this voice, and in tones straining under the angery load that had been building through all the perceived slights he had received today, he demands, "Who are you, and why are you bothering me? Can't you see I am trying to take a bath. What possible business is this of yours. Were you never taught proper manners, or are you just rude by nature?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As the face attached to the warning voice comes into the professors view, he is somewhat amused to see the face of one of his students from his lecture earlier in the day. He knew this student as one of the Americans who was studying methods of teaching English as a second language, as well work on their Japanese language skills.</dd>
<dd>"Boy, what is your name?"</dd>
<dd>"Sir, my name is not important, and you really should keep your voice down and try not to attract too much attention to yourself. You were about to make a embarrassing mistake."</dd>
<dd>"Who you are and who I am are very much an issue here. Where did you learn to think that way, some Corn-fed University in Iowa? Don't you know how to treat your betters?"</dd>
<dd>"Sir, any mistakes in my thinking are small in comparison to what you are trying to do here. You need to wash before you get in the bath."</dd>
<dd>"Child, that is one of the most ridiculous things I ever heard. In every civilized society a bath IS where one washes himself. Are you trying to tell me I need to find a river somewhere to jump into for a ritual cleaning? This isn't India. I am a well traveled man of the world, and I won't be taken in by your foolish little attempt at a prank. I am a important man in my field; do you really thing you can treat me with the disrespect you're shown here and get away with it? Who do you think you are?"</dd>
<dd>"Sir, I never said that we were in India, and I'm not trying to pull a prank on you or show disrespect for your professional standing. You are taking this all wrong. You just need wash at the spigots over there like your guide is doing BEFORE you get in. That's all I'm really trying to tell you."</dd>
<dd>"I don't need your help, or the help of that silly little twit over there. If what you are saying it true then this place is insane. Besides, why should I follow the example of a bunch of unwashed heathens who are sticking their head under facets on a wall, and openly displaying what only God, their mother and their wife should see?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As the professor chuckled to himself about how witty he thought the "unwashed heathens" part of his comment had been, the stunned American student stood there frozen, unsure what to do next. Not wanting to be involved with additional displays of disrespect to either himself, or to the students, teachers, and University staff who the English professor had failed to recognize were also in the bathing area listening to the exchange, the American decided to try one last thing. Since the professor was a well educated man, perhaps he would be more accepting of persuasion using symbolic truth imbedded in a made-up story, with enough exaggeration to highlight certain important points.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Thank you Argon233 for the nice lesson and this great story. I also like the story that was in the news, about the American diplomat John B. Bellinger III explaining to the United Nations Committee Against Torture about how the US for sure and beyond any doubt does not practice or condone torture of any sort, while Xuexian Wang of China asked "Where would you put 'waterboarding' or other forms of inhuman treatment?", while the Senegalese delegate, Guibril Camara, said it was the committee's interpretation — not that of the United States — that would set the global definition of torture. "One of the parties is going to have to give way," Mr. Camara said. "And I think it's probably going to have to be you." and the Greek chairman of the committee, Andreas Mavrommatis, stated that "the very fact that you are asking (the Americans) for diplomatic assurances means you are in doubt". Perhaps one would want to consider that certain peoples tend to be rather suspicious of others, paranoid and fearful. The Germans gave us a glaring example in the past. There are other peoples who tend to be more trusting. As a general rule, they do not tend so much toward minute rules and regulations as they do toward common sense. They do not focus so much on punishment as they do on sympathy. There are so many combinations and variations in between, but the chasm between the extreme poles can cause baffling behavior, just like your Japanese example, but also extreme cruelty.</p>
<p>So, people are different. Some go by the book, others do not need so many rule books to know right from wrong. Some assign great importance to things that others consider superficial, ephemeral and trivial. Some people overlook things that to others are as important as the essence of their own existence.</p>
<p>I thank you again for taking the time to give me your parable, which I enjoyed reading, and from which I learned, and for taking the time to read my little news story above. I must now go finish the Chinese language version of my China statistics web site, which, barring the discovery of some error, I will hopefully upload this weekend. You may wish to check it out, if you read Chinese zh-CN (if not, then click on the ENGLISH VERSION link): www.zhfacts.com/china_statistics</p>

<p>I see you nominated a whole slew of RAF articles for deletion a few days ago with the "reasoning" that they are non-notable subjects. There are two articles out of those that you nominated that, in their current state, I could perhaps agree with deletion. The No. 249 Wing article was in terrible condition and little more than a personal ramble masquerading as an article so that's one thing. The No. 51 OTU article was potentially a copyvio which is a separate issue to AFD so you actually went through the wrong channels on that one. I would also point out that non-notability in and of itself is not a criterion for deletion despite what many on AFD may think. The text on non-notability is an essay not an official policy of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As for the lists that you nominated, which I have the personal stake in, I see that again you claimed they were "non-notable". I say again that in and of itself is <b>not</b> a criterion for deletion. It would also have been nice of you to let me know what you were doing since I am the author of the vast majority of the material contained within those lists. With the balloon squadrons there was perhaps a case for dewikifying them but with other units there are decades of history that are represented there. It is not a glamorous topic and it is not a topic which has easily accessible resources, so it is hard to write about, but it is a worthy topic for inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 21:00, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lets be clear here; while I did nominate using the common shorthand of non-notable, the assessment that the article should be deleted did reach <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">rough consensus</a> in the following discussions:

</dd>
<dd>In all of these cases, after a rough consensus was reached on the AfD, an Administrator who is not known to me and with whom I have no relationship did the removal the articles per their guidance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My AfD was just a nomination. The community at large had their input using the standard AfD process (I have always used AfD up until now, even when I could use a 'Speedy' or a 'Proposed deletion', because it seems possible that someone, somewhere will object to the deletion). Excerpts from those discussions included the following comments made by others not previously known by me:
<dl>
<dd>1. "The proper course of action, as I understand it, should have been to build it in user space so it was up to standard. Of course, this being a list of links, that may never have happened. Perhaps if some of the individual wings had pages that met Wiki standards, some sort of category or list might be in order"</dd>
<dd>2. "Delete current list; move links to Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Article requests. Once the articles exist, this list would be entirely redundant with the related category, as it only orders the wings alphabetically (well, numerically, but it's the same thing)."</dd>
<dd>3. "I see no need for these lists - maybe in the distant future if we do eventually have lots of articles on, in this case, RAF Regiment Squadrons, but not now."</dd>
<dd>4. "I really want to give the author the benefit of the doubt, and give them a chance to populate the red links, but effectively this is just a list of the numbers 901-999."</dd>
<dd>5. "These Squadrons were formed during the second world war and didn't last long. Maybe an article covering the RAF Balloon Squadrons as a whole might be possible, but I doubt there's enough history behind each Squadron, nor are any that notable. Therefore no need for a list of them."</dd>
<dd>6. "If there were articles on many of the units, then keep, but I don't think there ever will be. Maybe if they appear, then create the list again, but until then..."</dd>
<dd>7. "With no internal or external links, there's really no content in the article."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have looked and cannot find any contributions by you to those discussions, though I would have welcomed them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am just a common user, not an Administrator. If you want to make claim that the lists were valuable and should be reinstated, or if you feel that material should be restored because the proper processes were not followed, I am most certainly not in a position to assist you with that.

For instance your changes to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_recognition.html" title="Speech recognition">speech recognition</a> directly contradicts WP:CONTEXT's rule that technical terms should be linked in articles.

<dd>I've gone through and reverted a number of your edits. You do seem to misunderstand WP:CONTEXT. A subarticle is not the same thing as a related article. The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Plan is not a subentity to the national medical care, but a separate, if related, programme. Similarly a <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexical_unit.html" title="Lexical unit">lexical unit</a> is not a subtopic of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_recognition.html" title="Speech recognition">speech recognition</a>, but rather a related concept in linguistics. Red links are not a negative thing to be hunted and removed, they are in fact one of the main engines of Wikipedia's growth. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 21:55, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's obvious from the modifications you made that this was not the current intent, so thank you for the clarification.</dd>
<dd>I still dislike redlinks (a opinion apparently shared by other users, based on the talk page for this guidance) and I strongly disagree with using redlinks in articles as some kind of a to-do list (though this may have been more beneficial in the past when their were fewer articles). Unfortunately my position is not currently supported as a matter of policy, guidance, or with any kind of consensus, so I will abide by precedent until the precedents change.<br clear="all" />

<p>Hi - My opinion about the busking zealot pretty much matches yours, I suspect. I don't have the energy to get embroiled in an edit war on the busker page, although I'll to add my voice to the discussion if no-one else steps up to the plate. He's obviously unsuited to contributing to Wikipedia, but there's likely no convicing him of it. Feel free to drop me a line if he doesn't drop the issue in the next couple days.

<p>"It is a nonpartisan institution, supported by public and private funds, engaged in the study of national and world affairs. The Center establishes and maintains a lively, neutral forum for free and informed dialogue. [...] The Center is charged by the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Act with symbolizing and strengthening the fruitful relations between the world of learning and the world of public affairs. The Center encourages contacts among scholars, policymakers, and business leaders and extends their conversations worldwide through its publishing, broadcasting, and Internet programs." (www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=about.about )</p>
<p>Your messages saying "Please do not add commercial links or links to your own private websites to Wikipedia" might be mistaken as an indication that you are deleting blindly. The center is a valuable resource. While wikipedia is not a mere collection of links, this site deserves better than blindly deleting any link to it that you might run across. That said, external links need to be pruned with a hatchet at regular intervals and I find no fault on your part with helping with that. Thanks for helping wikipedia be a better encyclopedia. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 21:06, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I did not leave this message at your talk page, I can only assume that you are referring to the standard 'spam1' template generated messages I have left today at others talk pages, regarding wilsoncenter.org edits. If you look at the edit history for 66.100.89.251 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.100.89.251.html" title="User talk:66.100.89.251">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.100.89.251_d5eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.100.89.251">contribs</a>), Globalhealth (<a href="../../../g/l/o/User_talk%7EGlobalhealth_88b3.html" title="User talk:Globalhealth">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Globalhealth_afa8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Globalhealth">contribs</a>), and Mredheffer (<a href="../../../m/r/e/User_talk%7EMredheffer_566a.html" title="User talk:Mredheffer">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mredheffer_28cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mredheffer">contribs</a>) it is clear that an effort is being made to 'place' external links pointing to wilsoncenter.org on a wide variety of articles. Also by the edit history of the 2 named accounts it is easily inferred that these users are very likely associated with the Woodrow Wilson Center, as I would think that CSC22 (<a href="../../../c/s/c/User_talk%7ECSC22_f7ff.html" title="User talk:CSC22">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CSC22_992e.html" title="Special:Contributions/CSC22">contribs</a>) is as well. They should not be adding external links on Wikipedia articles to websites run by their own organization, regardless of the standing of that organization, or the perceived value of the link.

<dd>Point taken, the message wasn't a perfect match, but then again template messages often arn't, but we still use them here at Wikipedia anyway. I simply do not have the time to write a custom worded message to each person I run-across that is contributing spam. The message I used <b>is</b> one of the standard message used by the <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WikiProject Spam</a> group, and in conjunction with my edit summary it is close enough to get the most important points across. If I might ask, which of the templates currently at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_talk_namespace_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace">Wikipedia:Template_messages/User_talk_namespace</a> would you suggest would have been a better fit? Perhaps a new template is in order or a change to an existing one? In either case, it would be more valuable for you to share your opinons on that issue at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">WikiProject Spam's talk page</a>, as it would be unwise to modify an existing spam template, or create a new one without that group's input. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgon233_2714.html" title="User:Argon233">Argon233</a> <font face="Arial"><font size="2pt"><sup style="margin-right:-18pt"><b><font color="darkred"><strong class="selflink">T</strong></font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Argon233_8f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Argon233"><font color="darkblue">C</font></a></b></sup>&#160;<sub><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Argon233_7b29.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Argon233"><font color="red">@</font></a> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgon233_Userspace_1439.html" title="User:Argon233/Userspace"><font color="teal">∉</font></a></sub></sub></font></font>  23:36, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an unpaid task for both of us and I have no doubt that we are both helping wikipedia to be a better encyclopedia as best as we know how. I am not suggesting that you "write a custom worded message to each person [you] run-across that is contributing spam". I am suggesting that "Perhaps a new template is in order or a change to an existing one". I suggest that to you rather than elsewhere because this is an encounter with you. Please do not insist that I join some group in order to talk to you. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 23:59, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not ask that you join <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WikiProject:Spam</a> in order to talk to me. I simply suggested that it would be more useful to contribute any commentary about the inadequacies of the standard spam templates on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">talk page for WikiProject:Spam</a>, instead of here on my talk page. I did not create the standard spam templates, and I have not been involved with their evolution; I am just one of many people who use that template, and WikiProject:Spam is a better place to find a wider audience of users who have a very active interest in those templates. It seems reasonable that they be involved with any effort to modify that template, or in building an alternate version that is a better fit for narrow particulars of this situation.

<p>This conversation is getting odd and I no longer wish to participate in it. I thought it made sense to suggest saying accurate things to people you are trying to give information to. You respond as if you have no choice but to communicate thru a limited number of templates; as if you can't copy and paste any message at all of your own choosing. I don't get it and I don't care anymore. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 07:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, I'm sorry if I have been unclear - let me try this again in case you ever become interested enough to look at this again.</dd>

<dd>When I left the messages about the wilsoncenter.org edits, I used the standard <a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">Spam1</a> template (please click on the link to see what I am talking about) - I did not copy/paste anything from anywhere. A short explanation about why/how this message is used can be found at <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#Warning_spammers" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam#Warning_spammers</a> (please click on link to see what I am talking about).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think that the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">Spam1</a> template was adequate for the situation you are taking issue with, though admittedly it was not an absolutely perfect fit. I am personally not interested in making unilateral changes to the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">Spam1</a> template, since anyone that modifies this standard message does so for the entire Wikipedia community, and there are a lot of users of this template. Also, I support the use of standardized <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_talk_namespace_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace">Wikipedia template messages in the User talk namespace</a> for common issues (like spam), and so I do not wish to create &amp; track a set of my own custom messages to copy/paste onto talk pages, as you seem to be advocating.</dd>

<dd>Since it appears that you are concerned with how well the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">Spam1</a> message works for noncommercial and nonprivate websites, I would point out that you are certainly able to change that template yourself to whatever wording you think is better, or you can create an alternative as you see fit. If you would like to consult with wider audience about the wording of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">Spam1</a> message or about creating a new template, you can find a large group of Wikipedia editors who actively use the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">Spam1</a> message at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">WikiProject Spam talk page</a> here at Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgon233_2714.html" title="User:Argon233">Argon233</a> <font face="Arial"><font size="2pt"><sup style="margin-right:-18pt"><b><font color="darkred"><strong class="selflink">T</strong></font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Argon233_8f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Argon233"><font color="darkblue">C</font></a></b></sup>&#160;<sub><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Argon233_7b29.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Argon233"><font color="red">@</font></a> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgon233_Userspace_1439.html" title="User:Argon233/Userspace"><font color="teal">∉</font></a></sub></sub></font></font>  00:49, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did notice that edit. I posted the original reference, apparently incorrrectly, since when I reviewed the reference it didn't support the "90% of NHS general practitioners have access to EMR". Ouch! I must have mixed up the quoted reference with another article, since I know I read this fact. So I have changed the same reference on <a href="../../../c/p/o/CPOE_8b26.html" title="CPOE">CPOE</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patient_safety.html" title="Patient safety">Patient safety</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_health_record.html" title="Electronic health record">Electronic health record</a>, which had similar statements.

<p>I'm a tad confused about your deletion of all links that Mikeyt931 has added to the Mayo. I followed this from <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brachial_Plexus_6d2d.html" title="Brachial Plexus">Brachial Plexus</a>, a page I watch due to my carrying a chronic injury in my BP. The pages at the Mayo Clinic are (in my experience anyway) some of the best and clearest describing this part of the body and the various injuries and treatments available. They run rings around the WP article. Internationally the Mayo is regarded as a leading medical institution, with highly regarded research and education programs. I'm not qualified to judge the other pages that had links to Mayo, but on that particular page the external link added to the article. Please note I appreciate the effort you goto to tracking down spammers, but I'm adding that link back into that page purely due to it being such a good resource. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpf_f0eb.html" title="User:Johnpf">Johnpf</a> 13:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Argone233,</p>
<p>Your recent activity regarding this page is inexplicable. How does one define notable? An organization with more than a 1,000 members at colleges and universities around the US and in Germany, does not qualify as "notable". Does an article in the Wall Street Journal suggest notability? I wonder. I have noticed, though, that half of your deletions are challenged by respectable users, somewhat concerning to all I think. For the good of this website,I obviously will have to take this deletion up with Wiki and propose you be sanctioned. Please feel free to justify your actions. All the best, Christopher. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Christopher Andrade (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Christopher_Andrade_22f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Christopher Andrade">contribs</a>) 2007-02-13T13:43:38 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed Chris!!! Argon I mean come on, you have to admit that some of your deletions are a little questionable:) The Wilson Center for instance, it has an even larger budget than CF's. I'm sure you mean well but I can't help but laugh a little. Oh and Chris, I will second any appeals to Wiki, and then I will get CF's page back up.MrsCAMEB 13:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)MrsCAMEB</dd>

<dd>I also can't help but ask, Argone, did you even bother to search for info on the organization??? There's a wonderful search engine that you may have heard of, www.google.com, you should definitely try it. Have a good day. MrsCAMEB 14:04, 13 February 2007 (UTC)MrsCAMEB</dd>

<p>Given the (lack of any significant) edit history by Christopher Andrade (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Christopher_Andrade_22f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Christopher Andrade">contribs</a>) and MrsCAMEB (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MrsCAMEB_fecf.html" title="Special:Contributions/MrsCAMEB">contribs</a>) (which gives the impression of sockpuppets at work) I have a hard time taking anything said in the above messages by very seriously, but I guess I'll invest a few word on this.</p>
<p>I could have added a speed delete tag, but I used a PROD message instead, since I prefer to have a more open discussion on article deletions than speedy's allow for. An admin who is not known to me (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">User:Mel Etitis</a>) saw fit to change my prod to a speedy delete, and he explained his reasoning here. As I didn't do the deletion and I am not an admin, if you feel it was in error, please make your appeal to someone that can actually overturn it. As for me, I believe that all I did was to spot someone trying to sneek an article back in, which previously had gone through the proper deletion processes, and that is not the right approach to take if an article should be restored.</p>
<p>As for notability, there were fairly clear guidelines listed in the PROD message. As far as 1000 members in the organization somehow qualifying it for notability, I have been in local church gatherings with more that that in the congregation, I have worked in an office building with more than that in that building, and I have worked for corporations that had more that number of people employed, and that church, building and corporation do not meet the notability criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Please also keep in mind that the world is a much bigger (and generally better) place than the narrow confines of the college experience might lead you to believe.
