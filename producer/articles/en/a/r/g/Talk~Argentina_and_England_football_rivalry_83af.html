<p>A lot of the Argentine teams have some english in their names (Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, River Plate, Racing Club, Quilmes Athletic Club, Newell's Old Boys, etc) and the even the first organized Argentine team was made of English expats (I think it was Alumni), see Football_in_Argentina. Even more, the first time Argentina beast England (At Wembley, I think) is still remebered and celebrated back home. Maybe we should even mention some instances of the Intercontinental Cup, one with Estudiantes de la Plata playing very rough (<s>I think against Nottingham Forest</s> against Man Utd <a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/sport/football/manchesterunited/s/126/126521_bitter_rivals_end_up_friends_.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/sport/football/manchesterunited/s/126/126521_bitter_rivals_end_up_friends_.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and another where Liverpool FC refused to play Boca Juniors (scheduling conflicts, was the official word).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we also imported the hooligan tradition, too.&#160;:(<br />
<br />
It might be worth mentioning that England has influenced Argentine sports in a lot of ways: For example, Argentina has the only competitive <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby.html" title="Rugby">Rugby</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_Hockey_0eee.html" title="Field Hockey">Field Hockey</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo.html" title="Polo">Polo</a> teams on the region. Also, is the South American country with the longest <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">Tennis</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">Golf</a> traditions. Needless to say, all British-originated sports.<br />

<dd>I've begun a section with some information on the British founding of football in Argentina. I'm not sure whether we should note the Intercontinental Cup games or not, as this article is supposed to be mainly about the national teams...

<p>I like the pre-1966 stuff, definitely makes it a more comprehensive and interesting article. I can't really add anything on the new club level section, as I don't know anything about it unfortunately. Sorry. Could well add another dimension to the page (which is, after all, about the <i>rivalry</i> - if this extends down to club level then particularly notable matches/fixtures should be included). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 21:41, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going to preempt anyone complaining about the handbags image. I think it perfectly displays how people in England treat things like football rivalry, with humour.

<dd>If I may contribute a small suggestion:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe the handbag image is more insultingly offensive than exemplary of British humour. In my opinion, it is substracting impartiality to this laudably neutral article, as it is slighting every Argentinean who visits this page. It is my belief the image should be either deleted or taken out until an Argentinean equivalent is found. Please consider this suggestion as nothing but merely a means to improve this overall well accomplished article. Thank you. 200.55.88.166 20:31, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, considering there's no connection between the image and the article itself (I mean, written), and the source of the image is not sourced to be British, it might be a good idea. The picture is not even from the match against England... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 12:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The image was on the front page of a national daily British newspaper immediately before a prominent game between England and Argentina. It has everything to do with the England/Argentina football rivalry and how the game is viewed in England. The fact that someone thinks that "it is slighting every Argentinean who visits this page" and that there is not Argentinian equivalent - is exactly the point. It shows the different way that the game is viewed. We treat these things with humour. Please see my comment above. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 23:02, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The picture is a mock-up: that is, it is not factual. An encyclopedia is a collection of facts. It is not necessary to reproduce an example of ridicule to assert that ridicule takes place.)" - It's a fact that a few days before a sigificant match between England and Argentina that picture was emailed all around the world. I had it in my inbox. It is a fact that a couple of days before (I think) a significant match between Enbgland and Argentina that picture featured on the front page of a British national daily newspaper. It is certainly worth noting that in England humour is used to mock football rivals and indeed our own players. Carricature of heros and villans is a significant part of British culture.

<dd>Your continual re-posting of the contested image suggests that you pay little heed to discussion here. The image in question was created with the intention of offending and ridiculing; the fact that it was published in a newspaper does not make in noteworthy; it does not serve the neutrality of the article; its inclusion appears gratuitous. You acknowledged at the time opf first posting it that it would be controversial, but you seem reluctant to pay attention to other opinions on the posting. I would challenge you to refer it for arbitration or to a vote.<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 23:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the contrary. Upon noticing the removal of the image I restored the image and I posted a comment above, to which no-one replied. You did not acknowledge my comment, but just removed the image without discussion. I then posted a second comment here after restoring the image, then you once again removed it. I posted a third comment on this page and only now do you come to discuss the issue. So thank you for finally acknowledging the existance of this page. Two things -firstly <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">Voting is evil</a> your "challenge" to take it to arbitration is confrontational, it's far to early in the process to head down that road, civil discussion is required at this stage. Secondly you are wrong to to say as you did in your edit comment "there is no other editor supporting it bar Jooler" - you will notice that at the time the image was added, a whole year ago bar a few days, and mere days after the creation of the article itself, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">User:Sliggy</a> said <b>"yes the image adds to the article"</b> and Angmering who is a major contributor to this article did not complain. So for an entire year and virtually the entire lifetime of this article the image has been on the page without protest. Then an anonymous editor posts a complaint and someone else suggests removal - but not for the same reasons - and you remove it and do not respond to discussion until now. I think other opinions are required, until a decision is reached, please leave the page in the same state it has been in for the last year. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 08:29, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I did complain. I still believe the image has no place in the article. As I said before, there is (currently) no connection between the text of the article and the image (no reference from one to the other). Plus, comments such as <i>a typical example of British humour</i> are way off-topic, and there are no proves the image was created in the UK at all!! How do you know it is not just another example of Nigerian humor? Or even Brazilian? I'm quite sure the newspaper publication was posterior to the email boom.</dd>
<dd>In short, the 2002 WC match was a poor low-profile match that didn't add much to the rivalry other than a victory to England and a controversial penalty; the image itself does not add anything to it, and the text fails to give a context that would justify it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 11:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I stand by my earlier comment, I think the picture adds a humorous touch to the article. It is obvious that it is a fake, and the caption makes plain that it is false. I can't see why its inclusion is any worse — or better — than the comments about World Cup Willie in pirate regalia or Gauchito with his foot on an English lion (in the section "1966 World Cup"). It records the <i>contemporary</i> media coverage. I agree with <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a> that there could be more context in the article itself, although this risks undue prominence for what is actually just humour.

<dd>That's because there was nothing wrong with the text. He <i>was</i> the England captain at the 2002 World Cup game. Whether he is any longer or not isn't really relevant to that section. However, if it makes you any happier I'll put it back in a clearer manner.</dd>

<p>The image in question adds nothing to anybody's knowledge or understanding of the rivalry between two national football teams. It is posted as an illustration of a sense of humour: evidently a sense of humour that appeals to some editors here. I think that makes the image suited to a page they may wish to post on flickr.com or something similar, but not an encyclopedic entry. The fact that some people shared an image with others by e-mail does not make it relevant or noteworthy: the fact that a tabloid newspaper published it does not make it news. The intention of the picture was to ridicule and insult: its reproduction in this pages extends that ridicule and insult to a new audience, and that is not the purpose of wikipedia.<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 22:50, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"intention of the picture was to ridicule" - correct, just like [Media:Darwin_ape.jpg]. In this instance it is an example of the way the rivalry is viewed in England both popularly and in the media. BTW I have The DVD series The History of Football - One episode of which opens with Maradona openly mocking and ridiculing Peter Shilton. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 23:50, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Mocking of a long dead scientist for his opinions is very different from denigration of a group of living sportsmen for their nationality. I fail to see how Maradona's behaviour on a DVD has any bearing on the publication on Wikipedia of a photograph that does not depict him. Are you suggesting that it is acceptable to insult all Argentinians on the basis that one Argentinian insults one Englishman? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 00:31, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's worth pointing out (because you rarely seem to see it mentioned elsewhere, and I don't want it to become watered down in this article), that Beckham's flick against Simeone, was not a retaliation for the foul that had just happned during the run of play, but was a retaliation for the way Simeone leaned on Beckham's back as he got up off the pitch. Beckham had been suffering from a back injury prior to the competition and was in genuine pain. Simeone, who appeared to have been shot by a sniper at the same momement that Beckham's heal landed on him said a year later "Obviously, I was being clever. By letting myself fall, I got the referee to pull out a red card immediately. ... In reality, it wasn't a violent blow, it was just a little kick back with no force behind it, and was probably instinctive." <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/288889.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/288889.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/288889.stm</a> <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 19:33, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think is that important and it is prejudicial towards Simeone. Beckham did kick him and the fact that he over-acted the pain doesn't take away from Beckham's bad judgment call. Both things are clearly stated in the article and emphasizing it more is not really necessary, IMHO. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 20:21, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not suggesting changing anything that the article currently says. I'm just trying to point out, here, on the talk page, that many places that cite this incident leave out the fact that Simeone pressed down on Beckham's back and that it was this and not the foul that sparked Beckham's "instinctive" (as Simeone himself described it) reaction. So I'm just saying that we should ensure that if someone comes along and changes the article to remove some of the details, or summarise this incident, that the information is retained. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 22:32, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Perhaps another thing worth noting on this page. During the 1966 World Cup, there was a strong belief, held by some Ururguayan and Argentinian supporters that their teams were knocked out because of an Anglo-German conspiracy. The W. Germany vs. Uruguay match was refereed by an Englishman (or possibly Scots not sure on this) and the England vs. Argentina match was refereed by a German. There is some information on this here - <a href="http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/snapshots/snapshot28/snapshot28.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/snapshots/snapshot28/snapshot28.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/snapshots/snapshot28/snapshot28.htm</a> <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 19:52, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In December User:86.130.179.16 changed all of the references from <i>British</i> to <i>English</i> for whatever reason. Watson Hutton was Scottish, and it's probably likely many of the other early influences may have been Welsh, Irish or Scots.

I changed the references from brit. to eng. because the article is called Argentina and England football rivalry. True, there is no subdivision of British humour called English humour, but if there was it would be a simple copy and paste job as all of the examples of 'British' humour referenced in that article are of English comedians or comedy shows</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'll be happy to. The translation is correct. It is a very popular chant "The one who doesn't jump is an XXX". Basically the expected effect (and the resulting effect) is that everybody at the stadium jumps at the same time to "avoid being called an XXX". The chant started to be sung after the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a> of 1982 and it became a traditional chant in every Argentina match, regardless of who are they playing against. "El que no salta es de Brasil" (The one not jumping is a Brazilian).</dd>
<dd>Obviously, since most Argentine stadiums still have a lot of "standing room" bleachers, it's not that hard for people to just start jumping, although seating spectators almost always join the crowd.</dd>
<dd>It is quite a sight to see 60000 people jumping at the same time, I'll tell you that.</dd>
<dd>I'll see if I can compose a little paragraph to that effect.</dd>

Any insulting adjective could have been substituted for "inglés" (as you illustrate yourself above): the point is that "inglés" is being used here as a perjorative. I'm afraid that your defence for reverting that it will be heard on TV seems to me to be a red herring: is there much Argentinian domestic football shown on UK television? Do the crowd at an Argentinian league fixture care whether it is being shown in the UK?

<dd>It's common knowledge in the football world that the English media and fans are insane with the way that they always say their opponents 'cheated' when the English lose. Often they blame the ref as well. In some cases, such as Barcelona-Chelsea in 04-05, the commentators spend the entire match complaining, which leads to disgruntled Englishmen sending death threats to the match officials. And in saying "no foul would have been given in the Premiership" - that isn't relevant, as the officiating in England is completely different from the actual rules of the game - completely different from the way the game is officiated in the rest of the world. <a href="../../../p/e/o/User%7EPeoplesunionpro_57d2.html" title="User:Peoplesunionpro">Peoplesunionpro</a> 03:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After reading the article, we must admit that unless you are English there are several sentences purely POV, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>the game was particularly noted for the sending-off of Argentina captain Antonio Rattín, which <b>Argentinians</b> considered to be unfair,</i> . Came on, even the scottish see this as unfair. I know uruguayian, italians, spaniard, germans, etc who think the same .</li>
<li><i>Argentina fans did not observe the minute's silence in memory of Stanley Matthews</i> I suggest remove the sentence unless is sourced. Also, how many argentine fans could be that day on the stadium&#160;? , 50?</li>
<li><i>Commentators described the match, which began at twelve noon UK time, as the "longest lunch break in history" as millions in England and throughout the world stopped their jobs and activities to watch the game on TV.</i> irrelevant and purely a english comment. Unless we add the same about Argentina, (all their games were seen by 30 millions fans on any hour) I suggest remove it</li>
<li><i>Although the Argentinian players and public criticised the awarding of the penalty kick — given for a controversial foul on Michael Owen, whom they felt had dived — the game was generally played in a good, if highly competitive, spirit, and there was none of the bitterness that had affected the 1966 and 1986 meetings.</i>.

<p>prior of this event, nobody cares about England in Argentina, their matchs have a similar importance of those with any other country. I still remember the argentine TV talking about the 1966 game in the prior hours of the 1986 match. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJor70_336f.html" title="User:Jor70">Jor70</a> 23:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What do you object to in the opening paragraph as it stood before your last reversion? It correctly stated that the UK (not England) was a party in the Falklands war, it credits 1966 as pivotal in the instigation of the rivalry, and it avoids the metaphorical (and therefore unencyclopedic) use of "edge" In what regard was the December version so superior that it should be preserved? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 22:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the new version we finish making a list of all the WC matchs (Very poor) whilst december version remarks 3 importants facts that we deleted here&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>1966 as the origin</li>
<li>mention the word <i>clasico</i> showing the importance of the match in Argentina</li>
<li>and highlight the event <i>Mano de Dios</i> over the others (per se british pov). I have no problem with the last one but would be important to notice that for Argentines is the the 1966 match. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJor70_336f.html" title="User:Jor70">Jor70</a> 10:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Angmering's version from which you reverted to the December version mentions only one footballing date, your preferred one of 1966. <i>Clásico</i> is Spanish, and to most readers of en.wikipedia will not communicate your intended interpretation; however, the reciprocity of the rivalry is explicit in the version you reverted from. I am unclear as to whether you want the 1986 match highlighted in the lead paragraph or not: I think that POV is best avoided by not giving any match the additional profile of inclusion in the lead para. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 10:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Too much?

<dl>
<dd>I think toning down the influence the war had on the rivalry would be nice, but innacurate and something of a whitewash. In the article we have cited quotes from Maradona about revenge, and the English fans chanting about the outcome of the war over twenty years later. The fact is, however distasteful we might find it now, the war was and probably still is a major factor in the feelings that emerge when the sides play, so I don't think the "somehow" is approproate there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I must confess I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "mediatic and entertained" — do you mean to say, perhaps, that the rivalry is media-driven and on the whole entertaining? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 11:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly! that the idea . About the 1982 war (perhaps due obvious reasons) have more influence in England than Argentina , other than those Diego quotes , you will not see the argentine media or fans massive talking about the 1982 war prior the 2002 or 2005 matchs but they surely mention all prior controversial matchs <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJor70_336f.html" title="User:Jor70">Jor70</a> 11:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apart from my dislike of brackets in opening sections, I think that the Clásico reference is inappropriate in en.wikipedia.

I think it is worth making the distinction between England and the UK in reference to the war, but I'm not too bothered so long as it does not say (as it did before) <i>the war between the two nations</i>. The qualification "and still play" is not necessary, as this can be taken as read in normal English usage: I would still hope that this line would be sufficient to allow for the deletion of the paragraph about individual players; it is not POV, and if there are English players in the Argentinian leagues, the sentence can be made reciprocal. <i>Mainly</i> is unverifiable: I would suggest <i>including</i> instead.

<dd>The word <i>clasico</i> doesnt means just a match between rivals, is like a Inter-Milan, River-Boca, in fact what means is much MORE than a game and when I was talking about being media-driven I was refering to the rivalry not the players, in the new sentence we are talking about the player profiles and that not the issue.

<dd>But all of that (the notion that it has more significance than 90 minutes of action and maybe 3 league points) is already implicit in talking about a match between rivals: the point is not clarified for users of an English language source by a Spanish word that links (inappropriately) to <b>local</b> derbies.

<dd>About clasico, I still think that it is important to let know all users (english or not) that this match is locally known in Argentina as a derby , the current version is really ok. The line about games of the 20 century is really necessary&#160;?? I dont think anyone played in 1800s and in that way we will forced to update the lead paragraph any time they play. I would start the 3rd paragraph just from <i>It was driven by various controversial incidents, ....</i> . Sorry If I do not understand you about the high profile term, Its seems to me that the current high profile line refers to the players be high profile and not the match ifself. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJor70_336f.html" title="User:Jor70">Jor70</a> 12:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word <i>clásico</i> does not have the effect on English language speakers that you suggest, and the word <i>derby</i> is not appropriate in this case, as in UK usage that only refers to a rivalry between close neighbours, but I would leave in the remainder of that sentence, making clear that the rivalry is reciprocal. The key words in the opening sentence of the 3rd para are <i>the latter half of the 20th century</i>, to refer broadly to the period 1950-2000, not merely to exclude the 19th century. I would prefer to delete the month-specific dating in the sentence that you are concerned about in terms of frequent updating, but changing one word every few years is not an onerous editing task. As regards your last point, I fear that your understanding of English may have let you down: the <i>it</i> in <i>its high media and public profile</i> refers to <i>the intense rivalry between the national sides</i> in the opening part of the sentence, not to high profile players. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 16:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe some English language users (Angmering?) would like to comment on the value of <i>clásico</i> in this context. I maintain that it adds nothing to the meaning of a sentence that states that the rivalry is keenly felt in Argentina, and that it is falsely linked to <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_derby.html" title="Local derby">local derby</a> as it is clearly not about a rivalry between neighbours. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 19:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Possibly we need to see if we can get some more than just the three of us debating this — ask for some opinions on the football wikiproject, maybe? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 19:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we should settle the <b>Argentine/Argentinian</b> discussion for once and for all. We already discussed this in other articles quite some time ago and decided to use the adjective <i>Argentine</i>, while for the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonym.html" title="Demonym">demonym</a> we could either user <i>Argentine</i> or <i>Argentinian</i>. But please, in no case should Argentinian be used as an adjective! --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 16:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By what lexical source do you claim that one cannot say, for example, "the Argentinian army"?</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only on-line UK English style guide listed at <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_guide.html" title="Style guide">Style guide</a> that is accessible and offers an opinion (The Guardian, as cited in my edit notes) gives Argentinian, but never Argentine. I believe "Argentine" as an adjective (as is the case for The Argentine as a name for the country) is at best dated, and almost obsolete: its use seems to me to be a mixture of an archaic style and a false assumption that it is a more authentic translation of <i>argentino/a</i>. If you can cite a modern authority that uses Argentine that would of course call for a re-think on my part. Perhaps you could direct me to the previous discussions on other articles.<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 17:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't find the proper discussion, I only found <a href="../../../a/r/g/Category_talk%7EArgentina_c7c3.html" title="Category talk:Argentina">this one</a>. I didn't mean it was gramatically wrong to use Argentinian as an adjective, just plain horrible. If you search (just to use your example) for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=lwm&amp;q=%22Argentinian+army%22+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=lwm&amp;q=%22Argentinian+army%22+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"Argentinian Army"</a>, you'll get way less hits than with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=Vwm&amp;q=%22Argentine+army%22+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=Vwm&amp;q=%22Argentine+army%22+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"Argentine Army"</a>, even if ignoring Wikipedia hits (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=5GS&amp;q=%22Argentinian+army%22+-Wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=5GS&amp;q=%22Argentinian+army%22+-Wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>/<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=sd7&amp;q=%22Argentine+army%22+-Wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=sd7&amp;q=%22Argentine+army%22+-Wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). What's more, Google will ask you <i>Did you mean: Argentine Army</i> when quering for "Argentinian Army".</dd>
<dd>OK, not really encyclopedic, but it does give you a good idea that the term Argentine is far from <i>almost obsolete</i>. What do you mean with <i>modern authority</i>? An updated Dictionary? A government institution? A hooligan's page?</dd>

<p>"<i>in no case should Argentinian be used as an adjective!</i>": it is listed in every dictionary I can find as an adjective! Have you found any that do not describe it as one? I suspect that very old dictionaries, but only old ones, might not list it as such, that is why I asked for a modern lexical source. Whether it is horrible is your POV: it is not incorrect, and I maintain that it is a more modern use (but not merely a modalism). You acknowledge that it was a matter of debate elsewhere in Wikipedia, and yet you seem to be dogmatic in your right to apply your opinion. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 10:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course my <i>horrible</i> comment was POV. That was the exclamation about. I stated my possition and backed it with certain sources/numbers; that's all. Argentine is also defined both as a noun and an adjective in all dictionaries. To me, both the adjective and the noun should be Argentine, but several people (and I'm sorry I can't find the discussion) provided certain support for the use of Argentinian as the demonym. And the fact that it's of <i>modern</i> use doesn't make it neither correct nor encyclopedic; after all <i>"dude"</i> is also in the dictionary. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 20:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
