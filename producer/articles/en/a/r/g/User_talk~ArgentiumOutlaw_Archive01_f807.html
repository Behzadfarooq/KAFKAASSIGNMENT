<p>Hi, just wanted to say "sorry!" about beeing rude to you on <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a>'s talk page, what can I say. I've had a couple of run ins with people who will fight tooth and nail to keep fair use images on theyr userpages or userbox template even if they know the rules, so when you came to "complain" about such an image beeing tagged as orphanded I just automaticaly asumed you where one of them. I'll force myself to re-read <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and remind myself that even if I have explained the fair use rules a thousand times it doesn't automaticaly follow that everyone know about them.

<p>The trick here (that is, with the Dharma Initiative) is not to become too embittered. I'm glad you agree with me, but the only clear way out of this (that is, when LOST ends, whever that may be) is to admit to yourself that someone who disagrees with you is not scum. It's hard sometimes - and Jtrost had made absolutely no effort to concede anywhere - but we'll have to just try and work through this without becoming hateful. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 12:15, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never claimed he was scum, I just dislike everything he does. I believe sometimes, he does things out of spite even if he himself doesn't believe something. So its not just about his opinions, I think he purposely tries to attack people sometimes. Since he has so much influence and power, he can bully people based on nothing more than a whim. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 21:35, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi I was thinking about taking this whole merge discussion in an entirely different direction. Instead of merging the info on the poorly named <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraviolet_map.html" title="Ultraviolet map">Ultraviolet map</a> into the unfocused <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_DHARMA_Initiative_5169.html" title="The DHARMA Initiative">The DHARMA Initiative</a>. How about we expand on Silentplanet's idea and create sub sections on known Hatches?</p>
<p>Remember the "The DHARMA Initiative" article is supposed to <b>focus</b> on what it is. Adding more information to "<i>the Swan</i>" only shows that this hatch should be expanded upon in another article. The title of this article after all is <i>not</i> "The DHARMA Hatches." To me it looks like we should put in some information about what exactly the DHARMA Initiative is. We should give some history on it maybe include the information on the film and then some brief information about the hatches and what they are. Hatches that we know more about like "The Swan" should have its own page that would then contain information such as "the Map", "The Timer", etc... I think that this is a more reasonable solution and would also make it a more logical solution as an encyclopedia article. Please let me know what you think (in your talk page)! And if you do agree please note that on your merge vote! Thanks -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 04:11, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Despite my personal desire to keep the article I started alive, I have come to believe that the idea for dividing up the Dharma article into seperate hatches and a seperate dharma section is a really good idea. So I will support that and I will comment on that next to my vote in the merge discussion, although I wont change my vote, because the vote is about merging with the DHARMA section. If it was to be merged with a The Swan section, then I'd vote for a merge. So I hope it works out, because that is a lot more organized than what is going on now. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 08:34, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you really think <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valenzetti.html" title="Valenzetti">Valenzetti</a> is significant enough for it's own article? How about a merge with Bad Twin? <a href="../../../c/o/f/User%7ECoffeeboy_11b4.html" title="User:Coffeeboy">Coffeeboy</a> 17:22, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, if there was a merge with Bad Twin and Gary Troup was thrown in there also, I'd change my vote. But, unfortunately it seems as if the people at that AFD want to delete the info because they think the whole Valenzetti thing doesn't belong on wikipedia (due to lack of credible info). That is what I disagree with, I think there is plenty of verifiable stuff, but if people keep making 'Comments' about what should be done and not actually vote, then the info will disappear. So I guess my vote to keep, is really a vote to keep the information, and less a vote to keep a specific article on Valenzetti. I'd like it if the info on lost was better organized, but it becomes extremely difficult when people keep avoiding discussions and keep deleting info.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Like I said, what I actually believe should be done with the articles is that we should seperate Gary Troup into his own article, and merge Bad Twin and Valenzetti in there. If I change my vote and the info is <b>delete</b>d, then that ideal I have will be a little farther away from being reached. Although, if you think that deleting or changing my vote to merge would actually make a difference in helping the Lost organization somehow, then i'm open to a convincing. I hope my explanation just now wasn't too convoluted, to summarize I guess you could say that my vote to <b>keep</b> was a strategic vote based on future implications. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 21:36, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I think I will change my vote then. I actually think someone from ABC wrote the original article, but hey that is just my opinion.

<dl>
<dd>Thank you. It means a lot to me when people complement me on arguments, it tells me that I'm not completely crazy and alone in what I believe in. =) Now that the AFD has ended with no consensus, maybe we can try to split the Gary Troup article and merge everything in there. Unfortunately I don't really know how to nominate things for deletion or seperation, so I'll look into it soon if I can find the time, unless you or anyone else can do it, which will help it move along faster. You have my full support in merging all Gary Troup related articles into one new article. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 20:02, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
