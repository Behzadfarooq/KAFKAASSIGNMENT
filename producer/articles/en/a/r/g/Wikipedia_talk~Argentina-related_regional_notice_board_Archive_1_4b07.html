<h2><span class="mw-headline">Provinces</span></h2>
<p>There's an argument going on on the naming convension for our Provinces. Options seam to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>: <b>X Province</b> (Buenos Aires Province, Río Negro Province, Jujuy Province, etc)</li>
<li><b>B</b>: <b>X (province)</b> ( Buenos Aires (province), Río Negro (province), Jujuy (province), etc)</li>
<li><b>C</b>: <b>Provincia de X</b> (Provincia de Buenos Aires, Provincia de Río Negro, Provincia de Jujuy, etc)</li>

<p>Please, add any further option you would prefer to vote. Comments to other poples votes in the <i>Comments</i> section. (Try to keep the votes in one line).</p>

<p>It seams that we will end up using the <i>Catamarca (province)</i> model. There will be a lot of changes needed, so I suggest we divide the provinces between the volunteers to do these changes. The more we are, the less work we have.</p>
<p>Also, we should remember to use the same policy when creating any other things (cities, departments, partidos, etc). We can also start fixing those once we finish with the provinces.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a> 10:00, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was expecting more feedback!</dd>
<dd>Any way, I found that this is not an <i>Argentine</i> problem only. Please, take a look at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28provinces%29_bd13.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (provinces)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (provinces)</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Subnational_entities_Naming_ac51.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Subnational entities/Naming">Wikipedia:WikiProject Subnational entities/Naming</a>.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I completely missed this. I completely agree. In case there's a possibility for ambiguity, shall we use <i>XXXX (province of Argentina)</i> or <i>XXXX (Argentine province)</i> or what? What about the other subnational entities? --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D. Flores</a> 11:00, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I think we should see what happens <i>there</i>, right? -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a> 15:10, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Firstly, I don't think we should <i>see</i> what happens. Instead we should act.</p>
<p>Why don't we just add the standardized ISO codes instead of making up names of articles? For example, for Argentinian provinces, we can add the <a href="../../../a/r/_/ISO_3166-2%7EAR_6009.html" title="ISO 3166-2:AR">ISO 3166-2:AR</a> codes. For example, we could name the Buenos Aires article "Buenos Aires (AR-B)". The only problem with that would be you would have to look up the codes if you don't remember them, but at least they are semi-intuitive. So we could also use the form "Buenos Aires (AR)".</p>
<p>And anyway, we don't need to write "(province of Argentina)". That's why we have <a href="../../../a/r/_/ISO_3166-2%7EAR_6009.html" title="ISO 3166-2:AR">ISO 3166-2:AR</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2_091d.html" title="ISO 3166-1 alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a> codes. For example, "AR" stands for Argentina, and "B" for Buenos Aires inside Argentina.</p>

<li style="list-style: none"><del>
<li><del><b>B</b>: The translation of the word "Provincia" is unnecessary and sounds artificial, and, many times, users just want to display the main part of the name, for example "Jujuy" instead of "Jujuy Province", or "Buenos Aires" instead of "Buenos Aires Province", even if they just refer to the province instead of the namesake city. The word "Province" should be optional, not obligatory. With the format "X (province)", displaying the word "province" or "Province" becomes optional when placing a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical_bar.html" title="Vertical bar">vertical bar</a> after the right parenthesis, like this: "[[X (province)|]]". For an explanation, see <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html#Links_and_URLs" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How to edit a page#Links and URLs</a>. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 18:04, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</del></li>
<li><del><b>C</b>: I'm against translating; "province" has a clear derogatory undertone in English (cfr. the use of "provincial" as an adjective). I can see reasons for B, but the benefits in piping syntax are minimal (one can also do [[Provincia de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]], after all). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaragui_2f04.html" title="User:Taragui">Taragui</a> 19:02, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</del></li>
<li><del><b>B</b>: The parentheses notation gives the same information and, as stated, most of the time you want the name of the province (or "province of X"). Besides, if this notation becomes uniform for all administrative units, we will avoid funny titles like <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigre_Partido_d57f.html" title="Tigre Partido">Tigre Partido</a> (it actually took me a while to get it). Combining with <b>C</b> might be useful too ([[Santa Fe (provincia)|]]). --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D. Flores</a> 10:49, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</del></li>
<li><del><b>B</b>. That format makes is clear that the "(province)" is a clarifier. The problem with using <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catamarca_Province_b39a.html" title="Catamarca Province">Catamarca Province</a> over Catamarca (province) is that it implies the former is the correct, formal name -- in which case, why isn't <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entre_R%C3%ADos_1bbd.html" title="Entre Ríos">Entre Ríos</a> at <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entre_R%C3%ADos_Province_33a3.html" title="Entre Ríos Province">Entre Ríos Province</a>?

<dd><del>many time people want use the name and with brackets you have to write [[X (province)|X province]] .... how often have I seen this. Your pipe trick is only half the truth.
<dl>
<dd><del>My pipe trick is the complete truth. When you write, you just have to type "[[Buenos Aires (province)|]]", and after you save, the text gets saved automatically as "[[Buenos Aires (province)|Buenos Aires]]". In other words, it's the wiki program (MediaWiki) which adds the second part that reads "Buenos Aires", not the user himself. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 06:25:04, 2005-07-27 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><del>I seldom see that. I see more of "[[X (province)|X]] province" or (even better) "[[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[X (province)|X]]" because, in general, the word "province" is a clarifier, not part of the name.

<dd><del>why do people write "[[X (province)|X]] province"&#160;? Why do people in ENGLISH write <i>New York City</i> and not <i>new York city</i>? Because it's needed to identify the thing. Maybe it's not 100% scientific, but this is language, language is living. Nobody speaks like "I was in Buenos Aires bracket open province bracket close. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 02:22, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><del>First of all, this is not about being "scientific" or not. Secondly, the people say "New York City" because they have to distinguish between the city and a homonymous state. And that, of course, is when they actually have a need to distinguish the two. But they don't always need to. Not all cities have namesake provincies. Then, they don't always say "New York City". They also say "New York" when they refer to the city. And whether the words "city" or "City" are "needed", as you say, to identify the "thing", in reality it depends on the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namespace.html" title="Namespace">namespace</a> or the context and situation in which they're talking. You ask why people say "X province". Well, then I ask you why people <i>also</i> say "X" instead of "X province", because they actually do. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 06:29:52, 2005-07-27 (UTC)</del></dd>

<dd><del>Amusing though it was, let's ignore the attempted vocalization of wikisyntax. You ask why people write "Córdoba province". Ok, the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Manual_of_Style_77c7.html" title="Chicago Manual of Style">Chicago Manual of Style</a></i> says: "Words such as empire, state, county, city, kindgom, colony, territory, and so forth, which designate political divisions of the world, are capitalized when they are used as an accepted part of the proper name. When not used as an accepted part of the proper name, or when used alone, such terms are usually lowercased." See the problem? I'm not sure the "Province" in "Santa Fe Province" is an accepted part of the proper name, most particularly because the proper name is in Spanish and obeys a different grammatical structure. See also the <i>Guardian</i> style manual <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,5817,184841,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,5817,184841,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which offers as examples "Sydney harbour", "Monterey peninsula", and "Bondi beach"; I'd guess "Entre Ríos province" would fit in nicely with those. <a href="../../../h/a/j/User%7EHajor_7ab9.html" title="User:Hajor">–<i>Hajor</i></a> 04:27, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</del></dd>

<dd><del>Secondly, I myself would never say that "I was in Córdoba Province, Argentina", because that sounds too bookish and too artificial, and it just sucks. Firstly, I'd never say "Córdoba Province, Argentina", because the comma and the pause in speech, they both suck, and because it implies a kind of telegram style or abbreviated style that I'd never use in natural spoken language, not even in written representation of spoken language. I don't care if it's Spanish, or English, or German. The comma and the pause suck.
<dl>
<dd><del>For the US it is done that way, afaik.

</del></dd>
<dd><del>I'd use the preposition "in" instead of the comma. And that <i>if</i>, and only <i>if</i>, I'd say "Córdoba Province", but even that sounds too artificial, because it implies that "Province" is part of the "official" name, but in reality, I know that that's not the truth, and it just sucks. In Spanish, we say "la Provincia de Buenos Aires" or "la provincia de Buenos Aires" at most, and that's just to distinguish "la provincia de Buenos Aires" from "la ciudad de Buenos Aires". And then, even the capitalization or not of "provincia" is optional, not forced. And if we're within the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namespace.html" title="Namespace">namespace</a> of Argentinian provinces, and if we then know we're just talking about Argentinian provinces, then we'd just say "Buenos Aires", even if we're talking about the province instead of the city. And that applies to Spanish and to any given translation.
<dl>
<dd><del>no it's not only to distinguish province from ciudad, there is also <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_Canton_bd5e.html" title="Buenos Aires Canton">Buenos Aires Canton</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 22:01, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</del></dd>
</dl>
</del></dd>
<dd><del>I just hate to see the generic name of the province outside the parentheses, because you're forcing many users to talk in a way they'd never talk, and because everyone has a different way of talking. If we put the whole generic name between parentheses, then we don't force users to talk in a way they'd never wanna talk. We don't force them to display that part in the text that the reader reads. That's why we have parentheses: to make the word or words between the parentheses optional, but not obligatory. To me it just sounds very burocratic to try to force users to use translated words which are totally unnecessary. For example, it's necessary to say "Buenos Aires", but not necessarily "Province". You could just as well say you were in the "Provincia de Buenos Aires" or the "Province of Buenos Aires". Why use the form "Buenos Aires Province" and not, say, "Province of Buenos Aires"? Why not use the prepositional phrase with <i>of</i> instead of "Province" as a determinandum? That really shows you that the translation of "Provincia" is arbitrary and unnecessary and inflexible and burocratic.
<dl>
<dd><del>sometimes it's unecessary to say Buenos Aires and it's sufficient to sy province. Maybe you take a trip to BsAs? <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 22:01, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</del></dd>

</del></dd>
<dd><del>Next thing, I don't see why you wanna force me to say "in Córdoba Province" instead of "in <i>the</i> Córdoba Province", because you're forcing the grammatical structure and an artificial translation. In Spanish we say "<i>la</i> Provincia de Buenos Aires", so you even want me to mix up the grammatical structures.

<dl>
<dd><del>The next point is, you're just talking about the length of the text one has to type. Look, I also care about that, but, nonetheless, it's still secondary. The most important thing is what gets displayed, in other words, what the reader reads when he looks at the page. In a wiki, you have to distinguish between the text that gets written, and the text that gets displayed. They're not the same. The most important thing is the end result, the bottom line. That is what the reader who visits Wikipedia sees when he looks at the page. I don't care if I have to type one hundred kilometers of text, as long as the text that gets displayed the way I want. What counts most is whether the ideas get expressed the way Wikipedia editors intend to, not whether they have to type more words. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 06:50:16, 2005-07-27 (UTC)

<h3><del><span class="mw-headline">Let's keep it cool</span></del></h3>
<p><del>Please, everyone has its own opinion, and we are trying to find a consent that has not yet being reached in the Wikipedia.</del></p>
<p><del>Truth is that there are thousands of articles with names such as [[New York City]], <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Cruz_River_94a8.html" title="Santa Cruz River">Santa Cruz River</a>, etc., and that naming is neither right or wrong, it's just an option.</del></p>
<p><del>I've read some things I would like to clarify. First I would like to say that the <i>official</i> name of the Argentine provinces respond to the <i>Procinvia de X</i> format (Provincia del Chubut, Provincia de Salta, etc). Question: Should we translate <i>Provincia</i> or not? Second, I believe its important to keep the name of an Article as clear, simple and closer to the end-user as possible.</del></p>
<p><del>In my opinion, the benefits of naming an Article one way or the other can not be <i>"I have to type less"</i>, but <i>"That's the proper</i> name"<i>, or</i> "that's the english name"<i>, or even</i> "that's what the end-user would probably search for"<i>.</i></del></p>
<p><del>Now, I kindly ask you to present your <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> in a more <i>tidy</i> way. I propose the following format, but its imperative that we keep the points short, not <i>duplicated</i>, and add no comments in between:</del></p>
<ul>
<li><del><b>X (province)</b> and variants
<ul>
<li><del><b>advantages</b>
<ol>
<li><del>No need of full typed pipe when the word <i>Province</i> is not needed.</del></li>

</ol>
</del></li>
</del></li>
</ul>
</del></li>
</del></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><del>I'll add a couple of things to the above, so as to keep the discussion from straying again.
<ol>
<li><del>It is just <i>not possible</i> to have a format that satisfies everyone and that fulfills all possible goals. But Wikipedia offers the possibility of redirects.</del></li>
<li style="list-style: none"><del>
<li><del>Please please everybody stop proselitizing a format, don't assume the other party is somehow ignorant of the obvious, don't resort to precedents (as if this were a trial), and sign your posts. We're going into uncharted space here, making an important policy and remaking the whole portion of WP that refers to Argentina, so let's keep it cool and sensible.</del></li>
<li><del>The user needs to be able to find things quickly. But in many cases the user will find an article by jumping from another article. When the user comes in from the Search dialog, s/he should find a redirect or a disambiguation page. Once exposed to a unified format for province name citation, s/he will learn. Let's not assume that users will be discouraged by not finding an article after just the first try.</del></li>
<li><del>Maybe (sorry) there's an extra alternative. There could be an inline template, e. g. <tt>{{argprov|Santa Fe}}</tt> that expands to, say, <tt>[[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Fe (province of Argentina)|Santa Fe]]</tt>. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

</del></li>
</ol>
</del></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><del>Bottom line, the problem here is that we have to use <i>province</i> because most of cases there are a <i>city</i> with the same name. That said, province is clearly disambiaguational, so, in my opinion, it should be beetween parenthesis. Below is my proposal:</del></dd>

<dd><del>Each province, as sovereign in matters of its own subdivisions, is different: Buenos Aires only has <i>partidos</i> under the provincial level, which are in fact municipalities, although most of the interior partidos are large and has more towns and villages besides the head. The partidos are divided in cuarteles (old use) or localidades, which in fact doesn't has authorities, besides appointed delegates. In the other provinces, which are divided in departaments, their caracther varies beetween them: in Santa Fe departaments are administrative, doesn't has elected officials, and are subdivided in communes and municipalities; in Mendoza, departaments are as same as Buenos Aires' partidos.

<p><del>The administrative divisions vary among <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province.html" title="Province">provinces</a>, it is self determined. For instance, <a href="../../../c/%C3%B3/r/C%C3%B3rdoba_Province%2C_Argentina_84fb.html" title="Córdoba Province, Argentina">Córdoba</a> is divided in <i>departamentos</i>, which are subdivided in <i>pedanías</i>, which are divided in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality.html" title="Municipality">municipalities</a>, and there are <i>comunas</i> which are administrative entities below municipalities, although they're not integral part of a municipality in administrative terms (I don't know what that means, I just found out about this).</del></p>
<p><del>On the other hand, <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_province_146e.html" title="Buenos Aires province">Buenos Aires</a> is NOT divided in <i>departamentos</i>. It's divided in <i><a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality.html" title="Municipality">municipios</a></i> usually called <i>partidos</i> (<a href="http://www.lamatanza.gov.ar/" class="external text" title="http://www.lamatanza.gov.ar/" rel="nofollow">Municipalidad de La Matanza</a>, not Departamento). The usual organization scheme of these <i>municipios</i> is in an Executive Department (Departamento Ejecutivo) and Legislative Department (Concejo Deliberante) which adds confusion about the issue: the municipality's government is usually called <i>departamento</i> referring to either the Executive or Legislative branch of the <b>municipality</b> government (or both).</del></p>
<p><del>There are 2171 <i>municipios</i> in Argentina according to <a href="http://www.portalargentino.net/municipios.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.portalargentino.net/municipios.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>.
