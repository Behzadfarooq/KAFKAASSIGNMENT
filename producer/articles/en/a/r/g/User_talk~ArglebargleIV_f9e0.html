<dd>Thanks for the reply! Even though the asterisk system is used throughout SeaWorld and the orca community, I completely understand.

<p>These two users appear to be separate actual users, but joined at the hip. Their behavior patterns are similar. We went through this with them last summer, and they seemed to go away in September, but they recently resurfaced, again totally focused on this one subject. In my opinion he/they are basically "trolls", or at least they exhibit "excessive" trolling behavior. They are good at starting edit wars and refusing to discuss things, then turning around and accusing everyone else of what they are guilty of. They are very good at pulling others into their game. I got sucked into it last summer, but I've tried to stay on the periphery of it this time and just watch the circus. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They do seem to be team editing and are thoroughly invested in the double standard. In particular Carfiend's edits (and their timing) during these past few weeks seem to be tactical appendages. I also notice, as Wahkeenah noted, that they seem to co-opt effective arguments and try to use them as their own - usually though, IMHO, they lack the ethical and authetically rational grounds that make those arguments effective and are left with mere choreography and unmoored rationales. I hesitate to say much more, as little pitchers have big ears and I'm sick of reading <b>mockumentary</b> versions of arguments and insights I hold as valid. By way of complete disclosure I initiated a RFC on Carfiend last summer as a result of the incidences that Wahkeenah desribes. The behavior which prompted the RFC is still apparent. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 04:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You can say that again. The pattern is the same, except that this time it's Gravitor that's more the aggressor. The RFC on Carfiend died on the vine when the both of them disappeared in mid-September... apparently, waiting for the heat to die down so they could start their game again. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I was just having a discussion with <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">User:Lunokhod</a>, who is talking about doing an RFC on the content dispute. I think that's actually a "request for mediation", and that RFC's are about users, but I could be wrong. Meanwhile, some memories came back as I was telling him about the RFC and the request for mediation that both died when those guys disappeared in September... specifically, about the ridiculous debate over the "rendezvous" definition. Remember that? Anyway, once Carfiend was shown up by the facts, he went away, and took Gravitor (and some other red-link users with similar M.O.s) with him. For awhile. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like Gravitor managed to suck Numskll into a set of 3-revert-violations, and they have both been blocked for 24 hours, by separate admins. My guess is that they each went to separate admins to complain about the other. Such a to-do. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And by the looks of Gravitor's talk page, he's learned nothing. He continues to delete stuff from his talk page that he doesn't like (calling it "trolling", as Carfiend did in similar circumstances last summer) and continues to parrot the sockpuppet question by accusing several of us of same. (I don't speak for anyone else here, but *I* don't do sockpuppets.) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:15, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The issue of content vs authority is so maddening though - especially given wholely user defined (and collaborative) topics and the range of motives at play.

<dd>1. Not one piece of evidence on the page is presented by "<i>proponents of the theory that the Moon landings did not happen</i>). None of the sources that the evidence come from have anything to do with the hoax.</dd>
<dd>2. Not one piece of evidence on the page was collected as a rebuttal to the hoax. In fact, nearly all of it (perhaps all) was collected <b>before the hoax accusations were even made</b>. To present this as part of a back-and-forth between the hoax proponents and landing defenders is a gross misrepresentation.</dd>
<dd>3. The people who collected this evidence are independent observatories and amateur astronomers. They collected it for their own reasons, certainly not as part of the hoax discussion.</dd>
<dd>4 The discussions on Wikipedia that produced this page are not a good reason to structure the information.</dd>

<p>Yes i know what u mean whit the ID thing about her. But i was actually sure that is was her. In the book there is no source to that bit of text. Sterling Seagrave wrote that there was an ancestor painting of Empress Xiao Zhen Xian. He also wrote how the painting looks like and by that i thought it was actually Empress Xiao De Xian. He says that she had a pointy chin and a dreamly look and if u look closely to the painting "i have got a much bigger and better version of it" u can see what i mean. But sometime it's very difficult to give reference cause a lot of chinese history is based on rumours. But anyway we can discuss about it:). (Read the book it's very good. ) It's called the Dragon Lady by Sterling Seagrave <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-679-40230-6</a></p>
<p>But one thing is sure, There is no ancestor painting of Empress Xiao Zhen Xian so it must be someone else.</p>

Oh, wow. I'm glad you could spend your time on worrying about c's page, even enough to ask a reference who submitted it, and if someone disagrees with you, which seems to be quite a few people, you could always call them vandals. Nothing like threating an anonymous user with a non-static ip (or dynamic... it changes whenever they log out).</p>
<p>Sorry if you failed your book report on Ryan Seacrest because someone cited another website and reveled that Seacrest's name was actually ethnic. Now what will America do if they found out.</p>
<p>Maybe you're right, we should cover it up and erases any traces of it. What will we do if he says "Aufenstein, out"</p>
<p>Pandemonium, I tell you.</p>
<p>But then again, someone will always know and make elaborate clues to get to the truth and Dan Brown will write a novel about it. I think he'll go for <b>The Arglebargle Code</b> or <b>Arglebargles and Dynamic63.136.116.166s</b></p>

Wow, it took a whole two seconds to think up what i wrote, but i guess 2 seconds of thinking is just plain unhealthy. It seems to me that most vandalism on seacrest is about his sexual orientation... I guess someone decided to go to IMDb and make up a name, solely to place it on here... A name that sounds Jewish...</p>
<p>We'll I see how calling him gay with John Dicksuck Fagenstein and an ethnic name with no gay name calling are alike. Gay, Jewish... same thing, right?</p>

<p>Hi Argle, for future reference, it's not a good idea to place warning templates on the pages of established editors, or to accuse them of vandalism, as you did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110863103" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110863103" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's best to assume good faith of people who've been contributing for a long time, and if you feel you have to comment on an edit from a long-term contributor, always best to leave a personal note.

<p>Hi ArglebargleIV</p>
<p>I saw your message on the Gilberto Silva goals page and I wanted to just leave a message to say a couple of things. First, I'm not angry at all that you've marked the page for deletion. The work you do keeps Wikipedia a tidy and clean place. I also anticipated that the article may be marked for deletion, because as you said, it is the first of its kind for any football|soccer player on Wikipedia. However, I ask you to listen to my points as to why this article should remain on Wikipedia, since they were what made me think the article should be created in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the most comprehensive football|soccer player's article on Wikipedia, and just because Pele's article is not so comprehensive, it shouldn't mean that others are limited to its size. It seems like an unnecessary bottleneck.</li>
<li>The goals which Gilberto have scored are encyclopaedic information</li>
<li>The information which is listed on Gilberto Silva goals was listed on his main article (<a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilberto_Silva_f08a.html" title="Gilberto Silva">Gilberto Silva</a>) for a number of months, proving it is indeed fit for Wikipedia, and...</li>
<li>It was only moved to a separate page because it was too chunky for its parent page. If the goals page is deleted, the information will only be pasted back onto the main article; I feel that would be less tidy/organized that it having its own page.</li>
<li>The reason Pele doesn't have his own goal page (or table) is due to the sheer number of goals that Gilberto scored. Some of the details of the goals are probably lost to history. Gilberto will only ever score about 50 goals, and they are all fairly recent, so his page can exist quite easily. The information is readily available. This is not to say that just the fact that Gilberto has scored LESS goals than most allows him to have his own goal page. Quite the opposite. There is even more reason that Pele should have his own page; the only reason that he doesn't though, is that nobody is willing (or able?) to compile a list of his many hundreds of career goals. This is a first step to more comprehensive soccer player articles; it shows editors a new added level of useful detail which can be attained.</li>
<li>Maybe Gilberto's goal page will lead to Pele (and other notable footballers) having their own statistics/goal pages. Maybe not. But the fact that no other editors have taken the time to compile such lists which require their own pages, surely does not mean that those editors which have, cannot have their pages exist.</li>
<li>Some Basketball and American Football players do have their own 'statistics' pages. See <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career_achievements_of_Dwyane_Wade_2a49.html" title="Career achievements of Dwyane Wade">Career achievements of Dwyane Wade</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career_achievements_of_Michael_Jordan_d25f.html" title="Career achievements of Michael Jordan">Career achievements of Michael Jordan</a>. True, this page isn't on the same scale as said career achievements pages, but the fact that Gilberto is so much less famous means his small goals page is correct to scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow! I typed a lot. I apologise. Thank you for reading, and I appreciate your comments, whether they are for or against the article's existence.</p>
<p>All the best, and keep up the good work. -<a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilbertoSilvaFan_0d3c.html" title="User:GilbertoSilvaFan">GilbertoSilvaFan</a> 18:41, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You seem to have an issue with an article about "Vibration Training". Very similar to Pilates it should at least have a reference here at Wikipedia. With no bias. Please explain exactly why you did this. As no group , company or person was promoted as per the rules. Thankyou. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lloyd Shaw (<a href="../../../l/l/o/User_talk%7ELloyd_Shaw_0dc8.html" title="User talk:Lloyd Shaw">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lloyd_Shaw_0fb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lloyd Shaw">contribs</a>).</small> <small>Moved from the top, where user:Lloyd Shaw had deleted a comment to put it in -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 21:26, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Re <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gogo_Dodo&amp;diff=121331616&amp;oldid=121182815" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gogo_Dodo&amp;diff=121331616&amp;oldid=121182815" rel="nofollow">your message</a>: The article was a personal essay that was spam and also a conflict of interest. If you do a Google search for the author's name and vibration training, you'll see what I mean. Most of the article was clipped out of forum posts so it could be seen as a copyright violation, too. I'd prefer not to restore the article as if I did, it could be seen as a copyright violation for reposting material that Wikipedia can't post. While the topic might be notable, the article in the form it was posted was not going to work nor do I think it was particularly salvageable as it would have to be completely rewritten to meet usual standards. -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 04:10, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
