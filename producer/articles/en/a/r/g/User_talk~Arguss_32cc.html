<p>Hi - please dont keep adding stub templates to the Kawerau article. it is a lot bigger than a stub. if you think parts of it should be expanded then you can use a {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}} template, but its already pretty big for an article on a place that size (its as big as the Rotorua article and bigger than the Taupo one!). or if you can, expand it further yourself! <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_Lacertae_bf5a.html" title="User:BL Lacertae"><font color="red">BL</font></a> <small><a href="../../../b/l/_/User_talk%7EBL_Lacertae_adb7.html" title="User talk:BL Lacertae"><font color="#555555">kiss the lizard</font></a></small> 00:29, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm not sure where you got the idea that images on news sites don't use copyrighted images. Most of them are copyrighted agency photos which aren't allowed. Regards Arniep 22:53, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Karl_urban_2.jpg. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Foundation_83d9.html" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a> is very careful about the images included in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> because of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_law.html" title="Copyright law">copyright law</a> (see Wikipedia's <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Copyright policy</a>).</p>
<p>The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images on Wikipedia is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikipedia are <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">open content</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>, and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>. Find the appropriate template in <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> and place it on the image page like this: <code>{{TemplateName}}</code>.</p>

<p>Hi. I am a bot, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 0% for major edits and 0% for minor edits. (Based on the last 133 major and 0 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<p>We don't usually link to the same article several times within a given page. In particular, linking to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> from within <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_New_Zealand_e943.html" title="Cinema of New Zealand">Cinema of New Zealand</a> doesn't help the viewer much, as they already know where New Zealand is if they are reading the article. Linking the first time New Zealand is mentioned is sufficient. Linking to an individual film or director multiple times is likely to be more useful, as it's more relevant to the text.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 08:12, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Karl-stuff.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arguss_d451.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arguss">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. If you have any questions please ask them at the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_legality_questions_60d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image legality questions">Image legality questions page</a>.

<p>I just saw your post on the South Africa page and was horrified. South Africa is a wonderful country - you really need to take the expat community with a very, very, very big grain of salt. Many people are not fully honest in their reasons for disliking South Africa, a lot of it has to do with their dislike of actually living under a black government. South Africa is great, we have the World Cup in 2010 and a huge tourism industry. You will have no problems and instead have a great time. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me! Oh, and also ask that question to some of the people on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_South_Africa_2bbb.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject South Africa">South African WikiProject</a> - I'm sure we'll all be just as mortified.

<dd>Hi; I'm also just piling on from the same place. I'm also a white Afrikaner in my mid twenties, but I'm not at all that negative. SA has its problems, but these are no different than any other nation; crime is an issue, but not a <b>super</b>issue. The same goes for any other country/big city; look at how New York was and how its been improved during Giulliani's reign. You must keep in mind that expats have left after becoming disillusioned; for that very reason, they are biased. I guess the same is true for those who have stayed behind; maybe we just want to turn a blind eye to all the bad things that're happening, I dunno.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Racial segregation isn't the case in schools anymore — all schools, colleges and universities must (by law) be equally accessible to all members of all races. So we should all be equal now; in reality, this is still taking time — some people feel that after ten years the divide between the haves and have-nots have changed in make-up somewhat (normalising according to our demographics), but the divide itself is much bigger. This is one of the major issues we still have to deal with: poverty. That, and AIDS, will be the two largest challenges we'll face for the next few decades.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I can <i>promise</i> you this: you won't go back to NZ the same person after spending some time here; getting to know the rest of Africa is something my wife and I are just itching to do. To which school are you exchanging? <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">dewet</a>|<a href="../../../d/e/w/User_talk%7EDewet_cdb4.html" title="User talk:Dewet">✉</a> 06:29, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Arguss. Well, we really seem to be piling in on this one. By the time I tried to save my addition, Dewet had already written a reply too. I (also a male Afrikaner, but a bit older than Dewet) absolutely agree with Páll and Dewet. For some strange reason expatriate South Africans feel the need to vilify their former country in order to justify their emigration ... I don't know of anywhere else where that is the case ... maybe just one of those strange national quirks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, two pieces of anecdotal evidence that may put your mind at rest ...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I lived in the Netherlands for five years (work reasons) and returned to South Africa of my own free will a couple of years ago. While SA is certainly not without its problems, I found that, while it doesn't hurt to be a little bit more security conscious, I don't really feel any less safe in South Africa than the Netherlands (where they had the murder of a political party leader and deteriorating race relations during the period that I stayed there). (Errm ... that sounds a bit bad ... I didn't cause any of it&#160;:-) )</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An Italian friend/colleague lived and worked in SA for four years. He experienced absolutely no problems with crime here. He then moved to London, where his flat was burgled. After his studies were completed, he went to The Hague in the Netherlands to work. A couple of years ago, cycling home from work, he was pulled of his bicycle by two men, kicked, and robbed. Now, which of those countries would you feel the safest in if you were him?</dd>

<p>Glad to hear you're coming to the Mother City; I've been living here (or <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stellenbosch.html" title="Stellenbosch">close-by</a>) for most of my life, and I won't exchange it for any other city. It is the more laid-back and arty (even eccentric!) of our cities. I'd be happy to show you around, if you're interested. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">dewet</a>|<a href="../../../d/e/w/User_talk%7EDewet_cdb4.html" title="User talk:Dewet">✉</a> 07:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I really am not too concerned if someone does not agree with my views on current South Africa. You can all claim "crime isn't that bad" all you want but that doesn't really change the statistics. Furthermore, I am willing to bet a lot of you are living in your gated-security-firm-patrolled White suburbs on the outskirts of the city so you can claim it's "not all that bad" all you want. It's actually funny, I'm sure this is how a lot of you live in majority-White South African areas and claim how crime isn't that bad. Wonder why? With that said, I do think you will be fine if you stick to the "safe" areas. The Universities in SA are world class and you should get a great education. Do you know any Afrikaans by any chance?</p>
<p>As for the expat community being delusional, I have only been an "expat" for five some odd years. How many of the current White residents have had their homes burglarized or have a family or friend that has been assaulted or robbed? I used to be able to go to the supermarket after dark, that's impossible now. Or maybe they can tell you that there are perhaps some friends or family members who no longer want children? Why? They don't want them to bring them up here. I don't think it's only the expats being delusional, Zimbabwe was a wake up call for many already. Although the West pushes for diversity from non-White countries as being beneficial I see a growing tide of "South Africa for the Africans" (regardless of the fact that Boers didn't even run into any "natives" for a long time).</p>
<p>Maybe you should take me with a grain of salt but I don't think my views should be ignored. Actually, I would like to add, I don't mean to scare you... if you stay in the suburbs of major cities you will be fine. South Africa is a beautiful place with a lot to offer, I think you will have a great time if you take the necessary precautions and do not travel to 'unsafe' areas after dark. I also found this news article that some may find interesting: <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20051031&amp;s=diarist103105" class="external free" title="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20051031&amp;s=diarist103105" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20051031&amp;s=diarist103105</a></p>
<p>Oh also, you said New Zealand isn't very diverse being around 75% White. South Africa is actually less diverse then New Zealand over 80% of the population is Black. So actually look for less diversity. <a href="http://www.gatedcomsa.co.za" class="external free" title="http://www.gatedcomsa.co.za" rel="nofollow">http://www.gatedcomsa.co.za</a> <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVolksgeist_5c91.html" title="User:Volksgeist">Volksgeist</a> 20:21, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All I can say is don't listen to much of what Volksgeist says. I, for one, live nowhere near a gated community and think they're actually rather disgusting and awful places — soulless, really. I park my car on the street at night and have no problems; in fact, so does almost everyone on the block. I walk around at night with no troubles, I go into informal housing areas — in short, I do everything that Volksgeist says you cannot do. While the crime rate is inarguably bad, it is also very localised: hence the crime rate is much worse in <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillbrow%2C_Gauteng_245a.html" title="Hillbrow, Gauteng">Hillbrow</a> than in, say, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandton%2C_Gauteng_47d4.html" title="Sandton, Gauteng">Sandton</a>. Oh, and you don't need to know a lick of Afrikaans to get by anywhere in South Africa, except maybe in <a href="../../../v/e/n/Ventersdorp%2C_North_West_149f.html" title="Ventersdorp, North West">Vendersdorp</a>, home of <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Terreblanche_7cdb.html" title="Eugene Terreblanche">Eugene Terreblanche</a> and his <a href="../../../a/w/b/AWB_af85.html" title="AWB">AWB</a> gang. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 19:16, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could that school be called <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops.html" title="Bishops">Bishops</a>; Bishops College or <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocesan_College_356e.html" title="Diocesan College">Diocesan College</a>? These three names all refer to one school, which has a massive exchange program. If it is, you will be going to one of the prestige schools in SA. (Its my school... and so if my guess is correct, i think i have hit the jackpot!) It is English language and rather liberal.</p>
<p>Here are a few comments re your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The school is definately stricter than in NZ. However, in an English school (which you will probably be going to), the standards are not so strict. Anyway, because you are an exchange student the <b>staff probably wont care</b> if you step out of line, unless the offense is major. The <i>Afrikaner factor</i> is not so great.</li>
<li>In SA, the driving age is 18. However, you may want to consult the AA for an international driver's license. I'm not sure what the regulations will be. Public transport is generally a no-no if you can afford not to use it. Taxis (basically 16 seater minibusses, which are often overloaded) and the MetroRail trains <b>must be avoided at all costs</b>, however, busses are slightly better. Maybe I am writing with a bias. Most parents are more than happy to drive you around wherever you want to go. Boarding houses have a matron to this effect.</li>

<ul>
<li>English South Africans are culturally <b>very similar</b> to Australia and New Zealanders. Generally the English are far more liberal than Afrikaans people. I am going on exchange to AUS later this year; I also know many people who have been to Australia/New Zealand, and they tend to agree with the above.</li>
<li>I am sure that u will enjoy it.</li>

<p>Hi mate how are you? I hope you don't mind but for the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_New_Zealand_films_ce31.html" title="List of New Zealand films">List of New Zealand films</a> could you gradually put them in the table provided in accordance to the other world lists and added details on the direcotr, actors, genre, notes and date of release. You<i>ve already done agreat job in ordering them anyway!! ALso all of the other lists are intended to be feature films anyway All the best . I'll give you a hand some time if you like<a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 22:05, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Thanks mate yes sorry about moving the page its just all the other lists are basically feature films and New Zealand seemed the odd one out. When I have time I'll give you a hand in filling in the tables -they are good because they also show the direcotrs actors genre release dates and notes which are list of titles can't do -cheers. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 20:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Just want to show my greatest thanks for helping reformat the New Zealand films with User:Dramatic thanks mate!!!

<p>I have added a "{{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}" template to the article Temeraire (film), suggesting that it be deleted according to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">proposed deletion</a> process. All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>" and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia's deletion policy</a>). Please either work to improve the article if the topic is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, or, if you disagree with the notice, discuss the issues at its talk page.
