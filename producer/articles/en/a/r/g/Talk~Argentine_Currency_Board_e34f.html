<p>hello in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_Currency_Board_34fa.html" title="Argentine Currency Board">Argentine Currency Board</a> entry in wikipedia it is said that "In 1989, former President Raúl Alfonsín resigned, and in July of that year Carlos Menem was elected President. His early attempts to stabilize inflation failed, resulting in further devaluation of the peso and a serious reduction in the central bank's reserves." there has occured a problem when i corrected this statement repleacing <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devaluation.html" title="Devaluation">devaluation</a> with <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depreciation.html" title="Depreciation">depreciation</a> i was called a vandal&#160;:( IMHO devaluation is when the exchange rate is changed (lowered) by central Bank when the exchange rate is set by this institution, while depreciation is a term used when exchange rate changes (lowers) in floating exchange rate if someone wants to clear this out pls post your answer here</p>

<dd>I used a standard template that warned you that you might be considered a vandal.

I already explained to you, in your talk page, why I think "devaluation" and "depreciation" are both right and what you should do (i. e. ask for someone in <a href="../../../d/e/v/Talk%7EDevaluation_0eb3.html" title="Talk:Devaluation">Talk:Devaluation</a> to clarify this issue). —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<p>and i ve asked there... and about that edit... well when i changed word to depreciation i finnished reading this article (which is very interesting and well written indeed) and restored it finding that devaluation word is still being used supposing that i didnt edit it well i agian repleaced word devaluation with word depreciation having not knowing someone reedited my first edit cinsidering me a vandal... if inflation in argentine was high it must mean there was floating exchange rate and as money being a commodity as other commodities like iron, gold, apples when its price lowered it means it has depreciatied not devaluated (devaluation is when someone from monetary unit like central bank orders to change exchange rate which is set by this authority)</p>

<dd>In the text you give, Devaluation and Depreciation are used as synonims (they are both used for the same thing). In this case, depreciation is a more general term,therefore I think devaluation should be used in this context. Don't forget to check the article's history to see who changed what.

<dd>Could you consider the possibility that neither you nor the authors of the articles are entirely correct? In Argentina we've always used <i>devaluación</i> ("devaluation") in both senses. In English "depreciation" is an accounting term, and its article is <i>clearly</i> written with that sense in mind and has nothing to do with currency depreciation. In these cases the usual practice in WP is to have <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> pages. <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depreciation.html" title="Depreciation">Depreciation</a> should be renamed to Depreciation (accounting) and somebody should write <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depreciation_%28currency%29.html" title="Depreciation (currency)">Depreciation (currency)</a>, but I'm not sure I'm qualified to do that. Please give me some time, and I'll try to get a draft. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.
