<p>I edited out the American physicist and Indian High school student to read just physicist and high school student, since it really doesn't matter in the least where in the world they're from.

<p>Some parts of the essay are good, but others seem unconvincing. My least favourite section is "It doesn't do any harm". Although this argument is clearly overinclusionist and wrong, the explanation does nothing to establish why non-notable topics should be deleted - just because there are 6 billion people in the world doesn't mean all of them are going to have articles overnight, and I don't seriously believe resource constraints will ever be a problem. I think a better argument would discuss the maintenance overhead of each article, the spread of misinformation (which you did address), and the inflation of lists and disambiguation pages with less useful entries. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 23:31, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously it's unlikely that every single person on the planet would get an article, like a lot of the examples contained in the essay it's taking things to ridiculous extremes to make the point more clear. Still, I'd agree that it could be clearer that it doesn't take everyone on the planet having an article before non-notable articles are a bad idea. Now that I think about it, it would probably be worth pointing out the issue of manpower restraints as well as resource constraints, admins and editors who do RC/vandal patrol are spread fairly thinly as it is. Of course, resources aren't the key reason why non-notable articles are a bad idea, the fact that they're unencyclopaedic is more vital, but from my experience most people making the "it doesn't do any harm" argument have difficulty seeing how the fact that an article is unencyclopaedic is harmful; they tend to consider being informative (even if it's being informative about things nobody cares about) as more important. I wanted to add maintainence haul into the equation but couldn't for the simple fact that I don't know what the maintainence haul is, and couldn't for the life of me find the info. Anyway, I'll probably have a crack at making that particular section better, but I never intended this to be a personal essay so feel free to change/add anything you want to. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 02:46, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must say that I really liked your essay, because exactly these things have crossed my mind a lot lately (especially the cruft argument). I have taken the liberty of adding a section on using search engines to determine notability. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 10:18, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have just added two additional sections (<i>per nominator</i> and <i>just policy</i>) and divided the arguments in several groups. Feel free to adjust. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 14:53, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would take issue with "Wikipedia has a number of fairly strict notability guidelines <b>that need to be met</b> before a subject can even be considered for an article." [Emphasis added.] This keeps coming up in discussions on whether or not to keep articles, and shouldn't.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../n/o/n/Wikipedia%7ENon-notability_3841.html" title="Wikipedia:Non-notability">Wikipedia:Non-notability</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This page is a proposed Wikipedia policy, guideline, or process. The proposal may still be in development, under discussion, or in the process of gathering consensus for adoption. References or links to this page should not describe it as "policy".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Notability should not be used to argue for or against the <i>inclusion</i></b> of information on Wikipedia – instead, official guidelines and policy relating to NPOV, NOR, and Verifiability should be used. However, it is valid to use it as a guide to the placement of that information.</dd>
</dl>
<p>[emphasis added]</p>
<p>The article goes on to give great guidelines on how to handle articles that may be nominated:</p>
<ol>
<li>No solution is possible for articles on non-verifiable subjects, or topics that directly violate official policy.</li>
<li>Articles that lack quality can be tagged as such, or readers can judge for themselves that a page is not written with the same standards as other articles. A suggested fix is to specially mark articles of quality, and also articles without quality.</li>
<li>Categories can be reorganized or further split off to form smaller more specific categories in which to place topics of differing degrees of fame.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notability isn't on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_guidelines_2dea.html" title="Wikipedia:List of guidelines">Wikipedia:List of guidelines</a>. That list "is a comprehensive summary of all guidelines that are in use and have the current consensus of Wikipedia editors. Unlike policies, guidelines are usually more flexible and more likely to have exceptions and could be changed and improved more easily."</p>
<p>The issue at hand is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>. As has been noted at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, notabliity is a <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sticky_wicket.html" title="Sticky wicket">sticky wicket</a>:</p>

<dd><b>This is an <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_essays_5501.html" title="Category:Wikipedia essays">essay</a></b> expressing the opinions and ideas of some Wikipedians. While it can help explain and understand existing Wikipedia policies and guidelines, <b>this is not an actual policy or guideline</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Feel free to update this page</a> as needed, or use the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">talk page</a> to discuss major changes.</dd>

<dd>Although <b>notability is not formal policy (and indeed the whole concept of <i>notability</i> is contentious)</b>, it is the opinion of some editors that this is what is meant by Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information (which is a formal policy).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm obviously one of the editors that doesn't agree with the "opinion of some editors". I can't see how one can assert or deny notability without violating Neutral Point of View <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. Let's take a brief outline for an article as an example: (assume all statements are verifiable and citations obtainable)</p>
<p>This person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was part of the original staff of the <a href="../../../n/a/m/NAMES_Project_AIDS_Memorial_Quilt_5ad2.html" title="NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt">NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt</a>.</li>
<li>Is credited in an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>-winning film.</li>
<li>Created the largest known database using the early flat-file version of the database software <a href="../../../f/i/l/FileMaker_Pro_d121.html" title="FileMaker Pro">FileMaker Pro</a> with more than 10,000 records.</li>
<li>Was a member of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Gay_Men%27s_Chorus_c928.html" title="San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus">San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus</a> (SFGMC), considered the "grandaddy" of the more than 100 LGBT Choruses worldwide. (See <a href="../../../g/a/l/GALA_Choruses_2864.html" title="GALA Choruses">GALA Choruses</a>.)</li>
<li>Served on the Board of Directors of Golden Gate Performing Arts, the non-profit parent corporation of the SFGMC; and produced the concert in 1987 that raised the money to retire the loan that financed the SFGMC's historic nationwide tour in 1981.</li>
<li>Was a member of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Symphony_Chorus_4dd6.html" title="San Francisco Symphony Chorus">San Francisco Symphony Chorus</a>, which has won several <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> Awards.</li>
<li>Has worked as an Associate Instructor teaching <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watsu.html" title="Watsu">Watsu</a>, a ground-breaking form of bodywork done while floating the client in warm water.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Is this person notable?</i> Can you imagine the discussion that would ensue? I warrant one of the first arguments to be put forth would be notability, which some people would feel was met. This person is directly associated with topics that are included in Wikipedia, etc. Others would feel that this was a perfect example of violating the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_of_vanity_articles_63d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles">Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles</a> official policy. (The latter people would be correct.)</p>
<p>So, at the risk of starting some sort of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flame_war.html" title="Flame war">flame war</a>, I'd like to see references here to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> removed, as this would just fuel the flames of the controversy already surrounding the controversial guidelines associated therewith. There are other official policies and actual guidelines that are in place or being developed to use as reasons for deleting an article.</p>
<p>For example, I don't think the following is a sufficient argument (which you have pointed out in your similar example regarding <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>:</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>. Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.</p>
<p>The first paragraph of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> (formerly/still known as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious). However, it is the opinion of many Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies). Failure to meet these criteria does not mean that a subject must not be included, meeting one or more does not mean that a subject must be included. Many Wikipedians oppose the use of this guideline.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So if someone wants to cite the guideline, they need to cite the specific portions of it that they feel are applicable to the discussion at hand, not cite it as a blanket reason for deletion.</p>
<p>Additionally, a guideline that is <b>proposed</b>, <i>e.g.</i>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28pornographic_actors%29_a726.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)">Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)</a> should definitely never be cited as a reason for deletion in and of itself. By virtue of its being a proposal which has not gained consensus, there are most likely portions that enjoy even greater contention than that of a guideline such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. Again, the editor arguing for deletion should list those points that are relevant to the discussion at hand rather than citing the proposed guideline.</p>
<p>Since these sorts of edits are what I would consider to be rather major, I leave them to you to either perform or ignore, as you see fit. I realize that this was a long slog, I appreciate your making it this far, and thank you for your consideration.<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 18:00, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not the original author of this essay, but I have contributed a couple of paragraphs to it, including the <i>just a policy</i> one, so I suppose I can also comment on this a bit. I partly agree with you that including the notability guidelines is tricky, because they are only guidelines and not policy and most of them are still under development. Also, the exact same points can be made by referring to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in many cases where notability is an issue. On the other hand, I certainly looks like the notability guidelines will be an important part of Wikipedia guidelines and maybe even policy in the future, looking at how quick the concept is being adapted by the community. One could ofcourse argue to reinstate mentioning those criteria <i>once</i> this had happened and the process is finished. Personally, I think we should take the notability references out for now and only refer to real policy, but it is not a major issue for me, so I'll leave it up to <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi">Daduzi</a>. I have just read <a href="../../../n/o/n/Wikipedia%7ENon-notability_Essay_bd12.html" title="Wikipedia:Non-notability/Essay">Wikipedia:Non-notability/Essay</a>, which increases my feeling that we should leave out notability here. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<p>I guess I kinda changed my mind on what I wrote earlier, but I just removed all reference to the concept of notability from the essay, where applicable replacing them with references to policies. This way, the essay sticks only to policies (and a few guidelines) for making the arguments, leaving out the more controversial notability concept. These are the changes I made: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADaduzi%2FArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions&amp;diff=68984368&amp;oldid=68707410" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADaduzi%2FArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions&amp;diff=68984368&amp;oldid=68707410" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. For a short while I considered including even a seperate heading to describe why notability would not be a good idea to use withour further arguments, but I've decided to refrain from that because that way the essay would lean the other way, towards people <i>not</i> liking the notability idea. So for now, it is removed all together. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 08:34, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to suggest two more arguments that I've seen bandied about in AfD a lot...</p>
<p>"<b>Keep</b>: I thought AfD was to provide information on anything." --AllInclusive</p>
<p>"<b>Keep</b>: It violates the spirit of Wikipedia/Jimbo Wales' vision." --FriendOfWikiSpirit</p>
<p>Both of these are similar; in any case they're not true. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. The "spirit of Wikipedia" argument in particular is annoying because it assumes the keep voter can read Jimbo's mind.</p>
<p>Should these be included in the "arguments to avoid"? Expanded of course. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:05, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right that the first one pops up now and then (assuming you mean <i>Wikipedia</i> rather than <i>AfD</i>&#160;:) ), although mainly from new, inexperienced users. But sure, you can add it. With regard tot the second, I (luckily) have never seen that one in an AfD, so I would leave it out for now.

<p>I disagree with both these sections. If the nominator already put things completely clearly, why do I necessarily need to restate them? Same thing with briefly mentioning a policy. If there are no reliable sources, and I say "delete, no reliable sources", do I really need to say more? While AfD is not a vote, there are certainly voting elements to it. If 3 people are "voting" keep, and only the nominator has asked to delete the article, probably it will be kept. If 3 people want to keep, and 20 want to delete, probably it will be deleted. So "me too" votes are, in fact, counted, so they do, in fact, have a purpose. Some people prefer brevity. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 16:39, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since I was the one who contributed those sections, I'll answer your points. I do see your point and sometimes brevity is indeed a virtue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to the <i>per nom</i>: It is very disappointing (the actual word that came to mind was annoying) when someone goes through lengths making a point in favor of keeping an article and in the end it gets deleted because the nominator said only <i>fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a></i> and there are a couple of <i>per nom</i> votes, but no real argument. I will change the sections to mention that if the nominator makes a clear, well sourced point for deletion, one could think of supporting this with a per nom vote, but I'll a remark that this useless if there are already a couple of those votes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to the other one, I'll still think that it is a valid point. Saying <i>delete, no reliable sources</i> does not give much information to other editors. Does it have no sources at all? Do the sources not reflect what is stated in the article? Does it have sources, but are they to non-reliable? Also, please keep in mind here that there is often a lot of debate on what exactly constitutes a reliable source. Similar reasoning can be applied when referring to other policies without further comment.</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, the "per nom" bit is not true. Disappointing, perhaps, but a "per nom" vote does count, if the issues are otherwise debatable. Ask any administrator how they will close a deletion discussion with 5 good arguments to keep, and 5 to delete. Now ask how they will close a deletion discussion with those same 5 good arguments to keep, and 5 to delete, and 5 "delete per nom".

<p>There are several problems with this argument. 1) No one is obligated to do anything on Wikipedia. We're all volunteers, so we are free to work on whatever we want as long as they are good faith efforts to improve the encyclopedia.

<ul>
<li>You can certainly violate a guideline (maybe the term "violate" is too strong, but you can "break" or "go against" a guideline). It's not problematic if people or issues break guidelines, because guidelines can have exceptions. However, if people disagree whether such an exception is reasonable, it may be useful to discuss that, and that is what happens on AFD.

<p>"Similarly, there are many examples where a large number of hits on a search engine is no guarantee for being suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, for example in the case of wide spread urban myths." But if an urban myth is pervasive and well known, it can be notable.

<p>in recent AfD debates I've heard these used more about notability than about content--and much more using it against the validity of a statment implying inclusion than the other way round.

<dd>Most duff arguments are from new users or even meatpuppets who don't understand AfD properly, and they normally&#160;!vote 'keep'. I'd say that duff arguments to keep are more varied than duff arguments to delete (which normally just say 'non-notable' or similar). Besides, the essay doesn't seem that biased to me; there are a few more sections explaining the problems with keep arguments than with delete arguments, but that's because their opposites never come up (for instance, I've never seen <b>Delete</b> there should be no information in Wikipedia). One thing that I have seen, and maybe should be added, is <b>Delete</b> I've never heard of them (in the face of several reliable sources showing notability). --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:46, 24 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<dd>"Most duff arguments are from new users or even meatpuppets who don't understand AfD properly, and they normally&#160;!vote 'keep'" - this adds weight to my view that AfD is biased towards established users who are (primarily) deletionists. If a new user (not meatpuppet) thinks certain topics should be included on Wikipedia, where exactly do they go to register their opinion if <i>not</i> AfD? The main problem is that there is far too much instruction creep here now, which potentially creates a hostile environment for new Wikipedians. Beyond the obvious WP:V and WP:OR requirements, I think AfD primarily <i>should</i> be about "ILIKEIT" and "IDONTLIKEIT", so long as people can explain <i>why</i> they like or dislike certain things being in Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>I'd like to raise an opposition to the received wisdom that othercrapexists is not a good argument. I agree that in the main this is true, however othercrapexists should be a good counter to systemic bias and so should not always be assumed to be nonsense. An example would be the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Affluence_%28KCR%29_822c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Affluence (KCR)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Affluence (KCR)</a> AfD as the comparison to similar articles from other areas of the world where wikipedia has a better developed article set serves as a useful means of determining the notability of the articles. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 14:19, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the point you bring up is exactly why the othercrapexists criteria is there. Two articles may have similar content (or maybe only similar subject matter, I've seen arguments like "but my little company that has no sources sells software, just like Microsoft and IBM"), but one may be covered in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and the other may not be so lucky. For your example, the argument's hinging on whether "light rail" (in the Hong Kong context) is rail, and I'd say that those would be closer to streetcars than rails. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 14:52, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm hoping my point is somewhat more subtle than that. Othercrapexists in respect of <i>some notable and verifiable thing exists so therefore my related but non-notable and non-verifiable article should exist</i> is fine. However, I think it is easy to use this as a means of excluding articles through wikipedia's pronounced systemic bias. On the example that I put forward, the prevailing argument was that it should be deleted until the putting forth of an argument that seems on the face of it to be othercrapexists and I believe it was a good use of that kind of point as it helped to clarify the equivalence to other articles that are better covered. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 15:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I had another thought about this and that is that othercrapexists is a form citing precedent, particularly for those who might not be familiar with wikipedia's complex processes. While I sympathise with the concept behind othercrapexists, I'm finding myself in opposition to this particularly as ilikeit is cited quite so frequently these days. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 12:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"OTHERCRAPEXISTS" covers good as well as bad arguments, in my view. To state that a comparable article survived a previous deletion debate <i>is</i> absolutely relevant to an AfD discussion - the whole point of such discussion is to establish consensus, and any evidence of an existing consensus is germane to the debate. It is a far more useful argument than simply invoking WP:N without explanation or citing an arcane and pedantic interpretation of a policy or guideline (something which I feel is often used in bad faith, by experienced Wikipedia editors, to intimidate newcomers). Bad arguments include using the existence of an article on a notable topic to argue for the retention of a non-notable one, or using the <i>non-existence</i> of an article to argue for the deletion of an existing one (better phrased as "OTHERCRAPDOESNTEXIST" - if this was consistently applied, of course, Wikipedia would have no articles at all). <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 13:19, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as WP:SCORCHEDEARTH is concerned, I think it is an appropriate way of describing attempts to defend an article by stating that other similar articles should be deleted as well.

<dd>For certain, WP:ILIKEIT is the one used the most often. It comes from the consequence of being the first shortcut made (long before the essay was moved to WP: space, to get an idea of how long it existed), so most people referred to it that way. I know it promotes "just a policy" thinking, but even without the current shortcuts people will just revert back to the "NN, D" style of arguing which is just as bad. So ILIKEIT is the new NN. I'm not sure we can prevent this without modifying people's behaviour. As for "other crap exists", do you have an alternative that would get the point across? WP:COMPARE? WP:JUSTASNOTABLE? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I know how long it has existed, together with Daduzi I was one of the early authors. The first shortcut was WP:ILIKEIT, to which I have no particular objections. My problem is mainly that we do not need this diversity of shortcuts, as it distracts from the main message of the essay, that you should use <i>sound arguments</i>, not shouting links or hollow phrases. This diversity of links actually promotes shouting them around, which is contrary to the essay itself. One or two good links should be more then enough I think. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 00:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Again, I'm not sure this is a shortcut problem, rather than a behavioural problem. The "I like it" meme has travelled so far that even if you wiped out all the shortcuts except WP:AADD tomorrow it'll just cause people to go [[WP:AADD|ILIKEIT]] instead. Which is ironic given that the essay was designed to wipe out these arguments. I think a better way to solve it is to put a nutshell statement saying "try to fully explain your reasoning behind your keep or delete statement; short statements that don't explain the reasoning don't help the deletion discussion." That way people don't have to read through the whole essay to get the point. Of course, purging a large number of the shortcuts wouldn't be bad, either. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 03:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'd like to remove IFD from being mentioned in the opening of this. The "discussions" that occur there are often minimal (if any) and most of this does not include IFD. Specifically, the code UE (unencyclopedic) is a valid claim for images. If it had a value to us (aka, encyclopedic) we'd put it in an article somewhere, but the nominator (and others) are saying that they don't see how this is useful. It's most likely used on images of a user they uploaded for their userpage (a picture of a user isn't encyclopedic) so we don't need it (would only generally apply if the image was also an orphan, aka not used), but can be used in other times. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 20:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone just put up the tag that proposes this essay to become a guideline or policy. As one of the early authors, I want to advise strongly against doing so. As I have explained before at several locations, this essay is being cited too much by people who have misinterpreted its intention. The essay was meant to encourage people to use sound arguments rather than dumping votes, Google searches or links to WP:ACRONYMS in AfD discussions. Quite the contrary has happened though. This essay is being cited too often in AfD discussion without the citing person giving any additional rationale for providing the link. In addition, the contents of this essay are so diverse that they do not reflect a consensus opinion as a whole. Many people agree with certain sections of the essay, but not with others. In addition, its contents reflect the current situation of Wikipedia, as is exemplified by the later addition of arguments on notability and the like. Therefore, its contents might change to much to ever reflect an "official" guideline (and especially policy). --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>I think it would be useful to have a guideline which sets out the kind of arguments that administrators should find persuasive when considering an AFD. Except we have one already - <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a>. Personally I don't think <b>this</b> essay should be used as a guideline as many of the sections would not command consensus and some could simply discourage editors from commenting on AFDs - not the solution we want.

<p>I added that tag, and here's why I added it: I am not looking to say that this page <i>should</i> be a guideline on Wikipedia. The reason I added the tag is because in the AfD discussions I have partaken in in the month since I returned to editing, it had been treated <i>as if it already was</i> a guideline, or even a policy, for the deletion of articles. People are very consistently linking to or referencing the page, usually doing so below the point on the page where it explains the things listed are a part of an essay and not policy or guidelines. I'm not trying to make this page a guideline, I'm just trying to get a consensus on the matter - either way - so that it can be referenced correctly in deletion discussions. I hope you all understand what I'm getting at here. --<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a>|<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECastAStone_a48a.html" title="User talk:CastAStone"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This essay should <b>not</b> become a guideline. As a frequent participant on AFD, I'll explain as follows. Wikipedia votes that don't contain a rationale, or a good rationale, are still useful. It's easier for an administrator to deal with a nomination followed by 10 "Delete per nom"s than if the nominator, with equally strong reasoning, were not supported by others. If we're trying to build consensus, then any user's contribution to that consensus is worth something. I'll also note that <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">User:W.marsh</a>, who handles deletion as an admin, has a little bot to help him tally the "delete", "keep" and other votes. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The point in that section about the process having possibly been applied incorrectly to previous AFDs is well taken, but I don't see how that applies the other way. If an article on the most notable of a very similar group (say, characters in a specific tv show or one list in a grouping of nearly identical lists) is deleted at AFD then surely the other members of that group are in danger of being deleted as well, right? <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 20:36, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I prefer to say that they have <i>different</i> standards. Some of this has to do with the way WP got started,and the need to fill inn content rapidly. This accounts for the otherwise absurd choice to add articles from a ninety-year old culturally biased encyclopedia, and it also applies to the use of a gazetteer. Logically, there was no reason to stop there--a complete list of schools and post offices and street names could also have been used, and there are some who continue to want just that. It is only lack of editors who have prevented the need to come to terms with the lack of geographic limitation--as stated, WP must include every village everywhere~</dd>
<dd>However, there are advantages in arbitrary very inclusive criteria in some cases, and this might be one of them. Just imagine AfD if it were otherwise. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b></dd>

<p>I find that if someone argues <b>Keep</b>, you have an article on Y which is the same sort of thing as X, what happens most often is that Y gets put up for deletion too (normally deservedly), which is quite a good outcome as long as there aren't any <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violations involved.

<dd>If this is "pretty commonly agreed", show me a page which explains this. I did not say that I wanted to change the WP:N guideline, I was questioning your interpretation of it. The WP:N page does <i>not</i> state that the subject of an article should be the <i>primary</i> subject of multiple cited works and I highly doubt that such an interpretation would be agreed upon by the majority of Wikipedia editors. It sets the "bar to notability" far, far, higher than would generally be considered reasonable. Going by your interpretation, citing a textbook about the pancreas in the article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islets_of_Langerhans_f5d9.html" title="Islets of Langerhans">Islets of Langerhans</a>, or a Beatles biography in the article <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Starr_ef1f.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, would not "count" under WP:N, as the article subjects are not the primary subjects of the cited sources. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 15:16, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The best thing to do is to see if the stuff really <i>doesn't</i> belong on WP, based on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_policies_92b2.html#Content_and_Style" title="Wikipedia:List of policies">content policies</a>, and if it does belong, but you don't like it, then just live with it! Or try and discuss a change in rules -- but remember, the final consensus will still stand and you'll have to accept it. If it really doesn't belong, then you should nominate it on AFD. We should have <i>less</i> subjectivity here on WP, not more. mike4ty4 03:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>May I draw attention to the following sentence:</p>
<p><i>Those working at newspapers, magazines, journals and other secondary sources have to make sure that a subject is notable before they write a piece on it, because if they don't, no-one will read it, their employer will lose money, and they will get fired.</i></p>
<p>In fact, the subject may not be notable <i>before</i> they write a piece on it! Influential journalists have the ability to <i>make</i> a subject notable. Certain websites, certain bands, certain other things, have only become notable because a notable journalist has decided "ILIKEIT". For popular music in particular, journalists can be "<a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingmaker.html" title="Kingmaker">kingmakers</a>". Look at all the bands in the UK who only made it big because a <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melody_Maker_7cc0.html" title="Melody Maker">Melody Maker</a> journalist thought they were great.</p>
<p>This isn't a criticism of the general argument, merely an observation that professional writers are not always held to the same high standards as amateur Wikipedia editors. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 11:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We'd then have to establish "influentiality" of a journalist, etc. I think the gist is that <i>Wikipedia</i> should not decide it, since Wikipedia is just to report on what is already out there. It doesn't have so much to do with "professional" vs. "amateur" as it has to do with the purpose of Wikipedia itself. The world outside of Wikipedia is what defines and creates notability. mike4ty4 05:48, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>ILIKEIT, IDONTLIKEIT, OTHERCRAPEXISTS</b> - when used in good faith, these arguments are direct attempts to establish or cite consensus. Saying you like/dislike the <i>subject</i> of an article is obviously not a very good argument, but ILIKEIT and IDONTLIKEIT are often (incorrectly) invoked when a person explains why they like/dislike <i>the article itself</i>. In this context, these are primarily arguments about <i>what Wikipedia is/is not</i> and are a perfectly valid means of expressing an opinion about what should or shouldn't be in the encyclopedia. OTHERCRAPEXISTS is an argument based on an <i>existing</i> consensus about which articles should be kept or deleted; where it refers to previous deletion discussions, it is more often than not a good argument.</p>
<p><b>INTERESTING, USEFUL</b> - again, fair arguments if "interesting or useful <i>to readers of Wikipedia</i>" is implied (and the editor elaborates a little on <i>why</i> s/he thinks the article is interesting or useful). The essay tells us to "avoid subjective judgements" in deletion discussions, which I find ridiculous as such discussions are inherently subjective.</p>
<p><b>Arguments without arguments</b> - just plain bad. No argument from me.</p>
<p><b>This number is big</b> - this may be a good argument if used in conjunction with OTHERCRAPEXISTS as stated above, to establish that a valid comparison is being made. If, for example, a band <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> sold nearly as many records or had nearly the same number of hit singles as a notable band such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, then there is a strong argument for keeping the band article. "This number is small" may be an equally valid deletion argument if used in a similar way. See also my comments about journalists above.</p>
<p><b>ITSFUNNY, IDONTKNOWIT</b> - bad. I'm surprised at how often the latter pops up.</p>
<p><b>NOHARM</b> - possibly a bad argument in itself, but poorly explained in the essay. There are severe limitations on Wikipedia's size other than the notability guidelines (e.g. the finite number of people who wish to edit and contribute to the encyclopedia). Relaxing inclusion guidelines does not mean we will end up with articles about <i>everything</i>. One could say that NOHARM argues for a presumption in favour of keeping an article if there are no more convincing arguments either way.</p>
<p><b>ABOUTEVERYTHING</b> - a perfectly valid opinion, but not a strong argument in favour of keeping an article if the overwhelming consensus is that there should be at least <i>some</i> restrictions on what articles are included. Again, Wikipedia will never have articles on <i>everything</i> so long as it is maintained by a finite number of human beings (rather than <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_monkey_theorem.html" title="Infinite monkey theorem">these guys</a>).</p>
<p><b>SCORCHEDEARTH</b> - actually a <i>good</i> argument which cites the existence of a consensus in favour of keeping the article. If consensus <i>has</i> changed, the evidence of this should be cited by those who wish to delete the article - simply shrugging your shoulders and saying "SCORCHEDEARTH" is not helpful. Strangely, the essay here seems to imply that deletion discussions are somehow <i>separate</i> from the consensus-forming process, when surely they are (or should be) a key means by which consensus is established.</p>
<p><b>Fame in x</b> - "big fish in small pond" is a tricky issue on Wikipedia, and this part of the essay does not really address it properly. Forget about your Aunt Mildred in her sleepy village, and think about well-known politicians, sportsmen, and local "characters" in large or medium-sized towns. That is where the main problem lies. Not only that, there may be geographical bias in the "reliable sources" themselves. In the United Kingdom, for example, most of the print media is based in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, so readers in, say, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_155c.html" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle</a> have far more opportunity to read about London-specific phenomena than readers in London have to read about Newcastle-specific phenomena.</p>
<p><b>Google test</b> - this is just a variant of "this number is big" and is only meaningful if a relevant comparison is made.</p>

<p>The "no harm" argument is an extreme inclusionist position best discussed in the philosophical context of inclusionism versus deletionism, which the meta articles already do much better than the rambling diatribe we had there before.

The articles themselves aren't problems, as content is... content. like schroedinger's cat it's neither here nor there until someone does something to it. The problem is that getting rid of any mainspace article "for the good of the community" is a hollow argument--what community? Whose? Do the 4-5 people on a given Afd that invoke this speak for all... 10,000+ active editors?

<dd>Sorry. I tried to add a brief note but didn't have enough space in the edit summary and didn't have time at work to comment extensively here. Decisions based on legal liability can be an example of deletions "for the good of the project". All the great work we are doing and all the volunteer hours will be wasted if we set ourselves up to be sued into shutdown. You can find examples by reviewing the OFFICE files. It's not the majority of deletions performed but it's a sufficient minority that I had concerns about the wording of your draft. Your wording struck me as rather sweeping - strongly implying that the very concept of "the good of the project" is a false concept, not merely that "the views of a minority may or may not speak for the views of the majority".<br />
Taken to the logical extreme, your essay would seem to imply that we can't (or at least shouldn't) delete anything. That creates overwhelming problems for the project. Why would we delete <i>any</i> page except because by deleting the page we make the encyclopedia better?<br />

<dd>Your points are actually great... let me clarify. Legal/OFFICE issues weren't my intention, but specifically the things I see on AfDs (actually very prevalent on the three I am/was following): Essjay, Daniel Brandt, Barbara Schwartz. A lot of the opinions put as Deletion reasons were based around the ideal that the articles simple existence--not citing any legal/BLP ground mind you, just their existence--was a problem, and that they should be deleted to long-term problems/disruption. I guess the same could be said for that GNAA article also. Basically, getting rid of something <i>because</i> it could lead editors to do stupid things for personal or emotional reasons, or due to possible long-term trollery isn't a valid reason to delete. We shouldn't remove stuff for non-policy, non-legal reasons, because they MIGHT be headaches later, or long-term. Every sitting President's article for forever will be a troll/vandal magnet. Do we remove them? Of course not, and shouldn't cut off our noses for possible future problems that seem to be in each case from a minority of people who decide IAR means "my way or the highway" against concensus. In other words, "delete this for the good of the community" rather than for policy/established reasons of how we deal with all other articles isn't valid, and supreme bad faith in their peers. does that make sense?</dd>

<p>There is no way this has consensus. Some articles are horrendous shitfights, and the value of having them in the encyclopaedia is small enough that it's at least possible to consider that one should delete them. Your personal view that this is not a valid reason for deletion is not sufficient to negate that others do. That you see this on AfDs should give you a clue.

<p>I do not agree with this addition. An admin does not have to cite a reason as contributing to his decision to delete for such a reason to be valid. The closing admin during the Daniel Brandt deletion review did not say he was discounting the votes that had that as their reasons, so that is not a definitive judge of what is or is not a valid argument for deletion. If someone votes delete because they do not feel that a particular article that will never cease to provoke arguments and bad blood is worth the fuss they should have the right to state as much. We're here to write the best encyclopedia possible, adding an article that greatly detracts from the time and emotional state of being of a large number of otherwise productive editors on a regular basis when the article is of questionable worth in the first place could very well result in net degradation to the encyclopedia as a whole. Every time some massive drama explodes out of an article like Daniel Brandt, people go on extended Wikibreaks, some people leave Wikipedia altogether, in a case like the recent Daniel Brandt wheel war we lose valuable admins, and then there's the thousands of KB of wasted discussion. Some articles are simply not worth it. It is not assuming bad faith to assume that something that has happened multiple times in a row will happen again. It is assuming that the people who caused these problems were reasonable people who thought that they were doing the right thing, and that similar reasonable people will do the same in the future because such is human nature. Regardless, this essay is not just a collection of opinions. It is highly cited (how often does WP:ILIKEIT turn up in AFD?) and what is added here should reflect consensus. If this page fails to reach such a consensus it should be removed.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 05:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would comment that
<blockquote>
<p><i>Some articles are simply not worth it...</i></p>
</blockquote>
would likely generate as much kb's of debate over the (non)inclusion of subject matter as you are trying to save by deleting articles on such subjects. An article such as <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Intercourse_6c1d.html" title="Sexual Intercourse">Sexual Intercourse</a> attracts vandalism simply by the subject matter, but would never be considered as being deleted as too much trouble. However, a subject matter attracting far less vandalism but considered far less noteworthy might? I have never seen anything like that in discussion. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 22:52, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry if I was unclear, but you missed my point completely. This has absolutely nothing to do with vandalism. This is specific to situations with articles such as Daniel Brandt which several people stated should be deleted because it does nothing but provoke massive fights all the time, while being of generally little worth to the encyclopedia. Obviously those arguing in favor of deletion failed on that article, but there was no mention of the votes using this reasoning being discounted, so there is no reason why this reasoning automatically shouldn't be used in future debates.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 07:02, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I stand corrected regarding vandalism as opposed to edit warring, although I would continue to contend that pre-emptively declaring articles as having its worth to WP outweighed by the likely friction it may cause is still going to generate just as lively debate as having the article (with potentially the same result of losing editors over the matter). It just moves the controversy to a different arena. Even if it could be agreed on a few subjects that this still outweighs the risks in having the article there will be the problem of defining the point at which this happens, again with the resultant debate.</dd>

<p>Recently, I've been noticing arguments in AfD that favor deletion seemingly because somebody can vandalize an article. I consider these to be straw man arguments for the same reason that they are exercising any sort of concern, ironically: that is, anybody can edit this thing. So that said, I'm not convinced that "somebody might spam/vandalize/urinate upon/spray paint/AfD the article" is a valid argument, and it's my opinion that such an explanation should be in here. Thoughts? Maybe somebody can formulate something a bit more...well, diplomatic? =) --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 18:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two points in response
<ol>
<li>Bad arguments that happen to get the "correct" response should not be encouraged even though they happen to get it right. Simply because an article should be deleted does not mean all arguments for delete are good arguments.</li>
<li>Contrawise, the existance of a bad arguement in support of a good position does not nullify the position itself. For example, simply because a deletion arguement is support by someone "out to get" a certain class of articles does NOT mean that the article is worthy of keeping automatically.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Both of these arguements are <i>ad hominem</i> arguments, and should be avoided at all costs. In EVERY case, deletion or keep (and in some cases <b>speedy</b> keep) can be decided from facts at hand while NEVER resorting to faulty arguements. If an article should be kept, it should be kept REGARDLESS of who is arguing for delete or why they choose to do so. Likewise, deletable trash is deletable EVEN if some of those supporting delete do so in <i>bad faith</i>. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 15:51, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a draft for a new section, perhaps under the "fame or shame" or maybe the "point of view" header:</p>
<p><a name="Ad_hominem_arguments" id="Ad_hominem_arguments"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia_talk%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_57c3.html" title="Edit section: Ad hominem arguments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a></i> arguments</span></h3>
<p><i>Examples:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator simply hates all Death Metal bands and is obviously out to delete every article related to this topic. -- Dontlikethenom 04:04, 4 April 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Everyone supporting keep is obviously a member of the He Man Woman Hater's Club, and thus their arguements are invalid. We must then keep this article. -- Deleteitnow 05:07, 9 April 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i> fallacy assumes that because bad people are in support of a position, the position itself must be bad. While at the outset, it would appear that we don't want to encourage "bad behavior" by appearing to be in the same camp as those people who commit the "bad behavior", it should be noted that <i>ad hominem</i> arguements avoid dealing with the substance of the argument, and thus should be avoided. In this case, this issue is if we should delete or keep the article based on the article's adherance to wikipedia policies and guidelines. Disruptive editing, such as deletion nominations that appear to be about <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">making a point</a> can be dealt with through other fora at Wikipedia, but <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> is not one of them.</p>
<p>The principle should always be: Does evidence exist that shows whether this article, with proper editing, can comply with established wikipedia policies such as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>? If the answer is yes, the article should be kept. If the answer is no, the article should be deleted. This evidence exists independant of the motives, personalities, and actions of the people involved in the discussion. An <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> discussion is about the presentation and vetting of this evidence. The deletion or keeping of an article is based on the merits of the article itself.</p>
<p>In many cases, <i>bad faith</i> nominations of patently notable and well-written articles can be <b>speedy kept</b> based solely on the content of the article. The nominator, if obviously acting in a malicious and disruptive manner, can be warned with the appropriate <a href="../../../u/w/t/WP%7EUWT_9d62.html" title="WP:UWT">warning templates</a> and, in cases of repeated violations, referred to a forum such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">the adminsitrator noticeboard</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a>. However, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> is <b>not</b> the place for such actions. Keep discussions at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> solely content related.</p>

<p>Would everyone agree that these are two bad arguments? Every page is a magnet for vandals and everyone has a POV on a subject so wikipedia would have to be entirely deleted if this was a valid argument. As for the second it is a bad argument since XFD is not <a href="../../../c/l/e/WP%7ECLEANUP_bfa2.html" title="WP:CLEANUP">WP:CLEANUP</a> and the state of the article is not a cause for deletion. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 19:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That an article has been a particular attractor for vandals is a fact that can reasonably be weighed in a deletion discussion. We would never delete <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W_Bush_83e6.html" title="George W Bush">George W Bush</a> just because it attracts vandals because it is a clearly encyclopedic topic and there are very many good editors who keep the article on their watchlists in order to revert the inevitable vandalism. That's a very expensive task but we do it because the encyclopedia is clearly better with the article. We might not make that same cost-benefit decision for a minor stub about a non- or semi-notable subject. If Wikipedia can not find the necessary critical mass of informed and interested editor/volunteers to keep the article clean, to revert not just the overt vandalism but also all the subtle vandalism, the encyclopedia is better off without the page.<br />
This is a relatively rare situation but it happens enough that we can not categorically state that "vandalmagnet" is always and forever an invalid argument.<br />
On the same note, "article is a mess right now" is a non-argument but "no one has shown any interest in cleaning it up or maintaining it in over x months despite requested cleanup" can be a valid consideration during the discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 20:25, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, this is taking it way to far. We should only cover arguments that pop up regularly and not try to cover each possible invalid argument that we can think of. Whats next? Cover arguments like "Fred Johnson shouldn't be deleted because my dog just pooped", because they do not make sense? Lets stick to the relatively sane, yet invalid arguments.

<p>Eh? You really think that the arguments specified in the nomination should be paraphrased just to give an admin something different to read? If the nomination argument covers all the topics and reasons that you also think is reason for delete then stating <i>"per nom"</i> is surely fine?

<dd>This has the drawback of encouraging a pile-on. AfD is supposed to be about the arguments, not the numbers. Though, to be fair to you, a few admins still treat it as if it <i>were</i> about the numbers. The official advice is "if you have nothing to add, don't". A small number of "per nom" means the nominator has got something right. Lots of "per nom" doesn't do anything more. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 22:48, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see your point, although the advice of "if you have nothing to add, don't" is potentially disingenious; the nominator unknowingly reflected a consensus who didn't indicate support for the deletion under that guideline, and the admin decides on <b>keep</b> or <b>no consensus</b> as they are unaware of that weight of opinion. Perhaps paraphrasing the nomination, although also falling foul of "...adding nothing...", would then be justified? <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 23:08, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a matter of weight of opinion - if 200 users drop in and say "keep per X", where X is a user whose entire reasoning boils down to "it's cool", then the four or five "delete per nom" should be <i>more</i> than sufficient. You can still have a "consensus to delete" if the delete comments are in the vast minority. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 23:21, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>X</i> is not the nomiminator, though. I am only arguing for the independently arrived at support of the nominators contentions, which covers all the points of a would be contributor. If seven or eight editors come to AfD to comment and find that the nomination has covered their concerns comprehensively then what can be added? Those independent views should, however, be noted by the admin in deciding where consensus lies. The problem is then how to express that consensus without failing "...nothing to add...". True consensus cannot be found if those whose reasons have already been articulated elsewhere feel they cannot add to what has been said and so say nothing.</dd>
<dd>Where a supporter/opposer has already stated ones thoughts I agree that a restatement or reiteration of the reasons given is necessary, if simply to indicate that you understood what that person was saying (which probably applies to the nominator also... hmmmm!).<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 23:45, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed in general, but sometimes an ed. does present so clear a case that there isn't much more to say.

<p><b>Disagree</b>. Sometimes one doesn't have much to add to a discussion that has not already been written. So, what to do in that case? One can not participate, but participation is a form of showing consensus/support for one action or another. Or, one can participate and write the same argument that has been stated multiple times above <i>once again</i>. This unnecessarily clutters the discussion. I generally dislike "per nom" arguments at the start of an AFD (when few arguments have been made), but someone adding to an AFD that is already 30KB long and has comments from 50 users doesn't need a repeat of arguments that were previously made. A "per XYZ" often suffices. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>In an ideal Wikipedia, "per nom" would be a bad argument, because consensus would be evaluated on merit, not on number of people who agree. In our imperfect Wikipedia with imperfect contributors, merit <i>can't</i> be the only measure of whether or not an article should be deleted. So if one person sums up all reasons to delete, and 10 different people come up with 10 bad reasons to keep, then the assumption is that nobody agrees with deletion, so it shouldn't happen. "Per nom" is sometimes necessary. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 02:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The Bad Thing here is not the "per nom" per se, but rather large numbers thereof. I'm sure that it is explicitly mentioned somewhere that a head-count is <i>not</i> a part of judging consensus. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 03:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also worth noting that some admins will still relist an AfD if it doesn't get 'enough' opinions, and I've seen deletion review relist AfDs at least partially due to low participation. While there is supposed to be no quorum, and IMO, if the issue is notability/sourcing and the article clearly has no reliable sources with the subject as its primary focus, it should be enough that the nominator points this out and the five day grace period has elapsed for people to find sources, in reality it makes things a lot clearer if two or three people have reviewed the nomination and shown that they agree with it. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the arguments do apply to the other debates, e.g. the guidelines about pure votes, ILIKEIT posts and 'per nom' posts. Although the focus is on AfDs, that's inevitable, because articles are what we're here for, and AfD is by far the largest deletion page, with over 100 pages a day - TfD averages about 5-10, MfD 1-2. For that reason I think the examples given should focus on articles, because that's what most people will be interested in. We could add a "Keep, this is a great template" example to the ILIKEIT section, but it wouldn't add anything - it's already obvious to anyone how it applies to the other XfDs. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>There is no discussion of the types of arguments to avoid in discussing the deletion of user pages, project pages, or portals (at MfD, which <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Archived_debates_March_2007_41bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Archived debates/March 2007">looks like it averages more than 1–2</a>).</li>
<li>There aren't any arguments to avoid when discussing categories, redirects or images, which are part of the content just like articles.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Frankly, the best thing is to probably just remove the other XfD discussions from the top of the article because the essay has very little relevance to them. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 00:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Delete as unencyclopedic" isn't short for "Delete because I think it ought to be deleted". It's short for "Delete for any number of reasons listed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a> which I have not bothered to specify". In other words, it's too vague. I think the essay should simply indicate that it is too vague rather than attempting to interpret what Cyclops' statement is shorthand for. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunctured_Bicycle_2aca.html" title="User:Punctured Bicycle">Punctured Bicycle</a> 02:14, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
