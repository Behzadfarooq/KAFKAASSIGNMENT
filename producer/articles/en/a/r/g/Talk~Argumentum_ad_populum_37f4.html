<p>This section is presumptive and illogical. Appeal to Popularity is always a fallacy. Democracy does not obviate this, it merely makes the fallacy irrelevant by defining law as judgmental rather than objective. The vast majority may enact law that must be followed, but the vast majority may be wrong. This applies to all scales of democracy. A politicized 5-4 decision from the Supreme Court can be as wrong as an 80% result in a referendum. There are however theories on how democracies can remain stable even though their basis for imposition of policy is a fallacy. See <a href="../../../a/p/p/Approval_Voting_2b49.html" title="Approval Voting">Approval Voting</a>. I'll probably edit this article to make more sense sometime soon, if nobody else takes care of it. 24.221.121.232 04:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've changed the lead and the Exceptions section. I have barely looked at the sections in the middle. They may need to be updated to be consistent with the sections I've changed (and then the sections I've changed may need some adjustment to remain consistent with the entire article). The crank has been turned. More later. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.237.179.238.html" title="User:216.237.179.238">216.237.179.238</a> 19:38, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>i like the way this page is turning out. i took out the bit on nazi germany and replaced it with a link, i hope you dont mind. also the part that i wrote on the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_large_numbers.html" title="Law of large numbers">law of large numbers</a> may be stretching that idea a bit too far. Lastly, does anyone know if its possible to get the 'contents' window to align beside the alias list? <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencerk_f3c4.html" title="User:Spencerk">Spencerk</a> 04:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did more cleanup. I moved the aliases to their own section to get the Contents up closer to where it should be. The lead may be thin, but it's apt, so I'll leave it as-is. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.237.179.238.html" title="User:216.237.179.238">216.237.179.238</a> 23:26, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Inductive reasoning paragraph appears irrelevant to this article. If it was trying to make a connection between argumentum ad numerum and ad populum, I failed to see it. Also this last sentence lost me completly: <i>Although Argumentum ad populum makes few concessions about the relationship between truth and widespread acceptence, according to the Law of large numbers, as the sample population gets bigger, truth becomes more likely.</i> It needs a cite. What concessions does it make? Is the truth mentioned that of the belief being measured? If not the sentence make no sense to me. -213.219.186.69 15:46, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree with this example:</p>
<p>"Safety</p>
<p>Whether to follow a tenet decided by popularity rather than logical design may be a matter of safety or convenience:</p>
<pre>
   * "Nearly all Americans think that you should drive on the right side of the road. Therefore, you should drive on the right side of the road in the United States."
</pre>
<p>"</p>
<p>It is not the case that you should drive on the right side of the road in America "because most Americans think you should", you should drive on the right side of the road in America because not doing so is likely to result in your death or serious bodily harm. These are two very different arguments. 88.105.250.223 19:16, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Is it an example of this fallacy to cite popularity of an opinion amongst a group if that group is arguably qualified to have unbiased opinions on the subject? I'm uncomfortable with calling it a fallacy to say "Evolution is probably true because most scientists agree that it is". Opinions? 129.31.77.89 23:30, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"However, due to the nature of probability, even statistics may accidentally measure a rare outcome rather than the norm, and unconditional reliance on statistics is therefore fallacious."</p>

<dd>This doesn't really belong here. Moreover, it's a vague, spurious charge which can be levelled against any kind of indutive reasoning. If the above statement is taken, then almost all science can be disregarded, because it relies on inductive reasoning and statistics. The reasons why an "unconditional reliance on statistics" might be fallacious have to do with inappropriate use of statistical methods or incompetent use, not statistics itself. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 22:47, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It may be out of place, but is is undeniably correct. It does not say that science can be disregarded; only that one should not rely unconditionally on science.--<a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoe_b8ad.html" title="User:Noe">Niels Ø</a> 23:41, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How is it correct?? It does NOT say that "one should not rely unconditionally on science". It says that conclusions reached via statistical methods should be suspect because of some vague spurious claims about the nature of probability. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 10:49, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well one should not unconditionally trust science. Science has proved its own theories wrong many times in the past. Theoretically science may some day have find the truth and all research, but I really doubt. Since science is still imperfect it only makes sense not to trust it <i>completely</i> -- im3w1l</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Did you read what I said?? This charge can be levelled against ANY TYPE OF INDUCTIVE REASONING. It is not a general disclaimer on over-reliance on science, taking it at face value would mean throwing away almost ALL of science. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 10:51, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, fine. I just find it strange (or perhaps, after the laughingstocks of the AIDS articles, predictable) that such nonsense finds its way into articles here. The whole POINT of statistics is to provide a mathematical way to deal with "rare outcomes", or to make inferences based on incomplete knowledge. You might as well say, "Math is fallacious because it's based on proof". <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 03:11, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The last example suggests that the pro-slavery lobby might have used the argument from majority, but this is 'disproven' by... "<i>yet few Americans today would consider it ethical</i>". Surely that's a pure <i>Argumentum ad populum</i> committed by Wikipedia in it's own <i>Argumentum ad populum</i> definition. The reasoning in all these examples looks a little weak to me, they mostly reject the majority of public opinion for the majority of 'expert' opinion. Specific 'good' reasons aren't given in any of these arguments, we are simply reporting the bias of a sample survey.</p>
