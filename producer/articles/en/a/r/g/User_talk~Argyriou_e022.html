<p>HEY THERE Argyriou; TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DONT REALLY KNOW THE ECONOMICS OF EL DORADO, BUT I'M UNDERSTOOD, THAT RENOVATION IS TAKING PLACE, WHICH FORCE AIRLINES TO PAY MORE TAXES. THE REASON IS, THAT EL DORADO INTERNATIONAL IS PLANNING TO HAVE A BEUTIFUL AIRPORT, THAT WILL SERVE PASSANGERS THAT VISIT COLOMBIA BETTER, WHICH HELPS WITH THE ECONOMICS OF COLOMBIA, AVIANCA IS ALSO PLANNING TO MOVE ITS HUB FROM "EL DORADO" TO A DIFFERENT AIRPORT IN COLOMBIA, DUE TO THE HIGH TAXES.</p>
<p>YOU COULD FIND MORE INFO ON WWW.AIRLINNERS.NET, JUST GO TO THE FORUM AND TYPE AVIANCA, EL DORADO, ETC, YOU COULD FIND MORE INFO THERE, THEY GIVE YOU LINKS TO COLOMBIAN ECONOMICS REGARDING AVIANCA, AND THE AIRPORT FACTS..</p>
<p>I hope this will help! <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColBog_2830.html" title="User:ColBog">ColBog</a></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Could you explain where you discovered the term "Global Tick" in reference to astronomy and cosmology?

<dd><i>Someone else added "Global tick" to the geology section of the requested articles; I guessed that it might be astronomical, based purely on intuitive evidence. Maybe it really is a computer thing, instead. Or a spherical arthropod.</i></dd>

<p>Hello Argyriou,</p>
<p>If you read the: "Authenticity" Authentic flamingos always have Don Featherstone’s signature under their tails. Each has a yellow beak with a black tip and they are only sold in pairs", The picture you have shown are cheap imitation’s that look more like snakes with tail feathers. I beg you to get a picture of a group of real Don Featherstone pink flamingos, as he is now 70 years old, and my dad. The original Pink Plastic Lawn Flamingo will turn 50 this coming year, and it would be a real tribute to my father to have a real picture of his art next to it’s description. If you would like help with this, I would be more than happy to do anything I can to help make this happen.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Just some background; I have been fixing the diocese in Ireland because they're a bit of a mess. There are links back and forth between Anglican (Church of Ireland) and Catholic dioceses in various articles--it causes confusions. I am well on the way to sorting that out.</p>
<p>Now, with regard to adding a country tag to the name, I can see a reason why that would not be needed. In Catholicism at least, the Vatican won't erect a new diocese with an existing name. Where I have seen ambiguity is where the reformation resulted in co-territorial dioceses with identical names. I see the issue as falling along denominational and not geograhic lines. I have started to added the denomination to all clergy and related items--though I only started Wikipediaing three days ago, so I just figured out how to do it. I have to go back and redo some of the pages I wrote up recently.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>

<dd>You're welcome. You're right that in ordinariy usage, the country of the diocese need not be listed; however, it is a convenience to people who see a diocese name without knowing which country it is in (and the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking countries have this problem in a huge way), and it's also convenient if it's ever desired to re-organize the list on a per-country basis. I'm willing to do the grunt-work of finding the country for those where it's not listed, but it makes life easier if people adding new dioceses to the listings include the country. Somewhere down the road, that's going to cause a mess when the Northern Irish nationalists discover that the Church considers Belfast to be Ireland. Until then, I'd like to see countries listed. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 16:33, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the article, I guess, it could be merged with the Reena Virk article. I understand it didn't make much news in the United States, but it was big news in Canada. I live in Canada and the same province where this murder was high-profiled. I don't know what more can be added to the article, because a lot is not known about Kelly Ellard's personal life. The most we know about her is that she had a lot of behavior problems in school. She's got one older brother and her family stands by their belief she is innocent. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 06:49, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that the murder-of-the-week rates a Wikipedia article, even if it did make a big news splash. Terrance Kelly made a big splash in the Bay Area when he was killed recently, but ultimately, it's just another murder. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dellums_4840.html" title="Michael Dellums">Michael Dellums</a> rates an article <i>only</i> because he's the son of a Congressman and because someone wanted to score political points in the article about his father. (If it gets prod'ed, I doubt anyone would care anymore.) If, on the other hand, the Government (provincial or national) passed some special law or spent lots of money as a result of the murder, then at the very least the case would deserve one article. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 06:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's the only co-op in the USCA with a redlink. I started a stub for it (albeit an extremely lame one, even for a stub) and it was speedied. I didn't notice there was a previous AfD (see below, last link). The arguments seemed to be that there was no info other than USCA for it--here are two more news refs. It's weird, because some other, newer, smaller, less noteworthy co-ops have articles which only cite the USCA. I don't get what the deal is with no Loth article. (Funnily enough, there is no love lost between me and Loth--I lived there for a semester to chill/escape from B-town, but since I was from B-town the elves thought I was danger incarnate or something. They wrote graffiti about me, the only Loth graffitit I ever saw: "sure, &lt;blank&gt; is exciting, but so is Beirut." I guess I moved in too soon after a bunch of Barringtonians put turkey carcasses in their outdoor hot tub...) Do you want to restart the Loth article?

But I don't think it makes sense that Loth is the only co-op without an article, since it's one of the oldest and largest. (And is is the only vegetarian student co-op in the country? certainly the oldest--1975. It might even qualify for the shortlist in a merge of smaller, newer houses into USCA...?)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 03:42, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Also: Lothlorien was designed by architect Clinton Day, who designed other buildings on campus, and in SF. The best part is that the building was leased by some freaky cult called the One World Family--which believed that UFOS were going to bring "a better life on earth"--from 1968 until 1975, when the USCA bought the building(s). (!) The cult built Lothlorien's sauna, and then absconded to Hawaii, leaving, er, cult-stuff in the attic and closets. At least according to this:<a href="http://lothlorienhouse.org/blog/lothlorien-history/" class="external autonumber" title="http://lothlorienhouse.org/blog/lothlorien-history/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Maybe George-O has harder data/more info.

<dd>I'm not sure what you see as "rudeness".

<dd>I'm seriously skeptical of any numbers related to "gated communities", because the numbers I see thrown around don't make sense unless condo complexes are included, and most condo complexes of which I am aware are gated, but not guarded, even in new complexes in areas in and around Oakland (CA). Even some of the more posh housing developments around here only have a single guard to check in and out delivery people, contractors, etc., while the residents all have automatic gate openers in their SUVs, and their kids have keys, if there even is a locked pedestrian gate. So unless someone's willing to provide a citation that any significant portion of "gated communities" have live security, the "most" will have to go. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 02:34, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, that wasn't one of the more "far-reaching" claims made in the article, even if it is directly contradicted later in the article. Things like <i>Especially in China, the trend towards gated communities is accelerating, in response to changing laws and economics.</i>, the whole discussion about Brazil, particularly <i>Some even have schools for the children so that they will only need to leave the community after the first five years of elementary school.</i>, the really outlandish claim that in China, <i>all new residential developments are required to be gated.</i>, and the discussion about bans on gated communities in Canada are all pretty far-reaching things to say without any citations. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 02:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was sort of what I was getting at when I said that Bronze Star may meet notability. In some campaigns and wars, certain medals get passed out to lots of people, while they're rare in other wars. Too many people get Purple Hearts for that to define notability, but so few people get Medals of Honor that pretty much any recipient should have a Wikipedia article. Bronze Star has probably fluctuated near both extremes, and I don't follow that, so I don't know what it means in the Iraq campaign. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></span> 01:48, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just feel it works decent enough, compares favorably as a means to access imformation e g on wikipedia.That's all. The choice of browser does effect reading experience, access-behavior, and possibly "end information productivity" for the individual accessing such an information source/service. The effectiveness or quality reflects back upon the work you do in managing and presenting Wikipedia resources.</p>
<p>In a functioning "library" and encyclopedia-type setting , one could argue for allowing even a few less notable browsers appear listed; if some "less notable" ones do it better than some of the othere, let them stay on. Let there be fair information, (If all the other browsers already worked just as good then there would of course be less need for such information.)</p>

<dd>The AM Browser may be a notable enough browser for inclusion into Wikipedia, but the AM Browser article gives no evidence of that. One of the core principles of Wikipedia is that articles are based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and the article presents none. If there are articles in the trade press which discuss AM Browser (and are not just rehashes of press releases), they need to be referenced in the article, and quickly. If nobody in the industry press has bothered to do a review of AM Browser, that is pretty clear evidence that it is not anything notable. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></span> 14:56, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again. I'm sorry I haven't been able to reply to your request to have a look at the Groundwater talk page, as I don't know that there's anything worthwhile I can contribute. If you could be more specific about what you'd like me to do, I'd find it easier to comply, I think.</p>
<p>I want to do more editing under the Geotechnical Engineering label, and I feel I should have my name on the list of contributors so that others know that I'm there and what I'm doing. I can't see how to do that, though. Can you help me, please?</p>
<p>I would like to change the term 'pressure' to 'stress' wherever it's used in reference to lateral earth stresses and retaining structures. I feel that it helps keep clarity in thinking if pressure is used only for fluids and stress for solid materials.</p>
<p>I don't even know whether this is the correct way to contact you. I seem to remember that I got an ordinary email from you when you first contacted me - maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, all help gratefully received. I'm going to edit the lateral earth stress/retaining wall pages, and hope I don't tread on anyone's toes.</p>
<p>Cheers. Don Jordan.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The groundwater article, in the section "Subsidence" (under "Problems"), states that subsidence is caused by consolidation of the <b>aquitard</b>, not the aquifer. This does not make much sense to me, as many aquifers are materials which will consolidate, and the magnitudes of subsidence don't seem to match in scale the amounts of consolidation one might find in the aquitard. But I could be wrong, and I have not followed the literature on that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that labelling all soil stresses as "stress" instead of "pressure" is the best way to go - most of the time it's correct, but, for example, "lateral earth <b>pressure</b>" is much more common than "lateral earth <b>stress</b>".</dd>

<p>I recently noticed that you redirected my definition of Geotechnics to Geotechnical Engineering. Geotechnics is not another definition of Geotechnical Engineering. Geotechnics is a stand-alone practice. Both Geotechnical Engineers and Engineering Geologists practice Geotechnics. I am an Engineering Geologist, and I, along with all other Engineering Geologists practice geotechnics. In fact, the term of Geotechnics, as well as the term of Geotechnical, were coined by engineering geologists. I respectfully ask that you return the deffinition of Geotechnics back to how I created it.</p>
<p>-Geohumphrey</p>
<p>P.S. It would have been nice for you to have contact me before making such a major change. It's one thing to change wording a bit, but to delete the definition all together is a bit much to not have input from the posts creater.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geotechnics.html" title="Geotechnics">geotechnics</a>, as it existed before I made it a redirect, really was just a definition of geotechnical engineering. If you care to create an article that is more than a definition of geotechnical engineering, which includes a discussion of the differences between <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering_geology.html" title="Engineering geology">engineering geology</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geotechnical_engineering.html" title="Geotechnical engineering">geotechnical engineering</a>, feel free to do so. (<i>In addition, the fields of geotechnical engineering and <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering_geology.html" title="Engineering geology">engineering geology</a> are similar. However, the field of geotechnical engineering is a specialty of <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, where the field of <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering_geology.html" title="Engineering geology">engineering geology</a> is a specialty of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geology.html" title="Geology">geology</a></i> is not a discussion of the differences, just a not-very-informative statement of them.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Almost every hit on Google for "geotechnics" is either a company name, a journal name, or a direct reference to geotechnical engineering (often to just a subset), which leads me to believe that it's an attempt at a noun counterpart for "geotechnical", for times when "geotechnical engineering" is too long. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></span> 15:45, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term Geotechnics existed before the term Geotechnical Engineering. It is true that geotechnics and geotechnical engineering have similar definitions. However, engineers have chosen to use the term Geotechnical Engineering instead of Geotechnics to describe their field. Engineering Geologist have always used the term geotechnics to describe the geotechnical aspect of their field. By redirecting the definition of geotechnics to geotechnical engineering, you have essentially said that geotechnics is not part of engineering geology, since in most States, geologists can not practice engineering without being a PE. However geotechnics is considered part of the practice of engineering geology in those States that regulate engineering geologists. The term geotechnics was coined by geologists, and we use the term more often than engineers do. If you want to redirect the definition anywhere you should redirect it to Engineering Geology. Essentially, Geotechnics is a Geology word, and for you to assume otherwise implies some lack of knowlege on your part of the history of the term. The term Geotechnics is a stand-along term in most geology and geotechnical engineering glossaries, and should be a stand-along term here on Wikipedia. I have reinstated Geotechnics as a stand-along definition, and would appreciate it if you do not redirect it again. My definition is accurate, with adequate references, and I have provided links to both Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology if the reader would like additional information. Wikipedia is about providing information, not limiting it. I believe that you have abused your authority as an editer by essentially deleting a well established definitions. If you don't like my definition, you may edited it as you wish, provided that you have adequate references to back up your changes.</p>

<p>Regarding the previous string of comments on Viadeo:</p>
<p>The article on Workspace Group was an intranet intended for Workspace Group clients. I had no idea that this was referenced on the public internet until the assertion of a copyright violation on Wikipedia. I will add my name to this article.</p>
<p>We have recently had a series of press articles in the UK of late - blogs such as the Guardian. Press articles in themselves do not prove we haev one million members across Europe - the only way I can prove this is to show you confidential info on our membership database which obviously I can't do.</p>
<p>I will try once more to re-write the article in an even more bland format. I would not mind adverse comments on the page but merely pulling it off the site four times is really very annoying!</p>
