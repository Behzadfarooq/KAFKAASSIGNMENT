<p>The <b>Argentine economic crisis</b> was part of the situation that affected <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>'s <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">economy</a> during the late 1990s and early 2000s. <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macroeconomics.html" title="Macroeconomics">Macroeconomically</a> speaking, the critical period started with the decrease of real <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_Domestic_Product_fa2b.html" title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</a> in 1999 and ended in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_in_Argentina_a683.html" title="2002 in Argentina">2002</a> with the return to GDP growth, but the origins of the collapse of Argentina's economy, and their effects on the population, can be found in action before.

<p>Argentina was subject to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_dictatorship.html" title="Military dictatorship">military dictatorship</a> (alternating with weak, short-lived <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic.html" title="Democratic">democratic</a> governments) for many years. Huge debt was acquired for money that was later lost in different unfinished projects, the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falkland/Malvinas Islands War</a>, and the state's takeover of private debts.</p>
<p>In 1983, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> in the country was restored with the election of president <a href="../../../r/a/%C3%BA/Ra%C3%BAl_Alfons%C3%ADn_fdab.html" title="Raúl Alfonsín">Raúl Alfonsín</a>. The new government's plans included stabilizing <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">Argentina's economy</a> including the creation of a new currency (the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_austral.html" title="Argentine austral">Austral</a>, first of its kind not to carry the word <i>peso</i> as part of its name), for which new loans were required. The state eventually became unable to pay the interest of this debt, the economy collapsed and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a> began increasing. In 1989, Argentina's inflation reached 200% per month, topping 3,000% annually. President Alfonsín resigned six months before ending his term, and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Menem_3bee.html" title="Carlos Menem">Carlos Menem</a> took office.</p>
<p>Menem, who had campaigned on a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populism.html" title="Populism">populist</a> platform, immediately went back on his promises and began a plan, aligned on the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoliberal.html" title="Neoliberal">neoliberal</a> <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_consensus.html" title="Washington consensus">Washington consensus</a>, of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_liberalisation.html" title="Trade liberalisation">trade liberalisation</a>, labor <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deregulation.html" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privatisation.html" title="Privatisation">privatisation</a> of state companies which were the source of much spending (such as those providing the telephone, energy and water services).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_economic_crisis_%281999-2002%29.html" title="Edit section: The 1990s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1990s</span></h2>
<p>The fight against inflation did not go well. In early 1991, under the rule of Minister of Economy <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domingo_Cavallo_f6ad.html" title="Domingo Cavallo">Domingo Cavallo</a>, executive measures fixed the value of Argentine currency at 10,000 australes per U.S. dollar. Furthermore, any citizen could go to a bank and ask for any amount of cash in domestic currency to be converted to the corresponding amount of dollars; in order to secure this "convertibility", the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banco_Central_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica_Argentina_a583.html" title="Banco Central de la República Argentina">central bank</a> was bound to keep its <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">dollar</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_exchange_reserves.html" title="Foreign exchange reserves">reserves</a> at the same level as the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetary_base.html" title="Monetary base">cash in circulation</a>. The initial aim of such measures was to ensure the acceptance of domestic currency, since during <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperinflation.html" title="Hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> peaks, people had started to reject it as payment, demanding U.S. dollars instead. This regime was later fixated by a law (<i>Ley de Convertibilidad</i>) which restored the <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peso.html" title="Peso">peso</a> as the Argentine currency, with a monetary value <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed_exchange_rate.html" title="Fixed exchange rate">fixed</a> by law to the value of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">United States dollar</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of the convertibility law, inflation dropped sharply, price stability was assured, and the value of the currency was preserved. This raised the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quality_of_life.html" title="Quality of life">quality of life</a> for many citizens, who could now afford to travel abroad, buy imported domestic appliances and electronic products or ask for credits in dollars at very low <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interest.html" title="Interest">interest</a> rates.</p>
<p>But Argentina had international <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_debt.html" title="Public debt">debts</a> to pay, and it needed to keep borrowing money. The fixed exchange rate made imports cheap, producing a constant flight of dollars away from the country and a progressive loss of Argentina's <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry.html" title="Industry">industrial infrastructure</a>, which led to an increase in <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, government spending continued to be high and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_corruption.html" title="Political corruption">corruption</a> was rampant. Argentina's public debt grew enormously during the 1990s, and the country showed no true signs of being able to pay it. The IMF, however, kept lending money to Argentina and postponing its payment schedules. Massive <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_evasion.html" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_laundering.html" title="Money laundering">money laundering</a> explained a large part of the evaporation of funds toward <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offshore_banks.html" title="Offshore banks">offshore banks</a>. A congressional committee started investigations in 2001 about accusations that <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banco_Central_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica_Argentina_a583.html" title="Banco Central de la República Argentina">Argentina's central bank</a> governor, Pedro Pou, as well as part of the board of directors, had failed to investigate cases of alleged money laundering through Argentina's financial system <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Pou"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/g/Argentine_economic_crisis_%281999-2002%29.html#endnote_Pou" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/g/Argentine_economic_crisis_%281999-2002%29.html#endnote_Pou" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span>. <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clearstream.html" title="Clearstream">Clearstream</a> was also accused of being instrumental in this global financial process.</p>
<p>Other countries, such as <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> (both of which also happen to be important trade partners for Argentina) faced economic crises of their own, leading other countries to mistrust <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> countries moneywise, and affecting the overall economy of the region. The influx of foreign currency provided by the privatisation of state companies had dried out, and after 1997 Argentine exports were harmed by the devaluation of the Brazilian real and a considerable international revaluation of the dollar, effectively revaluing the peso against its major trading partners, Brazil (30% of total trade flows) and the euro area (23% of total trade flows).</p>
<p>By 1999, newly elected President <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_de_la_R%C3%BAa_b5b2.html" title="Fernando de la Rúa">Fernando de la Rúa</a> faced a country where unemployment had risen to a critical point, and the undesirable effects of the fixed exchange rate were showing forcefully. In 1999 Argentina's GDP dropped 4% and the country entered a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recession.html" title="Recession">recession</a> (which was to last three years, ending in a collapse). Stability became stagnation (even <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflation.html" title="Deflation">deflation</a> at times), and the economic measures taken did nothing to avert it; in fact, the government continued the contractive economic policies of its predecessor. The possible solution (abandonment of the exchange peg, with a voluntary <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devaluation.html" title="Devaluation">devaluation</a> of the peso) was considered a political suicide and a recipe for economic disaster. By the end of the century, a spectrum of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementary_currency.html" title="Complementary currency">complementary currencies</a> had emerged.</p>
<p>While the provinces had always issued <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementary_currency.html" title="Complementary currency">complementary currency</a> in the form of <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bond_%28finance%29.html" title="Bond (finance)">bonds</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Check_%28finance%29.html" title="Check (finance)">drafts</a> to brave shortages of cash, the maintenance of the convertibility regime led to this being done in an unprecedented scale, leading to their being called "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementary_currency.html" title="Complementary currency">quasi-currencies</a>", the strongest of them being Buenos Aires province's <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patac%C3%B3n_%28bond%29.html" title="Patacón (bond)">Patacón</a>. The national state also issued its own <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementary_currency.html" title="Complementary currency">quasi-currency</a>-the <a href="../../../l/e/c/LECOP_3c8b.html" title="LECOP">LECOP</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_economic_crisis_%281999-2002%29.html" title="Edit section: The crisis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The crisis</span></h2>
<p>Argentina quickly lost the confidence of investors and the flight of money away from the country increased. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_Argentina_e437.html" title="2001 in Argentina">2001</a>, people fearing the worst began withdrawing large sums of money from their <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_account.html" title="Bank account">bank accounts</a>, turning pesos into dollars and sending them abroad, causing a <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_run.html" title="Bank run">run on the banks</a>. The government then enacted a set of measures (informally known as the <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Corralito.html" title="Corralito">corralito</a></i>) that effectively froze all bank accounts for twelve months, allowing for only minor sums of cash to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Because of this allowance limit and the serious problems it caused in certain cases, many Argentines became enraged and took to the streets of important cities, especially <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. They engaged in a form of popular <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest.html" title="Protest">protest</a> that became known as <i><a href="../../../c/a/c/Cacerolazo.html" title="Cacerolazo">cacerolazo</a></i> (banging pots and pans). These protests occurred especially during the period of 2001 to 2002. At first the <i>cacerolazos</i> were simply noisy <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration_%28people%29.html" title="Demonstration (people)">demonstrations</a>, but soon they included property destruction, often directed at banks, foreign privatized companies, and especially big American companies. Many businesses installed metal barriers because windows and glass facades were being broken, and even fires being ignited at their doors. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_%28advertising%29.html" title="Billboard (advertising)">Billboards</a> of such companies as <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca_Cola_060a.html" title="Coca Cola">Coca Cola</a> and others were brought down by the masses of demonstrators.</p>
<p>Confrontations between the police and citizens became a common sight, and <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fires</a> were also set on Buenos Aires avenues. Fernando de la Rúa declared a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_emergency.html" title="State of emergency">state of emergency</a> (illegally since it needed confirmation by the Congress) but this only worsened the situation, precipitating the violent <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2001_riots_%28Argentina%29_ec21.html" title="December 2001 riots (Argentina)">protests of 20 and 21 December 2001</a> in <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaza_de_Mayo_16a5.html" title="Plaza de Mayo">Plaza de Mayo</a>, where demonstrators clashed with the police, ended with several dead, and precipitated the fall of the government. De la Rúa eventually fled the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casa_Rosada_d642.html" title="Casa Rosada">Casa Rosada</a> in a helicopter on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">21 December</a>.</p>
<p>Since De la Rúa's vicepresident <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_%C3%81lvarez_d774.html" title="Carlos Álvarez">Carlos Álvarez</a> had resigned in October 2000, a political crisis ensued. Following presidential succession procedures established in the Constitution, the president of the Senate <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram%C3%B3n_Puerta_b9ad.html" title="Ramón Puerta">Ramón Puerta</a> took office but quickly resigned, followed by the president of the Chamber of Deputies, <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduardo_Cama%C3%B1o_40ef.html" title="Eduardo Camaño">Eduardo Camaño</a>. The <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_6fbc.html" title="Legislative Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> (a body formed by merging both chambers of the Congress) convened with the goal of creating a more legitimate interim government. By law, the candidates were its own members plus the Governors of the Provinces -they finally appointed <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolfo_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Sa%C3%A1_bbcd.html" title="Adolfo Rodríguez Saá">Adolfo Rodríguez Saá</a>, then governor of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Luis_7041.html" title="San Luis">San Luis</a>. During the last week of 2001, the interim government led by <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolfo_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Sa%C3%A1_bbcd.html" title="Adolfo Rodríguez Saá">Adolfo Rodríguez Saá</a>, facing the impossibility of meeting debt payments, <a href="../../../d/e/f/Default_%28finance%29.html" title="Default (finance)">defaulted</a> on the larger part of the public debt, totalling no less than 93,000 million dollars.</p>
<p>Politically, the most heated debate involved the time for the following elections -the spectrum ranged from March 2002 to October 2003 (the original date for the ending of De la Rúa's office).</p>
<p>Rodríguez Saá's economy team came up with a project designed to preserve the convertibility regime, dubbed the "Third Currency" Plan. It consisted of creating a new, non-convertible currency called <i>Argentino</i> coexisting with convertible pesos and U.S. dollars. It would only circulate as cash (checks, promisory notes or other instruments could be nominated in pesos or dollars but not in Argentinos) and would be partially guaranteed with federally-managed land -such features were expected to counterbalance inflationary tendencies.</p>
<p>Argentinos having legal currency status would be used to redeem all <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementary_currency.html" title="Complementary currency">complementary currency</a> already in circulation -the acceptance of which as a means of payment was quite uneven. It was hoped that preservation of convertibility would restore public confidence, while the non-convertible nature of this currency would allow for a measure of fiscal flexibility (unthinkable with pesos) that could ameliorate the crippling recession of economy. Critics called this plan merely a "controlled devaluation"; its advocates countered that since controlling a devaluation is perhaps its thorniest issue, this criticism was a praise in disguise. The "Third Currency" plan had enthusiastic supporters among mainstream economists (the most notorious being perhaps Martín Redrado, current president of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banco_Central_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica_Argentina_a583.html" title="Banco Central de la República Argentina">central bank</a>) citing sound technical arguments. However, it could never be implemented because the Rodríguez Saá government lacked the political support required.</p>
<p>Rodríguez Saá, utterly incapable to deal with the crisis and unsupported by <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justicialist_Party_121b.html" title="Justicialist Party">his own party</a>, resigned before the end of the year. The Legislative Assembly convened again, appointing Peronist <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduardo_Duhalde_55b8.html" title="Eduardo Duhalde">Eduardo Duhalde</a>-then a Senator for the Buenos Aires province-to take his place.</p>

Monthtly inflation in Argentina, 2002 (the peak is 10.4%, in April).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After much deliberation, Duhalde abandoned in January 2002 the fixed 1-to-1 peso-dollar parity that had been in place for ten years. In a matter of days, the peso lost a large part of its value in the unregulated market. A provisional "official" exchange rate was set at 1.4 pesos per dollar.</p>
<p>In addition to the <i>corralito</i>, the Ministry of Economy dictated the <i>pesificación</i> ("peso-ification"), by which all bank accounts denominated in dollars would be converted to pesos at official rate. This measure angered most savings holders and appeals were made by many citizens to declare it unconstitutional.</p>
<p>After a few months, the exchange rate was left to float more or less freely. The peso suffered a huge devaluation, which in turn prompted inflation (since Argentina depended heavily on imports, and had no means to replace them locally at the time).</p>
<p>The economic situation became steadily worse with regards to inflation and unemployment during 2002. By that time the original 1-to-1 rate had skyrocketed to nearly 4 pesos per dollar, while the accumulated inflation since the devaluation was about 80%. (It should be noted that these figures were considerably lower than those foretold by most orthodox economists at the time.) The quality of life of the average Argentinian was lowered proportionally; many businesses closed or went bankrupt, many imported products became virtually inaccessible, and salaries were left as they were before the crisis.</p>
<p>Since the volume of pesos didn't fit the demand for cash (not even after the devaluation) huge quantities of a wide spectrum of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementary_currency.html" title="Complementary currency">complementary currency</a> kept circulating alongside them. Fears of hyperinflation as a consequence of devaluation quickly eroded the attractiveness of their associated revenue, originally stated in convertible pesos. Their acceptability now ultimately depended on the State's willingness to take them as payment of taxes and other charges, consequently becoming very irregular. Very often they were taken at less than their nominal value -while the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patac%C3%B3n.html" title="Patacón">Patacón</a> was frequently accepted at the same value as peso, <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entre_R%C3%ADos_1bbd.html" title="Entre Ríos">Entre Ríos</a>'s <i>Federal</i> was among the worst-faring, at an average 30% as the provincial government that had issued them was reluctant to take them back. There were also frequent rumors that the Government would simply banish <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementary_currency.html" title="Complementary currency">complementary currency</a> overnight (instead of redeeming them, even at disadvantageous rates), leaving their holders with useless printed paper.</p>

<p>Many private companies were affected by the crisis: <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerol%C3%ADneas_Argentinas_8561.html" title="Aerolíneas Argentinas">Aerolíneas Argentinas</a>, for example, was one of the most affected Argentine companies, having to stop all international flights for various days in 2002. The airline came close to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>, but survived.</p>
<p>Most barter networks, viable as devices to ameliorate the shortage of cash during the recession, collapsed as large numbers of people turned to them, desperate to save as many pesos as they could for exchange for hard currency as a paliative for uncertainty.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> was also affected: Argentine products were rejected in some international markets, in fear that they might come damaged because of the poor conditions in which they grew, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture_db31.html" title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</a> put restrictions on Argentine food and drugs arriving at the United States.</p>
<p>Producers of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_channel.html" title="Television channel">television channels</a> were forced to produce more <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_show.html" title="Reality show">reality shows</a> than any other type of shows, because these were generally cheap to produce as compared to other programmes.

Evolution of the Argentine GNP, 1999–2004</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The economic outlook was completely different from that of the 1990s; the high exchange rate made Argentine exports cheap and competitive abroad, while discouraging imports. In addition, the high price of <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soybean.html" title="Soybean">soy</a> in the international market produced an injection of massive amounts of foreign currency (with <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> becoming a major buyer of Argentina's soy products).</p>
<p>The government encouraged <a href="../../../i/m/p/Import_substitution.html" title="Import substitution">import substitution</a> and accessible credit for businesses, staged an aggressive plan to improve <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a> collection, and set aside large amounts of money for <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_welfare.html" title="Social welfare">social welfare</a>, while controlling expenditure in other fields.</p>
<p>As a result of the administration's productive model and controlling measures (selling reserve dollars in the public market), the peso slowly revalued, reaching a 3-to-1 rate to the dollar. Agricultural exports grew and <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism.html" title="Tourism">tourism</a> returned.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

Foreign currency reserves of Argentina's central bank, in millions of USD</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The huge <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_surplus.html" title="Trade surplus">trade surplus</a> ultimately caused such an inflow of dollars that the government was forced to begin intervening in order to keep the peso from revaluing further, which would have ruined the tax collection scheme (largely based on imports taxes and royalties) and discourage further reindustrialisation. The central bank started buying dollars in the local market and stocking them as reserves. By December 2005, foreign currency reserves had reached $28,000 million (they were greatly reduced by the anticipated payment of the full debt to the IMF in January 2006). The downside of this reserve accumulation strategy is that the dollars have to be bought with freshly-emitted pesos, which may induce inflation. The central bank neutralises a part of this monetary emission by selling <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasury.html" title="Treasury">Treasury</a> letters. In this way the exchange rate has been stabilised near a reference value of 3 pesos to the dollar.</p>
<p>The currency exchange issue is complicated by two mutually opposing factors: a sharp increase in imports since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_Argentina_733e.html" title="2004 in Argentina">2004</a> (which raises the demand of dollars), and the return of foreign investment (which brings fresh currency from abroad) after the successful restructuring of about three quarters of the external debt. The government has set up controls and restrictions aimed at keeping short-term speculative investment from destabilising the financial market.</p>
<p>Argentina's recovery suffered a minor drawback in 2004 when rising industrial demand caused a short-lived <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_energy_crisis_%282004%29.html" title="Argentine energy crisis (2004)">energy crisis</a>. Scenarios of energy shortage are not discarded in the near future.</p>
<p>Argentina has managed to return to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_growth.html" title="Economic growth">growth</a> with surprising strength; GNP jumped 8.8% in 2003, 9.0% in 2004, and 9.1% in 2005 (with expectations of 8% for 2006). Consumer prices have accompanied this surge; though not comparable to the levels of former crises, the inflation rate was 12.5% in 2005, with expectations around 10% for 2006, though average wages have increased 18% in the same year. This has prompted the government to restrict benefits for exporters and put pressure on companies in order to stabilize prices. While <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> has considerably reduced, Argentina has so far failed to reach an equitable <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenz_curve.html" title="Lorenz curve">distribution of income</a> (the wealthiest 10% of the population owns 31 times more wealth than the poorest 10%). <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to Argentine <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agronomy.html" title="Agronomy">agronomist</a> Alberto Lapolla, who has written extensively on the transformation of Argentina from the "granary of the world" to a "soy republic", 450,000 Argentines died of hunger between 1990 and 2003. Citing the <a href="http://www.ateargentina.org.ar/idep/" class="external text" title="http://www.ateargentina.org.ar/idep/" rel="nofollow">Institute of State and Participation Studies</a> (IDEP), a thinktank, Lapolla adds that every day, 55 children, 35 adults and 15 elderly die in the country from illnesses related to hunger.</p>
<p>Although GDP has grown consistently and quickly since 2003, it was only in late 2004 that it reached the levels of 1998 (the last year before the recession). Other macroeconomic indicators have followed suit. A study by Equis, an independent counseling organisation, found out that two measures of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_inequality.html" title="Economic inequality">economic inequality</a>, the <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gini_coefficient.html" title="Gini coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> and the wealth gap between the 10% poorest and the 10% richest among the population, grew continuously since 2001, and decreased for the first time in March 2005.</p>

<p>When the default was declared in 2002, foreign investment fled the country, and capital flow towards Argentina ceased almost completely. The Argentine government met severe challenges trying to refinance the debt. The state had no spare money at the time, and the central bank's foreign currency reserves were almost depleted.</p>
<p>The Argentine government kept a firm stance, and finally got a deal by which 76% of the defaulted bonds were exchanged by others, of a much lower nominal value (25–35% of the original) and at longer terms.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monetary_Fund_2655.html" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> suffered no discounts in its part of the Argentine debt. Some payments were refinanced or postponed on agreement. However, the authorities of the IMF at times expressed harsh criticism of the discounts and actively lobbied for the private creditors.</p>
<p>In a speech before the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_General_Assembly_e5b8.html" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a> on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">09-21</a>, President Kirchner said that "An urgent, tough, and structural redesign of the International Monetary Fund is needed, to prevent crises and help in [providing] solutions". Implicitly referencing the fact that the intent of the original <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bretton_Woods_system_31be.html" title="Bretton Woods system">Bretton Woods system</a> was to encourage economic development, Kirchner warned that the IMF today must "change that direction which took it from being a lender for development to a creditor demanding privileges".</p>
<p>During the weekend of October 1–2, 2004, at the annual meeting of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monetary_Fund_2655.html" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>/<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, leaders of the IMF, the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, the <a href="../../../g/7/_/G7.html" title="G7">Group of Seven</a> industrialised nations, and the Institute of International Finance (IIF), warned President Kirchner that Argentina had to come to an immediate debt-restructuring agreement with the speculative "<a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulture_fund.html" title="Vulture fund">vulture funds</a>", increase its primary budget surplus in order to pay more debt, and impose "structural reforms" to prove to the world financial community that it deserves their loans and investments.</p>
<p>In 2005, as a large and consistently growing fiscal surplus made it possible, Argentina shifted to a policy of "disindebtment" towards the IMF: paying the IMF in schedule, with no negotiation whenever possible, with the intention of gaining independence from it. On <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_15.html" title="December 15">12-15</a>, in a sudden move following Brazil, President Kirchner announced that Argentina would <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_debt_restructuring.html#Anticipating_payment" title="Argentine debt restructuring">pay the whole debt to the IMF</a> which had been previously financed in installments until 2008, for a total of 9,810 million USD, employing the central bank's foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p>In a report published in June 2006, a group of independent experts hired by the IMF to revise the work of its Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) stated that the assessment of the Argentine case suffered from informative manipulation and lack of collaboration on the part of the IMF; the IEO is claimed to have unduly softened its conclusions to avoid criticizing the IMF's board of directors.</p>
