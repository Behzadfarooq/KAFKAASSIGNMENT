<p>The moment when 'Argentine' rock began as a distinct musical style can be traced to the middle 1960s, when several garage groups and aspiring musicians began composing <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songs.html" title="Songs">songs</a> and <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrics.html" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a> that related to local social and musical themes. Rock &amp; Roll itself however began in Argentina almost a decade before with the arrival of classic American <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockabilly.html" title="Rockabilly">rockabilly</a>; the major impulse to the music was the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Invasion_612b.html" title="British Invasion">British Invasion</a>. During that time until the rise of Argentine rock, local groups recycled the hits of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>-language rock &amp; roll. Since then, Argentine rock started a continued and uninterrupted evolution through the 1970s and into the 1980s, when it turned into an international genre. Today it is widely considered the most prolific and successful form of <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_en_Espa%C3%B1ol_ad32.html" title="Rock en Español">Rock en Español</a>, and one of the most important non-English <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> forms of rock music in the world.</p>
<p>An almost unique trait of Argentine rock is its uncompromising stance to sing rock only in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a>. Rock music is made in many languages around the world, but in most cases it shares the lyrical creative pen with English. The Argentine rock movement was truly one of the first non-English forms of rock to be commercially successful <i>outside</i> its own nation. To this day it is exceedingly rare that Argentine rock bands will sing in a language other than Spanish, specially in order to gain popularity, as it happens in other nations and languages, and even within <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.</p>

<p>Rock and Roll music emerged from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> from a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">Rhythm &amp; Blues</a> base, gaining international popularity in the 1950s with artists like <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_a641.html" title="Bill Haley">Bill Haley</a> (who visited Argentina in 1958), awakening the interest of several Argentine artists with ideas to replicate their sounds.</p>
<p>An important phenomenon was the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_rock.html" title="Mexican rock">Mexican rock</a> bands from the late 1950s and early 1960s. Groups like Los Teen Tops, Los Blue Caps, and Los Locos del Ritmo, whom created <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> lyrics to the hits singles of Elvis, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Richard_892a.html" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Holly_7119.html" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a>, and more. As many artists of the time have stated, such Mexican bands were influential in their early development into composing rock music.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In his book <i>Argentine Progressive Music</i>, Litto Nebbia tells reporter Miguel Grinberg: <i>"I joined a band in 1961 in <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosario%2C_Argentina_e9b6.html" title="Rosario, Argentina">Rosario</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_F%C3%A9_Province_50ce.html" title="Santa Fé Province">Santa Fé</a>, and there like elsewhere existed many local groups influenced by the Mexican rock groups of the time."</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> American bands were the source of the music and Mexican bands the interlocutors, who then exported the sounds to the rest of the region.</p>
<p>Argentine garage bands sprung up in the wake of the early days of rock and roll. Most notable among them was Sandro y Los del Fuego, whom recorded a very decent series of Spanish language covers of rock and roll hits from that time, and attained commercial popularity. Sandro would soon embark on his own contemporary pop standards career that would make him popular internationally.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_rock.html" title="Edit section: British and Uruguayan invasions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">British and Uruguayan invasions</span></h3>
<p>The first few years of rock music in Argentina were confined to cover bands and imitators. In 1964, as in most of the world, Argentina is shaken by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> phenomenon.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Los Jets were the most popular Beatle-imitators in the country, recording several of the major early hits from the British band. In general, the British Invasion was far more transcendental in the fledgling Argentine rock scene than the earlier wave of US rock and roll.</p>
<p>There were two developments unique to Argentina which may help to explain, in retrospect, why the country would become a very important rock producing nation.</p>
<p>The first is what historians call a parallel development curve with the United States in certain aspects of culture. Both countries were the destination for millions of Europeans, and their musical heritage were heavily influenced by Pan-European folk and traditional marches. These similar musical infusions yielded related results in both: a grass-roots rural guitar-based musical tradition, becoming Bluegrass and Country in the US, in Argentina <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">Folklore</a> and Pampas music. <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">Country music</a> is an important pillar of Rock &amp; Roll. In Argentina folklore (at that time <a href="../../../n/u/e/Nueva_canci%C3%B3n.html" title="Nueva canción">Nueva canción</a> was sweeping Argentina), was increasingly crossing over to popular musical trends by the late 1950s.</p>
<p>The second was the curious yet fascinating <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruguayan_Invasion_ba1e.html" title="Uruguayan Invasion">Uruguayan Invasion</a> of 1964-1965. Inspired by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_music.html" title="British music">British</a> bands like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, many young musicians in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montevideo.html" title="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruguay.html" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> began to emulate their sounds. Two bands in particular, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Shakers_bfec.html" title="Los Shakers">Los Shakers</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Mockers_dd42.html" title="Los Mockers">Los Mockers</a> pinched the styles of the Beatles and Stones respectively, singing in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> as well.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the mid-1960s, as the British Invasion was at its height, Uruguayan bands began a similar rise to fame in Argentina. Record labels began rapidly signing Uruguayan rock bands to promote in Argentina (others include Los Walkers, Los In, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Seasons_d49f.html" title="The Seasons">The Seasons</a>). Argentine television shows like <i>"Escala Musical"</i> were also a springboard for many of the bands' popularity.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The bands from Uruguay benefited by moving to Argentina, with a far larger consumer market and more developed music industry.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Shakers_bfec.html" title="Los Shakers">Los Shakers</a> stand out in particular. While Beatlesque, their sound was not an ordinary or rough copy. They were in fact superior than many of the English <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mersey_sound.html" title="Mersey sound">merseybeat</a> bands of that era. Added to this was the quality of their own compositions. They began making live presentations and television appearances in Argentina and overseas. Los Shakers made a conscious decision not to follow the development of Spanish rock lyrics in Argentina by 1965, and thus eventually their popularity dropped. Today considered one of the better Beat bands, Los Shakers albums are sought by collectionists. <i>La Conferencia Secreta del Toto's Bar</i> is seen as one of the best <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic_rock.html" title="Psychedelic rock">psychedelic rock</a> era albums.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Los Gatos in 1967</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By 1965, rock music was making rapid developments in Argentina. While the British and Uruguayan Invasion was still strong, other currents would begin cross-pollinating proto-Argentine rock. On television, several shows such as <i>Ritmo y Juventud</i> and <i>El Club del Clan</i>, with singers like <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palito_Ortega_8642.html" title="Palito Ortega">Palito Ortega</a>, Violeta Rivas, Chico Navarro, and Lalo Fransen, were introducing Sunny Pop, which owed equal amounts to merseybeat and to Argentine romantic pop.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>But it was in the underground where the most fundamental figures of early Argentine rock would emerge. In former <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> bars like <i>"La Cueva"</i> or <i>"La Perla del Once"</i>, bohemian elements like <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moris.html" title="Moris">Moris</a>, Pajarito Zaguri, Javier Martinez, <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Abuelo_0397.html" title="Miguel Abuelo">Miguel Abuelo</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanguito.html" title="Tanguito">Tanguito</a> would gather in the lazy days of mid-60s Argentina to exchange ideas. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Beatnicks_c080.html" title="Los Beatnicks">Los Beatnicks</a>, of which Moris and Martinez where members, began the transition that would slowly take Argentine rock from imitator to a more creative state (while still following UK trends mainly). Forming in quiet beaches of <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_Gesell_c8fd.html" title="Villa Gesell">Villa Gesell</a>, they recorded the first <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> single in 1966 called <i>"Rebelde"</i>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The definitive breakthrough of Spanish-language, original material rock would be up to the band <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Gatos_%28band%29_9b65.html" title="Los Gatos (band)">Los Gatos</a>. After playing in <i>"La Cueva"</i> for a few months (and members of the band being arrested on a regular basis by police, for political reasons), the band released two singles in 1967. <i>"La Balsa"</i>, a sunny track vaguely reminiscent of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doors_4c4f.html" title="The Doors">The Doors</a>, was composed by Tanguito and sold 200,000 copies. The following year saw the first publication of <i>Pinap</i>, a rock magazine, and the founding of the first Argentine rock label, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandioca.html" title="Mandioca">Mandioca</a>. In 1969, four major concerts of so-called <i>"música beat"</i> ("beat music") were held: the <i>June Sunday</i> concerts, <i>Festival Nacional de Música Beat</i>, <i>Festival Pinap</i> and <i>Festival de Música Joven</i>.</p>
<p>In the wake of Los Gatos, an explosion of bands emerged including <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta_ea8d.html" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">Luis Alberto Spinetta</a>'s <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almendra_%28band%29.html" title="Almendra (band)">Almendra</a>, the most influential band of the late 60s, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manal.html" title="Manal">Manal</a>, the first successful blues-oriented group in Spanish. The three are considered the founding trilogy of the Argentine rock movement. None of these groups would have an extended history, in fact most disbanded by the early 70s. The early Argentine rock scene was characterized by a lot of line-up changes in bands, and even member swapping between bands, or members of different bands meeting and forming new groups. However, the shuffles provided for a lot of experimentation and creativity.</p>
<p>Almendra would split with Spinetta forming <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pescado_Rabioso_b056.html" title="Pescado Rabioso">Pescado Rabioso</a>, and the remaining members forming <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_Humano_3820.html" title="Color Humano">Color Humano</a> and <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquelarre.html" title="Aquelarre">Aquelarre</a>. By 1970, <a href="../../../v/o/x/Vox_Dei_bf95.html" title="Vox Dei">Vox Dei</a> and their unique mixture of hard nosed rock with subtle melodious undertones refreshed the movement. Their album <i>"La Biblia"</i> (The Bible) is one of the seminal works of the early 70s, even getting an unusual stamp of approval by the Catholic Church. In that same year, the first B.A (<a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>) Rock festival would be the first showcase of a rising sub-genre that would dominate the first half of 1970s Argentine rock.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> A new group of musicians was to bring new ideas to the mixing bowl of early Argentine rock.</p>
<p>That the original creators of the movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart. While in other countries the original wave in the wake of the US or British rock invasions never sustained itself completely and quieted down, in Argentina not only did it continue, it evolved into its own realm and style more independent from rock music of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>. From 1965, Argentine rock, with a solid line of ascent and evolution, became the most important rock movement in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>-speaking world.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>By the turn of the decade the first real diversification in Argentine rock began taking place. In reality, the split had been brewing even before, as some bands began playing much heavier music, with the world of rock entering the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_Metal_b381.html" title="Heavy Metal">Heavy Metal</a> era. Among them, <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pescado_Rabioso_b056.html" title="Pescado Rabioso">Pescado Rabioso</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/x/Vox_Dei_bf95.html" title="Vox Dei">Vox Dei</a>, and Billy Bond y La Pesada del Rock. But out of all of the heavy rock bands, <a href="../../../p/a/p/Pappo.html" title="Pappo">Pappo</a>'s Blues would become the most influential heavy metal band and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> artist of its era in Argentina, and also acclaimed overseas (even playing with <a href="../../../b/2E/b/B.B._King_bfd1.html" title="B.B.

Another important but overlooked heavy rock act of the period is El Reloj, but they would drift towards progressive in the following years.</p>

<p>Conversely, the first B.A Rock festival (now promoted by Pinap magazine successor Revista Pelo), had many of the artists and bands that would lead the <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoustic.html" title="Acoustic">Acoustic</a> rock movement: <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustavo_Santaolalla_6190.html" title="Gustavo Santaolalla">Gustavo Santaolalla</a> forming <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arco_Iris_e704.html" title="Arco Iris">Arco Iris</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Gieco_917c.html" title="Leon Gieco">Leon Gieco</a>'s rock-folk hybrid, <a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_Generis_ff93.html" title="Sui Generis">Sui Generis</a> and the start of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charly_Garcia_d48f.html" title="Charly Garcia">Charly Garcia</a>'s music career, <a href="../../../r/a/u/Raul_Porchetto_aeed.html" title="Raul Porchetto">Raul Porchetto</a>, and Pedro y Pablo, among other bands. These groups not only turned to Argentine folk for inspiration, they began experimenting with South American musical styles as well; their lyrics becoming increasingly poetic with concerns about nature and the human condition.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The proliferation of these bands and their increasing popularity, the early 70s being the height of the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> movement in Argentina, led to the Acusticazo of 1972. Several acoustic rock bands would gain popularity from their performances there, including <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivencia.html" title="Vivencia">Vivencia</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">Pastoral</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_y_Vida_32ea.html" title="Alma y Vida">Alma y Vida</a>. The behemothic success of the Acusticazo was a turning point, Argentine rock would enter a new era of increased greater appeal.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In that year also, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanguito.html" title="Tanguito">Tanguito</a> was killed when he was hit by a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train.html" title="Train">train</a>. Conspiracies about his death abound, including that he committed suicide and even that he was thrown on to the tracks by police. A man dealing with heavy drug usage, others contend he simply might have tripped.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> The 1993 motion picture <i>Tango Feroz</i> ("Wild Tango"), would tell the life of Tanguito to new generations and the movie was an international hit.</p>
<p>As the 1970s progressed, acoustic rock continued as the most popular style in the country, with the above mentioned and other bands dominating the charts and musical tastes. And for the first time in its history, Argentine rock began spreading overseas: Sui Generis and Pastoral attained some popularity with counter-culture hippies in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, and even <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> (Pastoral had an EP edited there).<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> But a major shift was at hand.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_rock.html" title="Edit section: Sui Generis farewell concerts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sui Generis farewell concerts</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_Generis_ff93.html" title="Sui Generis">Sui Generis</a> began shifting from their classic acoustic rock to a more electric and visceral sound. Also, stirring in the Argentine underground were new bands with a radically different sound from either acoustic or heavy rock: influenced by some of acoustic rock's more experimental works (such as Arco Iris and their phenomenal <i>Agitor Lucens V</i> with its world music influences), by <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">Tango</a> music, and also by British <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_rock.html" title="Progressive rock">progressive rock</a>. This would be the blueprint of Argentine progressive rock that would bloom into the apex of the movement in 1975. As that year began few could foresee what a watershed it would become not just in Argentine rock history, but the country's too.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charly_Garcia_d48f.html" title="Charly Garcia">Charly Garcia</a> and Nito Mestre decided it was time to quit Sui Generis, almost as if they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the <a href="../../../l/u/n/Luna_Park%2C_Buenos_Aires_808c.html" title="Luna Park, Buenos Aires">Luna Park</a> Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most important acoustic rock band saying good-bye to 30,000 people.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression.</p>
<p>Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, among them <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moris.html" title="Moris">Moris</a> and <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquelarre.html" title="Aquelarre">Aquelarre</a>. The dictatorship there was almost at an end, and Spanish rock was in its infancy with bands like <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triana.html" title="Triana">Triana</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/q/Tequila.html" title="Tequila">Tequila</a>, and Asfalto. Interestingly, in Spain rock bands composed their songs in English. It was not until the arrival of Argentine bands with their Spanish language songs that local bands massively switched to singing in their own language, forever changing the development of rock music in Spain.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Classic era of Argentine rock music was completely over by 1976. As this year began, Argentine rock became far more sophisticated, grandiose, and conceptual. A few acoustic bands would continue having moderate success, including <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">Pastoral</a>, and Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre. But it was the beginning of the period of symphonic and progressive rock dominance.</p>

<p>As early as 1973, the band Contraluz combined rock with progressive and folk tinges. They would be an influential group in the years leading to the rise of symphonic and Argentine progressive rock. It would create some of the most enjoyable and brilliant albums in the history of the music, acclaimed nationally and by progressive rock fans worldwide.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first major act of symphonic/progressive was <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucis.html" title="Crucis">Crucis</a>. Their music began attracting attention in the underground, and so they started getting bigger performing venues. As change swept Argentine rock in 1975, their music was rapidly rising to popular musical tastes. Their compositions were strong and dynamic with surprising breaks, and the interplay between the electric guitar (often spectacular wah-wah) and keyboards captivating. The rhythm-section sounded powerful and adventurous.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../e/s/p/Esp%C3%ADritu.html" title="Espíritu">Espíritu</a>, who formed in 1973 but had roots since 1969, would go on to be an internationally followed group in the latter part of symphonic rock's heyday. The first album <i>Crisalida</i> is cited as their best effort, with beautiful and alternating compositions and changing atmospheres (from mellow with acoustic guitar to up-tempo with heavy electric guitar), lush keyboards and some vocal harmonies.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Formerly heavies El Reloj turned to prog with 1975's self-titled album. Their sound has been pinned down as vaguely consonant with <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uriah_Heep_%28band%29_ad8e.html" title="Uriah Heep (band)">Uriah Heep</a>’s mystic and proggy sound.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>A symphonic band that would have a great year in 1976 was <a href="../../../a/l/a/ALAS_47cc.html" title="ALAS">ALAS</a>. Their music was even more intellectual and unorthodox. ALAS would feature artists such as <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodolfo_Mederos_e5e1.html" title="Rodolfo Mederos">Rodolfo Mederos</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Aznar_213e.html" title="Pedro Aznar">Pedro Aznar</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta_ea8d.html" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">Luis Alberto Spinetta</a> would begin his third band <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible.html" title="Invisible">Invisible</a> later in that year. Their symphonic sound tinged with <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">tango</a> would bring critical praise. A band that showed a lot of promise that never materialized was Reino de Munt. Formed by <a href="../../../r/a/u/Raul_Porchetto_aeed.html" title="Raul Porchetto">Raul Porchetto</a>, it featured a young <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alejandro_Lerner_8895.html" title="Alejandro Lerner">Alejandro Lerner</a>, and musicians like Gustavo Basterrica and Frank Ojsterseck.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charly_Garcia_d48f.html" title="Charly Garcia">Charly Garcia</a> formed his first post-<a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_Generis_ff93.html" title="Sui Generis">Sui Generis</a> band, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_M%C3%A1quina_de_Hacer_P%C3%A1jaros_5f5e.html" title="La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros">La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros</a>, which began Garcia's dwellings in symphonic and progressive. Other symphonic and progressive bands of renown would be Torax, Ave Rock, Anacrusa, and Materia Gris.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/c/Arco_Iris_e704.html" title="Arco Iris">Arco Iris</a> meanwhile continued expanding on their symphonic-folk rock, and were joined by veteran Chilean band <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Jaivas_b5b2.html" title="Los Jaivas">Los Jaivas</a>, whom were escaping the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinochet.html" title="Pinochet">Pinochet</a> dictatorship that had swallowed their nation in 1973. The two along with Contraluz were the main exponent of the sub-genre.</p>
<p>On March 24, 1976, the democratic government was toppled by a military coup. It opened one of the darkest political chapters in Argentina's history, full of repression, fear, and missing citizens. Argentine rock by no means would be immune to the military crackdown, and would suffer the worst censure period of its history. Rock was seen as subversive by the nation's authority figures, who began to clamp down on the music. In a 1976 speech, Admiral Massera denounced rock musicians and fans as potential subversives, and repression began in 1977. Before the end of the decade, rock had gone increasingly underground.</p>
<p>In spite of this however, the music would continue its development against the odds. Along with the plethora of symphonic/progressive bands, heavies <a href="../../../v/o/x/Vox_Dei_bf95.html" title="Vox Dei">Vox Dei</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/p/Pappo%27s_Blues_b3fa.html" title="Pappo's Blues">Pappo's Blues</a> continued to sustain their popularity during the period. Yet another heavy metal band, <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plus.html" title="Plus">Plus</a>, made their debut in 76 and enjoyed success through the end of the decade.</p>

<p>Argentine rock continued its symphonic, so-called 'music hall' sound through the end of the decade. The 78-79 period was not the most prolific period for rock, as the progressive bands continued with their blueprint, and symphonic rock bands actually turned slightly commercial.</p>
<p>At the height of symphonic rock, <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucis.html" title="Crucis">Crucis</a> was joined at the top by the popularity of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esp%C3%ADritu.html" title="Espíritu">Espíritu</a>; the two are generally seen as the most well-known outfits of the symphonic rock period. <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_M%C3%A1quina_de_Hacer_P%C3%A1jaros_5f5e.html" title="La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros">La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros</a> efforts were impressive as well, their first album featuring many of the elements of good prog: intricate ensemble work, good individual performances, great melodies, dynamic contrast, and interesting arrangements.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>1977 was a year of separation and endings: <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucis.html" title="Crucis">Crucis</a> would disband at the end of the year. In heavy metal, <a href="../../../p/a/p/Pappo.html" title="Pappo">Pappo</a>'s blues would see their near seven year run end. <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquelarre.html" title="Aquelarre">Aquelarre</a> would return from their <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> stint, but following a tour run went their separate ways.</p>
<p>But the year would show a glimpse at the future: a band from <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Plata%2C_Argentina_0fcd.html" title="La Plata, Argentina">La Plata</a> called <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricio_Rey_y_sus_Redonditos_de_Ricota_48e4.html" title="Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota">Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota</a>, with their comical costumes and nervy fast tempos, started performing. 1977 was a year of one-year wonders: <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soluna.html" title="Soluna">Soluna</a> (<a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustavo_Santaolalla_6190.html" title="Gustavo Santaolalla">Gustavo Santaolalla</a>'s 2nd group), with their electric folk, and Orion's Beethoven, a progressive band that played since 1969 but had their moment of fame eight years later. Neither band sustained their popularity into 1978.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> Bubu with their album <i>Anabelas</i> was 1978's one-year wonder.</p>
<p>And even more bands ceased to be. After two successful albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_M%C3%A1quina_de_Hacer_P%C3%A1jaros_5f5e.html" title="La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros">La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros</a> hung up, as did <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible.html" title="Invisible">Invisible</a>, leaving as a legacy two of the greatest albums in Argentine rock's history: <i>Invisible</i> and <i>Jardin de los Presentes</i>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">Pastoral</a>, one of last acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did <a href="../../../a/l/a/ALAS_47cc.html" title="ALAS">ALAS</a>. With the country gripped by World Cup mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disco_music.html" title="Disco music">Disco music</a> craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out 'the death' of Argentine rock.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, Argentine rock had the strange fortune to get exactly what in needed at the right time, fueling an even greater expansion in the music. Sandro y los del fuego in 63 with their Argentine rockabilly igniting inspiration; the <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruguayan_Invasion_ba1e.html" title="Uruguayan Invasion">Uruguayan Invasion</a> of 1965 that proved the commercial viability of non-US or UK bands; the massive hit of <i>"La Balsa"</i> by <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Gatos_54e2.html" title="Los Gatos">Los Gatos</a> in 67 showing <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> rock could be appealing to the masses; the <i>Acusticazo</i> of 72.

Seru Giran in 1979</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charly_Garcia_d48f.html" title="Charly Garcia">Charly Garcia</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Moro_3712.html" title="Oscar Moro">Oscar Moro</a>, David Lebón, and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Aznar_213e.html" title="Pedro Aznar">Pedro Aznar</a> managed two major things with Seru Giran. The first was to create a sound that was trully distinctive from anything in English-language rock. The second was their ability to massively achieve popularity in the lower and upper classes with their style of rock. <a href="../../../s/e/r/Seru_Giran_15d4.html" title="Seru Giran">Seru Giran</a> could be 'brainy' yet unpretentious rockers simultaneously.</p>
<p>Partly because the group lived for three months in northeast <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the band's first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>. But the band's first live concert to support the album created one of the strangest anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and then when they played the song <i>"Disco Shock"</i>, a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and what should have been a great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for <a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_Generis_ff93.html" title="Sui Generis">Sui Generis</a> songs. People failed to get the message and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Seru_Giran_15d4.html" title="Seru Giran">Seru Giran</a> did not get their point across too well either. It would all fuel wild speculations about the member's sexual orientations, a PR nightmare at the time.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the group bounced back with a vengeance with their 2nd album <i>La Grasa de las Capitales</i>. It was well received by the specialized press, and would cement their status as the most popular band of their time.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> Seru Giran's third album <i>Bicicleta</i> (1980) was mildly received at first, but in time would be considered the band's best work. Both albums departed from the symphonic rock of the first LP, the music turning more visceral and 'simple' with less arrangement and pomp. Seru Giran would not be isolated in this trend, as slowly Argentine rock was writing the final chapters in its symphonic and progressive period.</p>

That year they had also performed in concert with Spinetta Jade, <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta_ea8d.html" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">Luis Alberto Spinetta</a>'s latest project and the other popular rock group of the early 1980s. It was a great event in which both bands eventually played some songs of each other's repertoire.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Spinetta Jade was a blend of jazz and rock that escaped the trappings of symphonic rock, something that was unseen in Argentina at that time. Towards the last two albums, the sound became a little bit more "pop", and embedded with electronic elements (samplers and synthesizers with "artificial" textures).<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Seru Giran released their fourth album <i>Peperina</i> in 1981 and promoted it on tour, but by the end of the year <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Aznar_213e.html" title="Pedro Aznar">Pedro Aznar</a> decided to leave the band because he wanted to study at <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berklee.html" title="Berklee">Berklee</a>.

Seru Giran (which at the time was even planning tours in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>), had a strong sendoff on March 6-7, 1982, when they performed for the last time at the Estadio Obras. A memorable moment was the performance of the song <i>"No llores por mi Argentina"</i> ("Don't Cry for me Argentina", which has no relation to the <i>Evita</i> musical theme); a song full of symbolisms. It was not only a farewell for Aznar, and for Seru Giran, but for an era in Argentine music, and history. The timing was beyond befitting.</p>
<p>Argentina's economy was in full recession in 1982, and discontent with the military government was rampant. On April 2, the world would awake yet again in the 20th century to the horror of war. After a season of death and destruction in the South Atlantic in which both sides suffered sunken ships, aircraft blown from the sky, and hundreds of young lives cut short, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> regained control over the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> (Islas Malvinas). The popularity of the Argentine military government hit then bottom, and democratic elections were called shortly after.</p>

<p>The war would be a dark chapter in Argentine history, but would have the paradoxical effect of creating one of the most fortuitous circumstances in the history of any rock genre.</p>
<p>In May of 82 the <i>Festival for Latin American Solidarity</i> brought together all the great bands of Argentine rock. It was a festival in support of the troops overseas, and also a veiled protest to war, and a call for peace (at first the musicians feared appearing for risk of being portrayed pro-war). This event was the final stepping stone of Argentine rock in becoming <i>the</i> dominant form of music in the country. At the same time, English-language rock was wiped out from radio play. The programmers had to fill the voids with something, and that was with Argentine rock.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> This created the opportunity of exposure to countless underground bands. It would set the foundations for the explosion of rock in the mid 1980s.</p>
<p>In the latter days of symphonic rock, a great number of new groups started popping seemingly out of nowhere. In reality, these were bands influenced by <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-punk.html" title="Post-punk">post-punk</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">new wave</a> from the US and Britain, and by the more symphonic and less progressive side of Argentine rock. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricio_Rey_y_sus_Redonditos_de_Ricota_48e4.html" title="Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota">Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota</a>, who had started in 1977, were growing a larger following on a monthly basis. In 1979 in <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Plata%2C_Argentina_0fcd.html" title="La Plata, Argentina">La Plata</a>, Federico Moura would form a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New-wave.html" title="New-wave">new-wave</a> pioneering band called <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus_%28Argentine_band%29_41ab.html" title="Virus (Argentine band)">Virus</a>. In <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, three young men influenced by the advent of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-punk.html" title="Post-punk">post-punk</a> in Britain started exchanging ideas, and decided to form a band with the name <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a>.</p>

At the local pubs in <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mendoza%2C_Argentina_574e.html" title="Mendoza, Argentina">Mendoza</a> a pop-rock act called Los <a href="../../../e/n/a/Enanitos_Verdes_b3d3.html" title="Enanitos Verdes">Enanitos Verdes</a> appeared. An Italian of Scottish background named <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luca_Prodan_c8a2.html" title="Luca Prodan">Luca Prodan</a> arrived in Argentina to fight his <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> addiction, worsened by the death of his friend <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Curtis_6976.html" title="Ian Curtis">Ian Curtis</a> of <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joy_Division_0c14.html" title="Joy Division">Joy Division</a>. Prodan would form <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo_%28band%29.html" title="Sumo (band)">Sumo</a>.</p>
<p>From the <i>Festival of Latin American Solidarity</i> emerged solo artists that would go on to delve into a more adult oriented form of rock and pop music, with the Argentine youngsters of the 60s now mature adults. Some of these names were Juan Carlos Baglietto (who was optimistic about a young musician from <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosario%2C_Argentina_e9b6.html" title="Rosario, Argentina">Rosario</a> named <a href="../../../f/i/t/Fito_Paez_ed6d.html" title="Fito Paez">Fito Paez</a>), <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alejandro_Lerner_8895.html" title="Alejandro Lerner">Alejandro Lerner</a>, and Celeste Carballo. In heavy metal, <a href="../../../p/a/p/Pappo.html" title="Pappo">Pappo</a> founded his new band <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riff.html" title="Riff">Riff</a>, and newcomers <a href="../../../v/8/_/V8_%28band%29.html" title="V8 (band)">V8</a> and La Torre would emerge. New "funny" rock bands like <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Twist_9d7e.html" title="Los Twist">Los Twist</a>, Sueter, and girl-riot Viudas e Hijas de Roque Enroll crashed to the scene infusing Argentine rock with needed dosages of humor and self-deprecation.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup> On the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_rock.html" title="Gothic rock">goth</a> side of rock, La Sobrecarga would carry the torch.</p>
<p>And for the first time in Argentine rock history there was a "revival" of an earlier style, with Acoustic rock making a comeback on the back of reunions by <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almendra_%28band%29.html" title="Almendra (band)">Almendra</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manal.html" title="Manal">Manal</a>. On the other hand <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charly_Garcia_d48f.html" title="Charly Garcia">Charly Garcia</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta_ea8d.html" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">Luis Alberto Spinetta</a> embarked on their solo careers. <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moris.html" title="Moris">Moris</a> returned from his period in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Argentina entered a new era with the inauguration of <a href="../../../r/a/u/Raul_Alfonsin_0036.html" title="Raul Alfonsin">Raul Alfonsin</a> as president of a fully democratic nation. Rock bands would no longer be harassed and even censored by the powers-that-be, and freedom of expression flowered. Songs critical of the military that were in prior years censored, some with exquisite lyrical poetry and allegory, were released during this time: <i>"Tiempos Dificiles"</i> by Fito Páez (sung by Juan Carlos Baglietto), <i>"Maribel se Durmió"</i> by Luis Alberto Spinetta, <i>"Sólo le pido a Dios"</i> by León Gieco and <i>"Los dinosaurios</i>" by Charly García. A more direct criticism of the military government that ended in 1983 came from the Argentine punk groups like Los Violadores (singing songs like "Represión") or seminal heavy metal bands like V8.</p>
<p>Finally, segments of Argentine rock moved away from the music hall and 'solemn' era, full of very heavy lyrics and concerns with domestic issues. It started to lighten up and turn more irreverent, and to focus on mondane concerns such as money, love, and sports. This would make the music and lyrics far more accessible (and commercial) to international audiences.</p>
<p>The stage was set for the boom of Argentine rock in Latin America and beyond.</p>

<p>"One could feel the winds of change" in 1983 Argentina. A cliché perhaps, but at no time more appropriately used. Everything was optimism about the future, the country, and music. Even technology cooperated with the palpable change: it was the year the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_disc.html" title="Compact disc">compact disc</a> was introduced. And 1984 was the year of female rock: Patricia Sosa and her heavy rock band La Torre were voted best band of the year and <i>"Solo quiero Rock and Roll"</i> best single, a first for a female lead rock act. Another female vocal band, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Twist_9d7e.html" title="Los Twist">Los Twist</a>, and their superbly catchy tunes about nothing were also doing very well, but the group suffered a blow when Fabiana Cantilo left.</p>
<p>As the early 1980s progressed it became clear that the new generation of rockers were not like anything before: <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Violadores_5440.html" title="Los Violadores">Los Violadores</a> pioneering <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_punk.html" title="Argentine punk">punk</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>; <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus_%28Argentine_band%29_41ab.html" title="Virus (Argentine band)">Virus</a> oxygenating rock with their new-wave sound; <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo_%28band%29.html" title="Sumo (band)">Sumo</a>'s punkish reggae-rock growing a fanatical cult (<a href="../../../l/u/c/Luca_Prodan_c8a2.html" title="Luca Prodan">Luca Prodan</a> sung mostly in English, which reduced his band's radio exposure yet their fame expanded unabated); and <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a> the buzz of the underground. ZAS introduced the phrase "<i>rock en tu idioma"</i> (rock in your language).<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup> <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Abuelos_de_la_Nada_c421.html" title="Los Abuelos de la Nada">Los Abuelos de la Nada</a> and newcomers G.I.T. found quick success outside Argentina, a preview of things to come.</p>
<p>By 1985, year in which <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Fabulosos_Cadillacs_b12b.html" title="Los Fabulosos Cadillacs">Los Fabulosos Cadillacs</a> formed, several bands began receiving consistent airplay across <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>. Argentine rock began "climbing" the continent up the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andes.html" title="Andes">Andes</a>: first <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>, then <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecuador.html" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. <a href="../../../z/e/t/Zeta_Bosio_1ee4.html" title="Zeta Bosio">Zeta Bosio</a> of <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a> said of this: <i>"We would leave <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and tour in Chile, Peru, etc, and in some places they had never heard a live rock concert before... they said that such music was for another world and wouldn’t work... now it's all joy seeing how it did work and that it now has its own legs..."</i> Argentine rock bands were the first to be signed to multinational record labels for distribution across many nations.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The trickle became a flood as 1986 approached, and by the start of that year it had become a continental phenomenon, reaching <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and crossing the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, even as far <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Enanitos_Verdes_c327.html" title="Los Enanitos Verdes">Los Enanitos Verdes</a> with their energetic pop-rock that appealed through music lines gained previously unseen popularity across borders.

<p>It would help to revitalize rock movements in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> for two reasons: 1) It would create a buzz and excitement in the local rock scenes; 2) it proved to producers and record labels in those countries that "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_en_Espa%C3%B1ol_ad32.html" title="Rock en Español">Rock en Español</a>" could work and make them money.

Year years of Soda Sterio (1979)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a> was arguably the most successful <i>and</i> influential rock band in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> ever. Even as a few other more recent rock acts have sold more albums (and thus are technically more 'successful'), the influence of Soda Stereo and its music, style, and even <i>business acumen</i> is undeniable. They were also the first Spanish-language band to use all aspects of their popularity to the fullest: their music videos, aesthetic, philosophy, and more. In the beginning they were deeply influenced by new wave and bands such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Police_9a4c.html" title="The Police">The Police</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking_Heads_1ab7.html" title="Talking Heads">Talking Heads</a>, and by symphonic rockers <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta_ea8d.html" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">Luis Alberto Spinetta</a> and <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquelarre.html" title="Aquelarre">Aquelarre</a>.</p>
<p>With their first album, the self-titled <i><a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_%28album%29_13fd.html" title="Soda Stereo (album)">Soda Stereo</a></i> (1984), they reached national success with joyful and ironic lyrics, and a sound that combined pop, reggae, ska, and new wave, but were accused of being superficial and frivolous. The second album, <i><a href="../../../n/a/d/Nada_Personal_%28album%29_a82c.html" title="Nada Personal (album)">Nada Personal</a></i>, strengthened the popularity of the band, with instant classics such as <i>"Nada Personal"</i> and <i>"Cuando Pase el Temblor"</i> opening the doors of the Latin American market. But 1986's <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Signos.html" title="Signos">Signos</a></i> is arguably their masterpiece. The musical arrangements and the lyrics reached a subtlety never heard before from the band's production. They embarked in an extensive tour through Latin America that brought the live album <i><a href="../../../r/u/i/Ruido_Blanco_f50d.html" title="Ruido Blanco">Ruido Blanco</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the tour supporting <i>Signos</i>, <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a> became international superstars. The band would continue their worldwide success well into the 1990s, and evolving their musical sounds unlike almost any other <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_en_Espa%C3%B1ol_ad32.html" title="Rock en Español">Rock en Español</a> band. In fact, they would lead the way in the changes Argentine rock would experience as the 1990s drew near.</p>

<p>The year 1987 would end in tragedy for Argentine rock. <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luca_Prodan_c8a2.html" title="Luca Prodan">Luca Prodan</a> had finally lost his internal war with heroin and was found dead on December 22, due to complications from his addiction.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup> His death was a shock to the entire music industry and to millions of heartbroken fans, and a prelude to further blight and woe to come. Following Prodan's death, the members of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo_%28band%29.html" title="Sumo (band)">Sumo</a> would split founding two new rock outfits: <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divididos.html" title="Divididos">Divididos</a> and Las Pelotas; both bands would be major players of 1990s rock.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Abuelo_0397.html" title="Miguel Abuelo">Miguel Abuelo</a>, following gallbladder surgery, would be diagnosed with <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>; terminally ill, he died from <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrest.html" title="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</a> on March 26, 1988. Another member of the founding generation of Argentine rock was gone. <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus_%28Argentine_band%29_41ab.html" title="Virus (Argentine band)">Virus</a> leader Federico Moura's persistent pneumonia fueled rumors of further complications, which ended in the revelation soon after by the singer that he was infected with the <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> virus.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> Moura died on December 21, 1988, eerily a year after Prodan's death. Moura's passing completed a dreadful trifecta of musicians who had still much to offer. It was a tough blow for rock. As a group, Virus would surprisingly survive and soldier on into the 1990s as a more adult pop-rock outfit than the outrageous yet influential 80s band that helped define the sound of "techno-pop".</p>
<p>Three major trends defined the Argentine rock of the end of the 1980s. The first trend was the consolidation of the Argentine Invasion bands into somewhat more mature rock groups. Some began to experiment with world music in the last two years of the 80s decade. For example, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charly_Garcia_d48f.html" title="Charly Garcia">Charly Garcia</a> got together with his old <a href="../../../s/e/r/Seru_Giran_15d4.html" title="Seru Giran">Seru Giran</a> partner <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Aznar_213e.html" title="Pedro Aznar">Pedro Aznar</a> and recorded <i>"Tango 4"</i>, whose name accurately suggests the style of the album.<sup id="_ref-polimeni_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-polimeni" title="">[40]</a></sup> Before Federico Moura's death, Virus had also began turning to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian.html" title="Brazilian">Brazilian</a> music for their album <i>Superficies de Placer</i>. In general the mood of the music got darker echoing a deteriorated economic climate.</p>
<p>A second was the rise of <i>"Tropical"</i> rock, and the explosion of local <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggae.html" title="Reggae">Reggae</a> bands in Argentina seemingly out of nowhere in 1987. While Argentine rock was triumphant internationally, Argentina was caught in a reggae-mania: in the summer of that year arose <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Pericos_604b.html" title="Los Pericos">Los Pericos</a>, Los Cafres, La Zimbabwe, and Jafran, among many other smaller outfits. But it was a fad, and only Los Pericos would sustain and grow their careers once the fancy faded<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[41]</a></sup> (Los Cafres would be mildly successful starting in 1994). A band that was not a fad was <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Aut%C3%A9nticos_Decadentes_303d.html" title="Los Auténticos Decadentes">Los Auténticos Decadentes</a>, who would become a hugely popular ska-Latin pop and ballad group. They along with <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Pericos_604b.html" title="Los Pericos">Los Pericos</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Fabulosos_Cadillacs_b12b.html" title="Los Fabulosos Cadillacs">Los Fabulosos Cadillacs</a> would be leaders in the tropical rock scene of <a href="../../../s/k/a/Ska.html" title="Ska">ska</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggae.html" title="Reggae">reggae</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_music.html" title="Latin music">latin music</a>.</p>
<p>The third trend came about partly as a result of the first: many rock fans did not approve of the commercialism and experimentation of the A-bands, and increasingly looked underground for a more confrontational guitar-led rock. Among them: <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todos_Tus_Muertos_9449.html" title="Todos Tus Muertos">Todos Tus Muertos</a>, Don Cornelio y La Zona (later Los Visitantes), <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Brujos_10bc.html" title="Los Brujos">Los Brujos</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babas%C3%B3nicos.html" title="Babasónicos">Babasónicos</a>, Los Siete Delfines. All of them would be part of the <i>"Nuevo Rock"</i> ("New Rock") explosion of the early 1990s.</p>
<p>In heavy metal, the already mentioned <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rata_Blanca_573a.html" title="Rata Blanca">Rata Blanca</a> dominated popular tastes, specially in other Latin American countries, along with <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herm%C3%A9tica.html" title="Hermética">Hermética</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/f/JAF_02df.html" title="JAF">JAF</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horcas.html" title="Horcas">Horcas</a> (the last two more domestic), in a very healthy scene for a style that never was overwhelmingly crowded in Argentine rock. A important band in the metal underground was <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal_%28band%29.html" title="Nepal (band)">Nepal</a>, one of the pioneering bands of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a>. Formed in 1984, they were part of the first generation of worldwide thrashers, and gained prominence as the decade ended and musical tastes turned approbatory for more extreme metal. The genre got many magazines committed solely to it and distributed nationwide: Madhouse, Metal, Riff Raff, Revista Epopeya, etc.</p>
<p>The end of the 1980s were also a period of continued growth for <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricio_Rey_y_sus_Redonditos_de_Ricota_48e4.html" title="Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota">Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota</a>, on their way to becoming one of the most mythic cult bands of broad popularity in the history of rock, anywhere. It was also the time when <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Ratones_Paranoicos_e588.html" title="Los Ratones Paranoicos">Los Ratones Paranoicos</a> were gaining followers with the burgeoning <i>"rolingas"</i> (followers of a sub-genre of Argentine rock that is greatly indebted to the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>). On the pop side <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_Ray_b06e.html" title="Man Ray">Man Ray</a> with their taylor made FM songs were ubiquitous. Finally, <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divididos.html" title="Divididos">Divididos</a> and their guitar-crunching melodic noise was more and more becoming a preview of what the next decade would bring. In general, as the fantastic 80s for Argentine rock closed, the music was in period of transition and exploration at all levels.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a>'s frontman <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustavo_Cerati_99c5.html" title="Gustavo Cerati">Gustavo Cerati</a> could foresee where the tide was heading and put his own band in front of it. After releasing the increasingly hard rocking <i><a href="../../../d/o/b/Doble_Vida_af31.html" title="Doble Vida">Doble Vida</a></i>, the band headed to studio with new producer Daniel Melero to record their fourth major album, <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canci%C3%B3n_Animal_d4bd.html" title="Canción Animal">Canción Animal</a></i>. It was released in October 1990, about a year before <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a> released <i><a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevermind.html" title="Nevermind">Nevermind</a></i>. The impact <i>Cancion Animal</i> had on Argentine Rock is almost comparable to that which Nevermind would have on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_rock.html" title="American rock">American rock</a> a year later.</p>
<p><i>Cancion Animal</i> confirmed that it was OK to return Argentine rock to an 'in your face', edgy attitude that shaped the Argentine Invasion aesthetic in the early years of the 1980s, but this time with electric guitars as the stars. From that album, the single <i>"de Música Ligera"</i>, might well be the most recognizable Spanish-language rock single of all time, and also one of the most covered by bands all over Latin America and elsewhere. <i>Cancion Animal</i> helped underground acts like <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Brujos_10bc.html" title="Los Brujos">Los Brujos</a>, Peligrosos Gorriones, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre.html" title="Massacre">Massacre</a> break faster into the mainstream, by taking guitar-crunching rock to the apex as 1991 began. Even pop-bound groups like <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Enanitos_Verdes_c327.html" title="Los Enanitos Verdes">Los Enanitos Verdes</a> rocked harder in their early 90s works, particularly in their <i>Big Bang</i> album, whose single <i>"Lamento Boliviano"</i> is now a classic.</p>
<p>These and other bands in their wake would be dubbed the <i>"Nuevo Rock Argentino"</i>, or New Argentine Rock. A term that not long after would also be used as an umbrella to group bands with a hard-to-pin-down style, like the neo-surf pop of Super Ratones (from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar_del_Plata%2C_Argentina_51b9.html" title="Mar del Plata, Argentina">Mar del Plata</a>), and neo-fusionists <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Portuaria_1ff3.html" title="La Portuaria">La Portuaria</a> with their world music touches. <i>"Nuevo Rock"</i> would be the dominant form of rock in Argentina until the middle of the decade when it lost ground to so-called <i>"rock suburbano"</i>.</p>
<p>In 1992, <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a> presented <i><a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamo_%28album%29.html" title="Dynamo (album)">Dynamo</a></i>, their fifth album, arguably the most conceptual (the other being <i>"Signos"</i>), and the most experimental to that point. It apparently took fans by surprise, and was the lowest seller of the group's works (it didn't help that in the middle of all this the band changed labels; Sony wouldn’t promote a band that was leaving, and BMG wouldn't promote another label's album).<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babas%C3%B3nicos.html" title="Babasónicos">Babasónicos</a> had in 1992 their first major breakthrough of their careers with the hit <i>D-generación</i> from their 1992 album <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasto_%28album%29.html" title="Pasto (album)">Pasto</a>, which would herald future international success for a band that would define the sound of "sonic" rock.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[43]</a></sup> Juana La Loca was another band in the so-called sonic scene that started in the early 90s and would breakthrough a few years later. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Brujos_10bc.html" title="Los Brujos">Los Brujos</a> would have a great year 1992; the single <i>"Kanishka"</i> was an instant chart-topper. Los Visitantes equaled the success of Los Brujos the next year with their album <i>Salud Universal</i>, an offbeat mix of guitar rock and <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">tango</a> tinges. <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todos_Tus_Muertos_9449.html" title="Todos Tus Muertos">Todos Tus Muertos</a> was a punk response to the Argentine rock being made in the late 1980s, consciously choosing to be far more direct and explicit in their musical (and political) statements. The band gained rapid acclaim with the rise of New Rock, and were one of the favorite bands of the period. Slowly the group would evolve from their early punk to a more diverse style that include afro-Latin rhythms.</p>
<p>The odd-group out that appeared in the early 90s was the outrageously named <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illya_Kuryaki_and_the_Valderramas_ffce.html" title="Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas">Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas</a> (a reference to Colombian footballer <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Valderrama_%28footballer%29_8d03.html" title="Carlos Valderrama (footballer)">Carlos Valderrama</a>). More rappers than rockers, the group nonetheless made a mark in the rock scene as time progressed and they were able to more successfully integrate rap with Argentine rock, and also Latin rhythms. One of the members, Dante, is the son of <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta_ea8d.html" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">Luis Alberto Spinetta</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Suburban_Rock" id="Suburban_Rock"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_rock.html" title="Edit section: Suburban Rock">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suburban Rock</span></h3>
<p>As New Rock was dominant, Suburban rock was at the same time laying the groundwork for large scale success later on. In its simplest description, suburban rock is straightforward and guitar centered, with a foundation in the blues, and a unsophisticated image (somewhat a counter-movement to the image conscious, musically more pretentious New Rock). Many of the bands would emerge from the distant suburbs of <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, thus their style being dubbed <i>"rock suburbano"</i>, or "suburban" rock (which goes under other terms including <i>"rock chabón"</i> and <i>"rock barrial"</i>).</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the early influences of the genre can be said to be <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo_%28band%29.html" title="Sumo (band)">Sumo</a> (aesthetically), and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricio_Rey_y_sus_Redonditos_de_Ricota_48e4.html" title="Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota">Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota</a>. After <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luca_Prodan_c8a2.html" title="Luca Prodan">Luca Prodan</a>'s death, Sumo's remaining members went on to either form <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divididos.html" title="Divididos">Divididos</a> or Las Pelotas. The former group's third album, <i>La Era de la Boludez</i> ("The Era of Dumbness"), was a commentary on modern Argentine society and made the band the more commercially fruitful of the two.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[44]</a></sup> On the other hand Las Pelotas were not necessarily seeking commercialism, which earned them street-cred in the underground. All of these bands and their incessant tours around the suburbs of <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> and other cities would reap benefits not only for themselves but for other suburban groups that would follow soon after.</p>
<p>Some of the suburban acts owed so much to the sound of the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>, that their followers came to be known as <i>"rolingas".</i> Eventually <i>rolinga</i> became a style: cheesy 1970s sneakers, tight t-shirts with the logo of the Stones or a local 'stone' band, and a disdain for other Argentine rock sub-genres they consider part of the establishment.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[45]</a></sup> At the forefront of this movement were <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Ratones_Paranoicos_e588.html" title="Los Ratones Paranoicos">Los Ratones Paranoicos</a>, whom for years before were perfecting a musical formula that would be emulated by countless neighborhood bands in years to come. They were joined in the Rolinga scene by <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viejas_Locas_fce4.html" title="Viejas Locas">Viejas Locas</a> in the mid 90s.</p>
<p>The rise of the suburban style of rootsy-rock was a catalyst to bring the until then obscure bands of Argentine blues to the light. <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis_La_Blusera_3bcb.html" title="Memphis La Blusera">Memphis La Blusera</a> are the undisputed fathers of the genre, performing and recording together since the late 1970s. Their appeal as well as that of newcomers La Mississippi increased dramatically in the 1990s as musical tastes now allowed a broader public to appreciate their work. Both bands are considered the indubitable leaders of the blues in Argentina.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_rock.html" title="Edit section: 1990s Metal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1990s Metal</span></h3>
<p>The last decade of the twentieth century was a very productive one for this style of rock in Argentina. There had always been "heavy" bands: Billy Bond y la Pesada del Rock in the 60s, <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pescado_Rabioso_b056.html" title="Pescado Rabioso">Pescado Rabioso</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/p/Pappo.html" title="Pappo">Pappo</a>'s Blues in the 1970s, <a href="../../../v/8/_/V8_%28band%29.html" title="V8 (band)">V8</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riff.html" title="Riff">Riff</a>, and several underground metal acts in the 80s. But they had never been at the forefront of Argentine rock, seemingly always obscured by other genres whether it was acoustic, symphonic, progressive, or the 80s invasion bands. This changed in the 1990s.</p>
<p>As the decade started <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rata_Blanca_573a.html" title="Rata Blanca">Rata Blanca</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horcas.html" title="Horcas">Horcas</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herm%C3%A9tica.html" title="Hermética">Hermética</a> and J.A.F had very respectable careers. Rata Blanca was internationally approved: in fact, it is plausible to state that their classic metal sound was more popular outside Argentina than within. Internationally popular to a lesser extent was Hermética, the archrivals of Rata Blanca (both formed in 87 when <a href="../../../v/8/_/V8_%28band%29.html" title="V8 (band)">V8</a> disbanded), but there were no doubts of their massive following at home. Horcas and J.A.F stayed mostly successful in the local medium, though nonetheless had some overseas exposure.</p>
<p>The major development in Argentine metal of the 1990s was the rise of <a href="../../../a/2E/n/A.N.I.M.A.L._c170.html" title="A.N.I.M.A.L.">A.N.I.M.A.L.</a>. The acronym translated literally stands for "Abused (accosted) Our Indians Died While Fighting". And their themes lived up to that title: the band would be one of the most outspoken advocates for indigenous people and even nationalism, while also (as such bands tend to do), blasting against the current world order.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[46]</a></sup> Their sound is equal parts <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal.html" title="Heavy metal">heavy metal</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash</a>. Another important band formed in 1990 was Tren Loco, whom not long after went to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and won second place in a major battle-of-the-band event at famous <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budokan.html" title="Budokan">Budokan</a> Stadium in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. The metal underground also flourished in the 1990s, with bands like Alakrán, Jezabel, Jason, Logos, and Jeriko, among others.</p>

<p>Solo artists from the earlier generations were by the 1990s established figures in the medium. The biggest two stars (as it had always been since 1970), were <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charly_Garcia_d48f.html" title="Charly Garcia">Charly Garcia</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta_ea8d.html" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">Luis Alberto Spinetta</a>. Garcia enjoyed a prolific 1980s with many of his albums turning into classics. Spinetta had a more uneven worksheet but nonetheless was successful. <a href="../../../p/a/p/Pappo.html" title="Pappo">Pappo</a> continued spitting out blues and heavy rock records, <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Mateos_1635.html" title="Miguel Mateos">Miguel Mateos</a> remained a popular rock figure in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> even as he dropped almost off the radar in Argentina. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Gieco_917c.html" title="Leon Gieco">Leon Gieco</a>'s unique "folk-rock meets world music" approaches made him an internationally acclaimed musician.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/t/Fito_Paez_ed6d.html" title="Fito Paez">Fito Paez</a>'s pop career continued to take-off in the early 1990s. In 1992 he released <i>El Amor después del Amor</i>, becoming the best selling Argentine rock album. The title "love after love" was not by chance: he had just ended a well-publicized relationship with female rocker Fabiana Cantilo (herself an important 90s singer in the movement), and was getting involved with movie actress <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecilia_Roth_08b5.html" title="Cecilia Roth">Cecilia Roth</a>.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[47]</a></sup> With the album Paez was confirmed an international pop star. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9s_Calamaro_a744.html" title="Andrés Calamaro">Andrés Calamaro</a> had enjoyed some popularity since his solo career begun, but never managed a complete breakthrough with the public. He left for <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and there met two local musicians forming Los Rodriguez in 1991. Two years later the hit single <i>"Sin Documentos"</i> finally gave Calamaro an international hit, and the band gained overnight vogue in Spain and Latin America.</p>
<p>Tropical, Fusion, and Latin influenced rock continued its ascent. 1992 was the year of <i>"La Pachanga"</i>: <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosario%2C_Argentina_e9b6.html" title="Rosario, Argentina">Rosario</a>'s Vilma Palma e Vampiros single was an across the board mega hit in the Spanish-speaking world; there was no way of escaping it unless one did not have any kind of social life in the early 90s. Bands like <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Aut%C3%A9nticos_Decadentes_303d.html" title="Los Auténticos Decadentes">Los Auténticos Decadentes</a>, who had a major hit in 1990 with <i>"Loco (tu forma de ser)"</i>, and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Pericos_604b.html" title="Los Pericos">Los Pericos</a> mirrored the tendency of increased popularity for the sub-genre. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Fabulosos_Cadillacs_b12b.html" title="Los Fabulosos Cadillacs">Los Fabulosos Cadillacs</a> had a slump in the early 90s after harvesting great accolades in the late 1980s, but came back with a roar in 1994 with <i>Vasos Vacios</i>; the compilation that featured <i>"Matador"</i>. The single would turn into a global superhit, winning MTV's best video of the year.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[48]</a></sup> The early 90s were also the formative years of a group that would have an impact towards the new millennium: <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bersuit_Vergarabat_1ebb.html" title="Bersuit Vergarabat">Bersuit Vergarabat</a>. La Mosca would begin tapping into the tropical and Latin trend by 1995.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_punk.html" title="Argentine punk">Argentine punk</a>-revival took off in the 1990s. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Violadores_5440.html" title="Los Violadores">Los Violadores</a> had ruled 80s punk; them along with the foreign punk bands of yesteryear would inspire the members of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attaque_77.html" title="Attaque 77">Attaque 77</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flema.html" title="Flema">Flema</a>. Formed in 1986 and 1987 respectively, they were pioneers of the worldwide punk revival movement. Attaque 77's breakthrough came in 1990 with the single <i>"Hacelo por Mi"</i>; <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flema.html" title="Flema">Flema</a> never broke to the mainstream but were heroic figures of the punk underground. Both groups paved the way for dozens of followers. One of those were <a href="../../../2/_/m/2_Minutos_24a4.html" title="2 Minutos">2 Minutos</a>, with their pure-energy, extreme, back-to-basics punk rock. Another darling of the scene were <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todos_Tus_Muertos_9449.html" title="Todos Tus Muertos">Todos Tus Muertos</a>, perhaps one of few bands in any punk movement that was accepted for their various rock styles <i>besides</i> punk. <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fun_People_fb1a.html" title="Fun People">Fun People</a> took punk's liberal philosophy to another level by tackling the punk-scene itself: many of their lyrics criticized the macho attitudes in the movement which they saw contradictory to the spirit of punk. The <a href="../../../s/h/e/She_Devils_4c37.html" title="She Devils">She Devils</a> were the leaders of the local <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homocore.html" title="Homocore">queercore</a> scene.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[49]</a></sup> <a href="../../../c/i/e/Cienfuegos.html" title="Cienfuegos">Cienfuegos</a>, a punk band that had existed since the 80s but suffered various contingencies, finally would produce albums by the mid 90s.</p>

<p>In the middle years of the 90s a rift developed in Argentine rock that would, with only slight wrinkles, endure to present times.</p>
<p>By 1995 <i>"nuevo rock argentino"</i> or Argentine new rock had lost steam. For starters, bands like Los Siete Delfines and Peligrosos Gorriones, with their more artistic antics, fell out of favor. At the same time, groups like <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre.html" title="Massacre">Massacre</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Portuaria_1ff3.html" title="La Portuaria">La Portuaria</a> went into recording hiatuses and would not return until more favorable winds in the early to mid 2000s. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Brujos_10bc.html" title="Los Brujos">Los Brujos</a> disbanded in 1998 after eight years of solid productions, but it left a large void in the movement. One of the last <i>hurrahs</i> of new rock were rap-rockers Actitud Maria Marta, which had a year of fame in 1995. <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babas%C3%B3nicos.html" title="Babasónicos">Babasónicos</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todos_Tus_Muertos_9449.html" title="Todos Tus Muertos">Todos Tus Muertos</a>, and <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illya_Kuryaki_and_the_Valderramas_ffce.html" title="Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas">Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas</a> were some of the new rock bands that were able to maintain their level as the year 2000 approached.</p>
<p>Also, 1995 would see the last album by <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a>, their relaxed almost chillout-like <i><a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue%C3%B1o_Stereo_b031.html" title="Sueño Stereo">Sueño Stereo</a></i>, an album at times more electronic than rock preluding where <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustavo_Cerati_99c5.html" title="Gustavo Cerati">Gustavo Cerati</a>'s solo career would depart. Soda Stereo would go on a last grand tour through the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, selling out entire stadiums as they went.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[50]</a></sup> Their last concert in <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> in 1997 was released as a <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_%C3%9Altimo_Concierto_d4e3.html" title="El Último Concierto">double-album</a>, and over 70,000 people twice over packed <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Plate_6498.html" title="River Plate">River Plate</a> Stadium. The arguably greatest band in Argentine and Rock en Español history wrapped up the concert and their career with the live version of <i>"De Musica Ligera";</i>, whose last line reads <i>"... nada más queda"</i> (nothing else remains), repeating over and over. It was one of the most emotional and poignant moments in rock.</p>
<p>Conversely, "suburban"; rock was on the up. On the one hand were the 1980s bands that by the mid 90s approached the suburban rock sound: <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricio_Rey_y_sus_Redonditos_de_Ricota_48e4.html" title="Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota">Redonditos de Ricota</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divididos.html" title="Divididos">Divididos</a>, Las Pelotas. They were joined by two bands that would define suburban in the late 90s as well: <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Piojos_900a.html" title="Los Piojos">Los Piojos</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Renga_f6c7.html" title="La Renga">La Renga</a>. La Renga is also considered one of the <i>Rolinga</i> groups (followers of the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> blueprint) like <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Ratones_Paranoicos_e588.html" title="Los Ratones Paranoicos">Los Ratones Paranoicos</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viejas_Locas_fce4.html" title="Viejas Locas">Viejas Locas</a>, whose weighty followings would only grow larger.</p>
<p>Argentine youth began to musically and socially gravitate to either the suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (<i>rolinga</i> and <i>post-chabón</i> in suburban rock; <i>sonico, punk, dark</i> in the underground). Then there were the heavy metal followers, the large and getting larger indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbia.html" title="Cumbia">Cumbia</a> and Cumbia Villera movement which would explode in the new millennium. The pieces were in place for the current period of rock in Argentina.</p>

<p>The late 1990s charts were dominated by the success of bands like <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Piojos_900a.html" title="Los Piojos">Los Piojos</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Renga_f6c7.html" title="La Renga">La Renga</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divididos.html" title="Divididos">Divididos</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricio_Rey_y_sus_Redonditos_de_Ricota_48e4.html" title="Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota">Redonditos de Ricota</a>, Las Pelotas, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Ratones_Paranoicos_e588.html" title="Los Ratones Paranoicos">Los Ratones Paranoicos</a>, La Mancha de Rolando, Caballeros de la Quema, and many more suburban rock bands.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[51]</a></sup> They were joined by Uruguayans <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Vela_Puerca_d45d.html" title="La Vela Puerca">La Vela Puerca</a> in the style, giving rise to the term <i>"rioplantense"</i> rock (rock of the <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_la_Plata_189d.html" title="Rio de la Plata">Rio de la Plata</a> region), to group all of the similarly inclined outfits. Suburban rock has created many fine singles and albums, but critics argue many of the bands (specially second rate groups in the <i>rolinga</i> scene), simply repeated the same formula to sell albums. Another feature of suburban rock is that it tends to shun overseas success: whether this is a conscious attitude or a simple limitation of the genre is an ongoing debate.</p>
<p>On the other hand the likes of Divididos, Los Piojos, and Redonditos have transcended its constraints and become influential in Argentine rock, and popular on an international level. The better bands in the genre also feature an unusual versatility with non-rock styles like <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">tango</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk.html" title="Folk">folk</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_music.html" title="African music">African music</a>, Latin, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, and even North American <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">country music</a>, each with their own eclectic mixture. It would help elevate them from the legions of imitators in the crowded suburban scene. Divididos 6th album <i>"Narigon Del Siglo"</i> (2000) was one of the first great Argentine rock albums of the new decade; it was peppered with folk.</p>
<p>The underground was more under than usual in the late 90s, it was nonetheless extremely creative. A style that gained some mainstream exposure was <i>"rock sónico"</i> ("sonic" rock), influenced by the 80s "techno-pop" of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus_%28Argentine_band%29_41ab.html" title="Virus (Argentine band)">Virus</a> and early <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a> (and also <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britpop.html" title="Britpop">britpop</a>), through <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babas%C3%B3nicos.html" title="Babasónicos">Babasónicos</a> and Juana La Loca. The latter group found success with sonic rock in 1997's <i>Vida Modelo</i>. The former would increase their popularity with each new album, arriving at 2001's <i>Jessico</i>, which received international acclaim as one of the first truly outstanding albums of the new millennium.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[52]</a></sup> Other underground groups started making noise at this time: <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Otro_Yo_fc66.html" title="El Otro Yo">El Otro Yo</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catupecu_Machu_3a82.html" title="Catupecu Machu">Catupecu Machu</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santos_Inocentes_e02e.html" title="Santos Inocentes">Santos Inocentes</a>, leaders-to-be of the early 2000s <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_rock.html" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a> scene in Argentina.

Classic metalists <a href="../../../o/27/c/O%27Connor_b80e.html" title="O'Connor">O'Connor</a> in the underground would emerge by the early 2000s, along with exponents of <i>nu</i>-metal <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabezones.html" title="Cabezones">Cabezones</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carajo.html" title="Carajo">Carajo</a>. One of the most critically acclaimed bands of present is <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Natas_2016.html" title="Los Natas">Los Natas</a>. Originally a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoner_rock.html" title="Stoner rock">stoner rock</a> group, in subsequent albums the band has turned more experimental. Some have called this demiurgic style (infused with Argentine folk, psychedelia, and space rock) <i>"Patagonian doom"</i>, and this brand of metal has been ranked with the best heard in the new millennium.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[53]</a></sup> The band itself prefers to call it "free" rock.</p>
<p>In punk, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attaque_77.html" title="Attaque 77">Attaque 77</a> still went strong, <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fun_People_fb1a.html" title="Fun People">Fun People</a> did as well (including a European tour), until their disbanding in 2000. The punk underground of the late 90s was buzzing with new bands (Cadena Perpetua, Expulsados), many of them to guide the early 2000s melodic punk scene (<a href="../../../s/m/i/Smitten.html" title="Smitten">Smitten</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaila.html" title="Shaila">Shaila</a>).</p>
<p>In tropical or fusion rock, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bersuit_Vergarabat_1ebb.html" title="Bersuit Vergarabat">Bersuit Vergarabat</a> rose to the zenith of the genre. <i>Libertinaje</i> (1998) catapulted the band to the top, and to tours of the Americas and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The follow up <i>Hijos del Culo</i> (2000) also went double-platinum. Both albums display a dizzying range in style versatility.

<p>A highly talented and promising band was Karamelo Santo, another contribution of the city of <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mendoza%2C_Argentina_574e.html" title="Mendoza, Argentina">Mendoza</a> (also home of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Enanitos_Verdes_c327.html" title="Los Enanitos Verdes">Los Enanitos Verdes</a>). They featured a very refreshing mix of rock, punk, ska, afro-uruguayan, and cumbia rhythms that earned them critical praise in Argentina. They would spend most of the 2001-2004 period on extensive tours of Europe and the Americas.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[55]</a></sup> <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todos_Tus_Muertos_9449.html" title="Todos Tus Muertos">Todos Tus Muertos</a> would break up at the height of their popularity in 1999. Fidel Nadal kicked-off his hardcore <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rastafarian.html" title="Rastafarian">Rastafarian</a> career and veered towards <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbia_villera.html" title="Cumbia villera">cumbia villera</a>.</p>
<p>By the year 2000 the <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbia_villera.html" title="Cumbia villera">cumbia villera</a>, the preferred musical style in the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_miseria.html" title="Villa miseria">villa miseria</a> (slums) of Argentina's largest cities, had grown dramatically in following and in fact rivaled rock in overall popularity. Its lyrics can parallel those of U.S. rap (poverty, drugs and crime). The genre would increasingly crossover to tropical or fusion rock (as seen in Fidel Nadal, Bersuit, and Karamelo Santo), as well as with several suburban bands that were esteemed by fans of both cumbia villera and rock. Some even talked about a takeover during the height of the <i>villera</i> boom in 2001-2002. The reality is that <i>villera</i> did not take over rock. But it did arrive to stay as yet another fertile popular style of music in modern day Argentina, just as hip-hop created its place in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. But neither managed to sink rock, nor was it their intention to do so.</p>
<p>To a lesser extent <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance.html" title="Dance">dance</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronica.html" title="Electronica">electronica</a> music, which in Argentina have the largest scenes in Latin America, also influenced Argentine rock of the 2000s. A good example of this is the internationally prominent techno-pop act <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda%21.html" title="Miranda!">Miranda!</a>, a band that owes as much to current <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance.html" title="Dance">dance</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronica.html" title="Electronica">electronica</a> as the 80s techno-pop of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus_%28band%29.html" title="Virus (band)">Virus</a> and Los Encargados, electronic pioneers in Argentina.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_rock.html" title="Edit section: Current Trends">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current Trends</span></h3>
<p>As with any current, evolving musical movement, it is hard to define the state of the scene in question. Its final anthology will not be written until 10 to 20 years in the future. But in general terms, Argentine rock in the middle of the 2000s decade can be said to showcase the following trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>A continued commercial success of suburban and rolinga rock. In the early part of the current decade the so-called '2nd wave of suburban' crashed to the scene: Guasones, Jovenes Pordioseros, La 25, Cielo Razzo, and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callejeros.html" title="Callejeros">Callejeros</a>. Their fan base is somewhat younger than those of the 1st wave, and their music is derivative of the 1st but with a slightly pop, more teen oriented approach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The current punk scene in Argentina features no real mainstream bands (besides eternal punks <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attaque_77.html" title="Attaque 77">Attaque 77</a>), and a huge underground scene which has a healthy amount of talent. Bands worth mentioning include <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smitten.html" title="Smitten">Smitten</a>, perhaps the best melodic hardcore punk band today (somewhat confirmed by their growth across <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>); Cadena Perpetua with their well-crafted and tight songs; <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaila.html" title="Shaila">Shaila</a> who features many English lyric songs, unusual for Argentine rock; and veterans <a href="../../../2/_/m/2_Minutos_24a4.html" title="2 Minutos">2 Minutos</a> who soldier on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Heavy Metal at mid decade features a predominance of nu-metal and doom metal groups; <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carajo.html" title="Carajo">Carajo</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabezones.html" title="Cabezones">Cabezones</a> and a recharged <a href="../../../a/2E/n/A.N.I.M.A.L._c170.html" title="A.N.I.M.A.L.">A.N.I.M.A.L.</a> in the former (and all having toured extensively overseas), internationally acclaimed doomsters <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Natas_2016.html" title="Los Natas">Los Natas</a>, and <a href="../../../l/%C3%B6/r/L%C3%B6rihen.html" title="Lörihen">Lörihen</a> for the latter. <a href="../../../o/27/c/O%27Connor_b80e.html" title="O'Connor">O'Connor</a> is the most prominent of the classic metal revivalists.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In fusion or tropical rock <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bersuit_Vergarabat_1ebb.html" title="Bersuit Vergarabat">Bersuit Vergarabat</a> still command legions. Dancing Mood is the ska representative on the mainstream, and Nonpalidece is the current reggae-rock band in vogue. Other current bands include Karamelo Santo, Los Calzones, La Mosca, and Kapanga. Ex-<a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Fabulosos_Cadillacs_b12b.html" title="Los Fabulosos Cadillacs">Los Fabulosos Cadillacs</a> Vicentico and ex-<a href="../../../t/o/d/Todos_Tus_Muertos_9449.html" title="Todos Tus Muertos">Todos Tus Muertos</a> Fidel Nadal are both well embarked in their solo careers with fusion rock.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In alternative, <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Otro_Yo_fc66.html" title="El Otro Yo">El Otro Yo</a> continue their impressive streak of great albums and fresh sounding music. <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catupecu_Machu_3a82.html" title="Catupecu Machu">Catupecu Machu</a>'s slightly threatening rock has made them a mainstream alternative band, and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babas%C3%B3nicos.html" title="Babasónicos">Babasónicos</a> are arguably the most internationally popular Argentine band today. <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Portuaria_1ff3.html" title="La Portuaria">La Portuaria</a>, after a late 90s hiatus in a hostile musical climate, returned in the early 2000s as alternative once again resurfaced in Argentina.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A renovated indie scene with great bands like Jaime Sin Tierra, which created lush beautiful rock before disbanding in 2001, and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interama.html" title="Interama">Interama</a> and their left-of-the-dial melodies. <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entre_Rios_73bf.html" title="Entre Rios">Entre Rios</a>'s elegant electro lounge with female vocals is one of the best kept secrets in Argentina's indie scene. The indie scene also has a neo-symphonic revival scene with the likes of <a href="../../../p/e/z/Pez.html" title="Pez">Pez</a> and A-Tirador Laser, bands which are reviving the sound of later 70s Argentine rock with an updated resonance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The start of the 2nd generation of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustavo_Cerati_99c5.html" title="Gustavo Cerati">Gustavo Cerati</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indio_Solari_6854.html" title="Indio Solari">Indio Solari</a>, Vicentico, Fidel Nadal, etc. Ex-<a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_Stereo_2867.html" title="Soda Stereo">Soda Stereo</a> Cerati spent most of the early part of the decade in the electronic side of music. In 2006 he returned with his first album of all new music since 2002 (<i>Ahi Vamos</i>) where rock was front and center, albeit a more mature rock of a man in the middle age of his life. Ex-<a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricio_Rey_y_sus_Redonditos_de_Ricota_48e4.html" title="Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota">Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota</a> Solari's debut album <i>El tesoro de los Inocentes</i> was seen as the best of 2004. Vicentico and his homonymous debut sold well, but his second effort suffered the sophomore slump. He has just released his third solo album, <i>Los Pájaros</i>. Skay Beillinson, also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his first two solo efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several current bands that are broadly tagged under suburban but are not easy to categorize: <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbol.html" title="Arbol">Arbol</a> is arguably the most talented of them: their albums can go from hardcore to balladry, and from hard rock to folk and reggae. Los Tipitos and <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanos.html" title="Villanos">Villanos</a> present a more melodic style of suburban. Los Tipitos show a tendency to mature pop-rock; <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanos.html" title="Villanos">Villanos</a>'s sound is cheery and shows more buoyancy, and at times slides towards the sound of Argentine "sonic" rock with a dash of punk. And <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intoxicados.html" title="Intoxicados">Intoxicados</a> has been burning the rock charts throughout 2006, their latest effort <i>Otro Dia en en Planeta Tierra</i> (2005) digging hit after charting hit. A diverse album stylistically with lyrics whose content seem not to match the music, it features the suburban blueprint sound but it is used more as a foundation than a showcase.</p>
