<dd>The GDP per capita reported in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">Economy of Argentina</a> seems ridiculously high, but maybe that's because it's measured in <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing_power_parity.html" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">de la plata / del plata</span></h3>
<p>The first paragraph talks about "Sierra del Plata", which is grammatically incorrect Spanish. I assume it is meant to be either "Sierra de la Plata" or "Sierra de Plata". Does anyone know the correct phrase? —<a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> 21:44, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but "Sierra del Plata" might be correct Spanish. See, for example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar_del_Plata_9ad5.html" title="Mar del Plata">Mar del Plata</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The word "del" is a conjuntion of two words: "de"(of) and "el"(the) singular article masculine (the femenine is "la"), but "Sierra del Plata" is grammatically correct because it talks about the river called "rio de la Plata" and "rio" is masculine, then:</p>
<p>Sierra del rio de la Plata = Sierra del Plata</p>
<p>Mar del rio de la Plata = Mar del Plata</p>
<p>When someone said "el Plata", is talking about the river and not about the silver.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Nacion Argentina / Republica Argentina</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.constitution.org/cons/argentin.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.constitution.org/cons/argentin.htm" rel="nofollow">Argentine constitution of 1994</a> makes it clear that the official name of the country is <b>Nacion Argentina</b>, not <b>Republica Agentina</b>. This section seems to my limited Spanish to make this point:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Articulo 35o.- Las denominaciones adoptadas sucesivamente desde 1810 hasta el presente, a saber: Provincias Unidas del Rio de la Plata; Republica Argentina, Confederacion Argentina, seran en adelante nombres oficiales indistintamente para la designacion del Gobierno y territorio de las provincias, empleandose las palabras "Nacion Argentina" en la formacion y sancion de las leyes.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:29, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The official name of Argentina is still República Argentina, and it shows in said constitutional article. The mentioned constitutional article says that <i>República Argentina</i> is the official style of the country, and <i>Nación Argentina</i> will be the name of the National Government. Thus, <b>República Argentina</b> is still perfectly valid.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Article 35- The adopted denominations succesively adopted since 1810 to the present, are the following: United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata; Argentine Republic, Argentine Confederation, will be from now on the the official names indistinctively for the designation of the Government and the territory, the words "Argentine Nation" being used in the formation and sanction of the laws.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>A 1862 law chose the name "República Argentina" from among the mentioned official names in art.35, to be the one to be officially used since. However, the term "Nación Argentina" is still use in that cases mentioned by the constitution: the sanction of laws, the official denominations of the President and the Congress (Presidente de la Nación Argentina and Congreso de la Nación Argentina), and so on.--<a href="../../../j/f/a/User%7EJfa_d88e.html" title="User:Jfa">Jfa</a> 19:07, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Capital Federal / Distrito Federal</span></h3>
<p>"1 federal district (formerly known as capital federal)". No one calls it "distrito federal", and "capital federal" is used by nearly everyone to call it. Also, it is in fact named capital federal on official documents, never DF.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
The right name for Buenos Aires since the 1994 constitution reform, is ciudad autónoma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous city of Buenos Aires). Everybody keeps refering to it as Capital Federal. we never called it as districto federal. The constitution states that the city of Buenos Aires will be declared the federal district,therefore the capital of the country. That's why we refer to it as capital federal.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Buenos Aires Province / Province of Buenos Aires</span></h3>
<p>OK, Ahoerstemeier. I understood your changes, because the page is in english, but be more consistent. You wrote "Mendoza Province", and forgot to put "Entre Ríos Province". Also wrote ", Argentina" behind the name of the province just in two provinces tooltips. And I think that is no necesary to put the City word behind Buenos Aires or the Province word behind Buenos Aires, in the list. Do not you think that?</p>
<p>I have a few questions:</p>
<p>- How is the right form? "Buenos Aires province" or "Province of Buenos Aires"? - Could be the provinces names inside a table, with complementary information like population and provinces's capital?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, and excuse my horrible english.</p>
<p><br />
The correct form is Province of Buenos Aires. By the way, it makes no difference if it is "Republica Argentina" or, "Nacion Argentina", we (people from Argentina), call it both ways.</p>

<p>I removed the phrase "without legal basis" from the Template:Argentina infobox.

<p>Hi <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> - many thanks for your corrections &amp; comments, much appreciated.</p>
<p>I will need to write to Whitakers Almanack who still (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>) state the old currency.</p>
<p>I have amended the Head of Government part to make it consistent with other sovereign state pages, whilst incorporating the current specific situation in Argentina. Hope it meets with your (and everyone else's) approval.</p>

<dd>Countries in which their president is both head of state and head of government, display it in a single "President" entry. (<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> for example. Seems a "New World" government scheme). Then again is a new layout, I don't know. If I can make it clearer to you, the Cabinet Chief is a designated by the President, and his/her main function is to check that Ministers (of Foreing Affairs, Education, etc, etc) can work consistently as a block, and that they work along the President's line of thought. In Argentina, it's widely regarded as a fuse/buffer between the Cabinet of Ministers and the President. I got to go, I'll check things up later. Thanks for all the good work. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 08:40, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

He doesn't call for pressure on De la Rúa to make him resign without offering alternatives. He could've called for a march himself, or told De la Rúa to resign in dire terms, or whatever, but he at least pretended to be a responsible political leader and didn't encourage any violent action to force the president's resignation.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cone-shaped??</span></h2>
<p>Okay, first of all, why does Argentina need to be described as "cone-shaped"? How many other country articles start by describing the shape of the country in geometrical terms?</p>
<p>Secondly, how can it be "cone-shaped" at all? A cone is a three-dimensional shape caused by rotating a triangle around one of its verticals. (My geometrical terminology may not be precise, but hopefully you get the idea.) For a country to be cone-shaped, it should basically look like a gigantic volcanic island. Perhaps Argentina does look <i>slightly</i> like a cone lying on its side, but you know what you get when you lay a cone on its side? You get a <i>triangle</i>.</p>
<p>And thirdly, it's not triangular. Its borders are normal geographic ones, which is to say not straight lines. I could see calling <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> rectangular, because their borders were arbitrarily fixed as straight lines, but Argentina's are based on mountains and river valleys and coastlines, and are anything but straight.</p>
<p>If this is a mistranslation of some common Spanish description used for the country, then I will relent, but otherwise that unhelpful phrase will be removed. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfvaen_e012.html" title="User:Alfvaen">Alfvaen</a> 05:32, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

About Menem beeing catholic, I can't assure that was for a <i>presidential</i> mather, I don't know when he passed to catholics, but I think it was quite early in his career, but I'm sure it was for a political fact, in a strong catholic province you will not climb in politics if you're not catholic.<a href="../../../q/s/e/User%7EQsebas_24e8.html" title="User:Qsebas">Qsebas</a> 17:03, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I does not mean support, especially since up until 1994 the constitution required the president to be Roman Catholic. That shows identifying with the religion, not paying for it. Even in the military you "swear upon" the flag. The fact that the government subsidizes the church is a very different and real thing, granted, but it's not a constitutional mandate, especially since there are also subsidies to other religions (i.e.: Moslem Mosque in Palermo).

<p>I've just edited out some inaccurate compliments on Argentina's economy, and I'm trying to phrase it better. The economy section (even now) ends up saying that basically Menem and De la Rúa did everything OK, except for the debt, and that's why the recovery after the crisis has been so fast. This is plainly not the case: in 2002 the local industry was practically destroyed, and it still is, mostly. The things that are doing well in Argentina are the services and the primary sector (basically we're about to get buried in transgenic soy), with some large industrial companies exporting low-level goods. Energy needs will not be met this year (even if Bolivia finally decides to send some natural gas over here, as planned), there's a generation of young people who grew up in the 1990s and will never get a job (because they lack the minimum education or skills), and Argentina effectively lost 12 years of industrial development, so that if you want to manufacture anything, you will surely have to compete with Brazil and/or China (i. e. you already lost). So a critical part of Argentina's economy was fundamentally <i>un</i>sound, and continues to be, though maybe less so. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<dd>I seriously think the Economy section is taking over the hole article, what seams to me to be absolutely wrong. This section should contain some information of the country's economical activities (grain, catle, etc), a comment on the crisis of the beggining of the century, and something about the ver lasting debt.

<dd>Yes and no. During <a href="../../../r/a/%C3%BA/Ra%C3%BAl_Alfons%C3%ADn_fdab.html" title="Raúl Alfonsín">Raúl Alfonsín</a>'s term, it was proposed that the Federal Capital be moved to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viedma.html" title="Viedma">Viedma</a>, but the proposal failed. The idea was not without advantages, but it would have had a ridiculous cost and the logistics alone would have been monumental work. Argentina likes to produce such proposals from time to time (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Menem_3bee.html" title="Carlos Menem">Carlos Menem</a> once proposed an artificial island in front of Buenos Aires, as well as a launch platform for "stratospheric planes"). The idea of moving the capital should be mentioned somewhere. Many believe that Buenos Aires has an exceedingly dominant position in many ways (demographically, economically, culturally) and that moving at least the political/administrative center of the country elsewhere would help correct the imbalance. Recently a number of people in <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosario.html" title="Rosario">Rosario</a> proposed moving the national Legislature there (I don't know what became of that project, but it was supported by the governor of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Fe_Province_215c.html" title="Santa Fe Province">Santa Fe Province</a>, the major of Rosario, and some local media and business groups). --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

It wasn´t a crazy idea that end in nothing: government bought tracts of land in the area, and the project of the city was complete: the hiperinflation crisis of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> stopped everything and the law was finally killed by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Menem_3bee.html" title="Carlos Menem">Carlos Menem</a>. The project (of wich I happens to have printed versions of part of it) calculated a 2000 population of 250.000. The idea of bringing Congress to Rosario is against the constitution: you have to move the three powers together, if Congress goes to Rosario, so have to go the executive and the Supreme Court (y yo no quiero ese puterío en Rosario).

<dd>I reverted your edit and then noticed these two last paragraphs. I was fairly sure that the proposal had failed, since nobody never heard of it again. I still think it was a ridiculous idea at the time, probably made up in order to steal funds. Seriously thought-out projects, with plans and all, are not necessarily legitimate. Believe me.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Southern Border??</span></h2>
<p>I saw a lot of back and forth regarding Argentina's southern border. I agree that The South Pole/Antarctica shouldn't be mentioned but technically, Argentina borders with Chile in the south as well, let us not forger that the 1985 Beagle Treaty gave Chile sovereignity over the three Islands (Picton, Lennox, Navarino) south of Ushuaia, so if we get really anal, Chile lies also to the south, right?

<dd>I think we should keep it as a claim but someway to let everyone know that it isn't recognised (As we shouldn't delete the claim to the Falkland Islands). I wrote it and dont care if you delete it, if you have a reason.</dd>

<dd>I think it's not necessary to mark a south border as there's no country physically limiting with Argentina as they are in al the other directions. If something is to be stated, then it's water. Or do you say that at the east it limits with the Malvinas?</dd>

<dd>The southern limit of Santa Cruz borders with Chile for roughly 200 kms. That's plenty for me to consider Chile being into the south besides west imho. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 4 July 2005 08:28 (UTC)

<dd>Mariano, I said south besides west. So the statement would be like "borders to the west and south with Chile" or something like that. And I didn't say it wasn't confusing, but the article right now mentions the Drake Passage, which could make you think that the Drake Passage is a country, I find that far more confusing (and imho, incorrect. i'd say it coasts the Atlantic Ocean, not border). And no, I wouldn't say Uruguay is to the north as there's the Rio de la Plata in the middle, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Cruz_Province%2C_Argentina_2e81.html" title="Santa Cruz Province, Argentina">Santa Cruz</a> borders with Chile with regular land border (and the article on the province states that it borders with chile to the west and south). So I'd say that if we mention an Argentine southern border, that's Chile or the Atlantic Ocean (or more accurately, both). But clearly not the Drake Passage. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 6 July 2005 04:09 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Forgot to mention. Sebastiankessel, the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Ocean_a062.html" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> (or Antarctic) starts on the parallel 60, even considering the Mar Argentino, you can see on Image:Mapa_Político_Argentina.png that it doesn't reach the parallel. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 6 July 2005 04:15 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Spiceman, I believe the issue of which body of water it is to be rather anecdotal. I side with Mariano here in the fact that Chile is commonly viewed as a westerly neighbor, and I would cite either the Drake Passage or the Atlantic Ocean as the southern border. Since Argentina has no country directly to its south, mentioning a body of water as a border is valid. Now, to the question of which body of water to use, I'd go for the Drake Passage. Since it connects the Atlantic to the Pacific it is probably clearer than just mentioning the Atlantic Ocean, that most people intuitively picture east, rather than south.

<dd>I insist, countries border with countries not oceans. Imho if mentioning a southern border that's Chile. Or not mention a southern border at all, if you think that's confusing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Argentine, Argentinian and Argentinean</span></h2>
<p>I think it would be wise to standarize the use of these words. The problem rises not in the articles (redirections can be done) but with the Categories, (E.g. Category:Argentinian Telenovela, Category:Argentine sport).</p>
<p>I know, we could also use <i>Telenovela of Argentina</i> and <i>Sport from Argentina</i>, but that would go against the standard in use (<a href="../../../s/p/o/Category%7ESports_by_country_0776.html" title="Category:Sports by country">Category:Sports by country</a>, Category:Telenovela).</p>
<p>Personaly, I prefer british use of Argentine, specially when used as a adjective. For the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentilic.html" title="Gentilic">gentilic</a> I also use Argentine, but Argentinian doesn't sound <b>that</b> bad. Argentinean (US writting) seams just awful.

<p>Personally, I think that <i>Argentine</i> should be use for all things argentine (i.e. Argentine Sport, Argentine Television, &amp;c.), and <i>Argentinian</i> (not Argentinean that sounds terribly awful) for people from Argentina (i.e., Fulano de Tal is an Argentinian writer). Argentine is an adjective (as is Argentina in spanish, that´s why the correct use is <i>la</i> Argentina, literary, the Argentine) and Argentinian is a gentilic adjective, in the standard english use: Chile Chilean, Russia Russian, Romania Romanian, &amp;c. --<a href="../../../j/f/a/User%7EJfa_d88e.html" title="User:Jfa">Jfa</a> 8 July 2005 14:02 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here in the US <i>Argentinian</i> and <i>Argentinean</i> are used interchangeably, but I have the understanding that in the UK <i>Argentine</i> is the preferred term. I honestly couldn't care less as long as the sentence is clear but I think that unfortunately this is one of the instances where British and American English differ.

<p>Here in Argentina ,when we must talk about us in english we use "argentinian". It sounds better to me but i think we should let the article as it is now and change only future edits. I have never seen "argentinean" before but if the "e" is pronunced as in "get", it is realy horrible. - <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentino_e642.html" title="User:Argentino">Argentino</a> 8 July 2005 17:57 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, the pronunciation changes are minimal, if any. On the other hand, Argentino, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but when I was in high school (in Argentina, of course) I learned <i>Argentine</i>, not anything else. I don't want to take merit of what you say, it just goes to show that there is no consensus formed. Furthermore, after having lived in Argentina until my 24th birthday (I'm 28 now) if there's something I know is that I can barely trust <i>Argentinos</i> to speak proper spanish, much less proper english (<i>Me entendé?</i>).&#160;:)&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> 9 July 2005 01:05 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFAIK "Argentine" is the adjective, and "Argentinian" is the noun. That's what I'm using consistently whenever I write. "Argentine" sounds terrible to me but seems to be common use.

<p>Argentina doesn't claims the Malvinas as part of Antarctica, but as part of the South Atlantic Islands. The Argentine Antarctica, the South Atlantic Islands and the Argentine part of Tierra del Fuego form together the province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and South Atlantic Islands, but that is another issue.</p>
<p>Also, the reasons given for Argentine claims over the Malvinas (and South Atlantic Islands) and the Argentine Antarctica are quite different: while the first ones are based on territorial and historical reasons (mainly), the second one are based on mere occupation and proximity (that is NOT the same).</p>
