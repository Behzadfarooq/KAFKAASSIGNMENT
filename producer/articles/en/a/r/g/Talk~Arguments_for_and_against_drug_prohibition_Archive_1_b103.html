<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></h2>
<p>This entry has been stitched together from material from the former <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_legalization.html" title="Drug legalization">Drug legalization</a> entry (which was merged into <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Drugs_b75e.html" title="War on Drugs">War on Drugs</a>, now called <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition_%28drugs%29.html" title="Prohibition (drugs)">Prohibition (drugs)</a>), and from the former <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Drugs_b75e.html" title="War on Drugs">War on Drugs</a> entry itself. The aim was to move the bulk of argumentative, opioniative material out of the Prohibition (drugs) entry. The first set of material is an extensive argument for the legalization of drugs. A corresponding section putting forth the argument for prohibition does not yet exist. This is why I've flagged the article as non-NPOV. See also the discussion that took place on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Talk%7EProhibition_%28drugs%29_93a3.html" title="Talk:Prohibition (drugs)">Talk:Prohibition (drugs)</a> before I split the material off. The second set of material is point-counterpoint stuff, so it should give a fairly balanced view, albeit one not well-suited for an encyclopedia but perhaps a necessary evil for such a complex and controversial issue. Once a decent section on <i>Aruguments for prohibition</i> has been contributed, the article should be moved out of NPOV dispute and in to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_controversial_issues_fbb2.html" title="Wikipedia:List of controversial issues">Wikipedia:List_of_controversial_issues</a>. <a href="../../../r/k/u/User%7ERkundalini_d2c2.html" title="User:Rkundalini">Rkundalini</a> 02:55, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually drugs do get the last word. Its up to us to alter our conscienceness or not.</p>
<p>You know what I think is funny? How anything that doesn't fit Fox News's definition of "Fair and Balanced" is accused of being full of spin. What I mean by this is that often times giving each side of an issue equal support is not actually fair. It would be like a baseball umpire keeping the game tied on purpose even though one team is far outperforming the other. Maybe proponents of drug legalization have the truth on their side on this one. There shouldn't be an obligation to fill half the page with arguments from one side if they aren't based in reality. <a href="../../../t/o/b/Toby_Ziegler_7389.html" title="Toby Ziegler">Toby Ziegler</a> 04:20, March 15, 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is ludicrously unbalanced. Four times as much space is given to arguments for legalization as against. Furthermore, the arguments against legalization are all neutralized by a "counter-point", whereas the arguments against legalization, many of which are poorly written, get no counter-point.</p>
<p>That the arguments against legalization may actually be rather strong is not something that can be considered by the reading audience since any attempts to add counter-points to the legalization points are instantly deleted by Diza, or at least were today.</p>
<p>Thus, we are left with a supposedly neutral article which espouses a number of manifestly hilarious concepts. For instance, the statement that drug addicts have no control over their actions and are involuntarily driven to commit criminal acts. Who here seriously believes human beings are forced by nature to take drugs, become addicts, and commit crimes? Anyone?</p>
<p>Although the For prohibition argument goes first it is rather short and desperately needs expansion. The majority of the world's nations (everyone except the Netherlands) must have a reason more substantive than the few words currently in the wiki for their stance on drugs. What are those reasons? Personally I am against prohibition so I struggle to think of reasons for but there must some and they must be good. Any For people have some good material? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewC_d748.html" title="User:AndrewC">AndrewC</a> 08:57, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If there are good reasons for the nations to ban drugs, then it is much harder to back up such claims with citations. It seems to me that much of drug prohibition has been based on arguements that are not rooted in fact. It is very possible that a contreversial case can end up being one sided after research and remain NPOV. If one looks at the common arguements for prohibition one finds that many of them do no meet wikipedia's criteria. However this is not to say the section cannot be increased, surely the health and religous section can be filled out. Or you can find new arguements that are rooted in fact. Thanks for the help, such a topic is very hard to remain NPOV with. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 12:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The War on Drugs may not encourage drug use directly, but it makes selling drugs highly profitable, and thereby creates a motive for drug dealers to encourage use of drugs. It also indirectly glorifies drugs by making them a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbidden_fruit.html" title="Forbidden fruit">forbidden fruit</a>. The best method of reducing the use of drugs like <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> is the same one employed to reduce use of drugs like <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> -- that is to ban promotion of the drug, discourage its use without prohibiting it completely, and prohibit use of those drugs in as many public places as possible.</dd>
<dd>I don't see the relevance to <i>terror</i> or <i>poverty</i>. Drug use (or more specifically, the desire to alter ones own consciousness) is a natural animal drive, like hunger, thirst and sex. The same cannot be said about terrorism or poverty -- the bulk of the population do not desire to be impoverished, nor to terrorize others. On the other hand, a small number of people cannot seem to help themselves in their desire to keep others under their thumb, and will certainly resort to using their power to keep others as powerless as possible through impoverishment, fear mongering, and of course through creation of superfluous laws and restrictions. Of note, neither the War on Terror nor the War on Poverty has done all that much to combat their respective evils... so it's a moot point. Poverty and Terrorism seem to be on the rise -- so maybe these wars do encourage what they fight against. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 22:02, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed but you will need to be very careful. It is long-standing content on a controversial issue. Probably the input of some people involved in wikipedia conflict resolution would be good here but here's my thoughts anyway: I like your suggestion from the WikiProject:Drugs talk page of writing down every single point and re-organising them, in terms of removing repetition and giving a better organisational structure. You'd just have to be sure you don't try to overly summarize or eliminate things that seem irrelevant or you might upset some people. I'd suggest doing a two step process:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>1) re-arrange the existing points into a more coherent structure without changing their wording much or at all--- just re-order them and put in sub-sections.</li>
<li>2) delete/merge duplicated/similar points.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There should be a waiting period between 1 and 2 to allow people to comment / react and to make it clear where to find any points you delete that they may wish to reinstate. <a href="../../../r/k/u/User%7ERkundalini_d2c2.html" title="User:Rkundalini">Rkundalini</a> 02:08, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm Totally agreed with above. Ok, I go some headers up, but it's pretty roughly categorized. We should wait for some more points/counterpoints, then condense all those points and convert it all into paragraph form.

<p>I've created a new category for the point-counterpoint under the 'against prohibition', "Hampers Legitimate Medical Research &amp; Treatment", potentially tying in the difficulties in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harm_reduction.html" title="Harm reduction">harm reduction</a> (how should we go about including this?), the section re: methadone formerly under misc, etc. There are probably a few threads in other sections that could get moved there and possibly culled. However, I *really* don't want to contribute to the bloat in this point-counterpoint.

<p>Outsider opinion, as I just ran into this page: this section could really do with a big refactoring into paragraph-style. (Which, yes, I would be willing to do, in the name of putting my money where my mouth is, but not against consensus.) The point-counterpoint has its virtues, but it doesn't read well, and I think a well-written prose style could capture the back-and-forth as well. Or if the sharp contrast is desired, perhaps table format? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 20:43, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point-counterpoint bullet points is perhaps the worst possible arrangement a page like this could have, as it strongly encourages drive-by-editors helpfully adding their own thoughts on the issue without attributing them or respecting the organization of the page. At the very least, the P-Cp section shouldn't be divided into two sections that more or less replicate each other. For instance, "Immoral" and "Subjective and Unfair" basically go over the same points. Ideally, however, the whole thing would be dropped and the (preferably attributed) arguments converted into paragraphs. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 15:21, 2005 August 2 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to add another voice of support for this, I agree the point-counterpoint section needs to be reworked. It's difficult to read, and (to me) it doesn't at all seem to fit in an encyclopedia article. It reads almost like bickering...which I'm sure is not the intent. This style of writing lends an air of competition to the article, as opposed to a presentation of the views of the two sides. The article isn't a place to argue, it's a place to present clear and concise ideas.Pkeck 05:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just read more of this section, and it doesn't even remotely read like an article. Some of the sections are written like this whole thing is a joke (e.g., Attempting suicide should be legal as well. Successful suicide should earn the death penalty, however.) This section should either be completely rewritten or completely moved to the talk page. It looks exactly like something on a talk page, but it doesn't really feel like it fits in an encyclopedia article. Pkeck 05:24, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you and would love to see it disappear. However it has been a necessary evil. The history of the situation is that there used to be a single article called <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Drugs_b75e.html" title="War on Drugs">War on Drugs</a>, which had a bit of vaguely article-like background, which was frequently subject to POV interjections, and it also had this ridiculous long point counterpoint. If I recall correctly there were edit wars involving moving that material back and forth between the article and its talk page. To remedy this I (then known as Rkundalini) moved all of the argumentative material and the point counterpoint stuff to the present location, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arguments_for_and_against_drug_prohibition.html" title="Arguments for and against drug prohibition">Arguments for and against drug prohibition</a>, and tweaked the original page to make it less US-biased, thereby also changing its name to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition_%28drugs%29.html" title="Prohibition (drugs)">Prohibition (drugs)</a>. An effort was made, which has largely succeeded, to keep that article NPOV and encyclopedic in tone-- only a couple of sentences of material on the pros and cons of prohibition have been allowed in that article. Now, I agree with you that the argumentative material actually has no place in an encyclopedia, but at the time it would not have been feasible to remove it -- someone would have simply put it back in. At least this way it was shunted off to a different spot where sensible people could ignore it. I fear any effort to remove the material now might encounter the same problems -- reversion, and potentially contamination of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition_%28drugs%29.html" title="Prohibition (drugs)">Prohibition (drugs)</a> ... but maybe I'm wrong and you're right. Would you envisage getting rid of the whole of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arguments_for_and_against_drug_prohibition.html" title="Arguments for and against drug prohibition">Arguments for and against drug prohibition</a>, or just the point-counterpoint? (By the way, the current US-specific <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Drugs_b75e.html" title="War on Drugs">War on Drugs</a> entry was made well after all of the above changes, and appears to be getting into the same old POV/argument problems as we had with the old entry of that name...

<dd>If it's just going to get put back in, that creates a bit of a problem. The problem I have with this section is best summed up in the first point-counterpoint section, "Immoral." The first point mentions drugs, and then there are <i>six</i> more points before you hear about them again. It's just bickering about how morals are different from person to person. These six points could be either replaced with a link to the article on morals, or replaced with a sentence to the effect of, "Morals vary from person to person and culture to culture; therefore, it's determine what qualifies as 'moral' and what qualifies as 'immoral.'" Everyone knows that different people have different morals, and I really don't think that this article is the place to debate that.</dd>

<dd>The whole point-counterpoint section just rambles on and on as if it's going to come to some resolution, but it misses the point entirely--there is no resolution. Some people think drugs are moral, some people don't. Some people think they should be legalized, some don't. And there is no solution to this--the only thing we can do is present the arguments on each side in a clear concise way and have people decide their own opinion based upon the information. It isn't the job of this article (or any encyclopedia article) to rally people to one side or another. It's the job of the article to present information, and a point-counterpoint style by its very nature has a feeling of competition where one side is trying to "win." I vote to delete it entirely, or at least condense it down to a few paragraphs for each side at most...but like I said, if it's just going to be put back in, that might be a problem.:) Pkeck 02:51, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I might interject, I believe that the inherent problem here is that the Wikipedia is being used for a purpose for which the wiki tool was not designed. A proper "encyclopedic" entry would contain, similar to the top section, an entry for each point for and against, each followed by the opposition's reasoning behind dismissing the point, and that would be the end of it. If you're looking to do the point-counterpoint thing you need a different tool, where each point is stated, evidence is presented for and against each point, and then each piece of evidence and the top level point are examined recursively. A wiki won't do that because its format is linear instead of branched. If you want to do the branched thing then you need to use a tool like the <a href="http://www.consensusengine.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.consensusengine.org/" rel="nofollow">"Consensus Engine"</a>. On the other hand this has been a useful brainstorming exercise.</p>
<p>If anyone is in the process of boiling down the arguments, I would be happy to help. I'm pretty pernicious at point out logic flaws. -- <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> 23:54, 13 Dec 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the following because, most importantly, it is not an argument, it is a series of rhetorical questions. Presumably, they are meant to imply something, but encyclopedia articles do not imply, they state facts. In addition, I can't possibly imagine the logic behind this being an argument for drug prohibition. The War on Drugs is different from the War on Terror and the War on Poverty; one is a mostly legal and partially military solution to a problem revolving around the creation and distribution of certain plant materials and other chemicals, one is a mostly military and partly legal solution to a problem revolving around idealogy, and the last is a cultural and legal solution to an economic problem. In addition, I don't think any of the three wars have had much success, so the implication is false (and would be irrelevant even if it were true). Just because a couple phrases begin with the same two words doesn't mean the same ideas apply. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 17:31, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From point-counterpoint, re: "Legalization means shutting down the FDA", I removed the counter-point "The FDA should have been shut down in the first place." It was an orphan, opinion-only statement regarding the FDA that wasn't directly related to the debate. Any objections? Also, that whole thread seems to be leaning towards 'flamebait' "legalizing drugs means shutting down the FDA" -- perhaps that thread should be cleaned up, and a more reasonable discussion started in its place, such as "legalizing potentially harmfull drugs with not clear medical benifit seriosuly challenges the purpose of the fda" or something somewhat less inflamitory?--<a href="../../../o/v/e/User%7EOverand_6955.html" title="User:Overand">Overand</a> 07:16, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Amoral Section</span></h2>
<p>I edited the amoral section, basically condensing the counterpoints to morality being subjective, and the previous author's point of the contradiction in advocating drug prohibition but not alcohol, tobacco, or others.</p>
<p>Going through this entire article, it seems <i>COMPLETELY</i> slanted towards the drug legalization side. And many of the arguments are fallacious and branch into other topics (Both the Counterpoint For and Counterpoint Against seem to advocate legalization). I think the arguments really need to be reorganized...</p>
<p>Particularly, I think all of the arguments that keey stating "There is nothing that shows prohibition has limited drug use." need to be eliminated. It is fallacious in that there is nothing to compare prohibition to, because the United States has had a prohibition policy for a long time. Thus, one can't really say that drug use has been on the rise, and automatically state that prohibition has failed to curb drug use, because there are a LOT of other factors involved to single out prohibition policy as the single one, and there is no reference point to tell where drug use levels would be if we DIDN't have prohibition.</p>
<p>But, I'm just a newbie here at wikipedia, and I don't want to do anything outside of my jurisdiction. What do you guys think?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the solution is really to attribute opinions to those who hold them. If the DEA claims that drug use will make you rape your mother and NORML claims DEA agents routinely rape your mother, we should coument those arguments, even if they're silly. This would apply, for example, to the bits about drug prohibition not decreasing drug use -- Wikipedia shouldn't endorse certain arguments as valid and others as invalid, but rather explain who believes what. Similarly, if no one actually claims that imprisoning a large portion of the population is inherently detrimental to democracy, then that argument should be removed even if it is logical. Basically, logic is not relevant, as Wikipedia documents illogical views and does not make up logical ones. This would, of course, require rewriting the whole article, more or less, but that's what should be done. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 23:05, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In America it started with Opium to control the Chinese, Cocaine and Heroin to control the black people, especially the black jazz musicians, "marihuana" to control the Mexican immigrants, LSD to control the hippies, MDMA to control the ravers, and it's very likely that the alcohol Prohibition of the 1920s had something to do with controlling Italian and Portuguese (maybe even Irish, French and German) immigrants... but I haven't checked that out yet. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 01:51, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone have any links to sources that show that "current drug laws are enforced in such a way as to penalize African-Americans more harshly and more often than other ethnic groups, and to penalize the poor of all races more harshly and more often than the middle and upper classes," <b>and</b> that this is the intent of the law? This seems highly speculative. It'd be accurate to say that some drugs are more highly punished than others, and then to say that some drugs are used more heavily by some demographics. But to imply (or flat out say) that "Nearly every drug was outlawed with intent of controlling a certain group of people" is awful inflammatory. Every law of every kind was brought about to control people, or were they not? Crossing guards are there to control people, but we wouldn't say that crossing guards are there to control children and deprive them of their freedom to run in traffic, and it would be misleading for me to represent crossing guards in that way. Maybe we could reword the text in the article and move all of the speculation on the intents on the laws elsewhere...unless someone has <b>proof</b> somewhere about the governments intention.

<dd>There exists definitive evidence that racial prejudice is exercised in the enforcement of drug laws. Our population is between 15-18% black. According to the statistics annually put out by SAMSA and Monitoring the Future, blacks have a lower rate of drug use than whites. Based on nationally compiled arrest records, 35% of all drug arrests are for blacks. Around 50% of those cases that go to court are black. Roughly 90% of those who are given prison time are black.</dd>

<dd>I would agree that there is absolutely no evidence of intent, but there doesn't have to be. Roughly 35% of our population uses some form of illegal drug. Only about one in 50 will ever get caught. Our complete inability to effectively persue all drug users results, out of necessity, in selective enforcement. For mere humans, selective enforcement is always descriminatory. While the laws may not have been written with descrimination in mind, they were written in a way for which non-descriminatory enforcement is impossible. - <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythobeast_dbf1.html" title="User:Mythobeast">Robert Rapplean</a> {23:15, 14 December 2005 (UTC)}</dd>

<p>The most cited evidence for racial bias in sentencing is the vastly disparate sentences handed out to those who posses cocaine, depending on the form the coke is in. Crack is treated much more harshly than powder. While this is usually cited as clear evidence of discrimination it is usually overlooked that it was at the urging of the African American community that these guidlines were adopted. It seems to me the conclusion is inescapable that the penalties for crack are far too harsh ( I am a proponent of legaliztion), but it is unfair, and incorrect, to simply label the enforcement as racist, as it ignores the part that people of color played in the propogation of these paternalistic laws.<a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevi_P._7191.html" title="User:Levi P.">Levi P.</a> 22:03, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Crime rates(removed section)</span></h2>
<p>I feel inclined to say something about the "Crime Rates" section of Arguments for Prohibition. I do not believe this to be a remotely valid argument, since it considers possession as a crime committed by users. It seems to be a logical fallacy without relavency. While crimes committed by actively addicted drug users would certainly be an interesting metric and potential argument, it is not rational to include simple possession as part of the metric. I'm inclined to ask that this section be modified to exclude possession as a crime that justifies prohibition, or the complete removal of this section. Please comment.</p>

<dd>If possesion of books were illegal, and a study of whether readers were criminals, and possesion of a book was counted, then the study would of course show that crime was tied to reading.</dd>

Neither does this parantesis make much sense: "Some claim it may not be morally acceptable to incarcerate people for selling products that are legal to possess (although gun sales are accepted in some countries), or if not actually legal, only a civil offense." I'm not sure what the parantesis means, but it seems to imply that gun possession is legal everywhere and sale too except a few countries where gun sales are only accepted(?). I actually thought that both possession and sale of firearms were strictly regulated in most counties. I guess the parantesis was written by an "American" beleaving that the US "right to bear arms" is universal.

<p>This section only discusses Latin America.

<p>What UN law? Many countries produce poppies for medical uses, in particular India and Turkey. The statement above is clearly wrong and should be removed.

<p>Note: I erased Some misleading statements that said that "empirical evidence has shown... deacrease use of drugs in Neyherlands"... Honestly, that is acceptable for soft drugs only; The Netherlands Still have a strong policy against Hard drugs; This drugs are not legal for recreational use. The Netherlands still fights to stop drug traffic. The hard drugs/soft drugs distinction is an important part of their drug policy. And hard drug use there merely gained stability, not decreased in the complete sense of the word. This may be because of people who wanted to quit their use and the medical policy on these drugs helped them. Medical use is not complete legalization, and it should not be considered that way beause of the huge difference beetween recreational use and medical use of these drugs.</p>

<p>An IP user made an honest and earnest attempt recently to add counter-points to the pro-legalization arguments of the page. However, due to the nature of this article, and the nature of the people who are more likely to visit such an article, his efforts were in vain. The logic was stunning to say the least&#160;: "REVERT. IP user's POV statements. this article is alreday sectioned for the 2 opposing sides." We have some highly-motivated and highly-ignorant people working on this page, and reaching a reasonable NPOV for this page is far off, if even possible, but I have a quick-fix: vote for a title change to the article to a topic both sides would agree is deserving of a slant. My two working titles (please, suggest more):</p>

<dd>Hi Jim, it seems you are probably the Ip user you were speaking of, either case the article currently has 2 opposing sections: A pro section and it's opposition. what was reverted was an attempt to mix the two by putting "counter points" in each section. we can only strive for a NPOV, and currently the best way for this kind of an article is by splitting it into the current two sub sections. if you have further <i>new</i> points (to any side) please feel free to add them here.--<a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDiza_c901.html" title="User:Diza"><font color="DarkGreen">Procrastinating<b>@</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/i/z/User_talk%7EDiza_270b.html" title="User talk:Diza">talk2me</a></sup> 19:43, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Addressing my earlier idea: I think there are too many sections on the "against" half. I think these could be combined into a few sections, possibly under the following subject headings: Personal freedom, economic arguments, crime reduction, harm reduction, and international effects. This happens to match the number of sections in the "for" half.</p>
<p>Also I think the point-counterpoint thing is unnecessary...I think each half should address the other's arguments without resorting to that. Either get rid of it or at least add some counterpoints to the "against" section. If this was done properly I think this article could be back to NPOV. I could take a stab at it, but I'm not sure...thoughts?--Russell_Abbott 23:40, 4 May 2006 (PST)</p>

I went for it and condensed the "against" section and removed the counterpoint section on the "for" section. I think this has made the whole thing a lot more NPOV and generally more coherent...however I probably screwed up here and there, so feel free to go over everything with a fine-tooth comb.

<dd>Done. I hope my re-edits are clear enough. I think the removal of the counterpoints is a no-brainer, but I guess I may have overstepped my bounds with the massive edit. I felt that the article was gave an impression in bias by the obvious disparity in the number of sections under the "against" side. I also thought that half was redundant in several places and could have been easily corrected with a reorganization; also the style often slipped into POV, something which I also tried to correct. As far as content, I believe I left everything in except for the "romantization" section, which I thought was too weak to be worth the increase in length. Anywho, I imagine that was a huge waste of time and someone will revert it back soon. What can I say?

<p>It is ironic that increasing worker productivity is protrayed as an argument <i>for</i> drug prohibition, when opium smoking was specifically prohibited in North America due to the fact that Chinese immigrant workers were able to work longer hours in unfavorable conditions because smoking opium made work more enjoyable. Also note that legal stimulants such as coffee and tea tend to make office workers more productive as well.</p>

<p>There was a junk-science study that tried to say that drug use lead to loss of productivity... I'm still trying to track it down.

<p>This section was reverted to its previous (weak) version.</p>
<p>The comment on the deletion was that the edit was</p>
<p>'Poved and non-encyclopedic. --&gt;2Editort: ry reinserting a Much shorter version instead fir'</p>
<p>... This wikipedia page is representing pro and con arguments, so the entire page is POVed as it is there to demonstrate different points of view.</p>
<p>Please leave the economic and psychosocial factors section in -- there are many more pro-prohibition arguments that need to be added, and the anti-prohibition arguments need to be argued better.</p>
<p><br />
-- This entire page at the moment needs considerable work before it provides a balanced viewpoint on drugs prohibition issues. Where it is not simply under-researched and sophomore, this page currently (July 2006) reads like an anti-prohibitionist tract, ignoring or taking judgment on the valid arguments from both sides.</p>
<p>-- Much good work is being done on comparing licit drug use (and problem use) with illicit drugs. The jury is still very much out on the economic/public health effectiveness of liberal drug policies (e.g. the Netherlands' tolerance of cannabis) vis-à-vis more restrictive policies (e.g. Sweden's).</p>

<p>It is not like these arguments are exactly new. There have been numerous major government commissions that have studied the subject over the last 100 years. That link contains the full text of most of them. Anyone who reads it will find that they all reached remarkably similar conclusions.</p>
<p>Until you have read those, you simply don't know the issue. For those who are new to the subject, the one book to read if you only read one is the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs at <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cumenu.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cumenu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cumenu.htm</a> That will give you a good summary of what you would learn if you read all the other major studies.</p>

<dd>Hmm, lots of things we consume are toxic to some degree, I think less toxic is a valid arguement against the prohibition of consuming an item. That logical fallacy refers more to moral problems, not health problems.

<dd>Just because illegal drugs cause less health problems than legal drugs doesn't mean that the health problems they do cause are insignificant. 68.40.167.60 15:28, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No of course not insignificant, but not so signification as to make the arguement invalid.
