<p>I agree, but it is still true that the region is often <b>called</b> "Argyllshire". Notable examples include the Argyllshire Gathering, military units such as the 98th Argyllshire Highlanders, Argyllshire Advertiser and Ordinaance Survey maps.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True, but that usage belongs to an era when attempts were made to rename Scotland "North Britain" and England "South Britain". Argyllshire is as archaic as either of those. Its usage survives in organisations such as the Argyllshire Advertiser, founded at that time, in the same way that North Britain survives in the title of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_British_Railway_4e00.html" title="North British Railway">North British Railway</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 06:10, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I actually did some research (<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">User:Mais oui!</a> made me do it, blame him) and the "correct" usage is likely "the county of X", where X is either Fife, Cromarty, Argyll, Ross, Sutherland, Caithness, Bute, &amp;c, or the the county town(s). That's what is used in Hansard as of 1830-1832.

<li>Most references to 'Argyll' are not references to the county, but to the general area. Whether people more often talk of the general area than specifically of the county is neither here nor there - the point is that this article is about the county, not the general area, and it should use the commonest, less-ambiguous term as its title. That term is Argyllshire. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStringops_3dcb.html" title="User:Stringops">Stringops</a> 17:18, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I am not seeing any explicit, clear reason for the proposal. And I dont know why the name of the constituency - as distinct from the county - seems to have been changed, from <i>Argyllshire</i> to <i>Argyll</i>, in 1950. Presumably to reflect common usage of that time, influenced perhaps by terms of reference under 1898 local government legislation. <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurel_Bush_dd09.html" title="User:Laurel Bush">Laurel Bush</a> 11:54, 3 April 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>The reason for this proposal is that Argyllshire was unilaterally moved to Argyll in the first place. Given that the local papers of the area are called the <a href="http://www.argyllshireadvertiser.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.argyllshireadvertiser.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Argyllshire Advertiser</a> and the <a href="http://www.dunoon-observer.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.dunoon-observer.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Argyllshire Standard</a> I have yet to see any evidence that <i>Argyll</i> is used specifically to refer to the area covered by the county. <i>Argyll</i> is used, most often, as a general term refering to a vague area, not a specific term refering to a specific set of boundaries that were used administratively until 1975. As this article is about those boundaries, I fail to see why both common usage and precision should be overturned in order to keep it here. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStringops_3dcb.html" title="User:Stringops">Stringops</a> 17:18, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Royal Mail have to take some of the blame for this confusion with their postal counties. The former postal county of Oban, for example is "Argyll", but thankfully the Royal Mail now have traditional counties on file. Try entering "PA34 4AA" into <a href="http://www.capscan.co.uk/mcd5demo.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.capscan.co.uk/mcd5demo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.capscan.co.uk/mcd5demo.htm</a> and you will clearly see that the traditional county is "Argyllshire". <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 17:38, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just because the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Mail_4118.html" title="Royal Mail">Royal Mail</a> can be duped by <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Watch_e4a6.html" title="County Watch">County Watch</a> (see <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_British_Counties_36bd.html#Successes" title="Association of British Counties">Association_of_British_Counties#Successes</a>) does not mean that Wikipedia can. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 18:09, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
