<p>Claims that argyria may only occur after ingestion of silver compounds and not after ingestion of elementar silver or silverdusts are false. Many articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals demonstrate it clearly. If needed, i can leave a list of articles or links to them on this page. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedecke_e669.html" title="User:Redecke">Redecke</a> 13:04, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Concerning the minimal amount of silver (to ingest) for becoming argyric:</p>
<p>Scientific refenrences:</p>
<p>argyria may occur after ingestion of 1.4 gr of silver over several month (silver nitrate in one particular case), 1.5 gr of silver within 14 days, up to 124 gr after 9 years and 200 gr after 10 month. (see Hill 1939, Wadhera 2005). Some scientist believes that argyria may come up after ingestion of only 1 gr silver (national health administration of Canada). Research on 70 cases of argyria by Gaud und Staud (1935) showed that the minimal amount of silver that induced argyria was 1.8 grams. Hill und Pillsbury think in 1939 that a total dose of 1 - 8 gr of inhaled silver dust may induce argyria and they say: ..The minimum amount of silver known to cause argyria in adults, from the use of any silver compound (including salts) is 900 mg of silver taken orally in one year". US-EPA writes: argyria is believed to occur at a total body burden of approximately 1 g Ag and above (EPA-440/4-81-017 (1981) 160 p).</p>
<p>People eating a huge number of Jintan Silver Pills breath freshener, a herbal product with silver coat 0,1 mg Ag / pill (at least 10 cases known and published in scientific journals) got argyria.</p>
<p>Local argyrosis cccured after: long time use of acupuncture-needles (Tanita 1985, Suzuki 1993, Takeishi 2002, Yamashita 2001) silvercontaining suture material silver earrings (van den Nieuwenhuijsen IJ 1988, Hendricks 1991, Sugden 2001) [4] silver "tattoo" around teeth, (seldom) after drilling work on silver amalgam fillings eye-argyrosis occured secondary to occupational silver soldering <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedecke_e669.html" title="User:Redecke">Redecke</a> 00:39, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The anonymous editor (you?) to this sentence, just striking what's overstricken here, made no sense:
<ul>
<li>" Studies in rats show that drinking water containing very large amounts of silver (<s>9.8</s> grams of silver per U.S. gallon water or <s>2.6 grams</s> per liter) is likely to be life-threatening."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Of course, the sentence before then made no sense either. It would need not only the concentration of that solution, but how much of the solution at that concentration was ingested, to make any sense.</dd>
<dd>I have no problem if you take the whole thing out, pending provision of a source for the information, and the relevance of threatening the life of rats to the discussion at hand. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 01:00, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>what i want to say is: we are not rats. and indeed: a concentration makes no sense of course. i do not know who wrote sentence that first... argyria is not life-threatening. we should talk about toxicology of silver on <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver.html" title="Silver">silver</a> and not here. michael <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedecke_e669.html" title="User:Redecke">Redecke</a> 02:15, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find it utterly sick that www.Argyria.info is one of the external links provided. The site is a dis-information site by peddlers of colloidal silver made in an attempt to cover up the dangers of their quack medicine. The FDA has found that though effective concentrations of silver colloids are not safe, and safe concentrations are not effective.</p>
<p>The site gives next to no information about argyria; the entire page is one ranting defense of colloidal silver raising FUD about how "they" don't want you to know about it. It has no bibliography, and lacks any academic credibility; it is no better than a personal rant.</p>
<p>If anyone here remembers the bad old days when silver colloids poisoned our rivers due to dumping by the photographic film industry (back before digital photography decimated the industry), you would remember the disasterous effects of exposure to silver colloids. This is not to say that silver particles don't inhibit bacterial growth: they do, but it is erroneous to extrapolate from this and think that you can ingest silver colloids and have the same effect. Alcohol also kills bacteria, but if you inferred that you could ingest alcohol and kill bacterial infections, you'd be eligible for the Darwin award. The concentrations of alcohol that you'd have to ingest to kill an infection would kill you first. The same applies to colloidal silver. All support for medicinal use of colloidal silver out there comes from anecdotal accounts, but double-blind medical studies and health disasters such as poor victims of silver medicine quackery blow away any notion that silver medicine is safe nor effective.</p>

<p>Hi Mark, I should have sent this sooner, Thank you for saving my life, thank you, thank you!<br />
The silver I used was your method, the method by Mark Metcalf, using distilled water. I was heating the water to between 100-130 degrees. The activation time was 10 minutes. I still use this method but I do not heat the water.<br />
In 1982 I was treated for neurosyphilis. Two weeks IV penicillin, 24 hours a day. After this treatment spinal fluid samples showed that I was within acceptable limits of the disease. Things still did not feel right. A follow up treatment was done. More spinal taps, same results. There were no more treatments. I was told that they did all known treatments.<br />
As the years went by I lived with the disease. Symptoms got worse, numbness on my right side from my foot to my face, loss of balance, more severe at night. Rashes, thrush, muscular problems, legs shutting down and severe stabbing pains in both legs.<br />
In 1995 my overall health was declining. What I thought was dust particles in my vision tuned out to be spirochetes. Over the next 4 years my vision deteriorated dramatically. My vision turned into a brown haze. I learned to relax and used the sun to watch the spirochetes. My liver was so bad that I had severe yeast infections, bloated knees and rashes. I was having problems with my heart, lungs and speech.<br />
In January, 1999, my body was shutting down. I had pneumonia, many fevers daily and body functions were almost non existent. By the end of the month I was in bad shape.<br />
I had known about cs for one year but did not believe in it. As a last resort I bought a 4 oz bottle at a health food store. The label stated that it was a 10 ppm. I drank the whole bottle in the parking lot. That night while looking into a light, some of the spirochetes in my vision changed from being curly to looking like an eye lash. That was the first time there was any change. I decided to get my generator that night.<br />
I started taking an 8 oz glass at 5 ppm a day. After 3 days I started urinating again, my swollen liver went down, fevers subsided and a lot of other symptoms were subsiding. After 3 days I started drinking 16 ozs in the morning and 16 ozs at night of 10 ppm. After 2 weeks my vision was changing, I was starting to see colors again. What was happening was amazing. My lungs started purging sputum 24 hours a day for 3 weeks. Then it stopped and I felt like I had new lungs. My health improved dramatically. I used the cs for 2 .5 years without missing a day.<br />
In Febuary, 2001, I was in California and got a little sun. Some friends were saying that my skin had a different tone to it. It was an ash color. I continued to use cs because I did not think it was a drastic change. Under different lighting it was more pronounced. In June after more sun my skin tone was a very noticeable slate grey. People would ask me what was wrong with my skin and if I was ok. I stopped using cs at that time, ready to start using it again if any symptoms came back regardless of my skin tone. My answer to people who would ask me questions about my color was that I overdosed on cs and they would give me a funny look. As for how bad my argyria was I will give two examples.<br /></p>
<pre>
 1. I was working in July 2001. It was a very hot day my friend and were removing plumbing fixtures. We were sweating a lot. There was a mirror in the room. When I looked at myself I was very grey. Tom stood next to me looking at me comparing his skin color. His comment was that I was very grey more than that morning. I think when you sweat it becomes more pronounced.
 2. I was with my wife at her doctor's office. They had florescent white lighting. Argyria shows up more in this lighting than natural light. The staff in the office were looking at me and talking among themselves. They asked my wife if I was ok. She said that I was working in a dusty place that day.
</pre>
<p>So these are just a few examples to try to answer your question since I have no one to compare the argyria to. I tried talking to Rosemarys site. They responded at first until they read my story. I have written to them since, still no response. I didn't expect anything from this site anyway.<br />
To reverse argyria I took 3 E 1000 100% natural d-alpha tocopheryl, 1 selenium 100 mcg yeast free, 2 vegetarian C 1000 mg, 1 teaspoon MSM organic, 1 super potency B100, and 1 teaspoon of kelp powder. This was every morning with 2, 16 oz glasses of water. I would also drink water throughout the day, close to 3/4 of a gallon a day.<br />
I still use cs today for different things. If I do not take the above and do cs my skin tone changes very slightly. My skin tone now is natural looking at this time. In the summer of 2002 I was in the sun all the time. I did not turn grey, just tan.<br />
I Hope this can help you in your research. I have many other peoples experiences with this method of cs. None have gotten argyria, but they have had amazing results.<br />
Take care, look forward to talking to you<br />
<br />
