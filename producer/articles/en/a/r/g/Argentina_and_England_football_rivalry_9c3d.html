<p>In the latter half of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, the Argentine capital <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> had a large expatriate British community of some <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_settlement_in_Argentina_c5d4.html" title="English settlement in Argentina">40,000 people</a>. As in many other parts of the world, football was introduced to Argentina by the British. The first recorded football match played in Argentina was organized by the Buenos Aires Cricket Club in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palermo%2C_Buenos_Aires_bf72.html" title="Palermo, Buenos Aires">Palermo, Buenos Aires</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">20 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/6/1867.html" title="1867">1867</a>, and played between two teams of British railway workers, the White Caps and the Red Caps<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> (it was common in the early days of football for teams to be distinguished by caps rather than jerseys).</p>
<p>The so-called "father of Argentine football" was a <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glaswegian</a> schoolteacher, Alexander Watson Hutton, who first taught football at the St Andrew's School in Buenos Aires in the early 1880s. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">4 February</a> <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> he founded the Buenos Aires English High School where he continued to instruct the pupils in the game.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1891 Hutton established the <i>Association Argentine Football League</i>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Five clubs competed but only one season of games was played. A new league, the <i>The Argentine Association Football League</i> was formed <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_21.html" title="February 21">February 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a> and this eventually became the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_Football_Association_4d92.html" title="Argentine Football Association">Argentine Football Association</a>. In these early days of football in Argentina nearly all of the players and officials were expatriate Britons or of British extraction and the oldest football clubs in Argentina like <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosario_Central_fa3f.html" title="Rosario Central">Rosario Central</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newell%27s_Old_Boys_6a92.html" title="Newell's Old Boys">Newell's Old Boys</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quilmes_Atl%C3%A9tico_Club_7386.html" title="Quilmes Atlético Club">Quilmes Athletic Club</a> and were all founded by British expatriates. As the popularity of the game increased the British influence on the game waned, and by 1912 the Association was renamed <a href="../../../a/s/o/Asociaci%C3%B3n_Argentina_de_Football_e1b1.html" title="Asociación Argentina de Football">Asociación Argentina de Football</a>.</p>
<p>However the British influence on the game in Argentina shows in the continued use of terms such as "corner" and "wing" rather than <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> translations. The names of several famous teams in Argentina are also English in origin such as <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club_Atl%C3%A9tico_River_Plate_fa71.html" title="Club Atlético River Plate">River Plate</a> or influenced by the language such as <a href="../../../b/o/c/Boca_Juniors_3d76.html" title="Boca Juniors">Boca Juniors</a>.</p>
<p>The national teams had met before their 1966 clash — Argentina were the first team other than Scotland to play England at <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> in 1951. They also played two matches in 1953 in <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. The first, a 3-1 victory for Argentina, counted as an unofficial international for England, who fielded a second string team dubbed an <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Association_1c38.html" title="Football Association">FA</a> XI. However, this match appears in Argentina's list of official internationals, and so Argentines consider it to be their first ever victory over England. Afterwards one Argentine <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politician</a> stated that "we nationalised the railways, and now we have nationalised football!".<sup id="_ref-multiplekuper_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiplekuper" title="">[5]</a></sup> The second 1953 international was an official match for both teams: England playing with a stronger line-up involving <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alf_Ramsey_c1f7.html" title="Alf Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_Lofthouse_7d1f.html" title="Nat Lofthouse">Nat Lofthouse</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Finney_854e.html" title="Tom Finney">Tom Finney</a>; Argentina sticking with the same line-up used in the first match. The game was abandoned after 36 minutes due to torrential rain, with a 0-0 scoreline. They also met in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962_FIFA_World_Cup_0b12.html" title="1962 FIFA World Cup">1962 FIFA World Cup</a>, where England beat Argentina 3-1 in the group stage. Argentina's first victory over England in a full international, recognised as such by both teams, occurred in a 1-0 win in Brazil in June 1964.</p>
<p><a name="1966_World_Cup"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina_and_England_football_rivalry_9c3d.html" title="Edit section: 1966 World Cup">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1966 World Cup</span></h2>
<p>In spite of all of this history, it was not until the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_FIFA_World_Cup_be65.html" title="1966 FIFA World Cup">1966 FIFA World Cup</a>, held in England, that the rivalry picked up the fierce edge and sometimes bitterness which it retains to this day. The two teams met in the quarter-finals of the tournament and England won with a combative 1-0 thanks to a goal from striker <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Hurst_14cc.html" title="Geoff Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a>.</p>
<p>However, the game was particularly noted for the sending-off of Argentina captain <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Ratt%C3%ADn_def0.html" title="Antonio Rattín">Antonio Rattín</a>, which Argentinians considered to be unfair, including Rattín himself who had to be escorted from the pitch by police before he would leave. According to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Observer_f59d.html" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i> newspaper, "with 10 minutes left in the first half, a German referee sent Rattin off for 'violence of the tongue', even though the referee spoke no <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Englishman <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Aston_de1d.html" title="Ken Aston">Ken Aston</a>, supervisor of referees, entered the field to try to persuade Rattin to leave, in a way the Latin American teams have since concluded that the English and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germans</a> were collaborating to eliminate them from the competition. <sup id="_ref-multiplekuper_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiplekuper" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rattin's intention appeared to have been to speak with the German referee, as according to the Argentines he was ruling in favour of the English team.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Rattin made a visible signal showing his <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%28football%29.html" title="Captain (football)">captain</a>'s armband and intention to call a translator.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After his expulsion, Rattín finally sat down on the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen</a>'s red carpet for a moment, although the Queen was not there.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> After the match, England manager <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alf_Ramsey_c1f7.html" title="Alf Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> refused to allow his players to swap shirts with the Argentinians — as is traditional after the conclusion of a football match — and later described the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_American_1d95.html" title="South American">South Americans</a> as "animals" in the press. This is the reason why most Argentine players still refuse to swap shirts with their English counterparts.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Argentinian press and public were outraged, and one Argentinian newspaper published a picture of the official <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_mascot_aaf5.html" title="Football World Cup mascot">World Cup mascot</a>, <i>World Cup Willie</i>, dressed in <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate.html" title="Pirate">pirate</a> regalia to demonstrate their opinion of the England team. As <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> newspaper later described the Argentine view of the English: "Many Argentines read this as classic British racism... England has since been the team they most want to beat. One bumper sticker for the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_FIFA_World_Cup_1204.html" title="1978 FIFA World Cup">1978 FIFA World Cup</a> in Argentina showed the tournament's mascot, <i>Gauchito</i>, posing with his foot on a British lion. England had not even qualified for the competition."<sup id="_ref-multiplekuper_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiplekuper" title="">[5]</a></sup> The only British team that qualified for the competition were Scotland, and, as there was no rivalry between Scotland and Argentina, the gesture was immediately thought to be an attack on England.</p>

<p>The next game between the two teams occurred at the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_FIFA_World_Cup_5635.html" title="1986 FIFA World Cup">1986 FIFA World Cup</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, again at the quarter-final stage. The encounter was made particularly incendiary by the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a> which the two countries had fought four years previously, and many in Argentina saw the game as being an opportunity to exact revenge upon England for their loss of that conflict, and incidents during the fighting such as the sinking of the warship <i><a href="../../../a/r/a/ARA_General_Belgrano_3146.html" title="ARA General Belgrano">General Belgrano</a></i> in debatable circumstances.</p>

The "Hand of God"</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Argentina took the lead through a highly controversial goal from their star player <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Maradona_6cd9.html" title="Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>, who punched the ball into the England net with his hand. The goal was allowed to stand by the referee, much to the fury of the English team and its fans. The goal, dubbed the "<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_of_God_goal_7cb7.html" title="Hand of God goal">Hand of God goal</a>" after Maradona's tongue-in-cheek description of how it was scored, has become infamous in England, particularly as England went on to lose the game and were knocked out of the tournament. Also in this game, Maradona scored a second goal, voted in 2002 as the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goal_of_the_Century_21d8.html" title="Goal of the Century">best goal in World Cup history</a>, before English striker <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Lineker_6cdc.html" title="Gary Lineker">Gary Lineker</a> pulled one back, but England could not score again and lost 2-1. Despite the skill of his second goal, Maradona wrote in his autobiography that "I sometimes think I preferred the one with my hand... It was a bit like stealing the wallet of the English."<sup id="_ref-multiplekuper_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiplekuper" title="">[5]</a></sup> He also wrote, in reference to the Falklands conflict, that "it was as if we had beaten a country, not just a football team... Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge."<sup id="_ref-multiplekuper_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiplekuper" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The importance of both goals for the English people can be seen as the fact they were chosen at the top of the list of <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_Greatest_Sporting_Moments_cd45.html" title="100 Greatest Sporting Moments">100 Greatest Sporting Moments</a> in 2002 by Channel 4.</p>
<p>The game added hugely to the rivalry between the two teams in England where they felt that they had been cheated out of the competition by Maradona's hand ball. Meanwhile in Argentina, the game was not just seen as revenge for the Falklands War but mostly for what they still see as the unfair game in the 1966 World Cup.</p>
<p>It is close to inevitable that, whenever the two teams play, this game (and particularly the Hand of God goal in England) will be referred to by the sports media in the build up to the game.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, a friendly match between the two teams was played at Wembley. Argentina, now under the management of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfio_Basile_7dab.html" title="Alfio Basile">Alfio Basile</a>, were preparing for the forthcoming <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copa_Am%C3%A9rica_1991_ba80.html" title="Copa América 1991">Copa América 1991</a>, which they went on to win. The South Americans had a new generation of players mainly playing locally, replacing the very successful group of the previous two World Cup tournaments. The game was mostly under the control of England, but near the end Argentina came back from two goals down to draw 2-2. In spite of not being a victory, the result was celebrated in Argentina, especially due to both Argentine goals coming from corner kicks, which in Argentina were seen as being a part of the game at which the English usually excelled.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina_and_England_football_rivalry_9c3d.html" title="Edit section: 1998 World Cup">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1998 World Cup</span></h2>
<p>The next meeting between the two countries came in the second round of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_FIFA_World_Cup_912e.html" title="1998 FIFA World Cup">1998 FIFA World Cup</a>, held in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. The game had many noteworthy aspects including a goal that is also considered <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goal_of_the_Century_21d8.html" title="Goal of the Century">one of the greatest of all time</a>, scored by young striker <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Owen_bd93.html" title="Michael Owen">Michael Owen</a>.</p>
<p>However, the incident in this game that most exacerbated the rivalry was when <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> received a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misconduct_%28football%29.html" title="Misconduct (football)">red card</a>. Beckham had been fouled by <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Simeone_e7be.html" title="Diego Simeone">Diego Simeone</a> and the two players were lying on the pitch in close proximity to one another. As Simeone attempted to raise himself from the ground, he placed his hands on Beckham's back; Beckham was seen to wince in pain as Simeone regained his footing. In what Simeone himself described as an instinctive reaction, Beckham, still laying face down on the pitch flicked his leg towards Simeone striking him on the calf. Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, waving imaginary red cards at the referee, urging him to send Beckham off.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Playing with ten men, England held out against the Argentinian attacks and, in the dying moments of the game, during a scramble in the Argentine penalty area, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_Campbell_bd7d.html" title="Sol Campbell">Sol Campbell</a> headed the ball into the goal. As the England players began to celebrate a winning goal the referee blew for a foul and disallowed it. The consequent free kick was taken very quickly, while the England players were still celebrating, and they had to rush back to successfully prevent the Argentinians from scoring. The scores stayed level at 2-2 until the end of extra time. In the ensuing <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penalty_shootout_%28football%29.html" title="Penalty shootout (football)">penalty shoot-out</a> that decided the game, Argentina won 4-3 after two English kicks were saved by their goalkeeper <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Roa_6c21.html" title="Carlos Roa">Carlos Roa</a>.</p>
<p>There was heavy criticism in England about Argentina's "theatrics" which many fans held responsible for stealing the win. This was somewhat ironic, as the penalty which earned England their first goal resulted from what is generally acknowledged to have been a dive by Michael Owen.</p>
<p>Immediately following the game, Beckham was vilified by the English press for his perceived petulance and naivety on the international stage. The headline in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Mirror_3a22.html" title="The Daily Mirror">The Daily Mirror</a></i> the following day described the England team as "10 heroic lions, one stupid boy".</p>

<p>Another friendly was played in 2000, again at Wembley, but ended 0-0. Argentina fans did not observe the minute's silence in memory of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Matthews_71be.html" title="Stanley Matthews">Stanley Matthews</a>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Then, the teams were drawn to meet once more in the group stages of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_07bb.html" title="2002 FIFA World Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>, Korea-Japan. Having been knocked out by Argentina in two of the previous three World Cups they had competed in, tension in England was high. This tension was raised by the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a> team only gaining a draw in their opening match, meaning that they needed a good result against <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina_national_football_team.html" title="Argentina national football team">Argentina</a> to avoid being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>The meeting between England and Argentina was one of the few times there had been so much attention given to a first round match. Commentators described the match, which began at twelve noon UK time, as the "longest lunch break in history" as millions in England and throughout the world stopped their jobs and activities to watch the game on TV.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>, who was then the England captain, scored the only goal of the match, a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penalty_kick.html" title="Penalty kick">penalty kick</a> which many felt redeemed him in the eyes of the English sporting public for his dismissal four years earlier. As <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> newspaper described it in their match report, "vilified for the red card that helped to usher England out of the 1998 World Cup at the hands of Argentina, he wakes this morning with his halo brighter than ever."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> Despite a late onslaught from the Argentinian players at the end of the second half of the game, England maintained the scoreline and won 1-0, and partly as a result of this Argentina (one of the pre-tournament favourites to win) were knocked out in the first round.</p>
<p>Although the Argentinian players and public criticised the awarding of the penalty kick — given for a controversial foul on Michael Owen, whom they felt had dived — the game was generally played in a good, if highly competitive, spirit, and there was none of the bitterness that had affected the 1966 and 1986 meetings.</p>

<p>The most recent game between the two nations occurred on neutral ground in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">12 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> when the two teams, having both already qualified for the following year's World Cup, met in a friendly. Both teams selected strong sides. England twice came from behind to beat Argentina 3-2 with goals from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Owen_bd93.html" title="Michael Owen">Michael Owen</a> from crosses by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Gerrard_445c.html" title="Steven Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Cole_%28footballer%29_7aa9.html" title="Joe Cole (footballer)">Joe Cole</a>. The result and performance were welcomed enthusiastically by the English public, although the Argentinians were dismissive of any wider significance of the result, having withdrawn most of their first-choice players when they were still in the lead. <i>The Times</i> reported: "by the unpleasant standards of previous confrontations, the skirmish between England and Argentina edged towards the saccharine, although the concept is deeply relative. The latest encounter featured punches on the terraces, songs about the Falkland Islands, jibes regarding players' sexuality and general churlishness that (sic), believe it or not, represents a significant thaw in diplomatic relations."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> This game followed the general tone of the last one (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_07bb.html" title="2002 FIFA World Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>), with players focusing more on trying to play football and less on getting revenge on one another.</p>

<p>At the club level, matches have also been heated. Argentine and English clubs have not had many chances to play against each other, but when they have done so there have been notable incidents. The most memorable matches happened in the now defunct <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_South_American_Cup_ba4b.html" title="European/South American Cup">European/South American Cup</a>. In 1968 <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estudiantes_La_Plata_c50b.html" title="Estudiantes La Plata">Estudiantes La Plata</a> played against <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_0c9f.html" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a> for the cup, then known as the "Intercontinental Cup". The first leg was in <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> where Estudiantes' supporters were highly vocal and the game was played in a very physical manner with a disputed red card and physical injury.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> Manchester United could not recover the 1-0 deficit in the replay and Estudiantes won the title.</p>
<p>Nine years later, in 1977, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool FC</a> refused to play against <a href="../../../b/o/c/Boca_Juniors_3d76.html" title="Boca Juniors">Boca Juniors</a>, so Boca played against European runner-up <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borussia_M%C3%B6nchengladbach_759e.html" title="Borussia Mönchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> and obtained their first cup. In 1978, Liverpool alleged "scheduling conflicts"; the cup was not played.</p>
<p>In 1984 <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independiente.html" title="Independiente">Independiente</a> played Liverpool for the trophy that, by this point, had been renamed the "<a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercontinental_Cup_%28football%29_aaaf.html" title="Intercontinental Cup (football)">Toyota Cup</a>". The format had also changed, to a single game played in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, making it easier for teams to attend. Independiente won 1-0 with a goal by Percudani; this was the last time Argentine and English clubs met in a championship.</p>

<p>Much of the colour and intensity in this rivalry is added by the fans themselves. The early matches generated interest and emotion but it was the 1982 <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a> that fuelled passions and elevated this rivalry. Before the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina_and_England_football_rivalry_9c3d.html#1986_World_Cup" title="Argentina and England football rivalry">1986 game</a> ultras from both countries (<a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooligans.html" title="Hooligans">Barra Bravas</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_hooligan.html" title="Football hooligan">Hooligans</a>) had a fight in a <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_City_fae1.html" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> street <sup id="_ref-hooligansfight_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hooligansfight" title="">[11]</a></sup>. During games, though, behaviour so far has been generally peaceful on both sides; probably because of the heightened security in the stadiums.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, fans in Argentina still use anti-English chants. The most used one is "El que no salta es un inglés"<sup id="_ref-multiplekuper_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiplekuper" title="">[5]</a></sup> (the one not jumping is an Englishman). This chant is used to rally the whole stadium into jumping, threatening ridicule to those not jumping with this perceived insult. English fans, on the other hand, frequently mock Argentinians with references to their nation's defeat in the 1982 Falklands War.</p>
