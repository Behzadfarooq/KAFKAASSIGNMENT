<dd>Read the discussion on <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarrington_Hall_793b.html" title="Talk:Barrington Hall">Talk:Barrington Hall</a> and Talk:WP:EL. There is no consensus that it is against policy to link to YouTube videos which are not clearly infringing copyright. That particular video clip is claimed to be allowed to be posted on YouTube, and nobody has offered any evidence that the clip exists on YouTube in violation of copyright. Deletion of a link which does not knowingly violate copyright, which has been discussed at grat length on the talk page, is not a good-faith edit. Neither is wholesale removal of links to YouTube throughout Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 16:24, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I was treated very rudely, then blocked, after adding YouTube links to the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Wiggins_257a.html" title="Graham Wiggins">Graham Wiggins</a> article. Wiggins is an American <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didgeridoo.html" title="Didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a> player and I emailed to ask him for some additional biographical information about his life, instruments, and work. He responded by posting some videos of his live performances on YouTube, which were clearly marked as having been uploaded by him (the performer himself). I linked to them so that our users could see excactly how he plays his didgeridoos, particularly the keyed didgeridoo he invented, and an editor removed them, insisting that we must not link to "copyright violation" YouTube links. From what I read here, perhaps I was right all along and the removing editor was the one being disruptive. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 10:27, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Aside from a little unpleasantness which I'm not really bothered by, I don't see this as a user conduct issue.

<dd>Moving it to a subpage of WP:RFC sounds fine to me; I'd suggest leaving behind a redirect under the section heading in WT:EL, and fixing the listing at WP:RFC/Policies.

<p>No, this is <i>definitely</i> a user conduct issue. And Argyriou, have you <i>seen</i> the discussions at NOR, ANI, and EL dating from a month ago??? They are very clearly aware of all the issues tou are trying to "discuss" in good faith, and also very clear that they do NOT have consensus, that these issues have been debated extensively and consensus is against them. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arg, as you can see at EL, Barberio, a respected longtime EL page editor, agrees this is a user conduct RFC. Let's get it over with--they are wasting your time on purpose by trying to avoid a user conduct RFC (because that is what will work). YT has been debated extensively on policy pages and community consensus is already in favor of no ban/keeping some links--they are violating consensus (and multiple policies, not to mention causing legal jeopardy) via <i>conduct.</i> Continuing the bickerfest/pretending there is any legitimate issue to discuss at this point just drags it out further/allows them to engage in continued disruptive acting-out. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 02:58, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though I've been active here less than three months, I've noticed that the Wikipedia community tend to approve more of those who proceed conservatively, touching all the bases, seeking consensus and harmonious resolutions while assuming good faith — than of those who rush the process, skip steps, or seek to act punitively. Cindery, I appreciate that your experiences may well have worn your patience thin, and I can sympathize with that, but please bear with Argyriou's attempt to touch all the bases once more. If he succeeds at getting others to cooperate on reaching (and abiding by) consensus <i>this</i> time, that's a victory for everyone. And if not, then the track record will be that much clearer to later readers for whatever purpose. <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>06:26, 22 Dec 2006 (UTC).</i></small></dd>

<p>Sorry, Jordan, but you just don't seem to realize how long this has been going on, how much discussion in good faith has already been engaged in, and how having to continue these circular arguments with people who are acting in bad faith is a huge disruption/waste of time. Policy, guideline, and consensus are <i>already</i> established against the YT project, and the behavior of the minority--their treatment of other editors--has been inexcusable. (Mismy should be desysopped.) Please see my talkpage, "Ongoing draft of RFC re Nick" (and "Nearly Headless Nick"). <i>It's a user conduct issue.</i> <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 09:46, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Argyriou. Edits like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington&amp;diff=96030686&amp;oldid=96030192" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington&amp;diff=96030686&amp;oldid=96030192" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> are really not productive or fair. The user you gave this warning to was not carrying out vandalism, which is what that template is clearly intended for. If you are in dispute with the user over content, then continue to engage he him and other users in the discussions. Issuing vandalism warnings, particularly ones that threaten a block, is very counterproductive and disruptive. I appreciate you do not like the fact that the user removed an external link, but it wasn'yt vandalism, and was not deserving of that message.</p>
<p>Please, don't use such templates again unless warning people actively engaged in obvious vandalism. Removing a link is not vandalism - it is a content dispute, which can hopefully be resolved civilly and maturely without resorting to threats of blocking and suchlike. If you have any questions, let me know.

<dd>Removing a link which was previously removed, and was restored following discussion on the article's talk page, with no additional justification other than the same justification which was previously rejected, <b>is</b> vandalism. If Sir Nicholas had gone to the trouble of looking on the article's talk page, either before or after, and said anything to justify re-deleting the link, then it would have been a content dispute. As it is, Sir Nicholas is engaging in vandalism. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 02:22, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't be so quick to label content disputes as vandalism. Vandalism would have been replacing the link with U ALL SUCK LOL! or something similar. This is a dispute over content. As soon as you label someone a vandal, you immediately upset them if they believe they are acting in good faith (which is the case here), and you show yourself as being unprepared to listen to the other's point of view (also the case here). I very much appreciate you believe you are acting to restore legitimate content, but, please, consider continuing to participate in the discussions rather than labelling people as vandals when it is not clear vandalism; doing so is disruptive and incivil, and it's really not helping your case.</dd>

<dd>Whilst discussions on the article's talk page are great, occasionally, all articles on Wikipedia have to meet Wikipedia policies, regardless of what the article talk page determines. Examples of this include <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and suchlike. What we are trying to do at the moment is work on a policy to establish just what is and is not acceptable on Wikipedia with regards to YouTube links. You are already participating in the discussion - please continue to do so! That is the correct way to get a good result. Whilst filing an RFC is very much your perogative and your right (and why I have opposed its deletion on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>), people respond better to civil suggestions and reasoned discussion, rather than threats and being labelled vandals.

<dd>Sorry, but I don't particularly care. Dmcdevit has been quick to assume incivility, but nothing that I have experienced from him rises to the level of abuse of power sufficient to warrant an RfC. If things against Sir Nick go to ArbCom, I'll include Dmcdevit as an interested party, because I don't believe he could judge that case fairly, but otherwise, I have no reasons to take actions against Dmcdevit. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 16:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would rename / refactor / redirect to an article on the case, which is much less problematic than an article on a living individual which focuses only on the conviction.

<p>Since Sir Nick is now calling any further discussion feeding the trolls and publicly proving that this is all due to his RfC which he amusingly calls disruptive then I guess the issue is settled then. New rule: Don't mess with Sir Nick or he will ban you and call the discussion feeding the trolls. Apparently Wikipedia now works a state within the state where all basic civil rights such as being innoncent of a crime (death threats) until proven guilty means absolutely nothing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 13:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
