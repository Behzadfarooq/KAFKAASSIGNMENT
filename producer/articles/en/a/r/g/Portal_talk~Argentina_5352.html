<p>While my responsibilities require much of my time, I would enjoy putting a couple hours or so a week into overseeing this Wikipedia.org Portal. I have been interested in Argentina for the last ten years, know some info about the country, and have about eight years experience building web sites. I will check back in a day or so. January 2, 2007 -[[]]</p>
<p>I see that this portal has languished since a promising beginning in October/November 2005. Can I lend a hand to get it up and running properly? I'm not in Argentina, although I have visited it (and think it's a beautiful country), but I have some experience of running portals from the <a href="../../../n/z/_/P%7ENZ_e857.html" title="P:NZ">New Zealand</a> and <a href="../../../o/_/_/P%7EO_1786.html" title="P:O">Oceania</a> portals. I'm <b>not</b> volunteering to take on the primary responsibility for this portal, but I could get a monthly rotation of selected articles and pictures set up, and kick off the "In the News" section. For me, that would be a great way to become better aquainted with Argentine politics and culture before I next visit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if no one is interested in the portal at all, perhaps it should be put up for deletion.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 04:11, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Ok, i started the portal from a red link and told that to everyone in the talk page of <a href="../../../a/r/_/WP%7EAR_447c.html" title="WP:AR">WP:AR</a>, now i have placed a kind of userbox-invitation in the talk pages of some argentine editors that i think are the best. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentino_e642.html" title="User:Argentino">Argentino</a> 15:18, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: let's wait a week, and if nobody is interested, we delete it</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we are more likely to attract attention if we start making active changes. Sometimes it takes months of keeping a portal lively before new people get drawn into it. Once the portal is set up, it will only require a few minutes a week to keep going - primarily just updating "In the News" a couple of times a week. I'm suggesting a monthly rotation of selected articles and pictures so we can set up a queue of 12 items and not have to worry about it again for a year.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope I'm not stepping on anyone's toes here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've done a bit of tidy up of the portal page. I think the next step is to get a list of selected articles and pictures. For the New Zealand portal, we have a rotation between four types of selected articles: a city, a biography, and then two other articles. Since each selection lists the last three items, the viewer always sees a diversity in the last few selected articles. Here's a possible list of selected articles: (now moved to it's own section of this page)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please feel free to change these, to reorder them, or to comment on the suitability of the selections. I chose the first two biographies as people who are very well known outside Argentina as well as to Argentines, and then deliberately chose someone who is less well known as the third. (<a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Maradona_6cd9.html" title="Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> would have been my choice if I'd wanted a third very famous person, but then I wouldn't have chosen <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_in_Argentina_bb6a.html" title="Football in Argentina">Football in Argentina</a> as an article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For selected pictures, I am not in a good position to choose, since I haven't read many of the Argentine-related articles on wikipedia, but here's a few anyway. Each picture needs to have an article to back it up, but the article doesn't need to be very detailed: (now moved to its own section of this page)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was disappointed not to find a picture of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condor.html" title="Condor">condor</a> from Argentina. I suspect I haven't captured the full diversity of Argentina in these pictures. I also was trying to get a dozen pictures, but I overshot. Again, please add, change or rearrange this list.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 21:19, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thak you a lot! This is really a good point to start. I <i>have</i> a picture of a condor in one of the other pcs, but i have to search it and have a lot to do (in real life) so maybe tomorrow. Thank you again.<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentino_e642.html" title="User:Argentino">Argentino</a> 21:33, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have set up a queue for the selected article, with the current writeup as April 2006, and Buenos Aires as May 2006. The portal will automatically change to the May article when the month changes. If this is acceptable, I will do the same thing for the selected picture. You can see the queue at <a href="../../../a/r/g/Portal%7EArgentina_Selected_article_2006_d59d.html" title="Portal:Argentina/Selected article/2006">Portal:Argentina/Selected article/2006</a>.</p>
<p>The portal Introduction should have a general description of Argentina, not of the portal. In fact, it should look rather like the current selected article writeup! We can leave this until later.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 23:02, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm really convinced that you are the best help. I didn't even know this existed. I am going to add some more articles to the queue later on, i feel we have to concentrate in the portal itself. thankyou again. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentino_e642.html" title="User:Argentino">Argentino</a> 23:14, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very nice! Should we have a standard that the picture is on the left, or the picture is centred with the text below it, or does it not matter?</dd>

</dl>
<p>Now that it's a new month (UTC time), the portal is displaying the new selected article and picture. I'm now back at university, so my time on Wikipedia is limited. I will make sure the selection queues don't run out, but I might not do much more work here until mid July.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 02:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>At the moment, these both link to major articles about Argentina. I suggest that we incorporate the links from the current categories pane into the topics pane, and remove the redlinks from topics. The categories pane is supposed to link to the major categories, but I am not sure if it is needed, since we have ten important categories already linked at the very top of the portal. If we don't keep the categories pane, the topics pane can be moved to the right hand column for balance.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 06:48, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are proposed selected articles only. Any one can add to the list, comment on the list, or rearrange it. There is a particular design at present; a city appears as every fourth entry, and a biography follows the city. Since each selected article writeup links to the previous three selections, this helps keep the selection diverse.</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/27/d/G%27day.html" title="G'day">G'day</a> everyone! How is everyone doin? - I have a few questions about the current sections of the portal. Shouldn't the <i><b>Categories</b></i> section have links to actual Category pages? For example, one of the links there is <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Argentina_0ef0.html" title="Tourism in Argentina">Tourism in Argentina</a>, which actually directs us to that page, instead of having <a href="../../../t/o/u/Category%7ETourism_in_Argentina_dd91.html" title="Category:Tourism in Argentina">Category:Tourism in Argentina</a>. Right now it looks like a list of selected articles. / Also, we could add some articles that are needed in the <i><b>Things you can do category</b></i>, this could be helpful for newcomers joining <a href="../../../a/r/g/WP%7EARG_801f.html" title="WP:ARG">WP:ARG</a>, who don't know what to start on. One of things listed there now, is adding to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Argentina-related_Articles_f909.html" title="List of Argentina-related Articles">Argentine related articles</a>, isn't this similar to <a href="../../../a/r/g/Category%7EArgentina_fe18.html" title="Category:Argentina">Category:Argentina</a>. We could maybe pick an article and work on it for a month, let people know that that certain article needs more info, then selecting another article the following month. Another suggestion would be adding a <i><b>Related Wikimedia</b></i> section.</p>
<p>Now changing the subject, if I want to add something in the <i><b>Argentina News</b></i>... how do I know what is actually appropriate to add? We obviously can't add all possible news that hapend in a day, it would be <b>tooooooo</b> long... Oh and, is there a maximum amount of news? when do they start getting deleted?</p>
<p>(By the way, I changed the Map image of Argentina that was placed on the portal intro with it's global location map, and arranged it correctly with the others... they were dispersed around the box, I hope it's alright)</p>
<p>It would be nice making it a featured portal&#160;;-) See ya around <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECROWDUDE_9714.html" title="User:CROWDUDE">CROWDUDE</a> 03:48, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hola Crowdude, thanks for your interest in the Argentine portal. Unfortunately, we don't have anyone willing to put much effort into this portal at the moment. I set up queues for the selected article and selected picture a few months ago, and have been keeping those queues stocked, and I've updated the news pane occasionally (mostly by taking material from <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_Argentina_76ac.html" title="2006 in Argentina">2006 in Argentina</a>). There are a number of other sections of the portal I've just ignored, including the categories section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would be great if you changed the categories section to be a list of the major categories dealing with Argentina, similar to the Categories section of Portal:New Zealand. Also, the Topics section should be overhauled to remove the redlinks and add other topics which we do have articles for. For the news section, I'd suggest you try to add at least one news story a week, but no more than one a day on average. Usually, we remove the oldest story when adding a new one. Ideally, the left and right sides of the portal should be about the same length, but so far I haven't worried about this too much. If you revamp the categories and/or topics sections, then their relative lengths will probably change. You could also swap these two sections over, to give more room on the right side for news stories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest you wait a little while for more comments here before doing anything too drastic. Since both you and I are in New Zealand, it would be nice to get some feedback from people in Argentina about future directions for this portal.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 04:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Gadfium!… I changed the layout of the portal, it looks better now. I haven’t changed any of the discussed before, still waiting to see if someone passes through here and gives his/her opinion. I might try later on, to get the word out about what we are doing in the Argentina Project’s discussion page, some people may not even be aware of the portal or have think of it as a lost case.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I’m convinced that once the portal is up and running, more users will want to volunteer, especially from Argentina; I see that most of the work that has been made in the portal came from your contributions which are great, one of the most important things to have now, is Argentine users contributing, although I check online newspapers, I might not always know on what goes on over there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As said, I won’t change the contents of the boxes yet; I’m seeing what categories could go there, and the current format that it has now occupies too much space. I’m also trying to see what articles could go in the Topics section, the red links should be removed temporarily until they get filled, and adding them into the To-do list. Just in case, I saved a copy of the old portal layout.</dd>
