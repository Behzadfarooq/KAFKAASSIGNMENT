<p>Noticed you are currently involved with the geotechnical engineering article. I've just extented the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geosynthetics.html" title="Geosynthetics">Geosynthetics</a> article from a stub. Hoping to take the article somewhere. (I think engineering is generally neglected in Wikipedia). Was wondering if you'd take a look and see what you think. It's by no means finished but think it's got a backbone now. Comments/Edits etc. will be very welcomed. I'll be more than happy to return the favour with the Geotechnical Engineering article when you want.

<p>The AASHTO pavement design procedure has used resilient modulus to characterize the subgrade material since at least 1986 (I'm not sure that it ever used CBR). That'll remain the same in the new AASHTO guide. Resilient modulus is very difficult to measure in the lab, so lots of agencies use a CBR correlation to estimate resilient modulus. The r-value test is used the same way in some agencies (perhaps all other than California that perform the test) - not used directly in pavement design, but as a resilient modulus estimator. <a href="../../../t/o/i/User%7EToiyabe_d751.html" title="User:Toiyabe">Toiyabe</a> 21:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I see you are gradually tidying up as you go along.. The introduction needs to be redone too, bits and pieces tend to get added up there from time to time. Have you thought about making a clearer distinction between concrete the material at the time of mix design and placing, and how it behaves once it is cast solid into structures and has to survive the elements? And the production of concrete and the selection of concrete for particular requirements.. The there is the "Structural analysis" Cheers. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorydavid_d508.html" title="User:Gregorydavid">Gregorydavid</a> 22:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I was hoping not to get drawn into this discussion, and have been watching with interest from afar. I did meet John Harrison a few years ago, and it is possible that I will do so again. Indeed, he has sent me samples of his cement to test and try out in concrete. I will need a little time to sought out my views. However, my general reaction is that the article is awfully written, doesn't clear state what the cement is, and "comes across" as advertising and a little self-praising.</p>
<p>Whilst I'm here, I'd just like to thank you for the good work you are doing on tidying up concrete and cement articles. <a href="../../../k/p/e/User%7EKpeyn_3496.html" title="User:Kpeyn">Kpeyn</a> 07:56, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please be more careful about copyvio notices. The <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-cement.html" title="Eco-cement">Eco-cement</a> article was written by the copyright holder to the web pages in question, and is thus not necessarily copyvio, <b>which is why I didn't include copyvio in the AfD</b>. If the article had been written by someone with a username of <b>EcoGuy</b> or something which didn't match "John Harrison", I'd have hit it with a copyvio tag a week ago. But when AubreyJohnWestonHarrison posts an article which matches content on the web written by "John Harrison B.Sc. B.Ec. FCPA", one should assume some level of good faith. (Only some - the article is clearly vanispamvertisement, which is why I AfD'd it.) <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> 16:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>The people who practice hydrogeology, geotechnical engineering, and environmental engineering use both spellings.

You have not shown, because you cannot show, that the one-word usage is incorrect, even within the field. It's also not a UK vs U.S. issue.

<p>Comment on Landfill being in the "see also" on the Geotechnical Engineering page. The reason I removed the link was that the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landfill.html" title="Landfill">landfill</a> page talks about garbage dumps. If it also talked about raising/modifying site grade, I would have not removed it. Just wondering your thought process on keeping the landfill page in the links. I can also see a Geotechnical Engineering issues with capping/closing a landfill, and opening a landfill. Just curious? --<a href="../../../t/b/o/User%7ETbonnie_5f38.html" title="User:Tbonnie">Tom Bonnie</a> 16:35, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Successful construction, operation, and closure of large garbage dumps is a pretty important problem in geotechnical engineering, even if small in terms of volume of work. And I suppose there should be an article about grading and fill - the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grade.html" title="Grade">Grade</a> disambiguation page is awful. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 17:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's funny because I've only used Terzaghi and Vesic, although I did use Hansen once for a retaining wall. I was thinking we could cover all the major methods and perhaps include the equations for one or two of the more simple and applicable ones (Vesic is a little complex). I don't have a book with Meyerhof or Hansen's equations, so you can change it to those if you want. I'm also just a student, so I'll leave it to you to handle the stuff that happens in practice&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasar_06bc.html" title="User:Basar">Basar</a> 02:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll check with Basar - there was talk of moving the content into an article about the class of program, instead of just the one program. Otherwise, I'll add some references to show notability. The program is, in the U.S., anyway, <b>the</b> program used for dynamic analysis of pile-driving. By the way, once it's ready, can I just move it back to article-space, or do I need an admin for that? <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 22:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I wasn't involved in that. An admin came by and deleted a bunch of his articles for copyright violations. You can see his talk page for which ones.

<p>Why did you revert my change at "Landslide"&#160;? I'm new to Wikipedia and even if I didn't clean up the vandalism properly (which I was not familiar about) my entry was still an important historical land slide that destroyed an entire village near where I was born.</p>
<p>I'm talking about this change: 18:28, 10 February 2007 70.48.136.229 (Talk) (→Historical Landslides)</p>
<p>Thanks Maxime</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maxime, there were a couple of reasons, but it's mostly laziness; it's much easier when cleaning up vandalism or inappropriate edits to just revert to a previous version. I've gone and put that landslide back, because it is a useful addition to the article. (Especially because it's referenced!) <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 14:48, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
