<p>"While pleasant scents can make a room a nicer place to be in and therefore relaxing, lowering stress and related effects, there is no scientific basis at all for aromatherapy or any form of proof it does anything other than make a room smell nice. There are some that give a form of relief for the airways when having a cold or the flu, such as most citrus-based essential oils. While there is no scientific proof that essential oils cure diseases, many people have found great success in their usage."</p>
<p>This paragraph is POV. 'No scientific basis at all' is false, there have been a number of double-blind studies attributing therapeutic effect to aromatherapy. --<a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 8 July 2005 02:52 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been working to rewrite the POV parts of the article to be more neutral. I also moved the critical paragraph to the Criticism section. However, now there is little content to the article besides criticism, so I am marking it POV. Someone care to contribute? <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 10:17, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi! Abowt Phytonsides - it is not a part of EO, but it is native organic substances emitted by plants (Allium cepe, Tagetes, Pine, Narciss, Brassica niger and so on). It wide using in Russian, Japanese, Ukrainian folk medicine, phytotherapy, aromatherapy... So I thinc it may be present in AT article. Best regards, Alex Alexandrov</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your edits. Can you point to some sources about phytoncides, showing their use in aromatherapy? When I google for the words: phytoncide aromatherapy (I believe that is the correct spelling), I find only 49 hits, and several of them imply it is a fraction of essential oil. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 10:46, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks for your letter and advices, and I seek in this week for corresponded information for You - or may be translate it from Ru to Engl. Alexandrov 15:40, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Alexandrov. I reverted some of your changes because, well, they didn't make sense to me. For example, contraindications--'Inperception of scents'. I've never heard of this as a contraindication. Do you have a source for this? It would be more useful to have more specific contraindications such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Infectious diseases</li>
<li>Under the influence of alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>and according to EOs:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of EOs having <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmenagogue.html" title="Emmenagogue">emmenagogue</a> properties during pregnancy</li>
<li>use of EOs in case of known allergy</li>
<li>use of EOs with known interactions with medications</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Also I question the last sentences you added about the different sense of aromatherapy. You already mentioned the difference between home and professional AT. Is that not sufficient? --<a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 06:12, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Dforest!</p>
<p>It can be discudssed - contraind. in AT. E.g. "1-st trimestr of pregnancy" (this time embrion has high sensibility to more VOC in EO)... (as emmenagogue EO work most in big/sometimes near toxic concentration, orally)... We will see about it.</p>
<p>About the different sense of aromatherapy. May be yes... But it is really VERY different AT legislation statut in many countries. And very different medical - social practice. In France AT is more conventional Med. then in US. In UK AT = massage. In Russia, Ukraine most CAM branches is'n conventional (exept partically Homeopaty at last times). And moderator of Italian AT page admit and translate that my sentence (by the way look at big Italian Wiki-AT, and Nl. And it is very strange that France page is very short!). Really we now create AT as science and denotation (implication) of AT transformation step by step.Alexandrov 07:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I hope you would be able to give me some feedback. I am thinking of studying massage, reflexology &amp; aromatherapy in the UK and then returning to my home in South Africa to open a practice. I have been a secretary for 8 years &amp; am so sick of the mundane work! I am very interested in holistic healing &amp; think this might be something I would enjoy.</p>
<p>As I am a bit short on cash at the moment I have decided to do as much of my studying via the internet to get a feel for what it would entail to study the above before I make my choice and commiting myself to my studies.</p>
<p>I was hoping that those that have qualified as any of the above could give me feedback on your path to qualification and working life thereafter? At the moment it is seeming a little bit daunting as there are so many different oils with so many uses and properties in aromatherapy, plus all the anatomy etc in massage. Although I am very interested in the subject I wonder if it will be manageable to go back to studying after 8 years while working a full time job?!</p>
<p>Did you enjoy studying aromatherapy/massage/reflexology - did you find it quite a challenge? How long did it take you to qualify and have you found it quite easy to establish a client base? Do you make a decent salary?</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any feedback you could give me.</p>

<p>Throughout this whole article, many claims by those who practice aromatherapy are being stated as facts. I think we need a fairly extensive rewrite with a more skeptical tone. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonuhl_5dcd.html" title="User:Jasonuhl">Jasonuhl</a> 21:57, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think we need to rewrite it with a skeptical tone; that implies POV language which would be against <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. What this article needs is good research and a neutral tone. Reading the article in its current state, I don't see any obvious factual problems, though it needs references, particularly in the theraputic effects section. Could you give an example of the language you take issue with? --<a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 01:01, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even the lead sentence ("Aromatherapy...is the use of essential oils and other aromatic compounds from plants to affect someone's mood or health") implies that such treatment *does* affect mood and health. The opening sentence of the Theory section ("When aromatherapy is used for the treatment or prevention of disease,...") is similarly objectionable. The article goes on to list specific compounds and their therapeutic effects as if their efficacy was a well-established fact. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonuhl_5dcd.html" title="User:Jasonuhl">Jasonuhl</a> 19:04, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you enter essential oils and antiviral in Google Scholor you get a bunch of in vitro studies. The same for antibacterial. Most of it is published in botany, virology or microbiology journals, not in journals aimed at the medical community. Cayte</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not surprising. Aromatherapy counts for a very small percentage of essential oil uses. Also, in vitro studies are a lot cheaper to do that in vivo.

<p>"Although there is little proof that aromatherapy can cure diseases, there is considerable anecdotal evidence of its benefits." This is a counterfactual in the light of in vitro studies plus clinial studies in France and Germany. It should be attributed or deleted. Cayte</p>

<p>Medical consensus on aromatherapy varies from country to country so the term medical professionals should be qualified.</p>
<p>Scientists are only authoritative within their specialty. In the context of aromatherapy, biochemists would be authoritative. Meteorologists would not. An unqualified reference to scientists is meaningless.</p>
<p>Its inaccurate to state that scientific literature contains only anecdotal evidence. A search of the literature turns up in-vitro and clinical studies. Their quality may be in dispute but not their existence.Cayte 04:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)Cayte</p>

<p>The following reference contains a journal of clinical studies not adverts. It is available on sciencedirect.com, a site of Elsevior. Elsevior is a publisher of science articles. I don't see how it could be construed as commercial except on the assumption that ANY studies of aromatherapy must be commercially rather than scientifically motivated.

<p>hello, there's some strange stuff at the very bottom of the aromatherapy page. it looks like some type of table and text that has not formatted properly. just letting you know (i don't want to remove it if someone intended for something to be there. maybe it can be properly formatted?) 68.34.158.128 22:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)alexis</p>
