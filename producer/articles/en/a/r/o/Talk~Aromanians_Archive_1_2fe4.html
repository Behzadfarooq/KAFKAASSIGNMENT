<p>The Identity Crisis section is almost as big a mess as this talk page. Besides the conflicting and sometimes contradictory information that has resulted from the numerous edit wars documented on this page, it is rife with poor grammar. I suspect it is not the product of a native speaker of the English language. Someone please do something!71.106.97.72 23:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This was added in a recent version to replace a previous section:</p>
<p>"In Greece, their number is estimated to be approximately 200,000 and they are highly respected by all members of the Greek society, being considered to be Latin-speaking Greeks, while their national pride and patriotism is exactly the same with their Greek-speaking counterparts, judging from their centuries old customs, music and culture.</p>
<p>Aromanians are also regarded as <i>ethniki evergete</i> (national benefactors in Greek) by their fellow countrymen, an honorable title for just a small portion of the Greek nation. Wealthy Greeks of Aromanian descent, who had made mythical fortunes overseas, contributed decisively to the construction and further economic aid of public buildings in the new-found Greek state of the 19th century. These deeds include the construction of the <i>Ethniko Metsovio Polytechnio</i> (National Metsovo Technical University), Metsovo being a historical town in Epirus (northwestern Greece) with one of the most famous Aromanian communities nationwide. Other important buildings among many others that were either supported economically or constructed by capitals of Aromanians are the Zappion Palace (named after Evangelos Zappas, its main contributor), the Athens Academy, the Hellenic Military Academy etc.</p>
<p>Great Aromanians of Greece are Konstantinos Krystallis, the most famous bucolic poet of the nation, and also Ioannis Kolettis, first prime minister of Greece and father of the ideology of the <i>Megali Idea</i> (Great Idea in Greek), the Greek people's motive force to liberate their enslaved brothers from Ottoman rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."</p>
<p>I doubt its validity.

<dd>There have been no Aromanians ever in Serbia - excluding a small number of emigrants (or more precisely migrant workers) in the second half of the 19th century. In Bulgaria there were 2,000-3,000 of them in Pirin Macedonia and the majority of them eventually resettled in Romania during the 1920s and 30s. As regards the estimated number of them - 1.0 to 2.0 mln, that is clearly a joke. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 15:27, September 2, 2005 (UTC)~</dd>

<p>As to whether there are Vlachs in Greece or not, there certaintly are. My grandfather is from Greek Macedonia and calls himself a "Vlaxos," although also identifying himself as 100% Greek. He grew up speaking a language that was half greek half latin, although he hasn't used it for decades since moving to central Greece. As to whether this language is still in existence I do not know. 6.13.06</p>

<dd>He he, I think we are going right at the heart of Greek nationalism here. Didn't you guys know? "There are no minorities in Greece"(lol). Ask most Greeks and they will tell you. Greece is for Greeks only. What? Aromanians. No, they have nothing in common with Romanians. They are Greeks too. -- I am sorry to all the Greek nationalists but on Wikipedia we try to present matters in a NPOV.

<dd>I agree that a lot of the edits' tone is not NPOV. However, a lot of the information is valuable, particularly the part on education in Aromanian in Albania, and should therefore be kept. The part on Romania's involvement is a bit of guesswork and also quite implausible. Romania is joining the EU in less than a year, and Greece was one of the first countries to ratify the accession treaty (and on the whole Greek-Romanian relations are very good). So, the prospect of Greece vetoing Romania's accession is actually impossible. All it could do is vote against accession in 2007, so that the safeguard clause can be triggered and accession can be delayed to 2008. But Greece does not have veto power in the Council of the EU - a majority of states have to vote "no" to 2007. Anyway, this type of thing, due to a fairly minor issue, is remote and unlikely to occur, to say the least. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 06:11, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Guesswork? Not really!</b> The Vlachs of Greece are a taboo issue right now as the article of the official Romanian Global News ( see <a href="http://www.rgnpress.ro/content/view/10349" class="external free" title="http://www.rgnpress.ro/content/view/10349" rel="nofollow">http://www.rgnpress.ro/content/view/10349</a>) clearly points out. RGN als o gives an indirect hint of the things about to come (in less that a year time). I say: you'd better get accustomed. The idea that the Romanians lost interest in the Vlachs of Greece is pure Greek wishful thinking. It's just a temporary stance and noone will and can prevent the Romanians to re-establish their educational work among the Vlachs of Greece that started way back in the 186o's.

<p>Hi. I've noticed that there seems to be factual dispute here between whether or not Aromanian is a protected language in Greece. Are there any sources for this? From what I know - and this may not be 100% correct - Greece does not recognise any ethnic minorities or any minority languages (in the same way, that, say Romania or Hungary do). There may be a structure for protected languages at national level, however, similar to the way that Sweden has Romany and Yiddish as "historical minority languages" at national level (but in reality there is no administrative recognition). Is this the case in Greece?

<dd>There is Turkish in Thrace. It is taught in the minority's schools, there is mass media in Turkish, there are Turkish interpreters at government agencies (police stations, courts etc) - you know, the whole nine yards. I'm afraid though; that there are no other languages in Greece with such facilities and promotion. As far as I know, Aromanian is not officially recognised as a protected language (as the article claims) or as anything else. This is what the Bletsas case was about. Bletsas was claiming that there are people in northern Greece who speak Aromanian (he also mentioned Slavic (Macedonian), Pomak (Bulgarian) and Arvanitika), and a right-wing MP sued him for publishing false information. Bletsas was acquitted in the end though. Presumably, this means that the Greek authorities are aware of the presence of Aromanian, but, as far as I know, it has received no recognition. <a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 23:19, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK - I think this should be reflected in the article. I don't mean this in a bad way, but the whole Bletsas case, from what I hear about it, is quite worrying. Is minority rights not really an issue in Greece (I mean, it's an issue nearly everywhere else in Europe, and nearly all EU countries do have quite solid minority rights legislation). <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 06:06, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Come on Ronline! Let's not beat about the bush. The Greeks do not admit that there are other natives in Greece other than they themselves. They only recognise the religious Muslim minority but not the Turks or the Pomaks as such and under the respective names. There are only Greeks in Greece and some recently arrived immigrants: aliens with uncertain status. This attitude really is bordering the absurdity not to say the sheer idiocy but then..Afta ine Eladha mas. What can we do really? <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostolos_Margaritis_aa4f.html" title="User:Apostolos Margaritis">Apostolos Margaritis</a> 17:51, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Aromanian proverbs:</p>
<p>How can you recognize a bird&#160;? By the way it sings and How can you recognize a boor&#160;? By the way he speaks; For He is as civil as a hedge and will skin your face A boor Never knows his place As How can a sheperd tell a good thing from a bad one? An uncouth man is like wood unplaned, You suddenly find He raps out something at you like a whack Saying: Don't think of what I was, better look at what I am. And Don't look at the coat, see what's under it, And don't scurb every pig you see or you won't long be clean yourself But Beware of a gipsy turned a Turk or of a boor turned a Greek Beware of God's wrath, of a king's ire and a boor's squeal.</p>

Theathenae is not happy with it and keeps DELETING it. All right then, let's play this silly cat and mouse game. I one think that the Avdela born Margarit is a representative enough personality, a symbol of the pro-Romanian Vlachdom if you wish.

<p>Greco-Aromanian refers to the hellenised Aromanians; it's simple english, not a self-descriptive name used by Aromanians. I got the information on Arnanji from an Aromanian website, which doesn't have have a reason to lie. After all it says <i>possibly</i>, it never states it as a fact.

<dd>Greier, I understand that have put a lot of work into your version, I think certain aspects of it are unacceptable. Besides the fact that it is dominated by POV pushing, you conveniently and skillfully "forget" to mention the fact that the Aromanians in Greece want to have nothing to do with Romania and the Romanians; is not even mentioned and the fact that they view themselves as an integral part of Greek society and calling them a "minority" is highly offensive, but you go well beyond that. You are telling them that they are an ethnic group and are not Greeks. I think you are aware of the reaction of the Vlach cultural leadership the last time someone (Bletsas) tried that. Aside from fixing these features of your version, I think a little restructuring would be in order, perhaps move all the parts of the "Identity Crisis" section on the topic of Aromanian history and move them to a "History" section. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 19:01, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It cleary says: IDENTITY CRISIS! Those who consier themselves greeks, then they are greeks. Not Aromanians. It does not have anything to do with Romanian or identifing with Romania. It has to do with indetifing as Aromanians. And this the article is all about. About Aromanians. About Aromanian culture, history, language. Not about Greeks. For those Aromanians that think they are Greeks, I tell them that they are not Aromanians, but they are what they ARE FREE TO BE: that is GREEKS! NOT AROMANIANS!!!. Aromanians are those who protect the Aromanian identity and language. It has nothing to do with identifing with Romanians or not. That is what Panayote Elias Dimitras also sayd. It sayd that Aromanians can be free to consider themselves Greek citizens of Aromanian ethinicity. But Greece and Greeks, don`t agree, and as the article shows, never agreed with the fact that despite the fact that Aromanians are patriotic, they are something different from the Greeks. What`s with all these theories, about their origin, about how they are Greeks that happen to speak latin, etc.? And they want to turn them into Greeks. Well, it`s basic logic: if you consider yourself a Greek, than you are a Greek. May you have Aromanian, Mongol or Somalese blood. But if you do, then pardon me: what right do you have to call yourself Aromanian? This article is not for these so called "Aromanians". This is for the Aromanians who consider themselves: A - RO - MA - NI - ANS! not Greeks, not "Latin speaking Greeks", not nothing, just Aromanians, with their own history, language, identity, culture, etc, different than that of Greeks, Romanians, Albanians, Chinese, Mexicans, etc. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">greier</a> 19:17, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>calling them a "minority" is highly offensive</i> How come they feel offensed about being called a minority? arent they one? don`t they have a separate language, culture, history than that of the majority? isn`t that the definition of a <i>minority</i>? Was this always the same? Did Aromanians always consider themselves <i>as an integral part of Greek society</i>? That`s what the article refers. About how a people so different were brainwashed. Hence the title: IDENTITY CRISIS. It`s about their history in relation with what they nowdays thin they are, that is, it`s a history about the relation they had with the Greeks. How come these hellenist, who from the 9th century to the middle of the 20th century, not only had a separate identity, language, culture, history than that of the greeks, are now so brainwashed. But it`s not enough they are brainwashed. They continue to call themselves Aromanians, with an incredible disresprect for the Aromanians who died (yes, DIED), and who still fight for their identity. The real Aromanians. This article is for people like Bletsas. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">greier</a> 19:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greier, if this article is about the Aromanians according to your POVish definition of the word (id est: not Greeks) then the first thing u should do, is to reduce their numbers in a couple of dozens and to exclude all these prominents (Kolettis, Rigas, etc) who were (according to <b>your</b> definition of the word) nothing but Greeks. Secondly, about your definition on 'minority': do u have idea about the aromanian culture and history? is that different from the one of the Greeks? the only difference that <b>we</b> have from the rest of the Greeks is the 2nd mother tangue!(yes, both aromanian and greek are mother tangus for us, no matter if it is hard for u to understand it...). it was the pro-romanian propaganda of the late 19th century that tried to brainwash the aromanians (but as u probably know, it <b>failed</b>). honestly, as an aromanian, i never had nor saw any aromanian having a sort of identity crisis. maybe people like Bletsas and the nazi supporters of WWII (see Principality of Pindus) see such a crisis. --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 01:24, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems that this article is creating controversy once again, and to be honest I think the controversy arises from the fact that the Greek concept of ethnicity and nationality is quite different to that of the rest of Europe. In Romania, Italy, Spain, Germany and most of the other countries in Europe, there is this key idea of minority rights when discussing cultural identity. This doesn't mean that national identity is harmed in any way. For example, in Germany, many Sorbs consider themselves German alongside their Sorbian ethnicity, while in Romania, ethnic Roma often see themselves as Romanian too. This is because ethnicity and citizenship/nationality are different. However, ethnic identity is also important: Roma from Romania see themselves as ethnic Roma, even if they are Romanian nationals. In Spain, Basques see themselves as Basques, even if they may also see themselves as Spanish nationals. This concept is quite simple (even simplistic, in today's age of transculturation): each person is both a citizen of a state and a member of a given ethnicity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In Greece, this concept seems to different, and it is this concept that a lot of us from the rest of Europe can't seem to understand. We often ask ourselves: why is it that in Greece these Aromanians, who are clearly another ethnic group under most definitions, why is it that they so actively oppose being classified as a separate grouping? In the rest of Europe, being classified as a separate ethnic group is in nearly all cases a source of pride, and governments encourage this through minority rights legislation. Now, I'm not trying to blame Greece in any way, but it would be great if we could get to know each other better, because I think the majority of non-Greeks are used to the mainstream European concept/notion of minority rights, and hence consider it quite natural that the Aromanians, even only as a linguistic minority, should be considered separate from other Greek nationals. Why is it that they do not wish to be perceived as such? My current explanation is that, unlike in other EU countries, Greece is still very much a nation-state, and it is frowned upon for people to see themselves as being non-Greek - there is still some discrimination in that way. This also explains, for example, Greece fails to recognise any ethnic minority, and why it still has an established church (the Greek Orthodox Church), something which for us in secular Europe is quite hard to understand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One reason why the "Aromanians are Greeks" argument does not really make sense to me is because Aromanians live in countries other than Greece, and there they do not proclaim a Hellenic identity. If Aromanians considered themselves Greeks in Greece, then by extension their culture is virtually Greek, and thus they should also see themselves as mainly Greek in the Republic of Macedonia, or in Albania. In these countries, which have a view of minority rights more in line with the rest of Europe (and I don't mean that in a negative way), Aromanians are recognised as an ethnic minority, and they have language rights, seats in parliament, etc, and they <i>do not</i> actively oppose that. They do not plead to be considered either Greek or Macedonian, for example. So I ask again: why is it that the Greek case is different? Is it not because of Greek minority policy and overall concept/ideology regarding minorities? Why is minority even an insult in Greece at all? In Romania, for example, minority is used as a badge of pride by Hungarians, Roma, Ukrainians and even Greeks. The case is similar in the rest of Europe. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 05:11, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I do find it very odd that this whole article as it stands is protected, because the overall tone is obviously partial, but more specifically because there are some very clearly POV passages of the type that not generally permitted elsewhere on wikipedia, particularly the extremely POV and agenda-led definition of 'Hellenism' - in which any neutral account would mention a "doctrine" of the "pre-eminence" of Greek culture rather than its "superiority" - the current version, particularly with its pointed references to "superiority" and "inferiority" , presents Greek nationalism as inherently different from any other nationalism in this respect through the use of that terminology, which is absurd, and is making a clear political point. The emphasis on "total identity erasure" is also obviously highly arguable and strongly POV - the description of an inexorable momentum towards assimilation is absolutely correct, but if there was a continuing process of complete identity erasure there would not have been the restricted concessions of identity to pro-Greek vlachs that are mentioned. A couple of other clearly non-neutral passages &#160;: the article appears to suggests that there was no self-identifying greek population at all in epirus in the late 19th cenrury, which is an extraordinary assertion, and not supported by any neutral sources anywhere&#160;; (and also a hint of the rarer, more radical agenda that is part of the background of Greece's paranoia and ineptitude in its dealings with minority rights issues in the north) . "Greek theories about vlach origins have been advanced for political reasons" - this may or may not be true, but again, it's incongruously an argument and aseertion rather than the basic factual narrative you usually see on wiki . Finally the passage about the word "vlach" in modern greek might perhaps also mention that the old word for idiot "vlakas", nevertheless understandably offensive for a vlach, has become totally separate from the modern word "vlahos", meaning vlach.</p>
<p>I get the feeling an "all or nothing" approach to protecting this article has developed, which is understandable because of a lot of useful factual background information provided by one faction of posters,and sometimes incorrectly amended by the Greek ones , but the result is definitely not acceptable by the standards of wikipedia's NPOV policy and nearly all of its articles.</p>

<dd>Apostole, not only that the page is not copywrited, but the edits clearly didn`t contained <i>mot a mot</i> copying... However, I do understand what you mean: you think it`s kind of "rude" to plagiarise from there. But I did not take credit or received any benefits from the edit, and my goal was to add info, and for other users to "polish" it further. But not like what has just happened: your removal of parts of the article triggered a "hacking" frenzy by users like Hectorian. It was like a drop of blood in the ocea: small, but enough to excite the berserk sharks... I honestly think you rushed... How do you think Apostole that Wikipedia works? Do you think there are Phd profferors, scientists and poets colaborating to write articles? The articles based on other internet sites. The author of the Vlachophiles page is the Vlach-British society, and I can see why I can`t use it for a reference. And the removal of quotes (like that of Sir <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Evans_bd15.html" title="Arthur Evans">Arthur Evans</a> regarding the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Question_725c.html" title="Macedonian Question">Macedonian Question</a>) are unneeded. But still, please bare in mind that despite that it was not copied word by word from there, I still understant what you are trying to say, and I agree that I could be held responsable of accidental plagiarisation due to poor citationing and referencesing, so I`ll remove the paragraphs which are more succeptible of disputes, and I ask you to contineue to tone down and copy-edit the whole article (besided the removal of the parts in question, you did made some good chages to the readabillity: i`ve kept what I could spot, but there ma may be parts that I missed). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">greier</a> 12:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="http://www.farsarotul.org/nl21_2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.farsarotul.org/nl21_2.htm" rel="nofollow">This link</a> also says:</p>
<p><i>The Greek response to this issue was a defiant one. Greek Vlach associations were formed. They too held congresses. I have attended such a congress, and, <b>although treated with great courtesy, could not help noticing the phalanx of bishops and generals sitting in the front row and the way in which speaker after speaker used dubious arguments from history, folklore and philology to forge links between Greeks and Vlachs</b>. Historical and linguistic scholarship in Greek universities follows the same lines. All Greek Vlachs and some non Greek Vlachs use a great many Greek words, the former because they are using Greek and Vlach interchangeably, the latter because Greek has been the language of education for three hundred years or more. Thus there are no philological grounds for linking Greeks with Vlachs from the earliest times any more than in parallel cases with Greek in Southern Italy and Cypriot in London, where a mixed language merely reflects a long period of contact10.</i></p>
<p><i>Towards their Greekless brethren in other Balkan countries <b>Greek Vlachs have adopted a missionary attitude of trying to convert them to the idea that Vlachs are Greeks</b>. In the case of some Albanians they seem to have succeeded, but this is hardly surprising as it is not only Albanian Vlachs who want to find work in Greece. etc....</i></p>
<p><br />
So it`s clear that the claim that <i>"however by 1905 the majority of vlachs in Greece had thrown in their lot with the greek state in their quest to throw off Ottoman rule"</i> is taken out of context. The article already says that Aromanians fought against Ottomans, having identifing as fellow Orthodox people with the greeks, albanians, bulgarians... But still, as proven, they still had separate identity and goals <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">greier</a> 15:47, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Yes, but the article , with its references to the process of Hellenisation, also explains why the vlachs of Greece would already have identified more with the nation they found themselves in by 1905 than vlachs in several other nations. It also says&#160;: "there was a struggle in most Vlach villages between a pro-Romanian and pro-Greek party with the latter being almost universally and inevitably the larger and more powerful."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But saying that <i>"however by 1905 the majority of vlachs in Greece had thrown in their lot with the greek state in their quest to throw off Ottoman rule"</i> is redundant and irrelevant. Also, by 1905, Greece was for 70 years an independent state. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">greier</a> 16:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know it sounds a slanted and non-contextualised statement; however, I only put it in to counteract the equally non-contextualised statement, as it stood in the previous edit , that all vlach history in Greece was essentially a single, continual narrative of momentum towards autonomy " a long history of struggle for independence" - which is very simplistic and one-sided. The Greek/Vlach history and interaction is much more complicated than that, I would say, and Winnifrith supports that view.</p>

<dd>You`ve also made some changes which I accepted, did`n you? So I would of had nothign against toning down that paragraph... And my point exaclty was that the Greek/Vlach history and interaction is much more complicated than simply saying that Vlachs are Greeks and that Vlachs had always considered themselves Greeks and that they fought for the idea of Greece and Greekness, and other such statements... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">greier</a> 16:21, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The urban element among the Vlachs has been almost completely Hellenized; it has always displayed great aptitude for commerce, and Athens owes many of its handsomest buildings to the benefactions of wealthy Vlach merchants. The nomad population in the mountains has retained its distinctive nationality and customs together with its Latin language, though most of the men can speak Greek. Like the Albanians, the pastoral <b>Vlachs seldom intermarry with the Greeks</b>; they occasionally take Greek wives, but never give their daughters to Greeks; many of them are illiterate, and their children rarely attend the schools. Owing to their deficient intellectual culture <b>they are regarded with disdain by the Greeks</b>, who employ the term j3M~os to denote not only a shepherd but an ignorant rustic.</i></p>

Πολεμηθέντες παρά τoυ βασιλέως Tραΐανoύ και παντελώς εκτριβέντες, εάλωσαν ... ούτοι γαρ εισίν οι λεγόμενοι Δάκαι και Βέσοι ώκουν δε πρότερον πλησίον του Δανουβίου ποταμού και του Σάου, ... ένθα νυν Σέρβοι αρτίως οικουσιν, εν οχυροίς και δυσβάτoις τόποις. Τούτοις θαρρούντες υπεκρίνοντο αγάπην και δούλωσιν προς τους αρχαιοτέρους των Ρωμαίων βασιλείς και εξερχόμενοι των οχυρωμάτων ελεΐζοντο τας χώρας των Ρωμαίων όθεν αγανακτήσαντες κατ' αυτών, ως είρηται, διέφθεφαν αυτούς οι και εξελθόντες των εκείσε διεσπάρησαν εν πάση τη Ηπείρω και Μακεδονία, οι δε πλείονες αυτών ώκησαν την Ελλάδα ... ".</i> u are right,he does mention 'Dacians' as well. however, he says 'from the region where the Serbs live now... so, he clearly says 'south of the Danube'... not surprised that u just editted 'along the Danube', in order to satisfy your POV and mislead the reader that 'maybe northern of the river... maybe from present day Romania...'. he also says 'οι λεγόμενοι Δάκαι και Βέσοι', passive syntax, i.e. supposed to be the descendants of. in addition, he says they fought against <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trajan.html" title="Trajan">Trajan</a> who scattered them to greece. see when he reigned please! miracullo! they fought against Trajan! were is the theory of their arrival in the 6th-7th century? it is only in some minds who want to connect them with the romanians... what a pity... i was right when i said that there have been used a selective usage of sources in this article. no need to answer in the other comments above about <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch_Athenagoras_2f86.html" title="Patriarch Athenagoras">Patriarch Athenagoras</a>, the <i>millet i Rum</i>, gala vlahas, and your POV about how the Aromanians view themselves more than a century ago, not about the 'nostalgic and not based on a hidden political agenda' attempt of Romania to brainwash them...

I knew, because I know what I`m talking about, unlinke you... I knew he clearly mentions the Danube and the Sava, and even mentions Trajan`s war as a reason for Vlachs dissobeintment to the Romans (in Kekaumenos case: Greeks) So, I`ve shown you that I was rigth, but you choose to insult me for, my my, great Romanian propaganda, because I sayd "on the Danube" instead of "south of the Danube' (by the way, I`ll search for the exact transaltion, as I doubt it is as you say). And not only that, yesterday you were ready to quote Kekaumenos when he says Vlachs came only from the Bessi, but now, when it was proven I was right, you start all this shit about how Kekaumenos speaks BS, because how can be possible this, when refering to the second century AD.

<dd>I have no problem to admit it when i am wrong, so, i loudly say: yes, he also refered to the Dacians! but the problem is that i was not aware of the text as much as i thought i were. on the contary, u claim to know 'everything' on the matter, but falsified his words (i want to believe that it was the translation that tricked u, and not yourself who deliberately wrote these things). the reign of Trajan, who forced them to immigrate, is dated in the 1st-2nd cen AD..., yet u wrote that they came in Greece 'somewhere between the 5th and 7th centuries'... isn't that your POV (contradicting the reference u had just given, i.e. Kekaumenos? well, i gave u the chance to see the original extract from his work, written in the language he wrote. i am a greek (and aromanian, weather u believe it or not) speaker, so i know what he meant. search yourself and find a GOOD (not biased) translation. i have nothing to be afraid on this! btw, when Kekaumenos said 'Romans', he did not mean 'Greeks'... Trajan was not greek... the Byzantine Empire was not yet created (in the time he talks about), and he talks about the <i>αρχαιοτέρους των Ρωμαίων βασιλείς</i> (=the most ancient Roman kings), clearly not about the greeks-selective usage of sources again!!! lastly, sorry, but i cannot see where u were right about de Tudela... --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 00:03, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, let`s take it one by one... First, to clarify once and for all what <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_of_Tudela_f906.html" title="Benjamin of Tudela">Benjamin of Tudela</a> says:<i>"From there it is a day`s journey to Sinon Potamo, where there are about fifty jews, at their head being R. Solomon and R. Jacob. The city is situated at the foot of the hills of Wallachia. The <b>nation</b> called Wallachians live in those mountains. They are as swift as hinds, and they swep down from the mountains to despoil and ravage the lands of Greece. No man can go and do battle with them, and no king can rule over them. They do not hold fast to the faith of Nazarens, but give themselves jewish names. Some people say that they are jews, and, in fact, they call the jews theyr brethren, and when they met them, tough they rob them, they refrain from killing them <b>as they kill the Greeks</b>. They are alltogheter lawless"</i> - Libro de Viages de Benjamin de Tudela" - Translation by Marcus Nathan Adler (1907). Includes map of route (pg.2) and commentary. <a href="http://www.teachittome.com/seforim2/seforim/masaos_binyomin_mitudela_with_english.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.teachittome.com/seforim2/seforim/masaos_binyomin_mitudela_with_english.pdf" rel="nofollow">.pdf</a>. So leave aside this BS about how he sayd that they are not a "a separate ethnic group, but as a group of rebels", the "lost tribe of Israel", and all that caca...</dd>
<dd>Second: I did not falsified Kekaumenos words. "where serbs now live" doesn`t mean south of the Danube. The Sava and the Danube pass thorugh the land of the serbs, not south of it. Moreover, except for a desperate cling, I fail to see the importance of that it is north or south of the Danube... It`s just a river, not an ocean...</dd>
<dd>Third: about Romans, Greeks and Vlachs... You should of known that the Greeks <b>did</b> consider themselves to be Romans. And this is clearly seen from other texts of Kekaumenos. For example, here`s a paragraph from the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategikon.html" title="Strategikon">Strategikon</a> which uses the name Romans for Greeks, and at the same time also mentions Vlachs: <i>"Let it be known to you, Vestes, that Peter, the legitimate nephew of the Germans' king, as come into the service of our majesty and has affirmed, so he claims, that he is and shall die a servant of my majesty. After accepting his loyalty, my majesty styled him a spatharios of the golden triclinium. But since he is a foreigner, my majesty did not allow him to be appointed general, lest we harm the Romans. Instead it promoted him domestic of the excubitoi under you. But because my imperial rule recognizes that you hold this position from my blessed father through a chrysobull, it shall give you the rule of the Vlachs of Hellas instead of the excubiti."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So Kekaumenos, aware (on good grounds/on basseless grounds) of the "Dacian and Bessi" origin of the Vlachs, mentioned Trajan as the reason for the dissobeintment of the Vlachs (Dacians) towards the Greeks (Romans).</p>
<p>And frases like "the Byzantine Empire was not yet created (in the time he talks about)" that prooves your blatant ignorance. You still live with the fantastic idea that the Byzantine Empire was a greek creation, made up only be greek elements... No wonder, as you greeks have totaly hijacked the articles about the Byzantine Empire... The history Byzantine Empire started in April 21, 753 BC in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. It was not a greek initiated state, but a Roman one (by name: <i><b>Romania</b></i>, and by origin <i>Constantine, the <b>Roman</b> emperor</i>). It only becomed greecised as time passed. But even so, the bulk of the armies were not Greek. An empire is multiethnic by definition, and the Byzantine Empire meant, for example Albanian and Armenian, as much as it meant Greek from the point of view of the armies and populations. An empire`s character, be it Latin or Greek, is given by the language used in administration... Now let`s laugh a little... the "Greek" army in the 13th century: <i>"descendit in Italiam cum exercitu magno, ie Russorum, Guandalorum, Turcorum, Burgarorum, Vlachorum, Macedonum, aliarumque ut caperet Siciliam"</i>. Turkic tribes, Varangians, Vlachs, Bulgarians.... actually it makes sense: you, these dubios descendants of the ancient Hellenes, are rather the descendants of Slavs, Vlachs, Albanians and Turks...ha hahahah hhaha....anybody knows that.... hahahha hhaha <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">greier</a> 10:35, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not sure if your comment deserves a reply, since u seem to be by definition "anti-hellenic"... so, u <b>do not want</b> to understand... Just one thing (cause u bolded a word for reasons that u know well): the Byzantine Empire was called 'Romania' (Ρωμανία), not '<a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>' (Ρουμανία), your country (interesting to note that this term was invented in the 19th century to make the Wallachians and Moldovans believe they belong to the same nation and that they have imperial (Roman) past... hahaha... this is <b>undisputable</b>! what u say about the greeks may well be disputed...

<p>Can somebody please refactor (i.e. weed out) this talk page so that an outsider has some slight chance of understanding what you guys have been fighting about? There's an awful lot of unconstructive POV trolling around here - on both sides, I dare say. Can I urge <i>everybody</i> involved here to use some restraint and refrain from wholesale POV attacks and childish rhetorics. Also please refrain from original research. IMHO, it makes rather little sense for you or me to try to present our own interpretation of the meanig of some source by Kekaumenos or whatnot. Just get a grip on the literature and write decent summaries of what modern historians say.</p>

<dd>i think it is not enough reason to keep the tag.

<dd>from what i could see, the pages that mention this are outdated version of this article on some wikipedia mirrors.

<p>...if a section on famous/prominent Aromanians (Tsintsars) is created?

<p>TO THE EDITORS OF THIS PAGE: What I want to say is that all greeks, romanians, macedonians, serbians, albanians, bulgarians, should shut up once and forever. How you can speak of Aromanians? what they are? what they speak? etc etc when you are not aromanians, let the aromanians speak. I am an aromanian and i can say that we are not what you say we are. we are just aromanians, who have not a country because of nacionalist people like you, we had a country in the roman empire, today we are discriminated by all of the above countries regarding language and identity, and also threaten if we show ambition of being aromanian. we speak different language and if you speak this language you know that it is like more similar to a latin-illyrian language.</p>
<p>i suggest to the editors of this encyclopedia when making it to go to find the vlach in america and ask them, who they are and what proof they have and where do they base their argument? dont listen to anybody of balkans, because you see how they try to robbe a nation of its identity.</p>
<p>base everything from what the vlach say? no greeks who just make propaganda and behave like uneducated people, and no other of the above nationalities, except the albanians and macedonians, aromanians were maybe you can find some reliable sources.</p>
<p>as an aromanian i was very surprise to see this people here takling bulshit, that only an aromanian knows that they are not true, because they are bias and in own interests how they siute to them.</p>
<p>aromanians have been one of the less nationalistic nation in the world, for us what we want was the roman empire a borderless balkans because we are spread in allover balkans and thats the only way we can be in one country peacefully with other nations, which now is the resamblance of EU. so far so good.</p>
<p>Aromanian is a term to call this gorup, but if you would refer to an individual you say just: he is an Aroman=A+Roman (A=may stand for Ancient, Antic, Ante, even maybe Ethnic Roman or Ancestor which may mean Ancestor Romans= romans are the anccestors of this group)</p>
<p>thanks, and dont warry for aromanians noone will steal our identity. we dont read books to learn who we are, our parents tell us who we are.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't bother explaining the "a"... <i>In Greek, a- is a prefix (alpha privativum) meaning "not" or "devoid of," used in many borrowed words in English, German and Romance languages (for example, amoral, asexual, arhythmic).</i>... Conclusions are yours... <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 16:57, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>maybe in greek, but in aromanian language means something else, we call ourself aroman which is not greek word and not vlach in greek. argue about vlach which is greek but not aroman</p>
<p>The Latin <b>ante</b> is generally used in the sense of</p>
<pre>
  before, in regard to position, order, or time, and the Gr.
  'anti` in that of opposite, or in the place of.
</pre>
<p><br />
and here are some aromanian proverbs which have a meaning, and they have teached us when we were children:</p>
<p>How can you recognize a bird ? By the way it sings</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>How can you recognize a boor ? By the way he speaks for;</p>
<p>He is as civil as a hedge and will skin your face</p>
<p>A boor Never knows his place</p>
<p>this is as: How can a sheperd tell a good thing from a bad one?</p>
<p>An uncouth man is like wood unplaned,</p>
<p>You suddenly find out</p>
<p>He raps out something at you like a whack</p>
<p>Saying: Don't think of what I was, better look at what I am.</p>
<p>And Don't look at the coat, see what's under it, And don't scurb every pig you see or you won't long be clean yourself</p>
<p>But allways: Beware of a gipsy turned a Turk or of a boor turned a Greek Beware of God's wrath, of a king's ire and a boor's squeal.</p>
<p>Vlahos 08:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC) Where and when we had a country ? "no greeks who just make propaganda and behave like uneducated people" A vlach can't feel vlach and greek simultaneously ? "i suggest to the editors of this encyclopedia when making it to go to find the vlach in america" America is the metropolis of vlachs ?</p>
<p><br />
AMERICA IS A FREE COUNTRY. AND YOU KNOW IT WELL IMPERSONATOR OF AROMANIANS WHICH CALL YOURSELF "VLAHOS" IF YOU WERE AROMAN YOU WILL PUT YOUR USERNAME AROMAN AND NOT VLAHOS. AROMANIANS ARE NOT GREEKS, AND THEY CANT BE, BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BE GREEKS AND NOT AROMANIAN.</p>
<p>I AM SORRY TO HEAR HERE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES, HIDING BEHIND A SCREEN, IMPERSONATING AND SPEAKING IN NAME OF THE AROMANIANS.</p>
<p>PLEASE FIND TRUE AROMANIAN, WHO SAY WE ARE AROMANIAN AND ANYTHING ELSE, AND ASK THEM.</p>
<p>AND TO THIS NACIONALIST HERE: DONT CONFUSE NATIONALITY, WITH CITIZIENSHIP. AROMANIANS ARE ONLY AROMANIANS BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE, AND CITIZIENS OF THE COUNTRIES THEY LIVE. DONT BE AFRAID, THEY WILL ASK FOR PARTS OF YOUR COUNTRIES AND MAKE THEIR OWN. WE ARE BETTER WHERE WE LIVE BECAUSE WE ARE EDUCATED AND IN GOOD POSITIONS, BUT WHICH HAVE TO HIDE OUR IDENTITY IN ORDER TO BE THERE. AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHO ARE WE, YOU JUST CAN, WE CAN FOOL YOU DAY AND NIGHT. ARE YOU ANGRY?? PLEASE DONT.</p>
<p>and the point is not what are aromanians, but preserve this unique language and culture which is not a threat to noones identity. and today, i dont know who and how they make history, but aromanians, albanians, and macedonians there is a very strong link they are one of the lost tribes of jewish people, and even today you can see that they perfer to put anccient names or jewish names. my name is a jewish name also and i am aroman. this is something inhereted to put this fashion and famous names. and albanians have that white hat in the head same like the jewish and have different names, and they are very ancient people and their main beleive is freedom. and are not religiose people, or neither belive in god.</p>
