<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/o/Aroma_amore.html" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h2>
<p>At the beginning of this episode, <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furrball.html" title="Furrball">Furrball</a> is being pursued by two angry bully cats down the middle of a busy street. Furrball escapes his tormentors but is inadvertently run-over by a truck painting the traffic lines on the road. Furrball recovers, completely unaware that he now has a white stripe down the middle of his back. Ever unlucky, the dazed Furrball stumbles over to the entrance of the Acme Acres Junkyard, which also happens to be the home of <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifi_Le_Fume_dd74.html" title="Fifi Le Fume">Fifi Le Fume</a>. Reading a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_novel.html" title="Romance novel">romance novel</a>, Fifi remarks, "<i>Le</i> sigh, love eez <i>tres</i> cool, no?" and begins pining for some of her own: "I know my true love eez out zere, somewhere..." Lucky for her, but not so much for Furrball, she instantly notices him standing outside the entrance to her home, catching his breath, and she mistakes him for a boy of the same species. Fifi's eyes light-up, her <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart.html" title="Heart">heart</a> beats out of her chest and she swoons, "Ooh la la! <i>Mon <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petite.html" title="Petite">petite</a></i> skunk <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunk.html" title="Hunk">hunk</a>!" Clasping her hands and swooning, she declares, "Beware, my leettle chocolate <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croissant.html" title="Croissant">croissant</a>! Fifi Le Fume eez going to cover you up!"</p>
<p>Before she can capture him, however, she decides, "I am, how you say, <i>petite</i> flumpy, no?" and admits, "Time for <i>le</i> <a href="../../../m/a/k/Make-over.html" title="Make-over">make-over</a>!" After dolling herself up, she looks to the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camera.html" title="Camera">camera</a> and remarks, "If looks could kill you would not be feeling so well, eh?" Emerging from her home in a cloud of stench and fluttering hearts, she shouts, "Do not fear, <i>mon dere,</i> Fifi Le Fume eez near!" Fifi begins to hunt down her potential <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyfriend.html" title="Boyfriend">boyfriend</a>, sweetly calling out, "Where eez my leettle <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crepe.html" title="Crepe">crepe</a> skunkette!?" and skips quickly down the street to the tune of the French <a href="../../../c/a/n/Can-Can_d66b.html" title="Can-Can">Can-Can</a>.</p>
<p>Cornering Furrball in a near-by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alley.html" title="Alley">alley</a>, Fifi flirtatiously greets the bewildered cat with "Like, <i>bonjour, mon amour!</i>" Furrball, confused, looks around and then points at himself. Fifi responds, "<i>Oui, vous!</i>" Furrball, believing she's a cat, sprays some breath-freshener into his mouth and runs directly into her arms, allowing himself to be thoroughly captured. A joyous Fifi shouts, "At last I've found you!" She immediately scoops Furrball up off the ground, wraps him tightly in her arms and begins to smother him in kisses, swooning, "Ohhh, my totally awesome beau, you are like ripe <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brie.html" title="Brie">brie</a> in my arms!" The captured Furrball is overwhelmed by the massive onslaught of passion. He is confused at first by a strange smell, but quickly gathers his wits once he notices her big <a href="../../../w/h/i/White.html" title="White">white</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stripe.html" title="Stripe">stripe</a> flowing down her back. Realizing that he's being embraced and smooched by a pretty polecat, Furrball holds up a sign that reads "Skunk!" He resists and narrowly manages to escape Fifi's powerful grip (on a size-scale, Fifi is much bigger than he is and, obviously, much stronger). Fifi giggles, "Ho ho! My Jiggling <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigolo.html" title="Gigolo">Gigolo</a> wants to play <a href="../../../h/i/d/Hide_and_go_seek.html" title="Hide and go seek">hide and go seek</a>!" She wastes no time in skipping lovingly after him, calling out, "I am almost finding you, my leettle <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepperoni.html" title="Pepperoni">pepperoni</a> of passion!"</p>
<p>Furrball takes cover in front of a <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_271d.html" title="TV">TV</a> shop, unsure as to why a female skunk would have the hots for him. He quickly notices in his reflection that he has a white stripe down his back and manages to put two and two together. No sooner does he realize this, Fifi catches up with him and, before he can flee, snares him with her massive tail, wraps him up in her tail, and holds him tightly against her body, snuggling him. With her prey firmly trapped and her tail wrapped around him like a <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boa_constrictor.html" title="Boa constrictor">boa constrictor</a>, she immediately picks up where she left off and smothers him in more affection and odor than Furrball could ever possibly want, sighing, "Hold me! Your love for me eez true blue!" With a lot of effort, and despite Fifi doing her best to keep him bound, Furrball barely escapes her embrace. Fifi takes this in stride, remarking, "Leettle boys are such children!" and continues her chase.</p>
<p>Furrball runs to a near-by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park.html" title="Park">park</a> and, using a <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain.html" title="Fountain">fountain</a> and some <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap.html" title="Soap">soap</a>, attempts to scrub the white stripe from his back. But much to his misfortune, Furrball discovers that the <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint.html" title="Paint">paint</a> is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent.html" title="Permanent">permanent</a>. Before he can sulk too much over his putrid predicament, Fifi bursts out of the fountain, clad in a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">red</a> one-piece <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathing_suit.html" title="Bathing suit">bathing suit</a> and snorkling gear! She attempts to catch him once more, singing, "Zere are many fish in ze sea, but you are zee only one for me!" Before she can grab him, however, Furrball, incredibly terrified at the sight of her, makes a hasty retreat. Fifi remarks, "He takes to me hook, line and stinker!"</p>
<p>Furrball runs to a carnival down the street and hides himself in the ferriswheel. Once the seat moves upward and Fifi is nowhere in sight, Furrball breathes a sigh of relief. His cause for relief is instantly cancelled, however, as Fifi coos, "Sorry I am late, <i>mon petite</i> <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiche.html" title="Quiche">quiche</a>!" from the seat above him and quickly swoops down on top of her trembling prey. Furrball cowers at the end of the seat as Fifi closes in on him. He tries to push the advancing skunkette away, but Fifi over-powers him easily and grabs ahold of his hands. Furrball desperately attempts to pull his hands free from her, but every time he gets them loose Fifi tackles him and grabs them once more. Clasped tightly by the swooning skunkette, and with no where left to run, the frightened and helpless Furrball finds himself completely at her mercy. Satisfied at having secured the object of her affection, Fifi lovingly pulls him close and recommends they take their relationship to the next step: "I know, my love, I am all in knots, too! Zat eez why I think eet eez time you meet my family, no?" With Fifi fiercely cuddling him (literally squeezing him like a <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_bear.html" title="Teddy bear">teddy bear</a>), Furrball weighs his options; he can either stay and be helplessly squeezed and smothered by the much bigger and stronger skunk, or he can jump for it. Letting out a painful meow at the top of his lungs, Furrball breaks free from her arms and leaps over the side. Fifi simply calls him a "<a href="../../../f/l/i/Flirt.html" title="Flirt">Flirt</a>!" and waits for the ride to stop.</p>
<p>Falling a considerable distance, Furrball lands painfully on the heads of the two bully cats who were trying to beat him up earlier. The cats grab Furrball's stunned little body and prepare to give him a pounding, but then they notice the stripe on his back and mistake him for a skunk. Horrified, the two cats scream in utter terror, "SKUNK!!" The two cats run in the opposite direction and slam into a game booth at fullspeed, knocking themselves out-cold.</p>
<p>Furrball wobbles to his feet, only to hear Fifi bearing down on him yet again, calling-out, "Yoo hoo! Where are you my leettle <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger.html" title="Burger">burger</a> <i>du <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese.html" title="Cheese">fromage</a>?</i> Your French fried <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomato.html" title="Tomato">tomato</a> eez missing you!" Exhausted, Furrball makes a futile attempt to flee from the amorous skunk who is fastly catching-up to him. Furrball rounds a corner, with Fifi only seconds behind him, and finally runs out of breath. Stumbling upon an open can of blue paint, Furrball thinks fast and immediately paints over the white stripe on his back. No sooner does he do this, Fifi rounds the corner after him, only to find a semi-familiar boy cat. "<i>Excuse moi,</i> <i>monsieur</i> cat, but have you seen <i>le</i> <i>cute</i> boy skunk anywhere?" she asks. Furrball, holding his breath, frantically shakes his head and slyly tosses the paintbrush away. Unable to recognize Furrball without his stripe, Fifi is heartbroken over the loss of her boyfriend and walks away, crying loudly. "Alone again! Poor, poor Fifi! No one loves you! <i>Le</i> boo! <i>Le</i> hoo! <i>Le</i> boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!" she cries. Furrball, feeling sorry for the poor lonely skunk and desiring to get revenge on the two bully cats, grabs some cans of black and white paint and paints said bully cats into proper skunk colors.</p>
<p>The two cats get to their feet, unaware of their new appearances, and immediately fall prey to a re-invigorated Fifi. With hearts in her eyes, she shouts, "Ooh! Two king-size <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crepe.html" title="Crepe">crepe</a> skunkettes!" Fifi pounces onto the large, buff cat and gives him a big kiss, her stench fuming all around them. Terrified, the big cat struggles to pull her off of his face. The two cats react in horror and make a break for it. Fifi addresses the audience: "Once you are thrown by zee horse you must get right back on and ride!". She immediately chases after the pair, skipping and hopping casually right behind them, calling out, "Giddy up my leettle polka ponies of love!" Free at last, Furrball watches the love-struck skunkette chase the two cat bullies out of the carnival, and then, celebrating his escape from Fifi, Furrball winks at the audience and joyously covers the screen with black paint.</p>
