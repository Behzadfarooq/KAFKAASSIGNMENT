<p>Does anyone remember when this show first started that it had a much different format. Every panelist stayed on until the very end and then they all got face time. I don't quite remember exactly how it worked because quite frankly the show was awful with that format and I almost never watched it.</p>
<p>Yes I remember it.</p>
<p><br />
The old format went something like this: Mutes were worth -3 (or was it -5?), and Max gave many more points for a topic (5-8'ish), but muted people more often which often resulted in massively negative scroes, usually for Woody. The rounds were also called different names, although I don't recall what they were. People weren't kicked off, but at the end of the game the top 3 people got face time, one second for each point they had amassed (as well as a medal). The fourth place person would be introduced as getting face time and would be promptly muted when they started to speak.</p>
<p>Overall I was a big fan of the old format and never have truly liked the new one.</p>
<p>I also remember people asking the voice over the loud speaker??? to be added points for various reasons. Also I think they sometimes changed the amount of face time for time reasons.--<a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkroha_3b96.html" title="User:Skroha">Skroha</a> 22:00, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Isn't "Around the Horn" a baseball reference of some sort? Specifically, after a strikeout or groundout, the ball is passed around the infielders until it gets back to the pitcher, and this was called passing it "around the horn." Or am I shockingly mistaken? --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Shazaam_7ee3.html" title="User:Jeffrey O.

<dl>
<dd>I think this happens a lot, but I doubt it's an every-topic-during-every-Showdown type of thing. For example, there was one topic a couple of days ago (it was Monday, but I can't remember who was in the Showdown) where both panelists agreed. I absolutely do think the preplanning does occur rather frequently, since there are few times when the panelists actually do agree, and because there are some topics in which I simply can't imagine either panelist taking a particular side. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:47, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>1. Well written?:</b> The article has a good intro, but other sections need expansion or cleanup. The Rounds section should be elaborated on with more detail for the various rounds. For example the "The First Word" could be fixed up with some examples. I would recommend working on improving statements such as "Reali is now much stingier in awarding points."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2. Factually accurate?:</b> There are no references, so nothing can be verified to accurate. I know there are fans of the show that contribute details about the scores and various inside jokes, but these can be cited by the appropriate episode and outside sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3. Broad in coverage?:</b> The article is not very broad, it would be better for the article if there could be information about how the show's production, ratings, any possible DVD releases, any awards for the show, etc.</dd>

<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> The article looks mainly neutral, but it may be more focused to people who already know the show, so using less jargon and more wikilinks could help improve it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>5. Article stability?</b> The article appears stable and I don't forsee there being any problems with that in the future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>6. Images?:</b> The current images are okay, but they both need fair use rationales. Look to similar TV shows for fair use rationales or look to already promoted GA articles. If you can, attempt to add screenshots of some of the rounds in play or some of the regular panelists (again with fair use rationales and sources).</dd>
</dl>
<p>This was my first GA review, so I'm apologize if I was a little harsh. I see above a few sections in the talk page that this was nominated to get a review, so hopefully I brought you some suggestions. Even though I pointed out a lot of things to improve, it will be more likely to pass GA with these suggestions being met. I've seen the show a couple of times, but the editors' expertise here will be able to provide details to improve the article. Keep up the good work and just begin adding references and further expanding the article before trying again. If you have any questions let me know, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 06:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, not too harsh. Good job on the review. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenmonkey_1a0f.html" title="User:Chickenmonkey">Chickenmonkey</a> 10:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are all good points and reasons I don't think this will ever be a GA. It's just basically facts about the show we've learned from watching it and a bunch of lists and tables. It's hard to provide citations for a sports talk show such as this. But we'll see… <b><a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmitchelf_4107.html" title="User:Bmitchelf"><font color="#FF4500">bmitchelf</font></a></b>•<a href="../../../b/m/i/User_talk%7EBmitchelf_bbf2.html" title="User talk:Bmitchelf">T</a>•<i><b><a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmitchelf_Favorites_6431.html" title="User:Bmitchelf/Favorites"><font color="#FF0000">F</font></a></b></i> 01:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How often do you think the winner is determined before the show? Is this talked about on the Yahoo site? Some shows it is obviously fixed, perhaps to give the face time to someone who has an important topic to discuss. Thoughts? EagleFan 17:39, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like the look of the statistics tables at the bottom of the article, but is there any way to group some of them together so readers can look at two or three tables in a row rather than all of them on top of each other? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 14:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I nested some of the tables, to show 2 in a row. I could do the first 3 all in a row, but I was worried about making it too wide, for users with a lower resolution. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjewiki_11bf.html" title="User:Bjewiki">Bjewiki</a> 16:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
