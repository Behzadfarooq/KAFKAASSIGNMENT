<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EArocoun_3602.html" title="Edit section: Philosophy Quiz">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophy Quiz</span></h2>
<p>I am happy that this quiz has become pretty popular! I'd like to thank everyone for the many compliments and the constructive criticism.</p>
<p>For v1.02, I fixed the spelling of the word "Divine" (which about 1/4 of the responses pointed out as being wrong). Thankfully, that was the only definite mistake pointed out to me. Also, I put a link to my Wikipedia site on all the descriptions, so that people could get see the results for the other philosophies (I was surprised how many requests I had for that). Finally, I made it so that the Existentialism questions would be a little harder to agree with, because I noticed that so many people got it as their top match.</p>
<p>For v1.03, I changed some questions which I was informed were too long, switched the quotes for Divine Command, and changed a question for existentialism, so that it would ask if you actually put <i>serious effort</i> into deciding your life's meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>If you come here, and have any further comments, feel free to discuss the quiz on my talk page.</p>

<p>Your life is guided by the ethical model of <b><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kantianism.html" title="Kantianism">Kantianism</a></b>: You seek to have consistent laws rule your actions, and your will is directed by reason.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
"I do not, therefore, need any penetrating acuteness to see what I have to do in order that my volition be morally good.

<p><br />
<br />
“I swear by my life, and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.”<br />

<p><br />
<br />
I <i>would</i> find a quote or two to better describe the virtues and thoughts behind apathy, but ironically those who would espouse the concept of apathy are too apathetic to write about it.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EArocoun_3602.html" title="Edit section: Responses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Responses</span></h3>
<p>I have received plenty of comments, and I feel that a few of them are particularly worth responding to.</p>
<p>"For responses, I would suggest a range of 5 rather than 6. I find it more useful when the options are of an odd number, because then it\'s easier for me to be smack dab in the middle&#160;;)"</p>
<p>I actually made it 6 on purpose. I could just as easily made it 5 or 7, but I chose 6 <i>precisely because</i> it forces you to choose one way or another. It gets you out of that middle-of-the-road comfort zone, and makes you choose, if only one little bit, which way you feel about something.</p>
<p>"good quiz =)</p>
<p>very well done and thought out..</p>
<p>In fact, I learned quite a bit from taking this quiz. I might have to dig into some esoteric research =)</p>
<p>-Dave"</p>
<p>To the folks who respond like this, I'd like to say both "thanks" and "you're welcome." I like it when I can help others learn.</p>
<p>"It may just be me, but I think there ought to be a few more \'types\' of answers. Whatever happened to Nietzsche\'s Ubermensch philosophy? That could be a fun one to design questions for...</p>
<p>Otherwise, this was much fun." "what about Buddhism, socialism?? your quiz sucks."</p>
<p>Well, there are problems here. I'm one person, using a limited quiz engine--I most certainly can't make a quiz which includes <i>everything</i>! Or even a hundreth of everything, for that matter. So when I was choosing which philosophies I'd use, I chose those which:</p>
<p>1. Were not extremely limited to a particular cultural set or time period, like the Ubermensch philosophy, and</p>
<p>2. Didn't have much to do with a particular political stance. <b>Socialism</b>, for example, is a political system which exists outside of oneself, while <b>being socialist</b> is an internal condition; the question, then, is why is one a social<i>ist</i>? It almost certainly has something to do with one's own <i>personal</i> philosophy, which is what this quiz tries to find.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided to choose eight (plus apathy), and make it so that everyone that I could conceivably think of could be adequately described by one or more of the terms. There is no way that a simple combination of eight results can describe anyone with great detail, but I (and a few who commented) think that my humble little quiz does the job as good as any other, at least.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who wanted pragmatism included, I must say that it seems that there are entirely too many people who consider themselves pragmatists (in other words, it's too broad). If I included that, the problem of everyone scoring as pragmatists would be many times worse than the problem of everyone scoring as existentialists that I just got done with. I'm sorry if that doesn't work well for you, but I don't see much that I can do about it.</p>
