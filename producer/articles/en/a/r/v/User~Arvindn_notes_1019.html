<ul>
<li>The Indus people had significant maritime activities.</li>
<li>Objects resembling scales and weights have been found (==&gt; trade)</li>
<li>Buildings were made of sun-dried bricks</li>
<li>No direct evidence of use of currency.</li>
<li>They had a cyclic concept of time. Indeed, Hinduism has the concept of the 4 yugas: Satya, Trata, Dvapara and Kali. After Kali is the pralaya (destruction) which leads back to Satya.</li>
<li>Fertility rites were common.</li>
<li>They believed in a connection between the productivity of land and humans. Accordingly one of their rites was to copulate on the field.</li>
<li>We have found many phallic symbols, thought to represent proto-Shiva.</li>
<li>Bronze statue of dancing girl in extrmenely provocative posture. (Remark: even today female statues/idols have enlarged mammaries and hips)</li>
<li>They worshipped a mother-Goddess.</li>
<li>Abandoned skeletons are found (?).</li>
<li>Indus remains suggest 4 diffent ethnic backgrounds:
<ul>
<li>Caucasian</li>
<li>Proto-meditteranean</li>
<li>Mongoloid</li>
<li>Negroid</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible causes for decline
<ul>
<li>Floods</li>
<li>Deforestation</li>
<li>Tectonic movement</li>
<li>Malaria</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The earliest scripts that are known are the following
<ul>
<li>Harappan</li>
<li>Hitite</li>
<li>Sumerian</li>
<li>Egyptian</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Cretan</li>
<li>Ilamite</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Harappan script alone has not been deciphered. It can be classified as pictography/logography/ideography</li>
<li>Evolution of syllablic scripts lead to decrease in the number of characters.</li>
<li>The H. script is found in seals, pot shards and bronzes.</li>
<li>The Egyptian script was deciphered using bilingual stones. The other language in the stones was proto-Greek.</li>
<li>The stratum in which the artifact is found gives clues about the date.</li>
<li>Animals known to the Indus people: Bull, elephant, rhino, tiger, buffalo.</li>
<li>Animals not known: horse, lion, camel.</li>
<li>Since the script has not been deciphered, in practice it is prehistory even though we call it history.</li>
<li>4000 seals of the Indus civ have been found.</li>
<li>400-450 characters of the script have been identified.</li>
<li>The average inscription has 5 chars. The longest has 26.</li>
<li>The margins are to the right. We find cramped characters on the left.</li>
<li>83% of the time they wrote R to L. 7-8% of the time R to L followed by L to R.</li>
<li>Boustrophedon mode of writing</li>
<li>Brevity may indicate that inscriptions may refer to names of owners. Thus it might not teach us much about the civ even if the script is deciphered.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rig Vedic society was tribal in nature (Indus: Urban).</li>
<li>Main occupation was cattle rearing</li>
<li><i>Rajan</i>: ruler</li>
<li><i>Visvamitra</i> was a <i>prohita</i>, a <i>rajaguru</i></li>
<li><i>Panchajana</i> - the confederacy</li>
<li>The <i>Dasa</i> or <i>Dasyu</i>s
<ul>
<li>Were thought to be pre-vedic/pre-aryan people by earlier historians</li>
<li>They were dark complexioned, did not worship Vedic deities, spoke a non-sanskritic language, had woolly hair etc.</li>
<li>Some scholars contend the gap was cultural rather than racial and say that Dasyus were earlier Aryans</li>
<li><i>Vyasa</i> had a fisherman background, and <i>Agastya</i> is descibed as being short.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Casteism as we know it wsa not found in the early Vedic times.</li>
<li><i>Gavishti</i> - cattle rites.</li>
<li>Prohit: advisor and religious head. Not a <i>brahmin</i> in the modern sense</li>
<li><i>Senani</i>: led the tribe in war.</li>
<li>Entire tribe had a right to bear arms</li>
<li>King often got a ceremonial gift - <i>bali</i> from the people</li>
<li>The polity of the Rg Veda was none too complex</li>
<li><b>Food.</b> The Early Aryans ate meat.</li>
<li>Cow is described as <i>aghnya</i> (that which cannot be killed)</li>
<li>However, there is reference to <i>goghnya</i> (one whose job is to kill cows)</li>
<li>Most likely explanation of the paradox: cows were a valuable resource, and were to be used sparingly.</li>
<li>Irrefutable evidence in later vedic text of author, who was one the major saints of the <i>Upanishad</i>s, enjoying tender calf.</li>
<li>Vegetarianism became an important part of Brahminical tradition after Buddha.</li>
<li><i>Shastra</i>s mention how to apportion meat of sacrifieced horse.</li>
<li>No reference in Rg Veda of prayers for better crops, only better <i>Pasu</i> (cattle).</li>
<li>Sidenote: D. N. Jha wrote a book about this subject and the VHP managed to prevent its publication by terrorizing the publisher.</li>
<li>Wheat was not known. <i>Godhma</i> is referred to only in later Vedic texts.</li>
<li>Gambling was a common pastime</li>
<li>In the Rg veda there is the lament of a gambler</li>
<li>Learning was by rote</li>
<li>Students learning verses are compared in the literature of the period to croaking frogs.</li>
<li>Poverty and plenty were both common</li>
<li><b>Religion</b></li>
<li>Worship of nature.</li>
<li>Fear of the unknown and unfamiliar.</li>
<li>The terrifying forces of nature were deified</li>
<li><i>Dharma</i> was supposed to be eternal and its practice ensured standing</li>
<li>Great emphasis on social and moral conservativeness</li>
<li>Fear of disharmony and chaos</li>
<li>Deities: <i>Indra, Varuna, Vayu, Surya, Mitra, Agni, Soma</i>.</li>
<li>Deities were not viewed as all-powerful</li>
<li>Relationship between devotee and deity was one of transaction</li>
<li>At any given point, one particular deity was superior to all others</li>
<li>Each had a specific role</li>
<li><i>rth</i> - the cosmic order</li>
<li>Mode of worship: sacrifices, chanting of verses</li>
<li>They prayed for longeivity of life, plentiful procreation and cattle.</li>
<li>No reference to <i>moksha</i> in the Rg.</li>
<li><i>Visvamitra</i> = friend of the Vis. hence he was probably not of Vedic origin.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvindn_notes_1019.html" title="Edit section: Later Vedic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later Vedic</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture emerged as an important economic activity.</li>
<li>More free time</li>
<li>Artisans and craftsmen were more numerous</li>
<li><i>Varna</i> was more rigid, but not yet watertight</li>
<li>Trade increased; was by and large barter</li>
<li>No unanimous view on the existense of money</li>
<li>The people had moved to a more congenial area, favorable climatic conditions, more rainfall and alluvial soil</li>
<li>Small hamlets were established along the Gangetic valley</li>
<li><i>Aryavarta</i> the land acquired a sacred connotation</li>
<li>All the sacred sites are found along the Gangetic valley</li>
<li>Early ruler was called the <i>Gopa</i> (protector of cows), now becomes <i>chakravrtin</i> - possessor (protector&#160;?) of land</li>
<li>Importance of cattle rearing seems to have waned</li>
<li><i>Jana</i>s fought among themselves and claimed the land</li>
<li><i>Jana</i> --&gt; <i>Janapathi</i></li>
<li><i>Rashtra</i> (state) occurs extensively in later literature</li>
<li>Rituals, organization and ceremony become important</li>
<li>Elaborate crowning/coronation rituals -- major social occasion</li>
<li>The king symbolically tilled the land</li>
<li>Various officers, in addition to the <i>prohit</i> and <i>senani</i> emerged</li>
<li>Wars occur in order to acquire more land. (e.g <i>Kurukshetra</i>)</li>
<li>Ruler who brings more land under his rule called himself <i>Ekarat</i>, <i>Samrat</i>, <i>Chakravartin</i> etc.</li>
<li><i>Yagnya</i>s: <i>Vajapeya</i>, <i>Rajasuya</i>, <i>Asvamedha</i></li>
<li>Much forest land had to be cleared</li>
<li>however, the <i>Brahmin</i> received gifts in <i>Go</i>, not <i>Bhu</i></li>
<li>Land surveys, revenue, etc. are common</li>
<li><i>Kshartiya</i>s and <i>Brahmana</i>s did not contribute to the economy and had to be supported by the other classes</li>
<li>Many rituals emerged to strengthen the alliance between these two groups</li>
<li>Internal divisions became marked (?)</li>
<li><i>Jaya</i> - 8800 verses; <i>Bharata</i> - 24000 verses, <i>Mahabharata</i> - &gt; 10^5 verses</li>
<li>Social division exists but caste system had not fully emerged</li>
<li>To strengthen their position, the <i>Brahmana</i>s proliferated a large number of sacrifices and increased their importance</li>
<li>Improper performance of sacrifices/chanting of verses was supposed to bring ruin</li>
<li><i>Vak</i>, the goddess of learning became a deity in order to ensure the proper enunciation of verses</li>
<li><i>Kshatriya</i>s amassed wealth</li>
<li><i>Yajamana</i> - the one who commissioned the sacrifice (sponsor)</li>
<li>Specialization of an extreme order developed among the <i>Brahmana</i>s</li>
<li><i>Dana</i> (gift) gave way to <i>Dakshina</i> (fee)</li>
<li><i>Matsya Nyaya</i> - smaller states being absorbed by bigger ones. (<i>Matsya</i> = fish; <i>Nyaya</i> = approx. rule; think smaller fish being eaten by bigger ones).</li>
<li><i>Janapada</i>s: 16 became <i>Mahajanapada</i>s</li>
<li>The lot of the lower <i>Varna</i>s declined and became miserable (the literature is clear on this point)</li>
<li><i>Dha</i> (root of <i>dharma</i>)&#160;: firm, strong, unshakeable</li>
<li>Less equitable distribution of wealth</li>
<li>Rule of primogeniture was not well established</li>
<li>Hereditary monarchy was emerging</li>
<li>Rg mentions <i>Gana, sabha, samiti, vidhata</i>. Now becomes merely royal court. (==&gt; Participation of people decreased)</li>
<li>Women were given a distinctly lower status</li>
<li>No child marriage</li>
<li>Brahmacharya was exhorted but spinsters were frowned upon</li>
<li>Concept of property and inheritance increases, therefore women's status decreases</li>
<li>Priestly class put forth the concept that proper carrying out of <i>yagnya</i>s led to victory.</li>
<li>Competition everywhere; survival of the fittest.</li>
<li>Many were upset about the economic and social differences instead of the egalitarian values of the tribal society.</li>
<li>Some wanted to opt out of the race</li>
<li>These people meditated on the philosophical aspects of life; their musings are recorded in the <i>Aranyaka</i>s of the <i>Upanishad</i>s</li>
<li>This was a natural response to transition and uncertainty.</li>
<li>They looked for certitude of position</li>
<li><i>Matsya nyaya</i> evoked condemnation from these people. They scorned wealth</li>
<li>The above information is based on socio-psychological analysis based on later vedic literature by contemporary scholars</li>
<li>This was a protest movement. If it became widespread, economy and society would come to a grinding halt.</li>
<li>Therefore the 4 <i>ashrama</i>s: <i>Brahmacharya</i>, <i>Grihasta</i>, <i>Vanaprasta</i> and <i>Sanyasa</i>.</li>
<li>Thus <i>sanyasa</i> is legitimized but placed at the fag end so that it does not affect the average citizen</li>
<li><i>Karma</i> and <i>punarjanma</i> - two important concepts.</li>
<li><i>Karma</i> = balance sheet of good and bad, <i>punarjanma</i> = afterlife/rebirth.</li>
<li>Sidenote: compare the psychological response of emigrant Indians to unfamiliar territory. Some become ultraconservative, others become highly liberal. The former are the group that funds the Hindu fundamentalists/terrorists like VHP. The latter try hard to become assimilated into the new society.</li>
<li><i>Karma</i> makes you accept your failure and makes you feel responsible for it instead of attributing it to external forces</li>
<li><i>Veda</i>s were considered axiomatic. But starting from there they reasoned logically in the <i>Upanishad</i>s.</li>
<li>A true believer in <i>Karma</i> would not be a fatalist</li>
<li>A call for action without getting too caught up in the outcome</li>
<li><i>Moksha</i> is freedom from good and bad, which are though to be subjective</li>
