<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Related" entry in infobox</span></h2>
<p>Although I agreed with NikoX's proposal to leave out the "related groups" entry in the infobox, it seems the template treats that row as obligatory and keeps inserting junk if we don't specify it. I think calling Albanians a "related group" here is not really <i>that</i> controversial, is it? Feel free to remove if the template can be fixed to make the row optional.

<dd>No problem with me - I just hope we won't have furious Greek readers calling in to complain that labelling Arvanites <i>related to</i> Greeks implies that they <i>aren't</i> themselves Greeks ...&#160;:-) By the way, if we want to add something useful in this row, how about <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbereshe.html" title="Arbereshe">Arbereshe</a>?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">about the tags</span></h2>
<p>The question is not weather you or I like to the tags to the remain. The tags was put there because of the very fact that the neutrality and factual accuracy of the article is disputed and not accepting this and state otherwise is a false statement.The tags are extremely necessary and appropriate so editors become more involved in the sensitivity of the subject concerning the article, and also otherwise readers cannot understand what they are reading may contain incorrect information. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 17:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the tags remain, it seems fair that they must also be introduced to the 'Albanians' article. Namely because if we identify Arvanites as an Albanian minority, then the Albanians must also be identified as Greeks because the Arvanites are clearly Greeks. I promise you that the way I will write it will make perfect sense. But I would prefer if the tags were removed. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 17:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In order to re-focus on solving the dispute, what would you say it is, what are the issues? What do we need to solve? <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 17:46, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are very honest Telex. Does anyone else have any idea what the dispute is about so that we can solve it?

<p>The first steep is of course admitting that we have a problem. The second steep is to find the actual problem with the article and what the dispute is about. The last steep is to solve the problem/dispute and satisfy everybody, but It won't be easy... I think the The actual problem with the article can be found above on users Politis contribution to the discussion. <i>because the Arvanites are clearly Greeks</i>... Users with Greek origin refusal of accepting and effort and attempt to conceal the connection or connections the Arvanites have/had with other Albanians have become the problematic and need to be resolved. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 18:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, Albanau, you identified a problem here in the <b>talk page</b>. Fine. It seems you cannot accept that Arvanites are Greeks; well, argue your case. Let me give you some POV information, according to a cousin there is Arvanitiko in our blood, and we say, we know we are Greeks. We like Albania and all our neighbours but we, like the Arvanites are Greeks. I have no idea who <b>you</b> are Albanau so I cannot take your motives very seriously. Perhaps you are a Belgium or a Canadian student having a bit of fun.

<dd>Guys, the problem, which has mainly been discussed between Matia and me, is whether it is appropriate to state in the intro that Arvanites are "descendants of Albanian settlers". It was my proposal to introduce that. And as I still haven't heard any serious alternative to that statement sourced to any serious reference, I still don't see why it shouldn't be included. If those ancestors at the time of the settlement were <i>not</i> Albanians, then <i>what the heck were they</i>? One year of edit war, and still no answer to that basic question. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The answer: Albanian-speaking Greeks. Greeks spoke different languages during the final centuries of the Byzantine Empire and especially during Ottoman times. There were Greeks that spoke Slavic and hence were deemed Slavophone Greeks. There were Greeks that spoke Turkish and hence Turkophone Greeks. The utilization of different languages was a survival tactic the Greeks needed in order to trade more easily, as well as to protect themselves from any potential dangers (especially from harassments by the Ottomans). Once again, language does not define ethnicity. Of course, since Western European academia assumes that a language reflects the ethnic make-up of a social group it is no wonder there is still controversy over this topic.

<dd>Sorry, I don't smoke. So it is true. You actually believe that language defines ethnicity. I never thought I would see the day when I would have interesting proof of sociological blindness on your part. Have you ever heard of the Anglophone Greeks? I hear they are ethnic Greeks who mostly speak English or some linguistic variation of Anglo-Saxon. Just so you know, Greeks speaking different languages during late Byzantine and Ottoman times is not something I conjured up in my sleep. I think there are entities called "people" who realistically understand this too. Care to meet them my sociologically blind friend? <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 22:09, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course there are. However, books are only part of the process. There are journals, notes, statements, etc. that you have to take into account (as well as good old fashioned sociological analyses). Besides, you have to be careful nowadays about which books to use (since certain scholars have these things called "axes" that they tend to grind for monetary or political purposes; oh how much fun academia is). Also, comparative analyses of the books utilized should be in order. You of all people should know that much.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arvanites are Albanians</span></h2>
<p>I think it is boring with Greek wikipedians that oppose the link between Arvanites and Albanians. Arvanites are not Greek since they are called arvanites and not Greek. Many arvanites today do not want to be considered as Albanians partly because of the bad reputation of Albanians in Greece created and backed by media and the government, and partly because of the Greek assimilation policies during the last to centuries.</p>
<p>I have read many books and Greece is at the bottom of Europe, when it comes to human rights and respect of ethnic groups rights.</p>
<p>On of you said that 20 % of Albania’s population are Greeks, which is WRONG. Today I think 0.1% (earlier max 2 %) of the population are Greeks, and that is because many of the Greeks have moved from poor Albania to the rich (in the Balkans context) Greece</p>
<p><br />
Can some of you answer me what the word arvanit means?</p>

<dd>I think I can help. The literal meaning of the term "Arvanite" (or "Arbanite") is "one who comes from Arbanon". This meaning is no different from say the term "Maniate" meaning "one who comes from Mani". Of course, any Greek word that ends in "-ite" also means "like" or "similar to". The reason the Arvanites were called "Arvanites" was because they were similar (linguistically) to Albanians, but were not Albanian in the ethno-cultural sense. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 21:46, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Plain wrong. Read the article. Of course, yes, the name comes from the toponym, but as an ethnonym it was originally shared <i>by all Albanians</i>. The distinction between "Albanians" and "Arvanites" as two distinct groups is not older than the 19th or even 20th century. Read the older Greek literature, or even just look at their titles. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:51, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Read the article many times (I'll give you a hint, it needs work). Besides, you didn't even let me finish. Tell me Future Perfect, do you know the meaning of the word "Gasmul"? Of course you do. It means a person who has a Greek mother and a Frankish father (I believe the term was a pejorative at the time of its linguistic inception). The point I was trying to make (before being rudely interrupted by you) is that the Greeks have classified different populations not only based on language, but also based on ethnicity, culture, religion, etc. If the Greeks can call certain people "Gasmules", then what makes them so dastardly wrong in calling Greeks who talk like Albanians and come from Arbanon "Arvanites"?</dd>

<dd>Also, the difference between the "Alvanoi" and the "Arbanitai" is shown to have existed since Byzantine times (haven't you read Michael Attaliates?). Even though both names sound similar (and have similar spellings) does not mean that they represent the same people. Besides, the history section (which needed serious work) was called "utter nonsense" by you if I remember oh so correctly. Just like Aldux. Short-sightedly dishonorable. Please, go ahead and throw a "crap" comment anytime soon. Now I could have sworn I put the names of authors whose statements should be taken into account when discussing the history of the Arvanites. They made some interesting cases. Of course, where are you to ask oh so respectfully for me to elaborate. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 22:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
