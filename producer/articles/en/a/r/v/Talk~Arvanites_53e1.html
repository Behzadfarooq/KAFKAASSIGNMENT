<p>Macrakis I have a Greek language-related source which states that Arvanites inhabited around the city of Athens, which explains the language of Athens, Pireus, Megara etc was isolated and developed into a separate dialect called "Old Athenian". There's even a map about it. Are you sure your source doesn't refer to Arvanite and Greek migrations to Athens after it became the capital of the Greek Kingdom? Or maybe is not being very specific about the borders of Athens? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 18:02, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The footnoted sentence says "until the "late 19th century", so, yes, this is after Athens became capital. As for whether the area is within "the borders of Athens", are you saying that Plaka was not within Athens?</p>
<p>Another source: Eyre Evans Crowe, <i>The Greek and the Turk; or, Powers and prospects in the Levant</i>, 1853: "The cultivators of the plain live at the foot of the Acropolis, occupying what is called the Albanian quarter..." (p. 99)</p>
<p>Poulton (got to chase down the ref) also claims that there was an Albanian-language law court in the Plaka in the early 20th century. But this needs checking. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 19:32, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the period <i>before</i> the War of Independence, Hobhouse, writing in 1810, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of houses in Ahtens is supposed to be between twelve and thirteen hundred; of which about four hundred are inhabited by the Turks, the remainder by the Greeks and Albanians, the latter of whom occupy above three hundred houses.</p>

<p>If Plaka became an Arvanite district after independence then what on earth was/is the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anafi.html" title="Anafi">Anafiotika</a>? Concerning the Ottoman period, I have another source which provides unarguably a more accurate account: "<i>Population of Attica: 22,000, Greeks and Turks in the city, Albanians in the villages.</i> " (History of the Greek revolution, Thomas Gordon 1832). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why do you think it is indisputable (I assume that's what you mean by "unarguable") that it is a "more accurate account" than the three other accounts I've cited? --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 19:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Poulton is probably right, I just read somewhere else that certain laws were applied in order to protect Arvanitika in that district. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:19, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't like the way the article presents these theories on the Pelasgians, it presents them as if it's because of their plausibility. It's sourced that the only reason they are propagating such theories is to as to claim indigenous status, so it's ultimately only for a political purpose.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 19:10, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>A procedural question: Since <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a> are officially seen as a different ethnic group to Bulgarians, and they are even considered to speak a separate language to Bulgarian, then how come it has to be stated here that Arvanitika is a dialect of Albanian? In post WW2 sources Slavophones of Macedonia and their language were considered Bulgarian speaking "Western Bulgarian", just like Arvanitika used to be referred as Tosk Albanian. The only difference between the two is that the Macedonian Slavs consider themselves distinct while the Arvanites consider themselves Greek. So how come the latter's personal self-identification is ignored in wikipedia? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 13:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh please. Not again. Man, <i>read</i> the old discussions. We do what the literature does, period. The Mac./Bul. situation is <i>not</i> the same as the Arv./Alb. situation, <i>because that's how the literature treats it</i>. End of discussion. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 14:13, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I know. I was asking out of personal interest why English literature treats it like that, because Arvanite literature certainly does not. This is a question Arvanite editors in the Greek wikipedia had, and I didn't know what to say. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:01, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, okay. Well, the main factor is the near-total absence of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Ausbausprache.html" title="Ausbausprache"><i>ausbau</i></a> status of Arvanitika with respect to Albanian. There is, despite loud assertions on Wikipedia, apparently very little systematic awareness of linguistic separateness of Arv. among Arvanites in the real world (I, at least, have never yet seen an Arvanite author outside Wikipedia actually claim their language was distinct); and, more importantly, there is no attempt in actual practice to treat it as distinct. Macedonian has developed its own standard form, Arvanitika hasn't. As a friend explained to me, even the few attempts at Arvanitic writing apparently consist largely in just writing Standard Albanian with Greek letters; they do not even attempt to form their own written language on the basis of their local dialects. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 15:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The absence of a standardised form and literary work makes sense. Thanks Lucas. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:36, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>That said, you'd be hard-pressed to find an Arvanite who would accept <i>Albanian</i> as the name of the language, linguistic classification notwithstanding. <a href="../../../k/%C3%A9/k/User%7EK%C3%A9kr%C5%8Dps_4c7f.html" title="User:Kékrōps">·ΚέκρωΨ·</a> 15:43, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arvanitika wish it or not is not distinct from Albanian is just a dialect understandable very well from a Gege Albanian , is just that it is in original form and not allowed to be developed . Dodona</p>
<p>Why you deny the pellasgian origin of Arvanites , even not mention at all in the article? Dodona</p>

<dd>Because it is an unscientific politically motivated theory that no one takes seriously.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 21:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>“unscientific politically motivated” and “no one takes seriously” I understand you very well it is just that does not interest you, even if it is true you will ignore, but it will come back again and again more strongly because it is a message from our grandfathers not just scientific evidence . Dodona</p>
<dl>
<dd>You say "even if it is true you will ignore" - no, if it wasn't an unscientific politically motivated fringe theory, then it would be in the article. The reason it is not is because it's unreferenced from reliable sources written by people who actually know what they're talking about, hardly surprising considering the fact that we don't know enough about the Pelasgians to ascertain such a connection. It's nationalist speculation, nothing more...--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 21:27, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why you judge then that it is nationalist idea, who is interested now day for a connection between Greek and Albanians , was Aristidh Kola nationalist and more.. Are you Arvanitas&#160;? Why the Arvanitas tried to build a join state continuously&#160;?The evidence that exist I am certain that it is well known here but being ignored. Dodona</p>
<dl>
<dd>The only possible connection between Greeks and Albanians is that they are both <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_languages_7b20.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European-speaking</a> peoples (likely unlike the Pelasgians, which throws the theory out of the window). History cannot be reconstructed based on what is convenient politically (this is the mistake Macedonian Slavs make). There is no proof for these theories, it is not supported by any reliable sources, why can't you understand that? You've also misunderstood what exactly Kollias's theory was - most significantly he did not say that the Arvanites are Albanians (nor did he ever declare as one). His Pelasgian theory had one purpose: to "prove" that the Arvanites are indigenous to Greece and that <i>arvanitika</i> is the language of the "old Greeks". If you understood his theory, you'd be vehemently rejecting it as Greek nationalism.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 21:52, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Read Dhimiter Pilika an albanian ortodox who wrote “Pellasget origjina jone e mohuar “(pellasgic our ignored origin) in Albanian , is a life long academic work on the subject. I understood Kola very well he certainly did know his Albanian origin and he had many Albanian friends abroad like the one who did his photo referred above, sorry but you know nothing about Kola , he played a substantial role during the war in Kosova clarifying Greeks that was not a religion war. Dodona</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dodona, I understand this. And he also had an ulterior political purpose though, didn't he?

<p>I do not believe that Kolia was politically motivated please do not play with facts, either was Kola theory of indigenous origin of Arvanites , Kola was academic and everything he wrote is based on academic prove and evidence his books are recently republished as bests seller in Greece.. His opinions during Kosova war were of an intellectual who respect his identity and origin seeing that s.th very wrong is going on…. Dimiter Pilika writes on “ Pellasget origjina jone e mohuar “ again based on extensive academic references a work he dedicated more then 20 years of his life. So you see that they are many evidences, and what is the substrate after your opinion for political purpose behind all this. Dodona</p>

<dd>Pilika gets a dozen or so google hits, all from nationalist web forums. He's a nobody in scholarship.

<p>Prof.Dhimiter Pilika the “nobody in your opinion” was Chief of Cathedra of Albanology University of Prague, this is just for clarification, although you are being rude.

Where's Albanau when you need him?&#160;;-)) -- But anyway, I don't mind having it say "Arv." in our editorial text there. Especially <i>because</i> the two terms mean the same in that period. We're free as editors to choose whichever term fits better in the context of our article, and arguably "Arv." fits the bill there. As long as we leave the actual quotes intact. And the very fact that we juxtapose our editorial "Arv." usage with the "Alb." usage in the source, without further commentary, very neatly illustrates exactly that the terms <i>were</i> identical. Which is correct. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And I obviously disagree with Macrakis. The point however is that the Alb/Arv is dealt in other parts of the articles. Greek people who are from Mikra Asia can't be called Turks, Cretans won't be called Saracens, and the confusing of Arvanites with Albanians (because of the language) is a matter that needs (and already has plenty) citations by authors who dealt specificaly with the subject and not just with travelers. Of course the Arvanites and the Albanians have similarities (I called them cousins in past talk pages - they could have been brothers but they were not), yet by 1821 Arvanites from Suli, Euboea, Hydra, Spetses and others were identifying themselves as Greeks. You may check the lives of Botsaraioi, Tzavelaioi, Krieziotis, Miaoulis, Bouboulina etc. Biris 1966 about the city of Athens, deals exactly with those few Athenians of Arvanitic inheritance (and we know Biris serious work about Arvanites, Roma people, and other, unrelated yet very good, works about architecture - hell his book about Athens was considered so good that the city of Athens funded its first publication). <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 06:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

While it's generally true that supercategories shouldn't be included when a more specific subcategory is already present, I think inclusion of both makes very good sense here. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Category%7EGreek_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin_3930.html" title="Category:Greek people by ethnic or national origin">Category:Greek people by ethnic or national origin</a> is predominantly for articles about individual people, and so is its subcategory <a href="../../../a/r/v/Category%7EArvanites_0c61.html" title="Category:Arvanites">Category:Arvanites</a> - it focus is on individual biographies and it only includes the main article <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> additionally. The category <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups_in_Greece_0a6c.html" title="Ethnic groups in Greece">Ethnic groups in Greece</a>, on the other hand, is for articles about the groups as such, and it conveniently places the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> article side by side with <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanians.html" title="Aromanians">Aromanians</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karamanlides.html" title="Karamanlides">Karamanlides</a>, <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a> etc. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem lies in the Greeks' distinct perception of ethnicity, which coincides with nationality almost entirely. The exception would be those Greeks of much more recent immigrant origins. The Arvanites and Vlachs certainly do not consider themselves any less <i>ethnically</i> Greek than other Greeks. <a href="../../../k/%C3%A9/k/User%7EK%C3%A9kr%C5%8Dps_4c7f.html" title="User:Kékrōps">·ΚέκρωΨ·</a> 01:26, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The category implies no such thing. It doesn't say how Greek they are. Arvanites, Vlachs, Karamanlides etc. are certainly groups that in some way stand out within the population and should be categorised together. What cover term would you use to describe what these groups are? In English, "ethnic" is exactly what describes it, I for one can see nothing more appropriate. And of course the English meaning of the term is what counts, this being the English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 06:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(un-indenting) - Nice semantics problem. I'd agree that they <i>"don't belong in the same <a href="../../../c/a/t/Categories_%28Aristotle%29_47de.html" title="Categories (Aristotle)">category</a>"</i>, in terms of real-world semantics. But that doesn't necessarily mean they <i>"don't belong in the same <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategory_37f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Category">category</a>"</i>, in terms of Wiki organisation. Not every fine nuance of real-world categorisations can be mirrored in its own scheme of Wiki cats, which are by necessity less fine-grained than our concepts in real life. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
