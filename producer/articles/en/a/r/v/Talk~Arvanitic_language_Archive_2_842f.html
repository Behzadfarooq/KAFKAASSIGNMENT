<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page move</span></h2>
<p>I propose moving this page to <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>. I think that Arvanitika is the best choice. It does not toe the <i>separate language</i> line of <b>Arvanitika language</b>, nor does it toe the <i>Albanian dialect</i> line of <b>Arvanitika Albanian</b> (which is the name that UNESCO uses). It is the middle way, and normally should not provoke reaction from anyone who has good faith, given that Arvanitika plain is the name that the Helsinki Report uses and is a compromise between both pro-Albanian and pro-Greek views expressed by different groups of Arvanites. If no serious objections are raised in the next 72 hours, I'll proceed in moving the page to <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Naming policy</span></h2>
<p>It is Wikipedia policy to include the word "language" in the names of all such articles. Whether or not User:REX considers Arvanitic a mere dialect is irrelevant. Perhaps he objects to <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosk_language.html" title="Tosk language">Tosk language</a>, then?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 13:35, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, please keep "Arvanitic", not "Arvanitika", because that is the name of the language in English. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 13:46, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Protected from moves</span></h2>
<p>This page, and this talk page, have been protected from moves by myself and <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> until this damn mess is sorted out. There are inconsistent redirects all over the place. There has been no consensus to move this to <i>Arvanitika</i> or <i>Arvanitica - language</i> or any of these such locations. Consensus is not a case of "if no-one objects within 24 hours" nor is it a case of what the majority wants.</p>
<p>Some of you are dangerously close to violating our three-revert rule insofar as these moves go, which will mean an immediate 24-hour block. Please begin discussing ideas for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where you want the article and the talk page to be</li>
<li>What redirects should point to the new location</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll be keeping an eye on this situation, as well as cleaning up this damn redirect mess as far as possible. Please let me know on <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">my talk page</a> if a consensus is reached. This will not be today - I want some proper, mature discussion of this.

<dd>I agree that User:REX's page move was completely arbitrary and in contravention of Wikipedia policy on the naming of language articles. It's a pity that a mini-edit war was required to draw the attention of the administrators.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 14:14, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, it appears someone is willing to begin building consensus. However, you were moving the page to <i>Arvanitic - language</i>, which doesn't actually fit naming conventions. We may need to settle for copious redirects on this one. I'm looking for more opinions before I unprotect this, however. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Talk</a></i> | <i><a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_Article_Help_Desk_86be.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured Article Help Desk">FAHD</a></i></sup> 14:18, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">A useful example</span></h3>
<p>To try to provide an example of how things generally work on Wikipedia, I thought I'd look at <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> and see how it's done for that language.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> is a disambiguation page, pointing to:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> for the language</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English people</a> for the people living in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I'd surmise that the accepted style in this case would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a> - disambiguation page pointing to
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> - for the language</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, it might not hurt to have that disambiguation page pointing to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosk_language.html" title="Tosk language">Tosk</a></li>

<p>Also, the Helsinki Report says that the Arvanites of northwestern Greece (Epirus and Western Macedonia) call themselves <b>Shqiptar</b></p>
<p>Also, Ethnologue says that there are 150,000 speakers of Arvanitika.</p>
<p>Can MATIA and Theathenae explain themselves, they have not provided ANY sources to support their edits, all they do is revert and then not be able to explain why. So much for MATIA, I at one moment in the past had thought better of you, silly mistake of mine, to think that you were neutral. Even if God himself verified what I say above, I bet you wouldn't believe it. GET SOURCES!</p>
<p>To get to the point, it appears to be perfectly clear that the status of the language/dialect is disputed. That is why is should be at <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Arvanitic (linguistics)">Arvanitic (linguistics)</a> as per <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Flemish (linguistics)">Flemish (linguistics)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin (linguistics)</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Cantonese (linguistics)">Cantonese (linguistics)</a>.

<p>I believe that <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> should be moved to <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Arvanitic (linguistics)">Arvanitic (linguistics)</a> to reflect the fact that its status as a dialect or a language in its own right is disputed. All other disputed languages/dialects on Wikipedia have titles of the form X (linguistics) (eg <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Flemish (linguistics)">Flemish (linguistics)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin (linguistics)</a> etc), which is a neutral and NPOV form as it doesn't take sides. I have provided evidence at <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanitic_language_720d.html#Discussion" title="Talk:Arvanitic language">Talk:Arvanitic language#Discussion</a> that it is viewed as a dialect by the majority (if not all) of the scientific establishment (<a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>), but as its status on Wikipedia is diputed (the users who believe that it is a language haven't provided any sources whatsoever), I believe that the form used by all other disputed dialects should be used and not take sides. Especially given that there is no evidence to suggest that it is a language in its own right in the first place.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Discussion</span></h3>
<p>According to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28languages%29_8df0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (languages)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (languages)</a>: <i>languages which share their names with some other thing should be suffixed with "language" in the case of natural languages</i>. Arvanitic does not share its name with anything else, therefore the qualifier language is not required and plain Arvanitic would suffice. Please note that Arvanitic is the English word for Arvanitika (a Greek word) according to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>. However, the status of Arvanitic as a language in its own right is disputed. In fact, the vast majority, if not all, sources say that it is a dialect of Albanian.<br />
Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_report.html#Arvanitika" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_report.html#Arvanitika" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> uses the name "Arvanitika Albanian" and says that it is a <i>diaspora dialect of Tosk Albanian.</i></li>
<li><a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aat" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aat" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> also uses the name "Arvanitika Albanian", but states that Arvanitic is an alternative name.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It has been argued that those sources refer to Arvanitic a language and therefore they are calling it a language. That is misleading. If you look up <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>, you will see that language is a form of communication and therefore, calling something a language does not in itself mean that it can not be a dialect. Having read <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>, it becomes clear that all dialects are languages, but not vice versa.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As these two <a href="../../../r/c/_/WP%7ERC_d77e.html" title="WP:RC">reliable sources</a> call this <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> Arvanitika <b>Albanian</b>, they are obviously indication that it is a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">variety (linguistics)</a>/<a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> of Albanian. Also, <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> unequivocally calls it a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>. Other sources include the professor at <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_University_e5b9.html" title="Ohio University">Ohio University</a>, Brian Joseph staunchly defends the term dialect to refer to Arvanitic. Some of his works include the quotes:</p>

All other <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a> or languages with disputed status use the form I am suggesting.

<p>MATIA, I'm trying to find a neutral solution, what do you want? Do you want everyone to agree with everything you say? I have done nothing wrong. This is a standard procedure to make a consensus to move a page. I don't see what the big deal is. Do you not want a consensus? I have told you. Are my arguments and sources invalid or something? Does <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> not call Arvanitic a dialect? Please try and co-operate. <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> is a neutral source. Are saying that you know better than them?

<p>Well, I was happy when it was at <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>, as it is NPOV. It doesn't take the pro-Greek <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_language.html" title="Arvanitika language">Arvanitika language</a>, not the pro-Albanian <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a> (which is what UNESCO and Ethnologue use). It was happily at <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a> until Theathenae arbitrarily decided to move it without notice.

Arvanitika does not share its name with some other thing, it's like <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>. It doesn't need the qualifier "language", which is what is disputed. I say that it would be POV to say that it is a language what ALL the sources I cite above call it a dialect and not an independent language and Matia's <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluff.html" title="Bluff">invisible sources</a> say that it is a language in its own right, I haven't see these sources yet.

It is quite clear that evey source on the planet bluntly denies Arvanitic being a language in its own right, but it is a DIALECT OF ALBANIAN. Calling it Arvanitic language is your POV. You haven't provided any sources, even at this point of duress, I guess that this means you don't have any. As for Macedonian, if Britannica, Encarta, UNESCO, the University of Ohio called it a dialect of Bulgarian, then it would be disputed. But they don't, only Greek and Bulgarian nationalists say that.

<p>No it calls the it Arvanitika Albanian, and why would it use the term Albanian if it were not a varitey of Albanian? UNESCO also clearly says that it is a dialect.

<p>You have! UNESCO says that <b>Arvanitika Albanian is a diaspora dialect of Albanian</b>. Do tell me, how did you interpret that so that it would mean Arvanitic is not called Arvanitika Albanian and is not a dialect of Albanian? Powerful Magic, indeed! Well, the magician is usually impressed by his own Magic. (PS The name is Arvanitika Albanian according to Ethnologue. It says it at the heading in big bright letters.

<p>Might I suggest a compromise? <b><a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Arvanitic (linguistics)">Arvanitic (linguistics)</a></b> would appear to be the neutral form of the name, as opposed to, say, <b><a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a></b> or <b>Arvanitic dialect</b>.

<p>As I understand it, "<i>Arvanitic</i>" is the English word for it, and so the base article does need to be <i>Arvanitic...</i> in order to comply with this encyclopedia's language. However, I believe <b><a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ais.html" title="Français">Français</a></b> redirects appropriately (i.e. to <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French language</a>), and I don't see why we couldn't have as many redirects as there are variations; provided there is one centralised article, and one centralised discussion.</p>

<dd>UNESCO, Britannica, Encarta, Brisn Jospeph (University of Ohio) and every other source on the planet calls Arvanitic a DIALECT OF ALBANIAN. It's status is disputed, like that of Cantonese.

Therefore Wikipedia should not take sides by saying that it is a language and directly contradicting EVERY AVAILABLE SOURCE.

<dd>We need some experts on Wiki-policy here.

But, because of Wikipedia's self-determination policy, it should (?) be treated as a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>, but the situation should be described in detail in the article.

<p>Alexander, you do realise that in Northwestern Greece all Arvanites call themselves Albanians (Shqiptar). Therefore, opinions are divided on this issue as follows.<br />
Pro-dialect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every linguist and encyclopaedia on the planet</li>
<li>The Arvanites of Northwestern Greece.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pro-seperate language:</p>

<li>Greek extremist nationalists</li>
<li>The Arvanites of Southwestern Greece (<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica.html" title="Attica">Attica</a>).</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise 2</span></h2>
<p>OK, straw poll looked promising, but some objections were raised, making it a very narrow consensus, hence I call <b>no consensus</b>.</p>
<p>Something that we could try is if the involved parties try "approval voting" - that is; parties indicate which of the following page names they would be happy to see used. I don't know if this has been tried before, or if it will work, but it strikes me as a fresh idea that has the potentially to really lay things out - if lots of people approve one particular name, then we can see where this is going, for instance.</p>
<p>You can support as many page names as you like. Ideally, please give reasons/cite sources (inline links fine) with your support. If you really strongly oppose a name, say so, but please say why - I appreciate; it's been done before, but I'd like to see it all clearly laid out. Confusion and repetition seem to be the biggest issue here.</p>
<p>Feel free to suggest additional names. The order of names as listed by me shall imply no endorsement or personal preference in this matter - I've scrambled them a little to help reinforce this. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Talk</a></i></sup> 14:24, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>That is a comment from Rex, not me. That is not what made me firmly decide to vote in support.

Rather, I decided after I deliberated on the implications and applications of the policy to this and similar cases that are well within bounds. More proof that I voted on principle (I believe in this policy, and that it can apply to more cases) and was not bought off is the fact that I came close to withdrawing my vote after debating with Theathenae, but after more consideration (of the Shqiptar of Epirus, etc.) I stood by my vote.

<dd>of course they are languages, but they are grouped with other languages, and can also be described as <i>dialects of</i> some larger entity.

<dd>I am afraid that I am slow in getting this. Is the problem that Arvanites do not self-describe as Albanians? But 'Albanian' is not a self-designation anyway . For the purposes of linguistics, "Albanian" is one of the branches of Indo-European, and not a political term. Linguistically, Arvanites are speakers of Albanian, just like the English are speakers of Germanic. We avoid calling the English "Germans" or "Germanics" of course, but we call them a Germanic nation or tribe, and just so we could call the Arvanites an Albanian nation or tribe (English is still a Germanic language btw, in spite of being heavily influenced by French, just so Arvanitic is still an Albanian language, in spite of being heavily influenced by Greek). Note also <a href="../../../z/%C3%BC/r/Z%C3%BCrich_German_c7bb.html" title="Zürich German">Zürich German</a> etc. (my own language). We could also have Zürich German language, but I don't know what that would do for me or my self-esteem. Fact is that Zürich German is totally incomprehensible to speakers of other varieties of German, yet it is called a dialect <i>by convention</i>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 20:22, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to point out that no one disputes whether English is a dialect of German, but people (some within the Arvanitic speaking community itself) call Arvanitic Albanian and it is perfectly clear that all academics call it Arvanitic Albanian. Wikipedia should not try to solve this problem, but leave it at <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a>, and let the reader decide if he thinks it is a language or a dialect. We shouldn't spoon feed them everything. Izehar 20:31, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>nobody calls English a "German dialect". Indo-Europeanists call English a "Germanic dialect". Germanic linguists call English a "West Germanic language". Both are correct, again, entirely by convention. We have nothing except <i>convention</i> (common usage, google counts) to guide us in 'language vs. dialect' questions, there is <i>no</i> objective citerion. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 20:42, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm confused now, isn't this a dispute over whether Arvanitic is a language or a dialect? I can answer that, it is a dialect. Academics of all levels say so. Calling it a language would make Wikipedia look silly as it is promoting factual inaccuracies. However, calling it <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a> raises objections here, so plain Arvanitika should be used, or plain Arvanitic (the English name).

<dd>No, it is <i>also</i> commonly called the "Arvanitic language", there's nothing wrong with that.

"<a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a>" seems to be most common.

<dd>I still recommend plain <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a>. It sidesteps the whole dispute and just designates the speech of the Arvanites, without going into the complex areas of linguistics. Arvanitic could mean anything. And those google searches may also be inaccurate. While the high frequency of appearance of Arvanitika and Albanian just confirms the fact that they are closely related (dialects). If they were seperate languages belonging to the same language family, then (by extention) a search for English German would yield more results that English language. So Arvanitic is obviously a dialect. If we said that it is not, we could say that British English and American English are seperate languages, and could say <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_language.html" title="American language">American language</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_language.html" title="British language">British language</a>. They are not where the main pages are, they are just redirects to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a>, so what you are saying does make sense, it just seems to be unacceptable to all the disputing parities here.

<dd>that's fine, no objections from me, but it is true that this is not common Wikipedia style. "Arvanitika Albanian" doesn't prejudice the question either, it could be "Arvanitika Albanian language" or "Arvanitika Albanian dialect".

<dd>I agree with you dab, the problem is that the disputing parties won't. Especially +MATIA and Thathenae. They say that it can't be a dialect because the Arvanites of southwestern Greece say it isn't. What is interesting here is that some Arvanites would accept <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a>. This case is like the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>.

<p>Well Rex has provided links which say so. You don't get my point, do you? Let me clarify, <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno_English_606c.html" title="Hiberno English">Hiberno English</a> is the name of the dialect of English as used in Ireland. No Irishman would accept being labeled an Englishman, but he would say that he spoke English. Why can't that be done here? It's actually easier as some Arvanites do call themselves Albanians. Izehar 21:11, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still don't get it. I haven't heard of any Arvanites who call their language Albanian. They call it Arvanitika. I know personally many Arvanites, but only the parents of a friend can speak Arvanitika. While they understand (more or less) Albanian they cannot speak it - they find the accent too heavy. The rest of my Arvanites friends just know a couple of words in Arvanitika, μπάκα and μπίθας for example. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 21:26, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So what, didn't Theathenae say that mutual intelligibility are not relevant. This can be proven in the case of Chinese. The difference between all the Chinese "dialects" is about as vast as between the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_languages.html" title="Romance languages">Romance languages</a> (see <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a>). But no one would say that French and Portuguese are dialects of the same language. Also, Ethnologue calls it ARVANITIKA ALBANIAN, and the code AAT refers to ARVANITIKA ALBANIAN. Remember, books in Greek cannot be used as sources according to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. UNESCO clearly says that Arvanitika Albanian is a dialect of Tosk Albanian. What is your problem? Can you ive me a web link which rules out the possibility of Arvanitika being an Albanian dialect. Every linguist calls it an Albanian dialect, can't you understand that, only "some" Arvanites and Greek nationalists call it a seperate language (read the Helsinki Report, it's a <b>source</b>). Even if you did find some obscure book that rules out the possibility of Arvanitika Albanian being a language in its own right, what is more important, UNESCO, Ethnologue, University of Ohio etc or your hypothetical source (obscure book). I am trying to compromise. You cannot say that Arvanitika Albanian is a language in its own right when every sources we have says the exact opposite. What is so objectionable about <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Arvanitic (linguistics)">Arvanitic (linguistics)</a> etc? They are NEUTRAL, you are trying to force your POV onto Wikipedia. The above poll is coming against you again, why don't you propose a neutral compromise. Calling it a language is plain wrong, it is not a language as demonstrated by every source we have. Is UNESCO wrong? Is Britannica wrong? How about Brian Joseph? MATIA, try to be neutral. Also I like Izehar's argument above about Hiberno English, you can't explain that, can you. Just in the same way you can't explain that Arvanitic is called Arvanitika Albanian by UNESCO and Ethnologue and the AAT code refers to Arvanitika Albanian. Why don't you accept that you are wrong? Try and compromise, I am not insinsting on <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a> (which I am entitled to do), but on a neutral compromise plair <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a> or Arvanitica, why don't you do the same?

<p>I would like one good response regarding my previous comments (<a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_language.html" title="Macedonian language">Macedonian language</a> and Arvanitic songs, buildings, clothes etc). Ethnologue calls it a language and lists the following names: Arvanitika Albanian, Arvanitika, Arvanitic, Arberichte. That would be Arvanitic language etc. The linguists who have studied Arvanitika call it Arvanitika and not Arvanitic see <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_Arvanites_sources_cfa6.html" title="User:Matia.gr/Arvanites sources">User:Matia.gr/Arvanites sources</a>.

I haven't called anyone to join the poll because wikipedia is not a democracy. Which linguists call it Arvanitic? Are they more than those who call it Arvanitika? Did they study the language? Have they done publications about Arvanitika?

<li><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_language.html" title="Macedonian language">Macedonian language</a>: every neutral source (ie non-Bulgarian or Greek propaganda) calls Macedonian a language in its own right (Britannica, Encarta, Ethnologue...) and every neutral source (ie non Albanian or non Greek propaganda) calls Arvanitic an Albanian dialect (Britannica, Encarta, Ethnologue...).</li>
<li><a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Ohio_0121.html" title="University of Ohio">Brian Joseph</a> all emphasise the fact that Arvanitic/Arvanitika is a form of Albanian.</li>
<li>You should know that Ethnologue calls every dialect a language. Check Flemish, Mandarin, Cantonese (Yue), Gheg, Tosk etc. <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">Language</a> merely means form of communication. It is a standard Ethnologue form <b>X, a language of Y(country)</b>. You will never find <b>X a dialect of Y</b>. No, it's a standard form, it means nothing. Therefore all dialects are languages but not vice versa. UNESCO's and Ethnologue's primary name for Arvanitic is <b>Arvanitika Albanian</b>. What is that Albanian doing there if it is not a form of Albanian.</li>
<li>Arvanitic is merely an Anglicized name for Arvanitika. It makes no difference. Wikipedia policy requires that names should be in English where possible.</li>
<li>You questioning the honour and motives of everyone who voted qualifies as a <b>personal attack</b>.</li>
<li>You yourself have been talking about Brian Joseph quite a lot until just recently.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a democracy, but issues can be decided by polls (see <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>). I slight anomaly I know, but what can you do?</li>
<li>Finally MATIA, do you have a source which absolutely rules out the possibility of Arvanitica being an Albanian dialect? I have sources which rule out the possibility of it being a seperate language. Therefore it cannot be called <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_language.html" title="Arvanitika language">Arvanitika language</a> or [Arvanitic language]] according to Wikipedia policy (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>).

<p>I have told you there are no sources which rule out the possibility or Arvanitic being an Albanian dialect. All sources rule out the possibility of it being a seperate language. You can't claim that it is a seperate language solely on the basis that just "some" of the Arvanites don't identify as Albanians. What about The <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish people</a>, none of them would call themselves <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a> (they would most likely be offended considering Anglo-Irish history). Nevertheless, "none" of them deny the fact that their language (<a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno_English_606c.html" title="Hiberno English">Hiberno English</a>) is an English dialect. Also, according to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: <i>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by a reputable publisher</i>. Which reputable publisher denies the fact that Arvanitic is an Albanian dialect, but is a language in its own right? Trudgill? He doesn't. You don't have to answer now, find a "specific" source and quote it. More importantly, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says: <i>Articles should contain <b>only material that has been published by reputable or credible sources, regardless of whether individual editors regard that material to be true or false'</b></i><b>. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is</b> verifiability, not truth<b>. For that reason, it is vital that editors rely on good sources.</b> Do you understand MATIA? It is not important what you think of Mr Salimien, of the UNESCO linguists, of Brian Joseph or anyone else. What is is important it that they <b>say</b> that Arvanitic is an Albanian dialect, therefore under Wikipedia policy, what the authors were doing or thinking is not important. Reliable publishers say it, therfore under Wikipedia policy, we must say that Arvanitic is an Albanian dialect. It's Wikipedia policy that requires all this, not me.

<dd>Stop sending me on a wild goose chase to find something that doesn't exist (those sources are irellevant to the issues discussed here. They say nothing about a language or a dialect). Calling it <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_language.html" title="Arvanitika language">Arvanitika language</a> would be a violation of Wikipedia policy and I have explained why time and time again. Deal with it! Do you have a problem with the neutral <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a>? Your "sources" do not deny the fact that Arvanitic is a dialect and do not say that it is a language in its own right. That's your POV. Read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, we cannot violate it. Also, sources must be in English unless they are quotes in which case the original language must be given. And I have explained, if UNESCO, Britannica, Encarta, Ethnologue or any neutral source called Macedonian a dialect, then that could be changed. Do they say that it is a dialect? No they don't. Only Ethnologue mentions that some in Bulgaria view it as a Bulgarian dialect (imperialists, they don't count. Read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). Are you saying that UNESCO, Britannica, Encarta, Brian Joseph etc are wrong? That they are secretly Albanian nationalists? Wikipedia policy must be observed.

<p>Hi MATIA, I have read <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28languages%29_8df0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (languages)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (languages)</a>. It’s talk page is irrelevant and of no formal significance. In the project page it says that <b>languages</b> should be suffixed with language. It doesn't say anything about dialects; this rule obviously doesn't apply to them. How else do you explain the existence of articles such as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_French_55f1.html" title="Canadian French">Canadian French</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_Spanish_c9c5.html" title="Mexican Spanish">Mexican Spanish</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_Hebrew_19fa.html" title="Ashkenazi Hebrew">Ashkenazi Hebrew</a> etc. Are they all in violation of the policy? No, that policy does not apply to them as they are dialects. The same as <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a>. Anyway, as I have said, you obviously don't like the idea of using the name Albanian in the title and as a significant group of Arvanites find it offensive, Wikipedia should be more moderate and not as blunt and direct and state the facts as they are like UNESCO does. That is why I support <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a> plain. It is not in violation of any policy, it is a dialect, there is no doubt about it, every source we have says it is and no source exists which says that it is an independent language. The Helsinki Report merely mentions that "some" Arvanites dislike their language to be called Albanian, but all linguists call it that anyway. It doesn't say that it is a separate language. That is original research, you own conclusion and it is not allowed to be used (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>). Let me put this in perspective for you:</p>

Cannot be used. The existance of a separate Arvanitic language is not supported by any evidence at all as per <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> and <a href="../../../r/c/_/WP%7ERC_d77e.html" title="WP:RC">WP:RC</a></li>

However, as an indication of my good faith, and my desire not to offend anyone, including the Arvanites of southwestern Greece. Therefore, I believe that this version cannot be used.</li>

For example we have <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, not <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athina.html" title="Athina">Athina</a>. This is neutral as it does not explicitly state that Arvanitic is an independent language or a dialect. I cannot offend anyone, it is accurate (it may be vague, but so what, at least it isn't inaccurate) and above all, it is supported by an overwhelming majority consensus. Please tell me, I want to understand how your mind works: what is so objectionable about this title?

<p>PS Ethnologue and Helsinki call it a language, but they don't call it a "independent language". That makes all the difference. The fact that they call it a language merely means that it is an oral form of communication (see <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>). It doesn't not exclude the fact that it is a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>. All <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a> are <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">languages</a> but not all <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">languages</a> are <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a>. Are you saying that <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Ohio_0121.html" title="University of Ohio">University of Ohio</a> are all wrong? They all call it specifically a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> (Encarta calls it a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">variety</a>). Are they lying? See it this way. If Arvanitic is an independent language, that means that the vast majority of sources are wrong. If it is a dialect, then they all are right. What do you think the facts are? Do you think it is possible that UNESCO, Britannica, Brian Joseph etc are all wrong? I have already explained this to you a million times!

<p>MATIA, I have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do NOT have the word language in the title. Witness Brigish English, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin (linguistics)</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Flemish (linguistics)">Flemish (linguistics)</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_Hebrew_19fa.html" title="Ashkenazi Hebrew">Ashkenazi Hebrew</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Cantonese (linguistics)">Cantonese (linguistics)</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardi_Hebrew_14bd.html" title="Sephardi Hebrew">Sephardi Hebrew</a>, etc etc... Arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by Wikipedia policy, therefore <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_language.html" title="Arvanitika language">Arvanitika language</a> are out of the question. I don't want to use <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a> as it will be too controversial (so i don't want Albanian in the title). Therefore, the only options are <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>. They can and should be used. <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a> has the majority vote, and therefore that shall be used. What is wrong with it? It is neutral. It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a> is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies. What UNESCO, Britannica etc say is assumed correct according to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I am not labeling Arvanites Albanians against their will. Are we labeling the Irish English against their will by calling their language (<a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno_English_606c.html" title="Hiberno English">Hiberno English</a>) a dialect of English? No! So stop that straw man argument. <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a> is neutral and will not offend anyone AND has majority support here and will be used according to policy.

<dd>Arvanites doesn't derive from Albanian, but yes, you are right that this is one of the theories.

<p>I'm saying that I didn't like the fact that the article seemed to indicate that Albanian is not a language, but a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_family.html" title="Language family">language family</a>. That is not supported by anyone. Language families is a matter for linguists and all lingusts say that Albanian is a single language with various dialects. That is why I made it perfectly clear that most linguists view Arvanitika as an Albanian dialect (thus affirming the fact that as far as linguists are conserned, that Albanian is one language; ie Wikipedia is not pushing inaccuracies), while at the same time stating that most Arvanites consider their language seperate from Albanian (again, not pushing inaccuracies).</p>
<p>I am planning to propose merging <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosk_language.html" title="Tosk language">Tosk language</a> and <a href="../../../g/h/e/Gheg_language.html" title="Gheg language">Gheg language</a> into <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian language</a>, where they can be examined in detail. I have made a table, comparing the major differences between them and that could go there (not finished yet). As seperate articles, they don't do much, except confuse. I'll go into this in more detail on the respective talk pages.</p>
<p>Are you accepting my changes, there's nothing wrong with them, is there (POV, nah!)?

<p>This <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanitic_language_720d.html#Matia" title="Talk:Arvanitic language">phrase is wrong</a>. The correct (by linguists) phrasing probably is "Albanian language makes up its own branch of the Indo-European languages". Labeling Tosk as a dialect will probably anger other albanian editors, I would suggest you take it easy with the moves. And I think the phrases you 've changed today here, didn't mean that Albanian isn't a language, but they explained some stuff.</p>
<p>I've created a new section in my user talk page, please add subsections (copy pasting perhaps or whatever you feel is good) with your today explanations, so we can discuss it there nice and peacefully and avoiding making the articles' talk pages a mess&#160;:) We'll be in touch. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 13:58, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Bogdan and 007. This article should include everything about Arvanitika (I 'm still expecting your answer dear Bogdan on Brian Joseph, your picture is neither NPOV, nor accurate according to BJ's studies).

<p>I have some Arvanitic songs from books, which we could use (some of the books have Arvanitika in greek, in latin, and then a plain greek translation). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 20:44, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I have my doubts whether the Prayer is, correctly written, in Arvanitika, I don't think that the other is Gheg. I have removed it and added an external link for the prayer in Tosk, after reading the above comments. I'll bring other Arvanitic text in the near future. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 01:40, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is totally unreliable information. The diagram in which the Arvanitic's position within Albanian is shown "Shqip" (the Standard Albanian word for Albanian) appears to be a sub-dialect of Tosk. Gheg speakers say they speak Albanian and not Gheg. They may only say "We speak the Gheg dialect of the Albanian language".</p>
<p>And finally, how come Arvanitic is a language when by all the means it is only a dialect of Albanian (not even a dialect, a form of Albanian).
