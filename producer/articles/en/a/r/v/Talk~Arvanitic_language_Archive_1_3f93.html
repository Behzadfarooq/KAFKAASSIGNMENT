<p>"Arvanites are those whose mother tongue is Arvanitika (name in Greek - Áñâáíßôåò)/ Arberichte (name in their language); most linguists use the word Albanian for that language, but the community loathes its use, and it is therefore advisable that this sensitivity be taken into consideration unless researchers and/or human and minority rights activists do not mind alienating the very community they are studying. Likewise, they call themselves Arvanites (in Greek) and Arberor (in their language); but in Northwestern Greece, in their language, they use the term Shqiptar (the same used by Albanians of Albania), a term strongly disliked by the other Arvanites, who also resent being called Albanians."<a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html--" class="external free" title="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html--" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html--</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 00:31, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Albanau, please read what you quote, you will do us all a favor. From the link you provided: "Sociolinguistic research conducted in two communities in southern Greece ... shows that people past their 50's on the average have a good command of the language (Tsitsipis 1983 and 1988)". That was 20 years ago. Today it would read "people past their 70's". Which is exactly what I wrote ("septuagenarians and octuagenarians"). Half of these people researched by Tsitsipis in the 1980's are dead (life expectancy in Greece is 78) , and in ten years they will <i>all</i> be dead. So please do not <i>invent</i> differences of opinion where there are none. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 12:23, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Albanau is right in stating that Arvanites are already Greek citizens. What's there to discuss about that? Are you claiming, on the other hand, that Arvanites do not have Albanian roots? The Greek state may not recognize minorities, but we have already provided neutral sources about the case. What would you call an Albanian people that came from Albania, speaks an Albanian dialect and upholds Albanian traditions? Can their nation of origin be just erased? Is nationality of any people just some sort of paper that one can declare on his own, or what? The distinction made here is obvious that refers to Greek citizens, but to those Greek citizens of Albanian descent. These specific Greek citizens are called Arvanites in Greek, Arbërorë in their own language of origin and Arbërorë in Standard Albanian. --<a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrymnir_7f92.html" title="User:Grymnir">Grymnir</a> 07:44, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Such attitudes have led many Arvanite (as well as Vlach, and Macedonian) parents to discourage their children from learning their mother tongue so as to avoid similar discrimination and suffering (Trudgill, 1983:130)."

<p>"One reason for such a slow movement is <b>the apparent hostility of the Greek state</b> to such ‘revivals’ among Arvanites, Vlachs, and Macedonians, which is indicated by police disruption of festivals (in Macedonia), and harassment of musicians who play and sing songs in minority languages; as well as by the tolerance -by the state and particularly its judiciary- of public calls, printed in the press, to use violence against those musicians; likewise, human and minority rights activists have been the object of similar threats (Stohos, 20/7/1994 and in previous issues, where even the European Union’s Euromosaic project -to report on the status of the linguistic minorities in the EU- was attacked)."

<dd>Please notice how old this "data" is, ranging from the <b>70's mostly</b>, to the early 90's. Also notice that you invoke "Stohos", a fascist periodical that has since been banned for inciting racism.

<dd>These data are a part of those presented and that both concerned parties can use. Furthermore we, as Albanians, are making use of the <b>Greek</b> HRWC! We are using Greek data among other! I don't know how much more neutral than this it can get. Albanau has already provided other neutral sources in this very page. The facts are that Greece has, reportedly, not recognized minorities within its own establishment for years. The data make use of historical evidence and give also references. '70-'90 is a a very objective chronology and recent too by historical standards. If you have other neutral, more recent(!) information on the case, naturally you can contribute to the article. But what you and Theathenae are now doing is just deleting or preveting existing information and contributions to the topic. Is wikipedia a place to add information or to prevent it from being shown? --<a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrymnir_7f92.html" title="User:Grymnir">Grymnir</a> 07:44, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Grymnir can understand the greek proverb, "don't try to hide behind your finger". Both here and in Arvanites article, Tosks are mentioned, and though different from Ghegs, they are Albanians. But it seems you would prefer to replace the reference to Tosks with Albanians, or even call Arvanites plain vanilla Albanians, but that would be untrue.<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 08:11, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where did I do such thing? Arvanites are Greek citizens! I thinks that's already clear! You are pushing inaccuracies, don't do that! Tosk is an Albanian dialect, what would a user from Japan think while reading "Arvanitic is a dialect of Tosk"? It helps claryfying within the phrase that "Arvanitic is a dialect of Albanian Tosk dialect". What are you afraid of? When I say "this Black Box" instead of just "this Box" am I doing a crime or claryfying things out?--<a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrymnir_7f92.html" title="User:Grymnir">Grymnir</a> 08:59, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Είναι αλβανικά κανονικά του 14ου αιώνα.</b> Αυτό το πιστοποιούν εξάλλου και οι σημερινοί μορφωμένοι μετανάστες Αλβανοί, οι οποίοι, όταν πηγαίνουν στα Μεσόγεια, λένε "μα εσείς μιλάτε αρχαία αλβανικά".

Ποιος άλλωστε θα καταπίεζε τους Αρβανίτες στην Ελλάδα; Οι Αρβανίτες ηγούνται της Ελλάδας. Συνήθως τα επαγγέλματα που ασκούν είναι πρωθυπουργοί, στρατηγοί, ναύαρχοι, κ.λπ.

<dd><b>One reason for such a slow movement is the apparent hostility of the Greek state to such ‘revivals’ among Arvanites</b>, Vlachs, and Macedonians, <b>which is indicated by police disruption of festivals (in Macedonia), and harassment of musicians who play and sing songs in minority languages; as well as by the tolerance -by the state and particularly its judiciary- of public calls, printed in the press, to use violence against those musicians;</b></dd>

<dd>Thank you, <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrymnir_7f92.html" title="User:Grymnir">Grymnir</a>, I looked for that passage at <a href="http://www.pangalos.gr" class="external text" title="http://www.pangalos.gr" rel="nofollow">Pangalos' website</a> but couldn't find it. Notice how he concludes: "<i>But they</i> (the Arvanites) <i>killed their past because, fanatically convinced of their own Greekness, and helped by language-defenders and teachers, they abandoned this idiom and made it extinct, and it is now spoken by no one, at least younger that my age</i>". So much for persecution. Pangalos calls his fellow Arvanites "fanatical Greeks". How much must <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> hate him ... Please also notice, in the HRW reference you provide, how nothing concrete is mentioned. As for the press, and the "calls for violence" therein: you must not be familiar with how free press functions. There is no censorship in Western democracies. If a newspaper editor, or a correspondent, wants to write something and the newspaper approves, no power on earth can stop the publication. Only if a crime is being committed are the courts allowed to intervene. Still newspapers are usually aquitted in court, as lawsuits against the press are often viewed as threats to the liberty of the Fourth Estate. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 09:05, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Grymnir, it seems that you are the one who made the talk page a mess, please don't to the same to the article. You may translate it for non-Greek readers, but anyone who can read Greek can see that my translation was accurate, and I'm guessing that if you have translated the above you have mis-translated the word Turks, or perhaps this is your comment. Hundreds CD and Vinyl Disks have been released with Arvanitik songs. And as Arvanites have chosen <b>not</b> to speak or even learn Arvanitic language, the phrase "Spoken in: Greece" is not that accurate. Finally, neither one Arvanitis nor any Arvanitic group or organization will agree with you and your claims Grymnir.</p>
<p>ps I've wrote <b>what</b> and <b>when</b> Pangalos said, and I guess it was reproduced in many newspapers because it was a news conference for a book, so don't tell me I didn't provide sources. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 08:22, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't do anything to the article except moving one answer of Albanau's under a different title, because the same issue was being discussed under two titles. I didn't accuse you of improper translation. I meant my own translation in English of possible forecoming material of Arvanites' own publications. What I accused you is that you took just an OPINION and brought it here as a fact, and leaving out of that material data very relevant to the issue in hand. Your <b>wishful thinking</b> that no Arvanite and no Arvanite Organization will agree with me, conflicts with already presented data! Why would we be talking about this Arvanitic language that doesn't exist at all, but "magically" is somehow reported all over the internet and various euroepan publications, cds, books etc., coming in/about that language?! Unless you provide facts, your claims are just claims! "I am an Alien from Outer Space." Should I write that down on Wikipedia as a fact?!

<dd>If one were to follow Albanau's writing on UCK and its "Greek subsidiary", one could write there is an "<i>unconfirmed</i> report that you <i>are</i> an Alien from Outer Space". No one in their right mind suggests that Arvanitic <i>does not exist</i>! Arvanitic is <i>almost</i> extinct, as Pangalos himself stated: notice how he mentions his grandmother as the last Arvanitic-fluent member of his family. This alone takes us back to the 1930's. If you want to blame the Greek state and the Greek people (including the Arvanites) for what has happened since then, or before, be my guest. But this 2005. What has happened, has. The current situation is rather straightforward: once a few septuagenarians and octuagenarians die, no Arvanite speakers will be left in Greece. I guess this is sad in a way, as a language, <i>any language</i>, is a form of cultural wealth. The same has happened to many regional languages and dialects throughout Europe. It's the inevitable course of events in an era dominated by radio and television. Efforts to revive those languages have taken place, but unless the young are willing to go along, these languages are destined to become museum pieces.

the phrase "their language", that you restored, is inacurate.</p>
<p>Arvanitika is partially intelligible to speakers of Tosk. Dialects are perceived as unintelligible to speakers of other dialects... The language is heavily influenced by Greek. from Ethnologue but you probably have read that before.</p>
<p>Arvanitika is not Tosks' language and is not Greek. Or maybe it's both. If they choose to speak modern albanian, the phrase "their language" would again be inacurate.</p>

While you are correct in stating that the Albanian population are divded in two Geg and Tosk , you are highly erred and have angered me by stating that they are so different that "they as people with origin and the dialects can be considered separate languages and not the same people" and have further angered me in bringing Greece in this separatist and schismatic description of the Albanian people and Albanian language, also in regards of the Arvanites and Arvanítik language: a variety of Tosk Albanian. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 00:44, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All citizens of Greece are Greeks, by definition. Ethnic, linguistic, religious, ancestral or what-have-you qualifiers do not change this. The same is true about the French, the Japanese, the Cubans etc. To illustrate it with an example, a Palestinian (Muslim or Christian) citizen of Israel is an Israeli, although he or she may not identify with the predominantly Jewish character of the state of Israel. Contrast this with the uniform self-identification of Arvanite Greeks as <i>Greeks</i>. Here not only is the technical prerequisite (citizenship) fulfilled, but also the mental one. I understand that this is difficult to fathom by someone who <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=343950&amp;oldid=343947" class="external text" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=343950&amp;oldid=343947" rel="nofollow">writes</a> that there is an <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C3%87K" class="external text" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C3%87K" rel="nofollow">"Albanian Liberation Army" operating in Greece</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 23:38, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

You can also prove that you are not a terrorist sympathiser by deleting the reference in the Swedish Wikipedia about a "Chameria Liberation Army" operating in Greece: a statement that you wrote in December 2004 and still stands in the UCK article in Swedish. As for my statement above, which you find "confusing", it is perfectly clear to anyone with a reasonably good understanding of English. If it confuses you, it is not my fault. Lastly, it makes no difference to me that you reported me, as you say.

<p>I really don't have much to add to the opening paragraph of the Greek Helsinki report. The Arvanites "loathe" the association with the word "Albanian", so I rephrased the wording to take into account their sensitivities. Nowhere is the link with Albania denied or clouded, but it appears that Albanian extremists are only satisfied if a specifically Albanian identity is projected onto the Arvanites, ignoring what the Arvanites themselves think. This is ultimately a case of whether or not the Arvanites have a right <i>not</i> to have themselves and their language called Albanian, in the same way that the Croats have the right not to have themselves and their language called Serbian, and the <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> have the right not to be called <a href="../../../e/s/k/Eskimos.html" title="Eskimos">Eskimos</a>. As for the Arvanitic language being "forbidden", this is patently ridiculous, as there are no laws in Greece regulating what language should be spoken in the home. The Arvanites can and do learn their language informally. Mirroring the situation faced by many other lesser-used languages around the world, the trend in recent years has been towards abandoning the language in favour of Greek and more "useful" foreign languages such as English.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 05:37, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Albanau please check <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_encyclopedia.html" title="1911 encyclopedia">1911 encyclopedia</a>, the old encyclopedia I mentioned is a previous version of Britanica. I wrote that Ghegs and Tosks aren't the same phara and it seems that this have angered you. I'll give you a similar example in Ancient Greece: Spartans and Athenians weren't the same tribe but both where Greeks. I've read in the past about Arvanites and Albania and I've talked with many Arvanites in Greece. I used the word phara (I already said that I don't know if this should be translated as tribe or clan or perhaps group of families) the way Arvanites use it.</p>
<p>Grymnir anyone checking article's history can understand who is trying to push his agenda. I've wrote before "Arvanitika is not Tosks' language and is not Greek. Or maybe it's both.

<dd>1911 information is outdated and user Albanau has provided newer references. I am not angry of anything except for the fact that some of the people here are making a big fuss about... what? Arvanites are of Albanian origin. Arbëror means just of Arbëria, of Albania. Thei language is classified as old Albanian, a variety of Tosk dialect as also is the Arbëresh, or Arbëror language in Italy. These people were Albanians that moved from Albania to Greece and Italy and kept their traditions and language up to now. Of course their language has incorporated Italian and Greek words for newer concepts and inventions, but what does this have to do with the fact that these languages are Albanian sub-dialects spoken by ethnic Albanians in Greece and Italy? They are Greeks and Italians, no one disputes that, but they have Albanian descent! What is that hard to grasp out of this? What is all the fuss about? Arvanites with Moraiti songs attended the folkloric festival of Albanian songs in 2004 for God's sake, where ethnic Albanians from Montenegro, Bosnia, Italy, Greece, Kosovo, FYROM, etc along with, normally, Albanian citizens themselevs were taking part. --<a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrymnir_7f92.html" title="User:Grymnir">Grymnir</a> 09:13, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oops, you just got caught: <i>...are Albanian sub-dialects spoken by ethnic Albanians in Greece</i>. You wish. Arvanites are <b>not</b> ethnic Albanians.

<dl>
<dd>The first <b>Christian Albanian</b> migrations to what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (<i>Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19</i>), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when <b>Albanians</b> were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (<i>Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 &amp; 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19</i>). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered <b>the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians</b> (<i>Trudgill, 1975:6</i>). Another wave of Muslim Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arvanites in Central and Southern Greece.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Very little is known about the Albanian presence in Thrace; it was probably a spill-over of the many migrations mentioned above. Anyhow, there were many Albanians in Eastern Thrace and in the adjacent Western Thrace department of Evros. The former, as Christians, were relocated in Greece during the compulsory exchange of Christians and Muslims between modern-day Turkey and Greece in the 1920’s: many settled in the Salonica department.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>As for the Arvanites of Epirus and Western Macedonia, they are considered to be part of the modern Albanian nation</b> (Banfi, 1994:20), something which perhaps <b>explains their self-identification as Shqiptars</b> rather than Arberor. When frontiers were drawn up in the early XX century, some Christian and Muslim Albanians were left in Greek territory, just as some Greeks were left in Albanian territory. An important part of these Albanians, the Muslim Chams, fled Greece towards the end of World War II, as many had collaborated with the occupying forces and were, as a result, persecuted by Greek resistance.</dd>

I won't go on repeating the facts that are already written if you are unable to read the talk page. Arvanites are (or actually were, since the majority of Arvanites speak only Greek for the reasons I've mentioned before) a language group minority, they are self-identified as Greeks and they have their own history.<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 12:32, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah we know the story, according to sources blah blah blah 30% of Greece was Albanian, 30% was Slavo-Bulgaro-Serbo-Macedonian 30% was Turkish and 10% was Romanian. Because they couldn't agree with each other, they just decided to use a neutral ethnicity and language. And now back to the real world Albanian nationalists like Albanau claim that Arvanitika is nearly dead because it's forbidden to be used in Greece. Go to this link <a href="http://www.music.gr/kritikes.asp?IdProduct=302" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.music.gr/kritikes.asp?IdProduct=302" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and use on online translator on this phrase: "Αρβανίτικα Τραγούδια". Arvanitika has a status of a <b>protected language</b> in Greece, similar to that of <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsakonic.html" title="Tsakonic">Tsakonic</a>. Hence people like Albanau are nothing but ignorant nationalists who have no clue on reality. They have never been to Greece nor every met an Arvanite Greek.</p>
<p>And as for those people who consider Arvanites to be an "oppressed Albanian ethnic minority in Greece", I'll translate a funny quotation which I just found on a website <a href="http://users.aias.gr/oode/meletes/3tayt.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://users.aias.gr/oode/meletes/3tayt.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which deals with the factors of people's ethnic identities and feelings:</p>
<p>"Στην περιοχή που μένω, ένα μεγάλο μέρος τού πληθυσμού, ανήκει σε αυτή την κατηγορία, στους "Αρβανίτες". Μια μέρα λοιπόν, συνέβει το εξής κωμικοτραγικό. Μπροστά μου, βρισκόταν μια παρέα από Αρβανίτες. Τότε, πέρασε από εκεί ένας Βορειοηπειρώτης, τον οποίο γνώριζα, που είχε έρθει με την τελευταία αυτή μετακίνηση πληθυσμών. Μιλούσε σπαστά Ελληνικά, όμως αισθανόταν Έλληνας. Τότε, η παρέα τών Αρβανιτών, άρχισε να λέει μεταξύ τους: "Κοίτα ρε τον βρωμο-Αλβανό, που ήρθε να μας πάρει τις δουλειές! Δουλεύουν οι Αλβανοί, και δεν έχουμε δουλειές εμείς οι Έλληνες!"</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;...In the region that I live, a great part of the population belongs to this category, the "Arvanites". So one day, a comicotragic even took place. I found a group of Arvanites to be sitting in front of me. Then a Northern Epirote (Greek) that I knew passed by, he had arrived with the last population exchange. He spoke broken Greek but himself he felt fully Greek. Then, the group of Arvanites started saying between each other "Look at the dirty Albanian who came here to take our jobs! Albanians work and us Greeks stay unemployed!"...&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>That's the answer to Albanians who fantasise Arvanites as an oppressed part of the Albanian nation and claim that there's no such thing as Arvanite Greeks. End of story, I'm reverting and reporting Albanau for vandalism. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:20, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Personally I don't consider Britannica a reliable source, well it depends on the version anyway. Whether you want to believe it or not, it was Arvanites who used the term "dirty Albanian" for a <b>Greek</b> immigrant from Albania. There's no biased or nationalistic overtone in the article.

<p>From ethnologue.com:<br />
Arvanitika (Arvanitic) a language of Greece: Arvanitika is <b>partially intelligible</b> to speakers of Tosk.<br />
Tosk a language of Albania: Reported to be <b>inherently unintelligible</b> with Gheg Albanian and <b>partially intelligible</b> with Arvanitika.<br />
And to sum up what was previously written on those talk pages (please take the time and read them carefully): Gheg and Tosk are Albanian languages and also are the name of the Albanian people who speak them. Arvanitic is partially understandable by Tosks, and not understandable by Ghegs. From what you've shown until now it's hard for me to believe that you act in good faith, I do hope you will prove that I'm wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 14:20, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ethnologue says that Arvanitika is <b>partially intelligible</b> to speakers of Tosk. It doesn't say anything about Gheg. Unfortunatly, I can't really prove that, but you can't prove the reverse. I can only cite my personal experience and present this rather feeble argument: Compare <a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-alb-gheg.html" class="external text" title="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-alb-gheg.html" rel="nofollow">Gheg</a> with <a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-alb-tosk.html" class="external text" title="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-alb-tosk.html" rel="nofollow">Tosk</a> and <a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-arberishte.html" class="external text" title="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-arberishte.html" rel="nofollow">Arvanitic</a>. You will see that the differences between these languages is smaller than the difference between say Norwegian and Danish, and we all know that there is a degree of intelligibility between the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavian_languages.html" title="Scandinavian languages">Scandinavian languages</a>. How can you then say that Gheg speakers can't, to a certain point, understand Arvanites or vice versa. REX 09:29, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Stop editing the page and prove your point if you can. REX 15:36, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll repeat it, just once, Tosk is <b>reported to be inherently unintelligible with Gheg</b> and Tosk is <b>partially intelligible</b> with Arvanitic, and that is according to ethnologue.com, visually it would be something like<br />
Arvanitic &lt; Tosk ~ Gheg. According to the wiki about the albanian language:<br />
<i>There are two principal dialects, the Tosk and the Gheg which are mutually intelligible depending on the level of speakers' literacy and proficiency in standard Albanian. <b>In their purest vernacular forms, Gheg and Tosk are inherently unintelligible.</b> ... The two dialects have phonological as well as lexicological differences.</i><br />
I don't speak Albanian or Arvanitic so I can't say that Gheg speakers can't do that or the other, but I believe that's what Ethonologue and wikipedia say: A Tosk speaker can understand a bit an Arvanitic speaker, but a Gheg speaker can't. I guess this happened because Arvanites and their language evolved apart from the Tosks and the Ghegs.<br /></p>

<p><i>In Greece, as minority languages are all alien (Abstand) to Greek, the use of different names for them (Arvanitika rather than Albanian, Vlach rather than Romanian, Slav rather than Macedonian) has contributed to denying their heteronomy (i.e. their dependence on the corresponding standard language) and increasing their autonomy (by assigning them the status of autonomous languages). As a result, the minority language’s vulnerability grew significantly, as well as the dissociation of the speakers’ ethnic (Arvanite, Vlach, Slavophone) identities from the corresponding national identities (Albanian, Romanian, Macedonian) which have developed in the respective modern nation-states. Today, Arvanite ethnic identity is perceived by many members of the community as distinct from that of the other Greeks who have Greek as their mother tongue but as fully compatible with Greek national identity (likewise for many Vlachs and Macedonians). A similar phenomenon has helped weaken the links between Pomaks in Greece (speaking a Bulgarian-based language) and Bulgarians, and the consequent Pomaks’ assimilation into the Turkish ethnic and, by now, national identity in Western Thrace, an assimilation here detrimental to Greece’s homogenization and anti-minority policies.</i></p>
<p><i>Almost all speakers of Arvanitika are today bilingual, i.e. they also speak Greek, usually fluently for the younger generations. It is widely agreed that Arvanitika today have been influenced significantly by the linguistic environment in which they have evolved, sometimes for centuries, without any contact with the Albanian communities of modern day Albania. So, it has acquired a separate (Ausbau) status from Albanian, in fact with dialectical richness; nevertheless, at least partial mutual intelligibility between Arvanite and Albanian exists. Indeed, the recent (in the early 1990’s) arrival of hundreds of thousands, mainly illegal, Albanian immigrants in Greece has led to a successful test of that mutual intelligibility, when many settled in Arvanitika villages.</i></p>
<p><i>A comparison with standard Albanian shows that Arvanitika has suffered reduction and simplification. Reduction here means loss of: Albanian vocabulary (often replaced by Greek words duly adapted phonetically and morphologically); prepositions (sometimes replaced by Greek ones); verbal tenses; and forms. While simplification consists of loss of case forms, connecting particles and invariable verbal forms.</i></p>
<p><i>On the other hand, Arvanitika is threatened with extinction. In the early 1970’s, more than 80% of the inhabitants of Arvanite villages in the Attica &amp; Beotia departments were found to be fluent speakers of Arvanitika, though the loss of the language was more pronounced in the villages close to Athens than elsewhere; at the same time, however, the actual use of the language was more limited. Moreover, there has been a rather widespread indifference among Arvanites, as well as Vlachs and Macedonian, about the fate of their mother tongues, along with self-deprecation: they have been led by the dominant unilingual Greek culture to -usually sincerely- believe that these languages are deficient, lack proper grammatical structure, have a poor vocabulary. So, gradually, Arvanites have switched from bilingualism to a subordination of Arvanitika to Greek; and, sometimes, young people discourage their parents from speaking the language (especially in public). It is probably a correct estimate, although no studies equivalent to that of the 1970s exist, that the language is used today by middle aged people (interchanged with Greek) and by elderly people (in most contexts) and much less by the younger generation (usually when addressing older people, in strict family context, or, sometimes, too, to make fun of non-speakers). Moreover, in the Peloponnese, it seems that the users are predominantly elderly people. Experts, therefore, agree that Arvanitika in Greece is threatened with extinction more than the equivalent Arberichte language of Southern Italy, as the latter country is more tolerant and does not feel threatened by plurilingualism.</i></p>
<p><i>Since the 1980s, some efforts to preserve Arvanite culture have been made. A congress was held in 1985. Four cultural associations have been created: the Arvanitikos Syndesmos Hellados (the Arvanite League of Greece) which has been publishing, since 1983, the bimonthly Besa (in Greek); the Kentro Arvanitikou Politismou (Center for Arvanite Culture); the Arvanitikos Syllogos Ano Liosion (Arvanite Association of Ano Liosia); and the Syllogos Arvaniton Corinthias (Association of Arvanites of Corinthia). Books on Arvanite culture have been published. Church reading and chanting in some Arvanite villages has been reported Finally, we had the release of a CD with Arvanite music mentioned above. Overall, though, this movement is weaker than similar ones among Vlachs and Macedonians (and certainly among officially recognized Turks).</i></p>
<p><i>One reason for such a slow movement is the hostility of the Greek state to such ‘revivals’ among Arvanites, Vlachs, and Macedonians, which is indicated by police disruption of festivals (in Macedonia), and harassment of musicians who play and sing songs in minority languages; as well as by the tolerance -by the state and particularly its judiciary- of public calls, printed in the press, to use violence against those musicians; likewise, human and minority rights activists have been the object of similar threats, where even the European Union’s Euromosaic project -to report on the status of the linguistic minorities in the EU- was attacked). Moreover, the EBLUL’s first visit to the community was violently attacked in state-sponsored publications.</i></p>
<p><i>Likewise, Arvanitika has never been included in the educational curricula of the modern Greek state. On the contrary, its use has been strongly discouraged at schools (and in the army) through physical punishment, humiliation, or, in recent years, simple incitation of the Arvanitika users. Such attitudes have led many Arvanite (as well as Vlach, and Macedonian) parents to discourage their children from learning their mother tongue so as to avoid similar discrimination and suffering.</i></p>

The helsinki report has been thoroughly examined both in this talk page and in <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanites_53e1.html" title="Talk:Arvanites">Talk:Arvanites</a>. You discussed the Helsinki report with other people, it's all written, perhaps you should read them again and remove the POV tag. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 14:50, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No MATIA. False facts are on the page. Facts that haven't been proven. The false facts are that Arvanitic is a language in its own right which is what ths article claims. There are no sources to support that claim. Hence it is POV. REX 15:21, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Just another try to hide the truth about Greece</span></h2>
<p>I have to react. It seems to me that this is just another try of the Greek nationalists to hide that minorities live in Greece and they have no basic human rights. Those people there have no Greek origin and they see themselves as of non-Greek origin.</p>
<p>Same happens with all national minorities that live in Greece (Albanians, Macedonians, Turkish, Roma etc.). <b>They have no basic human rights</b> in Greece. Just few years ago they were even inprisoned if they spoke their mother tongues.</p>
<p>I just can not understand how can the world ignore this. Every single human rights organization is criticising Greece, but the impotent politicians do not do anything about it. What a fucked up world we are living in. Macedonian 00:40, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tottaly support you Macedonian. I mean, how can the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_union.html" title="European union">European union</a> actually be in union with the violent and racistic policy of Greece? I mean, don't they (the Greeks) know the word <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> (which has roots from their land)? Oohh, I don't think so. <a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Bomac</a> 20:19, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
