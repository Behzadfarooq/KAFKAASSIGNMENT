<p>Admission to most institutes in India (like IISc/IIT ) are through GATE exam which is conducted during February every year. GATE is a common entrance for institutes like IISc/ IITs. The sale of applications and information brochures is during Septermber/October. Information about important dates is in <a href="http://gate.iisc.ernet.in/" class="external autonumber" title="http://gate.iisc.ernet.in/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://gate.iitm.ac.in/" class="external autonumber" title="http://gate.iitm.ac.in/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<p>IISc has a two year M.E program in most departments (which is called M.Tech/M.Des in other departments). For people interested in research it also has M.Sc(Engineering) programming which takes about 2 to 2.5 years. The entrance to these programmes is primarily through GATE.</p>
<p>There are two major research programmes (apart from M.Sc(Engg)) - Ph.D and Integrated Ph.D. Admissions for Ph.D programme is through "IISc Entrance test" which is conducted in April [8]. Usually Ph.D programme is taken by students after completing their Masters, though some departments offer direct Ph.D to bachelors. Integrated Ph.D programme is a 5 year course (with 2 years of course work and 3 years of research work). This programme is offered mainly in science stream.</p>
<p>People working in companies can apply for "External Registration Programs" (ERP) . It is similar to M.Sc(Engg)/Ph.D programme. The candidate needs to spend only the first six months at the institute. Research can then be carried on from his/her company. The candidate must have atleast two years of professional experience and must have a guide at the company<a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/admissions/ERPEligibility.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/admissions/ERPEligibility.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Entrance to IIT M.Tech programmes is also through GATE. Depending on the GATE score, some IITs (like Kanpur) require additional tests and interview. Others give admission solely based on GATE score . GATE score can also be used to apply for (KReSIT) Kanwal Rekhi school of Information Technology <a href="http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/about/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> , which additionally requires a written test and interview.</p>

<p>National Institute of Technology was previously known as Regional Engineering College (REC). Establised in 1959, there are 17 NITs in India , one each in major states. The admissions for masters in engineering is through GATE. Some of these institutes also conduct an additional exam for candidates shortlisted based on the GATE score, which will be the final selection criteria. Apart from masters in engineering some of these institutes also offer MBA, MCA, MSc(Tech) for Sciences and MSc(IT).</p>

<p>IIIT (International School of Information Technology) are in Allahabad,Bangalore, Hyderabad, Gwalior, Pune, Calcutta. Some of these including, IIITH, IIITB, IIITA and IIITM (Gwalior) offer PG courses. The notifications for PG admissions for IIITB comes around January and last date is around the end of Jan. For IIITH the last dates are around the end of March. The selection process involves an entrance test and an interview. Data structures and algorithms, Theory of Computation are subjects that should be looked on as an important from the point of view of interviews. Though the main stress in any PG interview is on the subjects that you like the most. One should be very confident in one or two subjects, the choice of subjects is always offered in the interviews. This does not mean that you have to necessarily pursue these fields only. IIITH also offers GATE scholarships for those having a GATE score.</p>

<p>They require GRE and TOEFL examinations. These are conducted by ETS ( www.ets.org ). The score is valid for five years, in case of GRE, and for two years in case of TOEFL, and students typically take these exams during their third year in the college. Many sites help you to prepare for these exams <a href="http://www.testmagic.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.testmagic.com/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Many people maintain information about these exams <a href="http://members.rediff.com/arnabc/2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.rediff.com/arnabc/2.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>A good score in GRE is helpful, but there are other criteria that will be used in determining the admission<br />
<br />
1) score in B.E/ B.Tech and courses taken<br />
2) Letters of recommendation from professors<br />
3) Publications( not mandatory, but very useful)<br />
4) Your project<br />

<p>The United Kingdom is another favorite destination for Indian students. However the UK remains more popular for business education rather than technical education. The main advantage of UK when compared to other countries is the lack of a language barrier.</p>
<p>Germany is renowned for some of its technical schools like the (max planck institut informatik <a href="http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>). However the main barrier for Indian students here is that most of the instruction is in German.</p>
<p>France is also renowned for its many technical schools. The INRIA (research institute) admits a lot of foriegn students for PhD and Masters and the language spoken and work itself is carried out in English. However, the language itself needs to be learnt in order to survive outside of your institute. Other schools are Ecole polytechnique, Ecole superieure etc., which are good, but here again the language of instruction is French.</p>

<p>NIT( National Institute of Technology ) were known as REC(Regional Engineering Colleges). Until recently known as Regional Engineering Colleges (REC), one for every state, these colleges are arguably the second in line of well-known stream of engineering colleges after IITs.</p>
<p>In their earlier form as RECs, were funded by the respective state governments. 50% of the students were (and still are) from the respective state and remaining 50% are from other states (they are specific quotas for each state in each branch of engineering). Admissions for native students (from the state having the REC) were through respective state engineering entrance examinations (eg, TNPCEE for REC Trichy ). For admissions into other state RECs, admissions were through marks obtained in the public state/CBSE board examinations.</p>
<p>Now, in the present form as NITs, they are funded by the central government ( resulting in much higher grants being doled out to them than when they were RECs)<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/2006/03/10/stories/2006031016611100.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thehindu.com/2006/03/10/stories/2006031016611100.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. These were part of a grand plan by the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) to slowly transition NITs into the premier institutions of the caliber of IITs, and align IITs into having a completely research oriented goal to strengthen the country's post graduate system of engineering education. Admissions are through the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE) held annually along the lines of IIT-JEE. Students are given two ranks, one an all india rank for admission into NITs of other states and another rank ( amongst the students of the state ), for admission into the NIT of the state from where the student hails.</p>
