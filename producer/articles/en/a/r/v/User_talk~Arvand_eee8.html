<p>Hey thanks buddy. I'd thought you'd hate me by now. I'd just like to use this oppertunity to say that I am quite sorry if anything I said may have been insulting. I fully appologize, I've got nothing personal against you. Sometimes I just get a little too heated in some debates and I usually regret it later. Anyway thanks again and I have left the Thermopylae article to the admin there, I guess I was a little too rude and now I'm not wanted there. Anyway, when I saw Scotties page, I noticed he had a whole buch of these cool diagrams. Like the one that shows he is from Australia. Do you know how to get some of those pictures or are those only belong to the admins? Thanks in advanced buddy.<br />
PS: whatever happened to that beast you had on the page eating a little human. --<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 22:05, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't worry, no offence taken. Getting overheated over content-disputes can happen to anybody. In reality I'm a nice person, and apparently so are you. Anyway those diagrams are called <i>userboxes</i> and they can be used by anybody. After all admins are nothing but wikipedia editors as well (eventhough some tend to forget that). There are hundreds of pre-made userboxes ready for you to use, just scroll down to the bottom of the <a href="../../../b/o/x/WP%7EBOX_a489.html" title="WP:BOX">WP:BOX</a> page and choose from a category. Scottie's userboxes lie somewhere there. Next to each premade box there's a template code which you have to type into a page in order to make the userbox to appear. You can make various tweaks, such as placing it on the left or right side of your screen. You can also make your very own userbox, <a href="../../../b/o/x/WP%7EBOX_a489.html" title="WP:BOX">WP:BOX</a> describes all that in detail. PS: The picture of the beast is still there, explore my userpage by clicking on the links listed next to the old woman. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perfect! Thanks a lot for your help Miskin, my page is actually looking quite nice now. Thanks for teaching me the tricks, I now have a better understanding of how to use these newfangled things like userboxes. I appreciate the help. And yep I certainly found that beast we were talking about. By the way how long have you been on Wikipedia as a member? A couple of years, or more recent?--<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 16:38, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I created the articles in the warbox after seeing the (then) massively empty warbox at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Punic_War_97a8.html" title="Second Punic War">Second Punic War</a>. I do have every intention of creating articles where the red links are, but I am not capable of doing so right now because I have started studying in a foreign country, away from ny text resources, and am quite busy. I am not sure if Greco-Lydian conflicts are worth more than a passing in a article in the Greco-Persian Wars, hence I have not included them here. There are also other battles not included in the box like between Macedon and Artabazus in Hennea Odoi, and perhaps the sieges of Halikidi should be merged. I you wish to create the articles go ahead, my usual tactic is to expand existing articles with references etc and I intended to this first with articles like the battles of Alexander the Great or the Messenian Wars before creating new articles. Currently though I will be able to do few things. Our conflicting wievpoints on numbers help give the articles greater authority <a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkokki_ab19.html" title="User:Ikokki">Ikokki</a> 11:48, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm planning of taking this article to GA. Do you have any suggestions? <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 02:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like the plan, although how about we make it even more ambitious good friend. Let's take both Naxos' and the Eretria you have started all to that status. I will be back editing/revising and adding tomorrow morning local time (EST). I have a few suggestions at this point but I think more will certainly come as we slowly build the article and the others. Most of which have to do with article categorization. I'll certainly be more articulate tomorrow once I have more time Kyriakos. But we'll start with the 499 BC Naxos as you suggested because you have already done most of the work on it. Thanks for the message, by the way, if you ever want to leave message on my discussion board please regarding the Greco-Persian wars or other articles, please do not hesitate, it's probably the fastest way I will get them LOL. You are evidently a very pleasant person, I very much enjoy building these articles with you.--<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 03:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok. I'm going to try to go to the library the state library and find some books on the Persian Wars which had som einfomation particularly on the Ionian Revolt and Naxos. Herodotus is the only main source that I have at the moment but I'll check for some primary sources on the Perseus website. I'll also look at my home collection of books as I have so books on the Persian Wars particularlly Marathon which is good as it will have the lead up to the events which means the Ionian Revolt and the Siege of Naxos in 499 BC as well as 490 BC as it is part of the same campaign. OK, I'm looking forward to working on you in the future on making both the siege of Naxos GAs as well the Siege of Eretria which I am happy that you have started to copy-edit. Anyway, bye for now. And PS you said EST are you from Australia. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 04:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No I am not in Australia, infact I live quite far from there LOL. I am in the Eastern Standard Timezone -5 hours from GMT. Usually considered or referenced to as Eastern United States.

<p>Hey thanks for looking at the Siege of Eretria. I finished the article now and could you please go over it and copy edit it. I think that this article has the best chance of becomeing an GA. ALso I want to ask you if you could please have a look at the other major topic I'm working on, the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman-Spartan_War_ab66.html" title="Roman-Spartan War">Roman-Spartan War</a>. If you have time could you copy edit it. Thanks. And I also wanted to ask if we should add the Siege of Paros to the Persian Wars, campaign box as the Athenians besiege the island in revenge for the Parian supporting the Persians. PLease give me your opinion. Thanks. And one last thing, I'd like to invite you to join WiiProject Military history. If you would like to join please add your name to the member list. I hope you join your knowledge would be a great help <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 07:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No problem at all Kyriakos. I have looked at it a couple of times, but I will certainly attend to it a few more times soon. Sometimes one just misses things (I consistently do this) and I will be glad to look over it again. I must say though the article is really coming along quite nicely. I believe you are correct, Eretria 490 probably has the best chance of ever becoming GA status amidst the 3 Persian Wars articles we did. Unfortunately a good article needs thorough detail, which is okay but difficult to find with less known topics like the two Naxos sieges. Fortunately Eretria has enough info out there to exploit and write a strong Wiki article. Over the next few days and weeks I will look for some more relevant info in case we can further expand it. Hopefully some others may come by eventually and add their expertise too.<br />
Regarding the siege of Paros, and this is just my personal opinion, I think should be left out because it was more a domestic Greek conflict, it was just a Greek city-state attacking another, which was generally common throughout Greek antiquity. Though I do acknowledge the reason given was for supporting the Persians, I humbly believe that the Greco-Persian wars should probably be kept for the direct fighting between these two civilizations. But once again, this is just my opinion and it's really up to you. You have been on Wiki for longer than I have and definitely know the site's conventions more thoroughly than I do.<br />
And thank you for inviting me to that Wiki Military history group, I have joined with great enthusiasm. I look forward to working on the wars of civilizations like Persia, Greece and Rome, the ones I consider the big 3.<br />
Ah yes, and I forgot to say this earlier but I am more than happy to look over the Roman Spartan War for you, I will be looking over it on the upcoming days with and eagle eye LOL. You can be sure my friend that I will make any necessary edits I find.--<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 03:07, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oops no I didn't mean you Kyriakos, I meant I did not know the anonymous since he signed with his IP and not with his name. That's why I apologized to him and called him an "anon" LOL sorry for the mix up. I certainly know your name, my good friend. LOL. But boy did that guy have some of his sources wrong. Haha!--<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 22:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think thats why he stayed anon. Anyway what do you think about the Roman-SPartan War. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 22:21, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll be honest, in one word. I thought the Roman-Spartan was "brilliant". I took a good look at it today fixing any punctuation, grammar errors I found. I also strengthened the wording where I thought it need be. But I am going to continue with the second part in the days to come, now it's just a matter of making the article even more eloquent. It seems to have much detail and perfect amount of content. It definitely doesn't need much to be an FA from here, in my opinion. You have definitely and obviously worked very hard on it Kyriakos. By the way, who ended up giving the B status to the Siege of Eretria article? Did they mention at all which areas need improvement? I'd really like to know any way of improving that article, so it can soon be GA.--<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 23:30, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Arvand, I loved the updates you have made to the Revolutionary/Napoleonics pages, so I went in to do some minor followup text cleanups, and only after a while did I realize that some of the things I was 'cleaning up' we some of the revisions you had just added. Rather than writing over each other's revisions, I thought we might chat about which format we wanted to use.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of commas, and some readers claim I use too many, so I was surprised to find myself deleting lots of commas from your revisions. In particular, I think that lists in text need lots of commas, such as: <i>The axis of evil consists of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.</i> But I don't think commas are needed when converting text format to list format.</p>
<p>Axis of Evil:<br />
Iraq<br />
Iran<br />
North Korea<br /></p>
<p>I like how you turned text content into list content into many infoboxes, but I don't think the list items need the commas any more. Am I wrong? -Gomm 04:58, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It turns out you were right and there's a <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html#Infobox_templates" title="WP:MILHIST">guideline that commas should be added</a>. Now I'll have go go back and reverse my revisions. -Gomm 21:34, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for help on the commas. I am not good at finding those tutorial/guidance pages either, and only 'find' them by doing something wrong and having them pointed out to me by somebody else&#160;:) -Gomm 16:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>Hi, I noticed that you changed the Battle of Thermopylae from a Persian Pyrrhic victory simply to a Persian victory. Some sources I've read call the battle a Pyrrhic victory (while most historians agree that the losses the Persians suffered, let alone the morale problems associated with such, were devastating even if they don't specifically call it a Pyrrhic victory), it certainly fits the description in the Pyrrhic victory (and is linked from there as well). Since I'd rather discuss this than just constantly mull it back and forth, I'd like to hear your thoughts. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 00:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</s></p>
<p>Nevermind. Found the reply under the Talk page. I suppose that's fair, though I'll go ahead and edit the <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrrhic_victory.html" title="Pyrrhic victory">Pyrrhic victory</a> page to account for this. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 18:51, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
