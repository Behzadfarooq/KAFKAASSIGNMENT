<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arvanites are Albanians</span></h2>
<p>The Republic of Greece might not recognize ethnic minorities among its citizens, but it is a period-ending fact the presence of the Arvanites, Albanians who have lived in Greece for centuries. Please be honest and accept that Arvanties are part of the Albanian ethnic family by all the means.--<a href="../../../p/j/e/User%7EPjet%C3%ABr_Bogdani_c23e.html" title="User:Pjetër Bogdani">Pjetër Bogdani jr.</a> 19:09, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What kind of relation do you have with Arvanites? Have you ever met any? Have you ever seen any? If I were of Arvanite origin, how would I be able to prove it, since there is no distiction between Arvanites and Cretan Greeks? This fact automatically makes arvanites incapable of editing this article. Arvanites were probably Albanians in the 13th century, are you happier now? However, both modern Arvanites and modern Albanians have significantly changed since then in every single aspect. They have changed so much as to be considered a completely different ethnic group, with some distant common linguistic origin. Today Arvanites are Greek nationals, and as much ethically Greek as the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normans</a> are <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a>. The fact is that there's no ethnic distinction between Arvanites and Greeks today, deal with it and go on with your life. If you continue pushing Albanian POV in Greek articles, I'll ask for mediation. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 18:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You can't compare the Arvanites and Greeks with the Normans and French as the Normans settled in insignificant numbers and were easily assimilated in both a cultural and physical sense. I agree that the Arvanites can't be considered the same as Albanians but it also can't be said there is no ethnic distinction between them and Greehks. Culturally, the differences may be very subtle in some cases but ethnicity also involves other traits as well as common origins. The fact they can still be considered a distinct group within Greece clearly demonstrates they are separate from ethnic Greeks. 69.157.121.76 04:20, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do not use the word 'fact' for something that u are not aware of.Arvanites in no case are considered distinct from the rest greeks.the only way that someone could say that they are distinct,is in regional scale,as all the greeks are:epirots,peloponnesians,macedonians,arvanites,cretan,pontians and so on.u also have to keep in mind that language is not the only factor in ethnic-identification.nor the religion is.the arvanites are as much greeks as the cretans...and the catholics in Tinos are as much greeks as the orthodox of Paros.If they were not-greeks they would not have rebelled during the greek war of independance,nor would they had been and continue to been elected in the greek parliament,as high as prime ministers and presidents of greece.--<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 13:39, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

All they have done is note that there is a dispute going on, which had turned incivil. Your summary of the arbitration case is confused at best, and dishonest at worst. As I've said many times, the way forward is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> and represent all viewpoints fairly and neutrally. If some people have said that the Arvanites are Albanian, then find a source and cite it; if others have said they are not, find a source, cite it, and note that there is no agreement.

The viewpoing that Albanian nationalists consider Arvanites to be an Albanian minority is already mentioned. It's even mentioned that the Albanian prime minister once said it in public and enraged the entire greek community (Arvanites included) I don't see what else could be brought up as an alternative viewpoint apart from that. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:32, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just as predicted, Albanian editors don't cite sources nor instigate a conversation, thinking that the current locked version is actually supported by the admin who protected the page. Once the page is unlocked, it will be justifiably return to its normal version. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:33, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am afraid there <i>is</i> such a thing as a "wrong version", in cases where one version complies with WP standards and the other doesn't. The only way to settle this is to <i>say</i> there is this dispute and quote both sides. If one side is really accounted for by crackpot Albanian nationalists, I am afraid there will be nothing but to present it this way. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No dear Dab.

<p>well, it is undisputed that the Arvanitic language is Albanian. There is a difference between linguistic classification and ethnic self-identification, and the Arvanitic language appears to be dying out anyway; it makes still sense to state that speakers of Arvanitic would be classified as Albanians linguistically. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:39, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a problem here. The problem is that Greek nationlists won't allow what can be found in resources to be written on the page. According with UNESCO <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_report.html#Arvanitika" class="external free" title="http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_report.html#Arvanitika" rel="nofollow">http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_report.html#Arvanitika</a> Arvanitika is Albanian dialect. Why we not say that on the page? That is not said nowhere. They instead use wealsel word "shares a common origin". That is not found in no source. Show what source says that. They also don't allow the name used by the Arvanites of northwestern Greece, "Shqiptaret". This is found in human rights report <a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" class="external free" title="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html</a>. According with that report some arvanites use Arberoret and some shqiptaret. They only write the Arberoret name, they hide the shqiptaret name. Why? That is not npov. Matia also tries to scare people away by thranating that she will say to ArbCom that I am adding unsourced infomation to the page. That is not true. Why will they not write what the resources say. They try to hide the things that they don't like. Zogu</p>

<dd>Look, a language is not a nation. My language is a dialect of German, but I am not a member of the German nation. Similarly, according to your very link, most Arvanites object to being labeled as "Albanians". Linguistically, the facts are clear, nor is there a dispute on the classification at <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a>: It's an Albanian dialect. The article on the Arvanites themselves can certainly mention that classification, but only when put in a context making clear that most of them resent being classified as ethnic Albanians. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:59, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>As for the Arvanites of Epirus and Western Macedonia, they are considered to be part of the modern Albanian nation (Banfi, 1994:20), something which perhaps explains their self-identification as Shqiptars rather than Arberor.</p>

Dab you could verify via a library visit that Arvanitika is (partly) an ancient form of Albanian (not exactly un-evolved, but evolved seperately, hence the "common origin" wording).

<p>That is your pov. The resource say that arvanites in north greeks are considered part of the modern albanian nation. Why you don't want to put it in the page? The unesco report say that Arvanitika is albanian dialect. You don't want to use that either. why? Zogu</p>

All dialects have "common origin". dbachmanns example swiss German and standard German have common origin, but are dialects. Zogu</p>

<dd>Albanian editors are ignorant enough to imagine the an "Arvanite" person as a regular speaker of the Arvanite language.

<dd>I'm sorry, Matia, but "Albanian" is simply the conventional name of one of the 12 major branches of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_languages_7b20.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European languages</a>, as well as the name of a modern nation. This is unfortunate, but the problem is not unique, compare German (language vs. Germany), English (language vs. England), etc. etc.; It appears that the Arvanites are simply Greeks who traditionally were speaking an Albanian dialect (I did not check that linguistic classification in a library, but I understand it is undisputed). We might add that the Arvanites are unhappy to be classified as Albanians and leave it at that. Speakers of Swiss German can be classified as "German speakers" linguistically, but not as "Germans" ethnically. Similarly, the Arvanites should be classified as "Albanian speakers" linguistically, but not as "Albanians" ethinically. I think we have established that this dispute concerns <i>only</i> Arvanites of Northern Greece / Epirus. I suggest you do a section specifically about those, and add a section-npov template there. Can we take this back to the article talkpage, guys? The Irish Gaelic simile is inexact; the Irish may speak about as much Gaelic as the Arvanites speak Arvanitic, but the Irish certainly consider themselves Gaels, not English, while the Arvanites apparently are more assimilated and do consider themselves Greeks. It's a little bit like calling a Frenchman a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franks.html" title="Franks">Frank</a> (or Franconian). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:48, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are official documents in which Arvanites don't identify themselves as Albanians nor their language as Albanian. As I said before, if Arvanite is forcefully classified as Albanian, then Croatian should be forcefully classified as Serbian. In fact the only difference between the former is that is has a national status. Similarly Macedonian Slavic is Bulgarian. Arvanite is probably a dialect of Albanian, but then again so is Macedonian Slavic to Bulgarian.

What official documents? Arvanitika is not forsfully called Albanian. Unesco say that Arvanitika is Albanian dialect. When unesco say that those languages are dialects you too can write that they are. Zogu</p>
<p>What you're suggesting is correct dab. The detail here is that Arvanite-speakers practically do not exist anymore. I don't see why do we have to enrage Greeks (Arvanites included) by classifying Arvanite as Albanian, since it's explicitely mentioned that they're two closely related languages of a common origin. I don't understand why we're discussing the linguistic question anyway, the article is about <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> not the Arvanite language. Albanian editors are explicitely claiming that Arvanites are an <b>Albanian ethnic minority</b> in Greece, and the article is locked in that ridiculous version as we speak. This is why I'm here, not because I don't want Arvanite language to be classified under Albanian. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:00, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll give you those sources later and in a different discussion page. Now please answer the initial question.

<p>I want to write that Arvanitika is albanian dialect and that the arvanites in north Greece name themselves Albanians (Shqiptaret) and are considered part of the modern Albanian nation. Exactly what the resources say. You only have Arberor in the first paragraf, please put Shqiptare there too. It is true, it is in the resource. Zogu</p>

<p>The Arvanitic language is an Albanian dialect. Let's state that instead of the ethnic stuff. Linguistic classification does not prejudice ethnic classification, and in the present case, this is of historical interest at most, since the language is apparently dying; the "are considered part of the modern Albanian nation" is dodgy. "Are considered" by whom? If "by themselves", we may have a dispute to document. At least we seem to agree that "Arvanites are ethnic Albanians" is not an acceptable statement and should be changed on unprotection. What percentage of the 1.6 million is made up of Arvanites "of Epirus and Western Macedonia", and why is that distribution not detailed in the article? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:31, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with dab. We not obliged to say every thing. We say that Arvanitika is Albanian dialect and that the arvanites in north Greece call themselves shqiptaret and not arberoret (that is what the rest arvanites name themselves). also there is no census on arvanites in greece since 1951. Zogu</p>
<p>Whether Arvanitika is an Albanian dialect belongs to a different article. Honestly that's not what I care about at the moment. I care about Albanians refusing to accept that Arvanites are not ethnic Albanian today by any means. There are no Arvanites in Western Macedonia and Epirus. Those were Chams, meaning proper ethnic Albanians, it's wrong to refer to them as Arvanites. In any case, those were deported during and after WW2 so there's no point discussing it.

<p>It should be mentioned in this page as well, there where it says that Arvanitika is a language with a "common origin". It should also be mentioned on the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> page. According with the source, there are arvanites in north Greece. You have givven no resources, only your pov. What is wrong with my edits - we can remove that where it says "ethnic Albanians" and replase it with "people". Why are you not cooperate? The facts are that Arvanitika is albanian dialect and the arvanites in north Greece name themselves as shqiptaret and not arberoret. It is from resources. Why you not like these edits? Zogu</p>
<p>Where's the source that claims the existence of Arvanites with Albanian ethnic feelings in Northern Greece? Please quote the exact reference along with its sources. Secondly the Albanian/Arvanite debate has already been through <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediation.html" title="Mediation">mediation</a>, and it was decided to leave it as is is at the moment.

<p>Don't quote from the Helsinki report just quote its sources. The Albanians of Northern Greece were <b>not</b> Arvanites. The report doesn't really differentiate betweeen "Arvanitic" and "Albanian", this is why it abstractly refers to all Albanian-speaking peoples of Greece as "Arvanite", which is wrong.

<p>That also your pov. Arberor and Shqiptar both mean Albanian. Arberor is only a more old fashioned way. This is because epirus and western Macedonia were part of the Otoman empire for longer and were in the same country as the rest of Albanians for longer too. The obdjective here is what the resource say. The resource name them Arvanites of Epirus and western Macedonia who self identify as Shqiptar. So they should be in this article untill you can give a resource that say they are not arvanites. Dab agree too. Read above. If you want to say that they are not arvanites you have to give a resource like I did.

<p>No matia, they are not blind reverts. I know I removed greek propaganda that all arvanites name themselves as arberor and that arvanitika is not albanian dialect. You accuse me of not have resources. I do have resources as you can see above. So far I have not seen resource from you. Even Dab agree with what resources say. Do you agree? Zogu</p>
<p>After many library visits, I have written the bigger part of this article (especially since September) and I've listed my sources at the buttom (Biris, Moraitis, Kollias etc). You (and the rest editors who reverted to your version) removed the phrase "linguistic minority" and wrote instead "Albanian ethnic minority", changed the greek names of the Arvanites authors, "their <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian</a> language" instead of Arvanitic language, etc (see the red parts at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;diff=38166289&amp;oldid=38165461" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;diff=38166289&amp;oldid=38165461" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).

<dd>I not know for sure - it seem ok, but it is dubius to claim that all arvanites dismiss being called albanians. No resource can claim that. It is possible to say that most arvanites. Also, the Shqiptare name should go in the first paragraf with arberore. The arvanites of north Greece are not second class. Thank you for the time you spent&#160;:) Zogu</dd>

<dd>Okay. I personally have no problem with moving the "shqiptare" towards the top, perhaps qualified by "somtimes also" or something to that effect (since it seems to be a minority usage and probably controversial within the community itself.) - As for qualifiers to "all arvanites", my impression was that all the statements I put in the article were already hedged by words like "most", "many", "typically" etc. - Actually, we do have sources that describe the opposition against the "Albanian" attribute as a stance shared by the Arvanitic community at large (e.g. the Helsinki report in its first paragraph), and given what I've seen here, it seems very clear to me that this stance is at the very least <i>characteristic</i> of the large majority of Arvanites in Greece.<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 19:40, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zogu, before 100 years Albanian and Greek people were much closer. Let's say (thought that's not exactly the case) that what happened next - during the Balkan Wars, the two World Wars etc - was a mistake of the goverments. However this effected the people too. To give a more specific example the Arvanites of Epirus or Macedonia, along with the rest Greeks weren't exactly a welcoming party for the Italians and the Albanians during 1940. All the Balkanians are close and perhaps during the Byzantine or the Ottoman Empire many of them were like brothers, but today they have become distant cousins and you must try to think about it, instead of trying strawman arguments about northern Greece. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 15:14, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zogu, your input in this talk page previously didn't support the edit war you participated. Your "proposed" version, while a bit better than the one currently locked, isn't justified. My previous comment to you was an appeal to logic and an effort of mine to understand why you revert this article since December (or November).

<p>No Matia, you version is too pov. There is too much anti Albanian propaganda (also offensing), where it speaks of Albanian nationalists who try to "invant" Albanian minority in Greece and so on (where are the resources?

<dd>Folks, that's just the idea behind locking an article: forget about the wording of the disputed passages in the old article for a moment, don't start fighting over them again, and start working from something fresh! Of course the subpage wouldn't be permanent, it's just a testing ground for the compromise to be developed. As I see it, the present version can't stand because the unqualified characterisation as an "Albanian minority" is unacceptable; and Matia's version can't stand because sentences like "Albanian nationalists frequently try [...] in order to invent [...]" are unacceptable. (Even if in many other points I personally agree more with Matia's version, that sentence is pretty blatantly POV, as it implies the whole Albanian side is acting in bad faith.) <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 19:52, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UCK and (the imaginary or not) UCC maybe? Would it be more acceptable than the vague term "Albanian nationalists"? Ok, let's change it. But how on earth can we call the Arvanites an ethnic Albanian minority. Are the Pontioe (Πόντιοι) or the refugees from 1922, an ethnic Turkish minority in Greece? The Cretans? <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 19:56, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a lot of infomation that can be added like the fact that Arvanited harased in Greek Army and the Metaxa helenizations and discriminations (all in helsinki report) and how the all the arvanites were called Albanians before the greek revolution. Matias version is Greek (not Arvanitic) pov. The present version is I admit Albanian pov, but Wikipedia is suposed to be npov: all povs. I know that when article is unlocked, matia and miskin and theathenae will make edit war. theathenae make a lot of edit wars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ATheathenae" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ATheathenae" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ATheathenae</a> he will certainly make one here. Compromise must be made before unlocking. I not want to call Arvanites Albanian minority in final version. Only the fact that the resources say that Arvnitika is albanian dialect and to admit that the arvanites in north greece call themselves shqiptaret. Also to remuve unsourced information that all arvanites dismiss being called albanians. The human right report <a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" class="external free" title="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html</a> say</p>
<p><br />
As for the Arvanites of Epirus and Western Macedonia, they are considered to be part of the modern Albanian nation (Banfi, 1994:20), something which perhaps explains their self-identification as Shqiptars rather than Arberor.</p>
<p><br />
Moreover, and more important for the survival of their language, they have distanced themselves from the Albanians to the extent that <b>most</b> consider today offending to be called Albanians: they have preferred the term Arvanite (Arberor in their own language) for the people and Arvanitika (Arberichte) for the language, as opposed to Albanian (Shqiptar for the people and Shqip for the language) that Albanians use for themselves and their language - <b>with the exception</b> of the Arvanites of Northwestern Greece, as mentioned above.</p>
<p><br />
I want to write npov version but matia dismiss my edits. Zogu</p>
<p>Also matia UCK and UCC (new name) have nothing to do with arvanites. If you want to say they do they to "make Arvanites albanian minority" you have to give resource. Zogu</p>
<hr />
<p>Please, both of you, don't return to polemics, and keep it short. Matia, if you read the two proposal versions carefully, you will notice they both refrain from calling Arvanites an "Albanian minority". <b>We have a consensus on that</b>. The new version is going to say "linguistic minority". As for the sentence about Albanian nationalists, the crux is the phrase "are trying to", in my view. - Zogu, may I point out that the Banfi quote says, somewhat ambiguously, that the northern Arvanites "are considered" part of the Albanian nation - he doesn't say <b>who</b> considers them as such. They themselves? So, that source doesn't actually help us much. (But of course we can mention it as one opinion among others.) <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 20:18, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Matia have to give resource to make any changes, I insist on them when she is going to say negative things about albanians. She too can insist on sources from me when we make compromise version. I try to cooperate, why not she? I go to trouble to make proposal even though I would be happy to leave it locked in present version (it is albanian pov, my pov), but that would be wrong. Wikipedia is supposed to be npov and Im tryin to make compromise and use resources. Zogu</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of sources: Does anybody have an exact reference for that Banfi (1994) thing? I can see it only quoted second-hand through the Helsinki report, and that one is missing its bibliography section. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 20:27, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I dont know. The report not give exact referense for any of its blibliografy, only a name and date. Zogu</p>
<p>To clear my position, regardles of my revert, what I want in the compromise version is:</p>
<p>1) Arvanitika is albanian dialect (from unesco resource. Even dab agree) (matia can say that this is disputed though) 2) Arvanites in north Greece call themselves Shqiptaret (this name to be in first paragraf next to Arbeoret) (this from helsinki resource) 3) Remove unsourced calumnis against Albanians and albanian nationalism 4) Remove unsourced information that "all" Arvanites are offended when called albanians (helsinki report say only <b>most</b>) and remove unsourced information that arvanites do not want to be given ethnic minority status</p>
<p>All that is sourced (or is supported by absence of resource) so it is allowed according with policy. If matia can make compromise version that includes all that I probably agree. Zogu</p>
<p><a name="Points_towards_consensus" id="Points_towards_consensus"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Points towards consensus</span></h2>
<p>Okay. Let me take up Zogu's and Matia's main desiderata, with a few comments of my own:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't label Arvanites as ethnic Albanian minority. (<b>Consensus</b>)</li>
<li>Don't label Albanian view (which sees Arvanites as Albanian) as inherently and necessarily bad-faith. (Reasonable according to WP NPOV policy.)</li>
<li>Mention self-designation of northern Arvanites as "Shqiptar" (Seems okay, with the proviso that we should clearly mark it as a minority usage, and provided we get a reliable source for it. Unfortunately the Helsinki report is poorly sourced.)</li>
<li>Describe Arvanitica language as a form of Albanian. (Seems majority position among international linguists, including world-wide sociolingistics authority Trudgill and prominent Modern-Greek linguist B. Joseph. Proviso: We can also mention the incertainty and lack of absolute criteria in all language-vs.-dialect judgments in linguistics; and we can describe the fact that many Arvanites do not like that classification.)</li>
<li>Avoid absolute statements about orientation of <b>all</b> Arvanites. (Seems okay, doesn't prevent us from stating the fact that certain sentiments are shared by a vast majority.)</li>
<li>Avoid the statement that "Arvanites do not want to be given ethnic minority status": I'd tend to disagree with Zogu here, for two reasons: (a) The truth of this statement seems logically entailed by the (undisputed) statement that (most) Arvanites feel ethnically Greek - if you're happy with belonging to the majority, it automatically means you don't want to form a minority; (b) We actually do have documentation that (many) Arvanites reacted negatively against such suggestions. - On the other hand, I don't really see the necessity to keep that sentence in that exact form.</li>
</ol>
<p>Matia, would you like to add some more points here that would be a "red line" for you?</p>
<p><br />
3) Very hard but there was a compromise in the past about it (Kollias or Moraitis mentions something relevant). The rest seem more or less ok (and were "used" in those articles in previous versions). <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 21:53, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I not say that we cannot say that Arvanites not want to be given ethnic minority status. I say not to say that if there is no resource that say that they do. And what you mean helsinki report is poorly sourced? That is the resource and it does mention an author and it would be critisised. Banfi source is Banfi, Emanuele (1994).

<i>Mention self-designation of northern Arvanites as "Shqiptar" (Seems okay, with the proviso that we should clearly mark it as a minority usage, and provided we get a reliable source for it. Unfortunately the Helsinki report is poorly sourced.)</i></p>
<p>No that's not okay. The Helsinki paper erroneously categorises the Albanian Chams under Arvanites, which is what has confused some Albanian editors. Chams were in fact ethnic Albanian, but they were not Arvanites. Chams never identify themselves as Arvanites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://salam.muslimsonline.com/~albanian/cham3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://salam.muslimsonline.com/~albanian/cham3.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Hence they belong to a separate article, and any references of Arvanites being ethnic Albanian should be removed. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 06:19, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I had wondered myself about the relation between those "northern Arvanites" and "Chams". If the alleged "northern Arvanites" are in fact identical with the "Chams", I think we are still left with the fact that <i>several</i> sources (including Helsinki and Banfi, who is apparently a reputable scholar) subsume them under "Arvanites". So, we should mention that, although we should also mention that it doesn't match the self-identification of both sides. Are we sure that the self-identification is mutual? (i.e. no Greek Arvanites would regard those Chams as Arvanites, and no Chams would regard themselves as Arvanites?)</dd>
<dd>By the way, what about present-day existence of that group, whatever it may be called - The Helsinki report states that "an important part of these Albanians, the Muslim Chams" were expelled - implying that a rest remained. It in fact mentions a study that puts their number at 30,000. 30,000 self-identifying ethnic Albanians in northwestern Greece? <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 07:03, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The self-identification is mutual since Arvanites don't link themselves with no non-Greek group whatsoever. This can also derive by definition from the fact that the Arvanites' most important cultural characteristic, the Orthodox faith, is missing from the Chams. Chams would never identify themselves as Arvanites because they're Muslim, hence they ethnically viewed themselves as part of the Albanian nation. Similarly the Arvanites viewed themselves as part of the Greek. I'm not sure about the numbers, but the vast majority of Chams were exchanged with Greeks from Turkey in 1922 or deported to Albania shortly after WW2. Their current numbers are probably included in the 2% muslim minority of Greece. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 07:17, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Northwestern "Arvanites"/"Chams"?</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be some serious factual confusion here, regarding those elusive northwestern "Arvanites"/"Chams". Suggestion: For the moment, let's just call them neutrally "Northwestern Albanophones" (NWA's). Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are they still there? i.e. when the Muslim "Chams" were expelled, were any significant numbers of other (presumably Christian) NWA's left behind in the same areas?</li>
<li>Do the present NWA's (if they exist) identify <i>ethnically</i> as Albanians?</li>
<li>Do the NWA's consider themselves as forming a single group with the southern Arvanites?</li>
<li>Do the NWA's consider themselves as forming a single group with the former "Chams"?</li>
<li>Do southern Arvanites and other Greeks regard the NWA's as "Arvanites"?</li>
<li>Do the NWA's call their own language, <i>in their own language</i>, "Shqip"?</li>
<li>Do the NWA's call themselves, <i>in their own language</i>, "Shqiptarë"?</li>
</ol>
<p>Please let's all be aware that questions (2)-(7) are mutually independent. Conceivably, the answer could be any of the 64 logically possible combinations, paradoxical as some combinations might sound to the outsider. Helsinki Report says "yes" to (1), (6), (7), which seems fairly well sourced. It also seems to imply (2), although that's far vaguer. Does anybody have access to the sources by Ciampi and Banfi? <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 09:18, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We are complicating the things too much with the unrelated Chams. Are the Albanians of Kossovo Arvanites? There's a traditional Arvanitic song about a muslim Albanian or a Cham (not sure if it's the one or the other) who betrayed the Arvanites of a village to the Ottomans. I have avoided bringing up such stuff in the past, but if the thing continues I will (at least this song is related directly to the Arvanites). <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 09:39, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Arvanites of Epirus, the Chams, the Albanians, the Greek-Albanians and the (non Arvanites) Greeks of the wider Epirus region are 5 (<b>five</b>) different groups of people.

<dd>Fine. So you are negating (4) and asserting (1) and (5), right? No problem, sounds plausible to me. In that case, we still have the fact that the Helsinki report claims the Arvanites of Epirus (and not the Chams, as I now understand) have (6) and (7) above. Can you point me to statements in the literature elsewhere that <i>specifically</i> contradict this? ("specifically" means: with a clear reference to language designation as opposed to ethnic designation, and with a clear reference to the Epirus Arvanites as opposed to the southern ones?) <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 10:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I (and another one editor at the archive 1) have pointed out that the Arvanites of Epirus call traditionaly their language Shqip (see Moraitis). <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 10:23, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good. So we have both Helsinki and Moraitis confirming (6). Also (7)? Question is whether this evidence is solid enough to promote "Shqip(tarë)" into the first sentence. If this evidence is solid, then I'd say Miskin's opposition to the "Shqip" is groundless. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 10:46, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first sentence should read Arvanites (Αρβανίτες). Not Arber*, Shqip*, or whatever else. And I'm really considered about the "is a language minority". The language is practicaly dead, and the few speakers are bilingual. There are also historical records that the majority of Arvanites were always bilingual (Biris, Kollias etc cites them) and most of the time they used Greek in written and Arvanitika in oral. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 11:32, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for the first sentence, I think it is pretty sensible to have the name <i>in Arvanitic</i> too. Having it <i>in Albanian</i> too might, strictly speaking, be unnecessary, but does it hurt?</dd>
<dd>As for the identification as a "linguistic minority" - if it's not a linguistic one, then what is it? The language <i>is</i> the primary defining criterion of this group, even if it's only the "language of the older generations" and not necessarily the "language of every member of the group now alive". I mean, people do not continue to consider themselves Arvanites more than maximally one or two generations after the language gets lost in a family, do they? <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 11:43, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The parents didn't speak Arvanitic in front of the children and taught them Greek language. Most Arvanites know few words in Arvanitic, but their grandparents (might) know to speak the language.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consensus draft?</span></h2>
<p>Based on the previous discussion, I've drafted the following to document what I think <i>might</i> become a consensus, with a few open questions at the end:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article should clearly reflect the self-identification of Arvanites as ethnically Greek.
<ol>
<li>It should not label Arvanites as an "ethnic minority" or an "Albanian minority".</li>
<li>It may describe other views, including that of some Albanians who regard Arvanites as ethnic Albanians, and it shouldn't label such a view as inherently wrong or bad-faithed (though in conflict with the group's self-identification).</li>
<li>It should not take over the claim that Epirus Arvanites (as opposed to the southern ones) "are regarded" as nationally Albanians, because that claim is poorly sourced and we don't have evidence that it is shared by the group in question.</li>
<li>It should generally refrain from making absolute statements about people's stances, hedging statements where appropriate ("most Arvanites" etc.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The article should clearly reflect the scholarly consensus that linguistic affiliation and ethnic affiliation are different things.
<ol>
<li>It should reflect the scholarly consensus that Arvanitic is a "form of Albanian". The formulation may leave open whether that means:
<ol>
<li>"a separate Arvanitic language, side by side with Standard Albanian, within an "Albanian" language family",</li>
<li>"a separate Arvanitic language, as an emergent <a href="../../../a/u/s/Ausbausprache.html" title="Ausbausprache">Ausbausprache</a>".</li>
<li>"an Arvanitic dialect group within a single Albanian language".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It should mention that many Arvanites object to seeing their language linked to Albanian, and it should mention that Arvanites do not regard Standard Albanian as their <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dachsprache.html" title="Dachsprache">Dachsprache</a>.</li>
<li>In the absence of sources to the contrary, the article should mention the self-designation of Epirus Arvanites as "Shqip(-tarë)", but it should not be worded so as to imply the claim that this means <i>national</i> identification with Albania.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The article should reflect the scholarly consensus about the historical/geographical origins of the Arvanites from territories of Epirus and modern Albania.
<ol>
<li>In the absence of reliable sources to the contrary, the only serious theory we can report on is that the ancestors of the Arvanites came out of the same medieval population groups that are also the ancestors of modern Albanians.</li>
<li>Other hypotheses (Non-Albanian Epirotic origins; separate Thraco-Illyrian origin; autochthonous "Pelasgian" southern Greek origin etc.) may be mentioned, but must be evaluated strictly in light of the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Reliable Sources</a> policy; if necessary treating them according to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Giving_.22equal_validity.22" title="WP:NPOV">policies on non-scientific fringe theories</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The article should reflect the scholarly debate about the etymological origin of the name "Arvanites".
<ol>
<li>It should mention that both name stems "Αρβα-(νίτης)" and "Αλβα-(νός)" have been attested since antiquity, and have been used more or less indistinguishably over a long time, with reflexes of "Αρβα-" also being used as an <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endonym.html" title="Endonym">endonym</a> of Albanians.</li>
<li>In the absence of reliable sources to the contrary, the article should present as a strong majority position in international scholarship that both name forms are cognate.</li>
<li>Other hypotheses, about "Arvan-" etymologies independent of "Alban-", can be mentioned as a serious minority position insofar as they have been proposed by prominent linguists (Babiniotis, apparently?)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Not yet determined</b>: Should the group be characterized as a "linguistic minority" in the first sentence? (If not, what else?)</li>
<li><b>Not yet determined</b>: Should the first sentence enumerate all the names (including "Shqip" and the Albanian names?) Alternative: Only use "Arvanites (Greek: Αρβανίτες)", and leave the discussion of all the different <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exonym_and_endonym.html" title="Exonym and endonym">exonyms and endonyms</a> to a separate paragraph.</li>
<li><b>Not yet determined</b>: Should further editing, based on these guidelines, proceed from Zogu's version (closer to the previous versions), or from Lukas' version (rewritten parts), or from <a href="http://www.answers.com/Arvanites" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/Arvanites" rel="nofollow">Matia's preferred older version from December</a>?</li>
</ol>
<p>If we can agree on something along these lines, I suggest we archive this talk page, put a version of these guidelines (updated where necessary) in a prominent, permanent place on the new talk page as a document for later editors, and request unprotecting. We should also put a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EControversial_f891.html" title="Template:Controversial">Template:Controversial</a> sign up in the article to point to this discussion. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 10:20, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I'd now say we can safely request unprotecting, then as a first thing (for practical reasons) make it provisionally identical to Zogu's temporal page (which lacks most of the really contentious bits), and then gradually start working in whatever bits are needed from my draft and from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;oldid=31359403" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;oldid=31359403" rel="nofollow">the pre-edit-war version</a>, or new material, in the light of the principles above. The remaining editorial issues can be worked out in the process, that's just a question of how to arrange stuff within the article structure. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 14:35, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are paragraphs missing from Zogu's version, and he haven't provided reasoning for that (as he didn't provide reasons for the revert-war he participated). I understand that these (long ago before edit war material) won't be cut. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 14:42, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand why is the Helsinki report trusted over other sources such as the CIA factbook for instance (which doesn't list Arvanites as an ethnic minority). It's fairly blatant that the Arvanites of the North who recognized themselves as Albanian were the Chams. I hope REX could translate this <a href="http://www.ilmb.gr/ekdoseis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ilmb.gr/ekdoseis.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> to his Albanian compatriots. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 05:20, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
