<dd>Yes, good work indeed - <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_game.html" title="End game">end game</a> is a really nice article (I've moved it to <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame.html" title="Endgame">endgame</a> by the way, which I think is the more common usage). I've answered you queries on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7EChess_d2d9.html" title="Talk:Chess">Talk:Chess</a> - I think a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_terminology.html" title="Chess terminology">chess terminology</a> page is a great idea. Just one thing - there's a convention to put comments on talk pages at the bottom of the page rather than the top.

<p>Hi, you cast a vote in the TEMP5 debate. The Temp5 proposal was voted down by 61.3% to 38.6%. We seem to be going around in circlces on the whole issue of the main page. A new vote is now taking place to clarify what <i>exactly</i> we want, namely</p>
<ol>
<li>Do we actually <i>want</i> to have a new page?</li>
<li>If so <i>when</i> (immediately, after a pause, timed to the press release, etc)?</li>
<li>What do people want on the front page and what do they want excluded?</li>
</ol>
<p>As of now, the whole issue seems surrounded by complete confusion. This way, <i>finally</i> and <i>definitively</i>, we will know <i>what</i> we want and <i>when</i> we want it. So do please express your opinions. The vote is on the same page as the previous votes. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÃ‰IREANN</a> 20:29, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey.... You're probably right re <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_violence_54bb.html" title="2002 Gujarat violence">2002 Gujarat violence</a> that we can rely on exhaustion. It has been weeks, however, and it seems that page protection is largely for this sort of case. I also don't know how it would cause attention to be drawn to it, and I think the user wants a different view presented, not attention to the page as stands. It is only one person, of course, so presumably it will settle down soon enough either way. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> 09:43, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>hey arvind, if you're interested in how the primary source data collection equivalent of Wikipedia - <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indymedia.html" title="Indymedia">Indymedia</a> - has (so far) developed in India, you can have a look at <a href="http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Local/ImcIndia" class="external free" title="http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Local/ImcIndia" rel="nofollow">http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Local/ImcIndia</a> and of course at the websites <a href="http://india.indymedia.org" class="external free" title="http://india.indymedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://india.indymedia.org</a> and <a href="http://mumbai.indymedia.org" class="external free" title="http://mumbai.indymedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://mumbai.indymedia.org</a> .

<p>Many characterizations of Ï€ do not mention integration. Which among them should be considered <i>definitions</i> is perhaps a subtler question.

<p>Hi Arvindn,</p>
<p>I am sure that would be good, however I am not too familiar with the details of Hindu mythology (being for all practical purposes an atheist or agnostic or whatever:-))! <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChancemill_4449.html" title="User:Chancemill">User:Chancemill</a> seems to be very knowledgeable in this area and even started a mythology series (check out his user page). However, he suddenly seems to have disappeared after nominating me for adminship (which I felt uncomfortable to refuse)!! I had wanted to nominate him for adminship shortly because of his friendly nature and enthusiasm. BTW, you have been consistently doing good work. Are you interested in adminship, I have been thinking about nominating you.

<p>Re: game theory in biology. Basically, yes. The synthesis of game theory into biology in the late 20th century particularly by <a href="../../../w/2E/d/W.D._Hamilton_f8af.html" title="W.D.

Hamilton</a> was very important (I'd rate Hamilton as the third most important biologist ever, after <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Fisher_1080.html" title="Ronald Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>.</p>
<p>It can be used in foraging theory, reproductive theory (particularly Hamilton's rule), prisoner's dilemmas (iterated or otherwise - q.v. Axelrod and Hamilton 1981 in science).</p>

<p>If/ when you have the time and the inclination, could you please look into <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>? User Sam Spade seems to consider it right to refer to Hinduism as an ethnicity and does not seem to see reason.

<dd>Hi, Unfortunately, the talk page for the article has become a graffiti wall, with people having a free-for-all throwing conspiracy theories and little-known assertions. Is there a limit to what can be discussed on the Talk Page? I am sorry to see an article that was shaping up so well, become a party to a dispute, so disassociated with the topic. I am particularly peeved at the assertion that there is a class of <i>native</i> Indian Hindus who are more flexible to the other religions, and that the so-called 'real' Hindus (who are supposedly foreign) are not. Isnt this suggestion racist to say the least? I would like to know your opinion on this issue. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChancemill_4449.html" title="User:Chancemill">Chancemill</a> 05:58, Mar 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>First, there's no big deal about stupid arguments on talk pages; as long as it doesn't affect the article I don't see the problem. Anyway this is quite minor, as arguments on wikipedia go: I don't know if you were around last year when we had a problem user on the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_violence_54bb.html" title="2002 Gujarat violence">2002 Gujarat violence</a> and related pages.</dd>

<dd>Getting to the issue, a good percentage of Tamils live in the kind of reality distortion field you encountered. One aspect is the supposed oldness of Tamil: my father, for example, believes it is "billions" of years old, although I doubt he has the faintest idea how many digits there are in a billion. Another is the "anti-Hindutva" philosophy of the <a href="../../../d/m/k/DMK_021c.html" title="DMK">DMK</a> etc; in its extreme form the ultimate goal is ethnic cleansing of the "Aryan" settlers and regaining the Tamil country for its rightful "Dravidian" inhabitants. Of course the theory is highly dubious (and obviously racist, that's the whole point). As for the specific point about Kali, my family are Brahmins, but they worship a mother goddess. Keep in mind, however, that when dealing with people who don't let facts get in the way of their silly casteist notions, it might not be fruitful to pursue the point further.</dd>

<p>Hello Arvindn! Neat chess board! I just want to you look at <a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwischenzug.html" title="Zwischenzug">Zwischenzug</a>:</p>
<p>You see I converted the table syntax. What do you like it? The only current problem with putting together chess position from your pieces is that it clutters the wikitext. Do you think it's better with the new syntax? I think we should make all chess positions in this new syntax..</p>

<li>Presumably, this is because its creation (Feb 13, 2003; I checked) predated the concept of MediaWiki pages. Given that we <i>do</i> have them now, however, perhaps the code should be changed so that this is one, for consistency's sake (and not, as such, a custom one - presumably its appearance is hard-coded somewhere). - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 02:42, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for the congrats on the voting. Not sure what'll do now with stupendous power, but... Looks like no one has been sufficiently irritated to squawk, but maybe there's a movement of which I'm unaware to suppress the multitudinous dissent.

<p>Arvindn, do you think we would benefit from a Wikiproject Cryptography? I have hacked together a <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_prop_ea36.html" title="User:Matt Crypto/prop">proposal for Wikiproject Cryptography</a>. It might be a reasonable place for collecting together useful information, identifying needs, and hosting more general discussions. I guess that even though we don't (at the moment) have a huge number of editors working on this, it still might prove useful. What do you think? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">â€” Matt</a> 17:45, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

Wow Arvindn that was fast. Ok I will check back tommorrow and see what it looks like. murph 09:24, April 23, 2004 p.s. I guess I need to go play in the sandbox some more</p>

<p>Well, I had a look, but I couldn't find anything definitive on the Hastings 1895 thing (I thought there was something in one of Edward Winter's <i>Chess Notes</i>, but I couldn't find anything). It seems plausable, as Chigorin didn't look like winning until quite late in his game, so if that's your memory of what Chernev said, it's probably right. I'm sure there's something definitive in some really obvious book, I've just not found it. Nice article on the tournament, by the way. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<p>Hey, Arvindn, if you are still active on Wikipedia, you might want to take a look at <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_violence_54bb.html" title="2002 Gujarat violence">2002 Gujarat violence</a> and some new material being added about recent terrorist attacks on other pages by User:Fatalvenom/User:Romanwarrior, some moved to <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2002_Gujarat_violence_5156.html" title="Talk:2002 Gujarat violence">Talk:2002 Gujarat violence</a>.

Anyway, most of his work (short of some deletions) does not seem obviously wrong, so I've of late only been touching up.

<dd>Hi, about the Ramakrishna page, its weird because AFAIK if A redirects to B then you can move B to A without bothering to delete it. Otherwise you wouldn't have "move wars" between two people disagreeing about what to call an article. But I tried it and it didn't work. Slightly alarmed that I've been away from wikipedia for so long that I don't even remember basic stuff, I didn't want to go deleting anything, so I just cut-n-pasted from one article into the other. Not sure if its OK with you though, because if it was you wouldn't have asked me in the first place. <a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvindn_6a6a.html" title="User:Arvindn">Arvindn</a> 02:55, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC) (moved from <a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbarish_db36.html" title="User talk:Ambarish">User_talk:Ambarish</a>)</dd>

<p>Arvindn, We cryptiacs now have an actual page for discussing cy v ci. You might want to look at it for amusement, or if you feel strongly one way or another, ... I have summarized some folks' positions insofar as I know them at <i>current standings</i>. You might want to chyme (or chime) in there, or not of course.</p>

<dd>Hi Arvindn, I saw your vote on wikipedia On Kolkata rename and your opinion that we are changing names on the whims of politicians. Do you really think so? For example what do you make of Chennai and Madras. I think Chennai is more apt and appropriate. After all why carry a name that came in because a few folks who came over to India thought it best to call it while the other names existed for years and have been in active use by the local folks. Think about it. It is not purely political. Cheers <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArunram_62b8.html" title="User:Arunram">Arunram</a> 04:18, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>P.S I've lived most of my life in Madras and I call it and have always called it Madras. So have all of my family and most of my friends. I'd seriously find it laughable if anyone called Calcutta Kolkata outside of a context that required political correctness.

<dd>That was my whole point - the Puranas are not "Vedic texts". I'm not even sure what is a "Vedic text" and what is not has a proper definition, but the Puranas were written 1500-2500 years after the Vedas, so there's no way they qualify. If you want to say there are references to palanquins in the Puranas, sure go ahead. <a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvindn_6a6a.html" title="User:Arvindn">Arvindn</a> 16:40, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for clarification... I thought that the purans and the vedas had their origin during the same period of time.

<p>I am seeking your guidance and advice on a particular issue. <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahuri.html" title="Mahuri">Mahuri</a> page on wikipedia was initiated by me, and I have contributed to the page from time to time. As per policy of the wikipedia anyone can use the contents of wikipedia, but I understand that use of such contents should indicate the source, that is, the wikipedia. The contents of the page Mahuri have been used in the site <a href="http://www.mahurivaisya.com/#" class="external text" title="http://www.mahurivaisya.com/#" rel="nofollow">mahurivaisya</a> without giving any reference to wikipedia - though I am glad that they have used our contents. In this case, a problem may arise at a future date if that website takes a stand that the contents of page <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahuri.html" title="Mahuri">Mahuri</a> on wikipedia have been copied from that site and thus violates copyrights. In an alternative scenario, a user here may tag our Mahuri page with copyright violation under the impression that our contents have been copied from that site, reference to which was given by me long back as an external link when that site was not active and having only a welcome page. Although I am not aware of any such issue, which wikipedians may have encountered in the past, I believe that such a situation may have arisen earlier too. I seek your advice and guidance to deal with this issue, which you are requested to kindly post on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bhadani" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bhadani" rel="nofollow">my talk page please</a>.

<p>Hello Sir I'm nominating this page for deletion because it is written with a point of view , excessive use of unreliable sources.and the title "Khalistan" is wrong for the topic because "Khalistan" does not exist,lack of support from resident Punjabi's and Sikhs in India, but there was a "Movement for Khalistan" and that is the right title for the topic, and i think this whole article "a new name" should be rewritten with the help of people from sikh community "in" India and other Indians, because this topic is related to politics/people of India.We all should understand Khalistan is not a political entity and having a article is not justified, Microsoft Encarta and Britannic encyclopedia don't have an article known as "Khalistan" but they do have articles on the movement that took place decades back, and i think there are also copyright issues involved with this article because big parts of this article are written on other peoples research. Many reliable sources are used to show "one side" of their view on the topic, there are also indications that organisations banned by US and EU are involved in providing their research on the movement.I am a strong supporter to have a stub on this topic , but im afraid that such articles on wikipedia have become mouthpieces for organisation which are known for disrupting peace (assassination of one of india's prime minister, twin bomb blast in New Delhi on the eve of Diwali) in Indian sub continent. This article requires your attention , please help. <a href="../../../a/n/m/User%7EAnmol.2k4_bafe.html" title="User:Anmol.2k4">Anmol.2k4</a> 18:31, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>sir im sorry about spamming,it wont happen again(i did that because i had no idea that so many people can be active at a time in wikipedia), as far as afd is concerned i am new to wikipedia and its rules so it was also a mistake. all i was trying to do was to get people's attention to this article especially Indians$admins and as many as possible. but sir don't you think this article has got POV problem and requires clean up. I hope you are going to take interest in this article because it is related to Indian people and Indian people have got proper knowledge on the subject. regards <a href="../../../a/n/m/User%7EAnmol.2k4_bafe.html" title="User:Anmol.2k4">Anmol.2k4</a> 11:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Arvind,</p>
<p>We are producing a code-breaking series for British TV called The Search. It's a little like Treasure Hunters on NBC in the USA but with more history and cryptography and fewer corporate sponsors!</p>
<p>In episode 2 we shall be filming in India, most likely Rajasthan. I'm currently trying to research as many examples of Indian cryptography as possible. Since it's primarily a history show, pre-war methods are more useful than modern ones. Can you suggest any good ones, or relevant works that i should read?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>Hello Arvind,</p>
<p>I need help regarding the pages I created. I'm a follower of two spiritual organizations and was trying to create information about them. One is Dattapeetham, headed by Sri Ganapathi Sachchidananda Swamiji of Mysore and the other , World Teacher Trust, a newage philosphical and spirtual organization founded by Late Ekkirala Krishnamacharya. Both have world wide centers and lakhs of devotees. 1) I created an article on Ganapathi Sachchidananda , a spiritual leader and guru from Mysore. The article was later modified by someone who included copyright material. Admin Zoe deleted the article citing copyvio,which is understandable but he also said that Sri Swami was a non-notable person. When I created the article, Admin Deville agreed it was genuine. Please help me ....How can a swamiji who has Lakhs of followers and tours around the world every year be non-notable? I was wondering if you can undelete the article and revert it to the old version where it doesnt violate any copyrights. I couldnt ask admin Zoe because he seems not to agree about the notability. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapathi_Sachchidananda" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapathi_Sachchidananda" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapathi_Sachchidananda</a></p>
<p>2) Same issue with article on Master E.K.</p>
<pre>
  Though I initially used copyrighted material and was trying to rewrite in my own words, Admin Zoe 
  deleted it every time. I can understand that. May be I have to use Ekkirala Krishnamcharya instead of Master E.K. But again I failed to convince Admin Zoe that he is a notable person. He protected the page Master E.K. Please help me on this..
</pre>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_E.K" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_E.K" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_E.K</a>. I might have crossed the civility code by being a little bit rude to Admin Zoe because of the short time he gave to establish reasons for notability. But I believe these two spiritual gurus can fittingly have a bio on wikipedia, becuase they fit the "cult following" condition from wiki:bio code. Kindly help me on this and let me know if I'm missing something.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you, Ramki</p>
