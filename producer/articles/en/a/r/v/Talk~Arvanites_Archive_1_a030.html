The life of Basil Sakelaris, the Troesenian priest. (Freely adapted from the arvanitic.) I was born in nineteen ninety-seven, 1797, after the birth of Christ. And when I reached the age of seven, I learned to write in modern? Greek in Piyada (Nea Epidaurus?). Then I returned in my native country, and in 1808 I went to Poros, to study Greek under N. Bambakis. Then, after one year I got on a ship and we set sail to Constantinople, and then came we to Smyrna and we loaded raisins destined for Amsterdam. We set sail for Malta, from there we went to Mahon, and then to Mallorca, and we anchored in Argazilia (?). The sailors warned us not to go on sea, because the Algerians were offshore, and they would kidnap us. We went to sea anyway, they caught us and put our whole crew in their ship. In our ship the Algerians put some of their men and took us to Algiers. We remained there for four days, and then they released us, together with some other slaves. After being released we arrived in Calais, but we were sent off. Then we went to Lisbon, from there we went to London. We went to Helder by ferryboat (?) and unloaded. We entered Amsterdam six months after we set sail for the first time. Then we came back to Poros. Then I got married there, in 1818, and in 1820 I became a priest.</p>
<p>In 1821 the war with Turkey broke out. In 1828 I learned the allilodidaktike method? and became a teacher in Poros, remaining there until 1842. Then I left the island and in 1852 I was anointed priest for the king Ludwig. We went also in Toulon, France. In 1855 Ludwig released me from my duties and since then I have been employed in my church, with no other occupation.</p>

<p>Theathenae simply said Arvanites are 'a people' originating in central Albania rather than specifying 'a people of Albanian origin', <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;diff=15420320&amp;oldid=15406259" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;diff=15420320&amp;oldid=15406259" rel="nofollow">look</a>. Take a good look on the article <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic</a> as well, he begines with 'Arvanitic is an Indo-European language originating in the Balkan peninsula', he does not either specify here that 'Arvanítika is a variety of Tosk Albanian originating in the central Albania', and he continues 'spoken by about 150,000 Arvanites, a people of south-central Greece', also here he mention 'a people' which for me is very confusing. But he does not stop here, he says ' <i>genetically related to Tosk</i> , the language has been heavily influenced by Greek over the centuries', can't he say insteed <i>genetically related to Tosk Albanian</i>, look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=15250751&amp;oldid=15246956" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=15250751&amp;oldid=15246956" rel="nofollow">edit</a>. It's obviously that this two articles are written from Theathenae point of view, he want to claim that the Arvanites are albanophone hellenes and not hellenphone Albanians.

<p>Theathenae obviously has a concerted agenda here to deempasize the historical/linguistic links that the minorities of Greece (such as Arvanites &amp; Aromanians) have with groups outside of Greece---the problem is, 'athenae takes it to the brink of pseudo-science, because the fact is the groups in question have very much the same origin, despite the gulf that has developed in the ensuing centuries. While one should not necessarily project the close historic link onto the modern scene, one should also not attempt to blot out the common link from the past in a Wikipedia article. Decius 11:02, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's the way I approach this topic: my edits to the articles in question will show that my concern in these situations is to make sure the close historical/linguistic links are made clear; in the articles, I do not get involved with the modern scene or how the people identify themselves (how people identify themselves is extremely subjective and arbitrary and does not necessarily reflect the historical realities of a situation) . And I note that 'athenae gives a selective impression of how these groups identify, and repeatedly attempts to speak for an entire people---which is ridiculous, point blank. His own position is extremely pro-Greek. Decius 11:08, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My views are merely a reflection of how our communities view ourselves, reinforced by every other Arvanite and Aromanian I have ever met and unadulterated by the non-Greek constructed identities Albanian and Rumanian nationalists have attempted to project on us. I can see how you would find my views irritating and obstructive to your own agendas, but they are a genuine representation of how we feel, especially considering the pain and suffering your meddling inflicted on us in the past.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 11:15, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There is nothing in this article that is factually incorrect, nor is the link with Albania or Albanian omitted. The only problem is Albanau's insistence, not merely on calling the Arvanites "Albanians", but going so far as to claim on the <a href="../../../f/u/s/Talk%7EFustanella_c17c.html#A_Lame_edit_war" title="Talk:Fustanella">fustanella</a> talk page that "you cannot claim Theathenae that Arvanites are Greeks, a pure Arvanítis is a pure Albanian, they have no Greek origin". If you scroll up on this page you'll see more of this kind of diatribe: "It's obviously that this two articles are written from Theathenae point of view, he want to claim that the Arvanites are albanophone hellenes and not hellenphone Albanians". He even disputes the Arvanites' Greek nationality, effectively equating these Greek citizens with the recent Albanian immigrants. That is a deliberate distortion of the truth that is unacceptable on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, that's wrong. The Arvanites are a hellenized ethnicity who have a common origin with Albanians, but you can no longer call them Albanians in the same sense as an Albanian is an Albanian. Decius 12:39, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's all I have said from the very beginning. Having a common origin does not mean we are the same. All of us are ultimately related, after all. Unlike Albanau, I have never made claims of ethnic "purity". And unlike you, I didn't even claim my pretty skirt was originally Greek.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 13:49, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't seriously claim that the <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fustanella.html" title="Fustanella">fustanella</a> is of Greek origin. I would assume that it was imported along with the word itself, but I don't know. Decius 14:17, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is usually elements which contribute to confusion about identity. The Arvanites living in southern Greece are originally a Albanian folkgrupp who have absorbed a lot of Greek element through intermarriage and interaction with Greeks through the centuries. They have lived in Greece for centuries, they identified themself today with Greece, they have become associated with the new land.</p>
<p>Part of the article confused me, it stated: 'a people' originating in central Albania, I changed it to: 'originally a Albanian ethnic group' originating in central Albania. I think it's necessary to confirm this and not try to dislink the affinity of Arvanites people with the southern Albanians.</p>
<p>On the article <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> it is stated: 'an Indo-European language related to and somewhat mutually intelligible with Tosk' which should have sounded an alarm bell in you mind Decius. The line should be replaced with the following; 'a variety of Tosk Albanian spoken by the Arvanites'. Theathenae must recognize this fact that the Arvanítika language is a a variety of Tosk Albanian and not attempt to dislink the dialect of Arvanítika with the Tosk Albanian. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 20:29, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What you said, now, and what you wrote on the article: <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> it's misleading. <a href="http://print.google.com/print?id=PBeGOLDusJgC&amp;pg=1&amp;lpg=1&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fie%3DUTF-8%26q%3DArvan%25C3%25ADtika%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;sig=hbbVLyhh81VcLlAuvbitililU4w" class="external text" title="http://print.google.com/print?id=PBeGOLDusJgC&amp;pg=1&amp;lpg=1&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fie%3DUTF-8%26q%3DArvan%25C3%25ADtika%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;sig=hbbVLyhh81VcLlAuvbitililU4w" rel="nofollow">Oxford University Press</a>: "Arvanítika, a variety of Tosk Albanian spoken in Greece".</p>

<dd>And if Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian can be separate languages despite being entirely mutually intelligible, then I think we can safely call Arvanitic a separate language from Tosk Albanian, considering their level of mutual intelligibility is only around 50%.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 21:42, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree Arvanitic should be referred to as a Tosk (Albanian) language, not a dialect. Ethnologue also indicates that Arvanitic has dialects within it. Decius 21:51, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Greek Helsinki report</span></h2>
<p>"Almost all speakers of Arvanitika are today bilingual, i.e. they also speak Greek, usually fluently for the younger generations (Trudgill, 1975:53). It is widely agreed that Arvanitika today have been influenced significantly by the linguistic environment in which they have evolved, sometimes for centuries, without any contact with the Albanian communities of modern day Albania. So, it has acquired a separate (Ausbau) status from Albanian, in fact with dialectical richness; nevertheless, at least partial mutual intelligibility between Arvanite and Albanian exists (Trudgill, 1994:14). Indeed, the recent (in the early 1990’s) arrival of hundreds of thousands, mainly illegal, Albanian immigrants in Greece has led to a successful test of that mutual intelligibility, when many settled in Arvanitika villages (it is also noteworthy that in these villages we have seen the two most serious incidents of beatings of Albanian immigrants)." <a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" class="external free" title="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html</a></p>
<p>I would add that the recent Albanian immigrants themselves have acquired Greek so rapidly and speak the language so fluently that one can hardly question the Arvanites, who have after all lived in Greece for five centuries. The real question is whether or not the children of the recent immigrants will be speaking any Albanian at all in the years to come.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 22:21, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

So maybe you are going to declare those parts of the Balkans they now make home a part of the new Albania. The great Albania that some nationalists like you have in mind. Wake up!!!

<p><i>Arvanitic itself is barely 50% intelligible with Tosk,</i></p>
<p>I myself speak spanish. However when I hear someone speak latin, I can understand about 1/2 the stuff said. Does that mean that Spanish is not a Romance language, deriving from latin? No, it just means that centuries of foreign influence, and independant growth and slang have changed the language to it's own course. This has been through 2000 years time. Arvanitika has had 500 years of influence, purely from Greek. I however, can still understand it. I speak a Tosk dialect, and while it may be difficult due to the large amount of recent Greek loanwords and prnounciation differences. I need people to repeat something over again. However, when it comes literature. I can understand it almost perfectly. Many of the differences between todays <i>shqip</i> and Arvanitika are mentioned in one of the articles I provided.</p>

<p>The Encyclopædia Britannica Article mention a mass Albanian immigration to Thessaly, Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnese where most of the Arvanites are residing today.</p>
<p><i>The origins of the Albanians (Albanoi/Arvanitai in Greek) remain uncertain. They appear to be the descendants of the Illyrian populations who withdrew into the highlands of the central Dinaric chain. Their name may originate from the valley of the Arbanon (along the Shkumbi River) in the theme of Dyrrachion (Durrës/Durazzo), in which they were first noted by outside commentators. Their language probably evolved from ancient Illyrian (formerly classed with the Hellenic group of Indo-European languages but now generally recognized as an independent member of the latter family), but it is heavily influenced by Greek, Slavic, and Turkish, as well as medieval Italian. For reasons not yet fully understood, the Albanians began in the 14th century to advance into the western coastal plain, where they served both Byzantine and Serbian overlords as well as ruling independently under various warlords and chiefly families; they were also present in considerable numbers in Thessaly, Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnese, serving as soldiers and as farmers, colonizing deserted lands. Albanians arrived in large numbers in the Peloponnese during the reign of the despotes Manuel Kantakouzenos, who brought them there to serve as soldiers and to resettle depopulated regions. The impact of their presence on the region's existing ethnic and linguistic structure remains debated.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">erased Greek propaganda</span></h2>
<p>I erased this, <b>The native disposition of the Tosks has been modified by intercourse with the Greeks and Vlachs.</b>, cause Tosk are as Geg Albanians and not a mishmash of people. Tosk are not Greek/Vlach/Albanian people. Tosks are southern Albanians and Gegs are northern Albanians. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 17:17, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I 've already told where this phrase came from. I believe you can use that source and make two articles, one for Gegs and one for Tosks, explaining the similarities and differences (language, way of dressing etc). This was old britanica "propaganda", take the source, modify it properly (I don't like some characterizations on that encyclopedia about Albania people) and make something useful out of it.</p>
<p>Please change the phrase Greek propaganda and try to accept the history of Arvanites.</p>

<p>Ok what they are talking about had nothing to do with Arvanites, are you sure you're taking your pills? - User&#160;:)</p>
<p>So any fact you don't like is propaganda now? What reason did the old Britannica have to use propaganda against Albania? What characterizations don't you like from that encyclopaedia?

<dd>It's quite simple, really. The Arvanites do not self-identify as Albanians, nor do they describe their language as Albanian or a dialect or variety of Albanian, and in fact consider the term offensive. Just like the Croats, who do not wish their language to be referred to as a dialect or variety of Serbian, even if their standard language is much closer to Serbian than Arvanitic is to Albanian. Languages sharing a common origin need not share a name, especially when issues of distinct ethnic self-identification are at play.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 14:05, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree, not all Arvanites view themselves as distinct from mainstream Albanians. I am of Arvanitic descent and I know many other people who are also. They do not regard mainstream Albanians as foreigners but also regard themselves as Greeks, they (and I) just prefer to not be called Albanian for the purely social reason that a few immigrants from Albania have given all Albanians a stereotypical bad name. That does not mean that they are. Also, if Arvanitic were genealogically related to Tosk, Gheg and Arbëreshë (which it is, it belongs to the Albanian branch of the Indo-European family of languages), the link being on the page would be helpful if one would like to compare them. I think that you are mixing (Greek imperialistic) politics with science, and you shouldn’t. REX 14:54, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Greek imperialism? We are talking about a Greek population living on Greek soil. On the contrary, it is Albanian imperialistic politics trying to project an alien identity onto the citizens of another sovereign nation. I don't know if <i>all</i> Arvanites view themselves as distinct from "mainstream" Albanians, but I would say <i>almost all</i> certainly do. I have yet to meet or even hear of an Arvanite who considers him or herself Albanian, inside or outside my family.

<p>Let me just explain my position here. Arvanites (<font face="Arial Unicode MS">Αρbε̰ρόρ</font>, <i>Arbërór</i> or <font face="Arial Unicode MS">Σ̈κ̇ιπτάρ</font>, <i>Shqiptár</i>) are neither ethnic Greeks nor ethnic Albanians although they possess characteristics of one or both nations. However most hold Greek citizenship. They are a Greek ethnic minority. What makes them an ethnic minority is their history, their language, and some other cultural characteristics (ie traditional dress). If you have a Greek encyclopaedia with you, look up Αρβανίτες or Αρβανιτόβλαχοι, where you will see it refer to them as a λαός. What I propose is avoiding mentioning both Greeks and other Albanians as much as possible. We could say that <i>Arvanites are a people</i> (=λαός) <i>originating in Central Albania who immigrated to Western Greece during the Middle Ages</i>, that <i>their language Arbëríshte is a form of Tosk Albanian</i> and <i>that they have almost totally assimilated into Greek society</i>. That's it! We haven't said anything to politically sensitive, nor have we said anything untrue. And Please… Please don't speak for all Arvanites, you don't know what percentage resent being identified with the immigrant Tosk and Gheg Albanian community. I see the term Albanian an equilavent term to Scaninavian. Just as there are Tosk, Gheg, Arvanite, and Arbëresh Albanians; there are Norwegians, Swedes, Danes and Icelanders. Similar people, with partial intelligble languages, but different. Tell me what you think and if you don't agree with me prepare a proposal of your own, so that we can get this over with, Φαλεμινdέριτ. REX 19:29, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Descendant and admixture is differing. The Arvanites are, dispite the degree of Greek genetic admixture, descendant to the Albanian immigrants. Their mother-tongue is Arvanítika, is referred to as a language cause it has dialects within it, and the language is a variety of Tosk Albanian.</dd>

<dd>Theathenae have very clear denied two important things about the Arvanites and the Arvanitic language that we should take notice.

<p>Φίλτατε Ρήγα, your proposal would be a breakthrough if only the likes of <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">User:Albanau</a> would accept it. It turns out our views on the subject are practically identical. Your phrasing is almost exactly what I had written before <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">User:Albanau</a> stormed in and insisted on calling them Albanians. He rabidly objected to the use of the term "people", insisting on "Albanian folkgrupp" instead. I have been saying all along that the Arvanites are a similar people to the Albanians, with partially intelligible languages, but <b>different</b>. The only modification I would make to your wording would be in regards to the language; "Arbëríshte shares a common origin" or "descends from the same root as Tosk Albanian" is a truer reflection of the linguistic situation, as they both descend from the same mediaeval proto-language, which I like to call proto-Arvanitic. "Arvanitic is a form of Tosk Albanian" implies that Arvanitic is somehow dependent on Tosk Albanian, when in fact it has developed entirely independently over the course of five centuries and can legimitately be classed as a separate language. Unfortunately, the term <i>Albanian</i> has very specific ethno-national(ist) connotations, so it is not equivalent to <i>Scandinavian</i>. If there was a neutral umbrella term covering all "Albanian" groups, I would use it.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 20:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Theathenae, I am pleased that we are actually agreeing on something. However <i>Arvanitic is a form of Tosk Albanian</i> is not that bad. I mean that it is similar to saying that <i>Hellenistic Greek is a form of Attic Greek</i>, with the sole exception that Arvanites and Tosks are related while Hellenistic Greek was a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingua_franca.html" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a> spoken by many people with little or no connections to the Ancient Athenians. They certainly were not dependent on the Ancient Athenians. It could also be compared to Spanish's relationship to Latin. They were once the same languages, then they began to differ. The standard Latin of Rome and the vulgar Latin of Spain. Spanish Latin was still a form of Standard Latin. Then after Arabic influences during the Middle Ages Spanish became similar to language we know today. Is it still not a form of Latin in the loose sense that Arvanitic is a form of Tosk. If we call it a form of Tosk, then even Albanau will be happy. Also, in Arvanitic χ is pronounced like the English letter h, which differs from the Greek letter χ. REX 21:07, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Albanau says that <i>Arvanites are the descendants of settlers of Albanian ancestry from central Albania that settled in various Greek lands during the Middle Ages</i> and that is true isn't it? Anyhow, Theathenae says that he accepts the following <i>Arvanites are a people originating in Central Albania who immigrated to Western Greece during the Middle Ages</i>, which is almost the same thing. However, I find one small defect in that second definition. While it says that Arvanites immigrated to Greece at some point in the Middle Ages, the problem is that then Arvanites were the <i>same</i> as Tosk Albanians and that the differentiation began later, and it also implies that even before the immigration, Arvanites and Tosks were different peoples. That <i>is</i> quite misleading isn't it? Albanau also says that <i>the Arvanitic language is a variety of Tosk Albanian</i>, while Theathenae accepts that <i>Arvanitic shares a common origin Tosk Albanian</i>. While they are both true, it depends on your perspective. Albanau's input seems to treat Arbëríshte as a dialect of Albanian, while Theathenae's seems to treat it as a separate language. Politics no doubt, but unfortunately there is no Arvanitic Authority from whom we could find out whether it is a language or a dialect. However, respectable sources such as <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aat" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aat" rel="nofollow">Ethnologue</a> treat it as an Albanian dialect and my encyclopaedia calls Arvanites Αλβανόφωνοι Χριστιανοί (=<b>Albanian</b> speaking Christians). Also Albanau's reference to the Encyclopaedia Britannica (if it's genuine) could be acceptable. That encyclopaedia has a very good name and is respected throughout (not just the English speaking) world. I would also like to say that it is a bit unfair to accuse Albanau's input of appeasing political guerilla groups. I can't see any connection (unless of course Britannica was written by them). I wouldn't pay much attention to his other references, they are just private books, I could even write a book saying that the capital of Greece is Tokyo. REX 08:52, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, even Ethnologue describes Arvanítika as a <i>language</i> of Greece. I have no problem with saying that the ancestors of the Arvanites were the same people as the <i>ancestors</i> of today's Tosk Albanians, but that is <i>not</i> the same thing as describing them <i>today</i> as <i>Albanians</i> or descendants of <i>Albanians</i>, as the <i>Albanians</i> are a very specific <i>modern</i> nation. The ancestors of <i>both</i> the Arvanites and the Tosks called themselves <i>Arbërór</i> (Arvanites), not <i>Shqipëtare</i> (Albanians), so why not call the <i>Albanians</i> the descendants of <i>Arvanites</i>, which is actually more correct than the reverse? The Albanians would not accept this, of course, which is why we don't do it. But neither should we do it to the Arvanites, who deserve to have their distinct identity respected. The Arvanites and Albanians became separate peoples by virtue of their identification with separate <i>nations</i> in modern times. Apart from being simplistic and anachronistic, it is unhelpful and misleading to impose an unwanted label onto a people with its own unique heritage, just because that term happens to be more well-known and convenient. The appearance of the term in Britannica or other references does not make it correct or eternally binding; the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_%28people%29.html" title="Roma (people)">Roma</a> are no longer referred to as "gypsies", nor are the <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> labelled "Eskimos", even if such names were commonplace until relatively recently. A more nuanced description of the Arvanites' origins and identity is both possible and necessary.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 10:00, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed, but at the heading Ethnologue says: <b>Albanian</b>, Arvanitika A language of Greece. In conjunction with the fact that the distinction between language and dialect is somewhat blurred (eg Cantonese and Mandarin are classed as dialects one language Chinese, even though the difference between them is like the one between Portuguese and Spanish, which are classed as different languages; Danish and Norwegian (Bokmål) are intelligible and are classed as different languages) I believe that we shouldn't really go into detail on the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> page. That sort of lengthy discussion is for the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> page (see there, we are calling it a language). Also, I disagree with your statement that calling the Albanians the descendants of Arvanites is actually more correct than the reverse or vice versa is wrong. Arvanites and Tosks are both seperate modern nations (sorry for using such a strong word) but they are very closely related (similar languages, similar religion (the Orthodox), similar (ethnic dress) dress, same history (up to a certain point) etc.). To get to the point, couldn't we say: <i>Arvanites are an ethnic group descendent from the Tosk Albanians who immigrated to Greece during the Middle Ages and have been influenced strongly by their Greek surroundings</i> and that <i>their language Arbërishte is an offshoot of Medieval Tosk Albanian and is partially intelligible to speakers of Modern Tosk</i> or <i>their language Arbërishte is closely related and partially intelligible to Tosk Albanian</i>? Are we reaching a concensus here? Do tell me, in your opinion aren’t Arvanites the Greek equivalent to the Italian <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB.html" title="Arbëreshë">Arbëreshë</a>?

<dd>No, we couldn't say that because one doesn't descend from the other: they <i>both</i> descend from the original Arbërór. The Tosks have no more right to claim the Arbërór than do the Arvanites. As for the Arbëreshë, I don't know enough about their ethnic self-identification to comment. If they see themselves as Albanians, fine. If they don't, we shouldn't be calling them Albanians, however closely related to the Tosks they may be. If the Arvanites and Tosks are "separate modern nations", as you say, then it is absurd to call the Arvanites Albanians, is it not?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 12:50, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

And <i>you lied</i>. As the Helsinki Report states in its very beginning, the Arvanite Greeks abhor being called "Albanians". So, their ancestors were never called "Albanians", they <i>hate</i> being called Albanians now, their language has evolved independently of Albanian, and is about to become extinct, and in the meantime Albanau and you want to dictate and appropriate their history and their sense of nationality.

<p>I think that you may find this interesting. It is from the Helsinki Report:<br />
<i><b>When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian, even if those Christian Albanians were considered an integral part of the Greek nation and had played a decisive role in the War of Independence between 1821-1828</b> (Bartholdy, 1993; Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule, which were though considered as part of Greek irredenta; the other Balkan countries (Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, and later Albania) had also followed similar policies. As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994).</i> <i>It is noteworthy to point out though, that, before the definite development of modern Albanian nationalism, there were efforts in the 1870’s to include most Albanians under Ottoman rule in a Greek-Albanian kingdom (Castellan, 1991:333; Vakalopoulos, 1994: 243-249), just as others appealed to them for their inclusion in an Albanian-Vlach Macedonian state (Berard, 1987:292-333). The Albanians’ fear of an eventual assimilation by the Greeks led to the failure of the former effort.</i> <i><b>The result of the Hellenization policy -which was to take a very oppressive turn during the Metaxas dictatorship (1936-1940)- was that Albanian Greeks, especially after the emergence of Albanian nationalism and of the Albanian state, felt that they had to ‘constantly prove their Greekness.’ Hence, their very conservative political behavior: they had traditionally been royalists and, in large numbers, adhered to the Old Calendarist Orthodox Christian Church, which -when the split in the Greek Church over the introduction of the new calendar took place in the 1920’s- was originally supported by the royalist forces. Moreover, and more important for the survival of their language, they have distanced themselves from the Albanians to the extent that most consider today offending to be called Albanians: they have preferred the term Arvanite (Arberor in their own language) for the people and Arvanitika (Arberichte) for the language, as opposed to Albanian (Shqiptar for the people and Shqip for the language) that Albanians use for themselves and their language -with the exception of the Arvanites of Northwestern Greece, as mentioned above. This attitude may also explain the efforts of some intellectuals of the Arvanite community to trace Arvanites’ and Arvanitika’s roots back to the prehistoric inhabitants of Greece, the Pelasgians and their language, so as to claim indigenous status</b> (Williams, 1992:87; Gerou, 1994b; Thomopoulos, 1912).</i> <i><b>Trudgill (1994) has shown that, in Greece, as minority languages are all alien (Abstand) to Greek, the use of different names for them (Arvanitika rather than Albanian, Vlach rather than Romanian, Slav rather than Macedonian) has contributed to denying their heteronomy (i.e. their dependence on the corresponding standard language) and increasing their autonomy (by assigning them the status of autonomous languages). As a result, the minority language’s vulnerability grew significantly, as well as the dissociation of the speakers’ ethnic (Arvanite, Vlach, Slavophone) identities from the corresponding national identities (Albanian, Romanian, Macedonian) which have developed in the respective modern nation-states.</b> Today, Arvanite ethnic identity is perceived by many members of the community as distinct from that of the other Greeks who have Greek as their mother tongue but as fully compatible with Greek national identity (likewise for many Vlachs and Macedonians). A similar phenomenon has helped weaken the links between Pomaks in Greece (speaking a Bulgarian-based language) and Bulgarians, and the consequent Pomaks’ assimilation into the Turkish ethnic and, by now, national identity in Western Thrace, an assimilation here detrimental to Greece’s homogenization and anti-minority policies. In another Balkan context, such attitude helped distance the literary Macedonian language standardized by Yugoslav authorities in the late 1940s from Bulgarian to which the previously spoken dialects in Yugoslav Macedonia were heteronomous</i>.<br />
I think that this is clear enough. REX 14:10, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it's not. What's the relevance of what the dictator Metaxas, a fascist, did 70 years ago? It's as irrelevant as what Hodja did to Albanians, and Vorioepirote Greeks, for 50 years. If you want to mention in the article that the Greek state carried a process of Hellenization thoughout its 175-year-long existence, go ahead, I have no problem with it. So did all Balkan states. France did the same with Alsace-Lorraine since 1945. The US was almost genocidal to the native Americans. The Albanian state threw the leaders of the Vorioepirote Greek party in ... jail (!) for several years to keep them from taking part in elections, and to intimidate their voters.

<p>I don't understand what all the brouhaha is about. The Arvanites' situation is analogous if not identical to that of the Vlachs in Greece. I have had some minor differences with the Rumanian editors here, but they have not insisted on calling the Greek Vlachs ethnic Rumanians or the descendants of Rumanians. The <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanians.html" title="Aromanians">Aromanians</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanian_language.html" title="Aromanian language">Aromanian language</a> articles represent a fair balance, one achieved without resorting to mediation or other extremes. REX is right; this is all about contemporary Balkan politics, with Albanian editors objecting to anything that deviates from the dogma of pan-Albanianism, which for obvious reasons is today a more virulent strain of nationalism than that of the EU-bound Rumanians. But it doesn't have to be like this; the Albanians belong in Europe too, and the sooner they abandon their dangerous ultra-nationalism, the sooner they will get there. As for Wikipedia, the Albanian editors should take a leaf out of their <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Albanians_25c1.html#See_also" title="Origin of Albanians">Rumanian</a> brethren's book.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 15:58, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem here boils down to the fact that there is no neutral umbrella term like <i>Vlach</i> to describe that common stock from which both the Arvanites and Albanians branched off centuries ago. I would use the term <i>proto-Arvanitic</i>, as the ancestors of today's Arvanites and Tosks were referred to as <b>Αρβανίται</b> in contemporary Byzantine sources. But to call them <i>Albanians</i> is anachronistic and misleading, and would be the exact equivalent of calling <i>all</i> Vlachs in the Balkans today <i>Rumanians</i>. We should apply to the Arvanites the same principle we have already applied to the Aromanians, but it appears that is impossible due to a few Albanians' delicate nationalist sensibilities.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 16:13, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I never said that Avanites are Albanians. I said that their ancestors were Albanians (like the Helsinki Report does), something which Theathenae is determined to gloss over. I am happy with the article as it is now and I'm trying to convince Theathenae that it must stay this way. If he can find reasonalbe proof that the Arvanites' ancestors were not Albanians then I'll willingly consent to the edit. But he doesn't do that. He insists on not including the word <i>Albanian</i> in the article and replaces it with things like "Arbanoi". That is a Greek word. This is an English encyclopaedia. Only legitimate English words can be used. All English sources have always called the Albanians Albanians, just as they have always called the Turks Turks. I still insist on Meditation.

<dl>
<dd>No REX, it is you who wants to gloss over the fact that the ancestors of the Arvanites and Tosks were called <b>Arbanítai</b> (Arvanites) in <b>contemporary</b> sources, not <b>Albanoí</b> (Albanians). <i>Vlach</i> is not an "English" name either but is used for the ancestors of both the modern Aromanians and Rumanians. The correct equivalent term to <i>Vlach</i> in this situation is not <i>Albanian</i>, which denotes a specific modern nationality, but <i>Arvanite</i> or <i>proto-Arvanite</i>.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 16:47, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But does <i>Albanian</i> always denote the specific modern nationality? The actual term may also be used to include the <b>ancestors</b> of related ethnic groups, as the Helsinki report uses it. The problem here may be the definition of <i><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a></i>. If we're going to use <i>Albanian</i> in the article (and we probably should) as it is now, I think we should explain this problem in the article itself. Decius 17:01, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is indeed the problem. And because of the confusion the use of the term inevitably causes, my proposal is to describe the Arvanites in a <i>neutral</i> way, such as "sharing a common origin with the Tosk Albanians", which acknowledges the Albanian link but doesn't explicitly call them <i>Albanians</i> or the descendants of Albanians. <i>Albanian</i> in this context is an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a> used in the absence of a neutral term covering all such related groups, but we are not <i>bound</i> to use it when it is easily avoidable by way of a periphrastic description. Insisting on calling them or their ancestors Albanians, however, would be like ditching the term <i>Vlach</i> in favour of <i>Rumanian</i>, i.e. projecting the modern national identity of the Rumanians onto the <i>related</i> but <i>separate</i> Vlach groups.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 17:23, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No no no no. Vlach can be found in the OED. Anyway, I have been reading the articles <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanians.html" title="Aromanians">Aromanians</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanian_language.html" title="Aromanian language">Aromanian language</a> and I do like them. Do you think that we could use those articles as templates? They omit anything controversial of they state both opinions: Romanian nationalist and Greek supremacist. Off the record: If you want to support you opinions, GET SOME SOURCES!

<dl>
<dd>We could easily use those articles as templates, but we would have to refrain from using the loaded term <i>Albanian</i> in the main description. Then we could add the opinions of Albanian nationalists, who view the Arvanites as Albanians, and those of Arvanite Greek nationalists, who say they are the descendants of the Pelasgians and are therefore indigenous to Greece. They are both as ludicrous as each other, but that's just my opinion and not a reason to exclude them from the article.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 17:40, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, maybe we could exclude the phrase <i>Albanian ancestry</i> from the main description, but is that phrase really that offensive to most <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>? REX says he is an Arvanite (I think), and he doesn't have a problem with it. Also, the view that Arvanites are of Albanian ancestry is not just an "Albanian nationalist" view, and we've seen references that use that terminology. The point I was underlining earlier is that the definition of the term <i>Albanian</i> may include the ancestors of Arvanites, so it would not be an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a> in that context, regardless of the fact that the nation of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a> didn't exist back then. Decius 18:46, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, except for the fact that the <b>separate</b> term <i>Albanoí</i> was <b>not</b> used for the ancestors of the Arvanites, the term <i>Arbanítai</i> was. As for REX, I doubt he really is an Arvanite - you can blame <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">User:Chronographos</a> for that - but what I think is irrelevant. Even if he is, by his own admission he does not represent the Arvanites. The Helsinki report clearly states that the Arvanites "loathe" the <i>Albanian</i> designation, and yes that extends to their ancestry. You don't <i>loathe</i> something half-heartedly, you loathe it <i>totally</i>. Similarly, the overwhelming majority of Aromanians in Greece reject being called Rumanians, but they have no problem being called Vlachs - even if that isn't the name they use for themselves <i>in their own language</i>. The Arvanites don't call themselves Albanians in <i>any</i> language.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 19:06, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and I would also reject being called an <i>Aromanian</i> (or a <i>Koutzovlach</i>). If most Arvanites really do object to that phrase ("Albanian ancestry"), then maybe Theathenae's latest proposal is the way to do it. Decius 19:15, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>I guess it now rests on REX and the opposing parties to describe what they want the article to say. Decius 19:42, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are speaking generally. The Helsinki report says that MOST Arvanites reject being called Albanians, these Arvanites live generally live in South Greece. Other Arvanites who mostly live in Northwest Greece do call themselves Albanians. Of course these distinctions are not absolute. I am from Southern Greece (<a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydra.html" title="Hydra">Hydra</a>) and I do not reject the name Albanian, so we can assume that there is at least one Arvanite from Southern Greece who doesn’t. Anyway, to get to the point is this what is going to be done: All references to Greece or Albania shall be avoided with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arvanites originate in somewhere in today’s Central Albania.</li>
<li>Arvanites speak a language very similar to Tosk Albanian (as in <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanians.html" title="Aromanians">Aromanians</a>).</li>
<li>Arvanites have being assimilating into Greek society since the establishment of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek State</a> and now, like other Greek ethnic minorities such as the <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanians.html" title="Aromanians">Aromanians</a>, identify nationally but not ethnically as Greeks?</li>
<li>And perhaps your proposed references to Albanian and Greek nationalism trying to project different identities on the Arvanites.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, I strongly urge you to remember: the less said, the better. Also, do we request for Meditation after all, or should we wait? REX 19:48, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with all of the above, except your third point. For the Greeks, the notions of ethnicity and nationality effectively coincide, and the Aromanians and Arvanites are certainly not excluded from the <b>Έλληνες το γένος</b> designation as the Muslims of Thrace and the Roma are. It would be best simply to state that the Arvanites are a people who identify as Greeks but also retain their own distinct identity, as expressed through their language and culture. Also, they haven't been assimilating into Greek society since the establishment of the Greek state; they have been doing that since they first set foot in Greece.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 20:11, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed they are, which is why we should avoid them. As for the Arvanites' assimilation, there is nothing I need to prove that you don't already know. They have been under Greek influence for centuries, speaking Greek as well as Arvanitic and living as Greeks. If you mean their <i>total</i> assimilation, that began relatively recently with the advent of urbanisation and modernisation, not since or because of the establishment of the Greek state <i>per se</i>.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 21:03, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been withholding comment about the "Arvanites" of northwestern Greece (known simply as <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epirus.html" title="Epirus">Epirus</a> by the Greeks - cheap gibe, I know), because I didn't know there were people there who identified as "Shqiptár" until reading the Helsinki report. If they really do self-identify as <i>Shqiptár</i>, i.e. Albanians, then using the term <i>Arvanites</i> for them would be a misnomer; they would be ethnic Albanians plain and simple. This would not be inconceivable in areas adjoining Albania, just as there are ethnic Greeks in areas of southern Albania adjoining Greece. My argument all along has been that you can't project "Shqiptaria" onto people who don't identify as Albanians. If they do, then who am I to object?

So he withdraws his consensus, REX does likewise (as always) and now a new consensus will be required: one that's halfway between the previously emerging consensus and Albanau's immutable extreme position. The tactics is well known, and even has a name: "the Oriental Bazaar bargaining strategy".

<p>I think that you all need to realise that in order to change an article, you need to have to prove why. Chronographos and Theathenae have yet to prove their position, despite the regular requests for them to do so. As I have said, many times: the Helsinki Report refers to the ancestors of the Arvanites as Albanians, and if it’s good enough for an Official Report, it is good enough for Wikipedia. Of course far right extremist groups in Greece such as the Χρυσή Αυγή or the political party Λ.Α.Ο.Σ. don’t like that, but I don’t think that that should affect the article. Also, Theathenae and Chronographe I think that I should request, with all the earnestness possible, do NOT make racist remarks. Wikipedia is not the place for that kind of thing.

If so, then somebody should request that the page be unprotected here:<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">Wikipedia:Requests for page protection</a>. Albanau apparently hasn't changed his mind on the formula <i>Albanian ancestry</i> in the main description, but it doesn't depend on <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> here. He might (about a 35% chance) even agree to a new format. I'm wondering though whether you are willing to let go of that phrase in the main description (your latest comment indicates a return to Albanau's position, but you haven't said explicitly whether you want the phrase <i>Albanian ancestry</i> in the main description). If not, then there is no compromise (that's the main point), and all your comments towards compromise would be rendered irrelevant. The page should then as well stay protected for awhile longer.

<p>An example of a more neutral treatment would be: <i>"Arvanites are descendants of settlers from central Albania who were of the same ethnicity as the ancestors of today's Tosk Albanians"</i>---something along these lines. As you can see, it is presenting the same fact, but without saying of "Albanian ancestry". Just because Brittanica or Helsinki says it in a certain way, doesn't mean Wikipedia has to echo them exactly. Wikipedia's whole point is that it is more free and flexible. Decius 15:44, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've got another proposal which is pretty god and perhaps better then yours, "Arvanites are descendants of the Arberesh people or the Albanian people from central Arbëria (i.e. medieval Albania) who migrated to Greece during the late Middle Ages". <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 15:52, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might've been better if not for <i>"or the Albanian people"</i>. Decius 16:01, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You guys can figure something out, this isn't my "battle" here, but it parallels the Aromanian case which was resolved along these lines (though actually what resolved the Aromanian case is the fact that Romanians <i>don't really care</i> whether the Aromanians choose to consider themselves as a southern variant of Romanians or a separate Vlach group from a common Vlach stock; the Aromanians don't really fit in any current nationalist Romanian scheme). Decius 16:17, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>why better of with the part <i>"or the Albanian people"</i> cause not everyone will know who reads it that Arbersh people during the mediveal time in Albania were an Albanian ethnicity, and Albanians are classed as an ethnicity regardless of the fact that the nation did not exist then as a modern state. You denied this one important part of the mediveal people Arbersh or at least try to hide it, their ethnicity. The part <i>"or the Albanian people"</i> will just explain the Albanian ethnicity of the descendants to the Arvanites people, the arbersh who had an Albanian ethnicity. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 16:33, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't ask me, I'm not the one whose ancestors are at issue here. Since most <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> (Arvanite <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a>) <i>apparently</i> do not like the term <i>Albanian</i> applied even to their ancestors, a different phrasing would <i>perhaps</i> be best (though we don't have any <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion_polls.html" title="Opinion polls">opinion polls</a> that prove that most Arvanites would take offense to <i>Albanian ancestry</i>). Decius 16:44, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't change the historical realities of the situation, and were do you get the term Arvanite Greeks?, and if the term exist shouldent we mention it in the article? "Arvanites are descendants of the Albanian people from central Arbëria (i.e. medieval Albania) who migrated to Greece during the late Middle Ages" would be a good phrase. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 16:49, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't say that it "changes the historical reality of the situation", I'm saying the same reality can be described in a different manner. Decius 16:53, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And how would that be described as? Cause when we Albanians talk about the Arbëresh we are talking about the medieval Albanians or the descendants of the Albanian immigrants still present in Italy, and Arbërorët are the descendants of the Albanian immigrants still prestent in Greece, called the Arvanitís in Greek and Arbéror in their language. So actually it would be better to phrase it like this ""Arvanites are descendants of the Arbëror people or Albanian people from central Arbëria (i.e. medieval Albania) who migrated to Greece during the late Middle Ages" would be a good phrase. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 17:02, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, your phrase looks to be 100% accurate as long as a reader understands what <i><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a></i> implies in this context. "I" do not have a problem with your phrase. But most <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> might have a problem with it; and since the same historical reality can be described in a less obtrusive way, then why not try a different phrasing in the <b>main description</b>.

Do we really need to discuss something that is improper to say <i>some Arvanites will a problem with it</i>. Either are you a Arvanite or not, and being Arvanite means that you are part of the Arvanites people who are descendants of the Albanian people from medieval Albania who migrated to Greece during the late Middle Ages. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 17:21, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think any one can put forth a credible argument that Arvanites and (Tosk) Albanians were not once the same basic ethnicity (which is termed <i><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian.html" title="Albanian">Albanian</a></i> in the references we've seen so far). Many Arvanites still speak <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic</a>, which is in the same group as <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosk.html" title="Tosk">Tosk</a>. These are the facts we've repeated a hundred times. The issue is how do we describe these facts in the text so that many <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> will not be offended. I don't plan on repeating myself on this topic over &amp; over. The Wikipedia text can be more flexible while still presenting the same facts. Decius 17:45, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Their current population is estimated at anywhere from 140,000 to 1,600,000.

<p>Their language is called <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic</a>, although today very few Arvanites speak only Arvanitic. They are either bilingual or speak only <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>.</p>
<p><b>Name</b><br />
The name Arvanite derives from the medieval Greek word for the Albanians: Αρβανίται <i>Arbanítai</i>. Most Arvanites today though still call themselves Αρbε̰ρόρ <i>Arbërór</i>, the medieval name that Albanians used for themselves. However in northwestern Greece Arvanites refer to themselves as Σ̈κ̇ιπτάρ <i>Shqiptár</i>, which is what modern <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a> call themselves. It should be noted that most Arvanites, particularly in southern Greece reject being called Albanians and prefer the term Arvanites.</p>

<i>The first Christian Albanian migrations to what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when Albanians were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 &amp; 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Muslim Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). <b>All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arvanites in Central and Southern Greece</b>.</i> REX 21:30, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Greek still claim that there are no minorities in Greece, only Greeks with religious, cultural and language difference. The Christian Albanians in Greece used to be "Albanophone Greeks". The line "Arvanites are the descendants of settlers of Albanian ancestry from central Albania that settled in various Greek lands during the Middle Ages" is totally correct and supported by scientific sources and will remain so in the article according to policy, and will not be changed for it become sutiable to the the Greek chavunists view that descendants of the Arvanites were not of Albanian ancestry. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 01:00, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree. A legitimate source refers to the ancestors of the Arvanites, so we can say: <i>Arvanites are the descendants of settlers of Albanian ancestry from central Albania that settled in various Greek lands during the Middle Ages</i>. If anyone tries to remove it without stating why, they will be guilty of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_spot_vandalism_bdf4.html#Disguised_Vandalism_and_Stalking_Vandalism" title="Wikipedia:How to spot vandalism">Wikipedia:How_to_spot_vandalism#Disguised_Vandalism_and_Stalking_Vandalism</a>.

<dd>Blah, blah, blah. It is obvious to any objective observer that it is Albanian nationalists who have an agenda. Witness <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a>'s "indignation" about Greek "minority rights". Greece has the highest standard of respect of civil rights and liberties. It is a fully functioning, wealthy (with a per capita GDP almost four times the average of its neighbors) Western democracy, a member of the <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a>, the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurozone.html" title="Eurozone">eurozone</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a>. It houses and gives employment to an amazing number of migrants that total a huge 10% of Greece's population. You can only imagine what would happen, say, in the USA, if <i>25 million Mexicans</i> were suddenly to cross the border and seek a home and employment there. Mexican migration to the USA is one tenth of what I described, yet the USA has erected steel fences on its border and has authorized border patrols to <i>shoot</i> if need be.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In contrast, Greece has given most of these migrants full social benefits (including <i>free medical care</i> and subsidized medication purchases), free access to the country's infrastructure (e.g. schools and Universities, paid for by generations of Greek taxpayers). These also include, e.g., children of illegal aliens, as Greece accepts that these kids are <i>entitled to free health care and a free education</i>, regardless of whether their parents might have broken the law by entering the country illegally. If there is anything Albanian nationalists should fear (in their nationalistic delirium) is <i>assimilation</i> of these migrant kids. Just the other day I was passing through a park and saw a bunch of Albanian kids, probably aged around 6-8, playing soccer on the grass. They were jostling and having fun <i>in Greek</i> ("<i>δώσε τη μπάλλα <b>ρε μαλάκα</b></i>!"). I am sure these kids will grow up here in financial safety and will lead rewarding lives for themselves and the society at large. This makes me very happy because I believe that any country's most valuable asset is its people, regardless of where they come from. That's why Greece's neighbors have been <i>voting with their feet</i>, as what they see here is a chance for a vastly better life. And Greece is coming through for them too. I read somewhere that 80% of the money that enters Albania comes from migrants in Greece who send it to their relatives. I think it's wonderful that this prosperity is shared.

<dd>The present Albanian language is Tosk. The phrase <i>Arvanitic shares a common origin with Tosk</i> is correct. Tosk and Arvanitic developped seperately for the last 5 or 8 centuries. As a result modern Tosk and Arvanitic have some differences, yet both languages share a common origin. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 12:57, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tosk is actually a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian</a> and the division between Tosk and Gheg already existed before the immigration of Tosk-speaking Albanians (you can check the dates in the Helsinki Report). What is important here is that sources other than Wikipedia (The Helsinki Report and more recently MSN Encarta), which can be considered neutral and impartial, do refer to the ancestors of the Arvanites as (Tosk) Albanians and refer to Arvanitic (Arvanitika) as a dialect/variety of Tosk Albanian. Therefore this proves that those terms can be used in (what is supposed to be) a neutral encyclopaedia article. So why do you insist so firmly that these phrasings cannot be used? I did agree with you when you said that Arvanitic and Tosk were unintelligible to speakers of Gheg. I changed it, didn't I? The article doesn't say that now, does it?

<dd>Your phrase <i>Their language, Arvanitic is a variety of Tosk Albanian</i> is not wrong, but the phrase <i>Arvanitic shares a common origin with Tosk</i> is a little better, because Tosk today is not the same as Tosk before those 5 or 8 centuries. So, the second phrase is the more clarified version of the same thing.<br /></dd>

<p>What I certainly didn't like was your phrase <i>until you can prove otherwise, <b>don't</b> change it</i>, because I really think that you were both talking about the same thing.

<p>It's just that <i>sharing a common origin with Tosk</i> is quite misleading; you see Gheg <i>does</i> shares a common origin with Tosk, but when the migrations happened, the modern Arvanites' ancestors were already called Tosks and had already differentiated themselves from the Ghegs. Do you think that we could say that <i>Arvanitic shares a common origin with Modern Tosk</i>? REX 15:50, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand, what are you trying to say? Today, Tosk is obviously different from the Tosk as spoken five hundred and something years ago, but doesn't it remain the same language. If modern Greek and ancient Greek are actually the same language as most Greek scholars claim, why can't Tosk change over the years? What I'm saying is that Tosk as spoken today and Arvanitic as spoken today, were the same language about six hundred years ago: Tosk of that period, which had already differentiated itself from Gheg. REX 17:36, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now you are getting somewhere: the Tosk of that days, or something similar, is the common origin of Arvanitic and Tosk as spoken today. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 18:05, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed, but also a variety of Tosk, if you read the article <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> you will see that this way Arvanitic could be called a dialect of Tosk. It could also be called a seperate language but that is for politics to dictate. Equally all are fine answers, but which one do we use and why? REX 22:35, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been doing some reading on this subject and I believe that the only truly neutral way of phrasing is to say: <i>Arvanitic is a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">variety</a> of Tosk Albanian</i>. I mean according to the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">Variety (linguistics)</a>, variety could mean that Arvanitic is merely an Albanian <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>, but it could also mean that it is a separate language genetically related to Tosk. This is ideal, as it has not been <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official.html" title="Official">officially</a> established whether Arvanitic is a language or a dialect. In my rather humble view a <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> Albanian nationalist would like to have the article say that Arvanitic is an Albanian dialect, while a <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> member of the Χρυσή Αυγή would like to say that Arvanitic is a separate language from Albanian altogether (but as it is obvious, sharing a common origin with it). As, as I have already said, neither view has been officially established (linguists don't seem to care much for this beautiful language) the term 'variety' could well mean both and so there would be no disputes. Also as a respectable source (<a href="http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554362/Albanian_Language.html" class="external text" title="http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554362/Albanian_Language.html" rel="nofollow">MSN Encarta</a>) refers to Arvanitic as a variety of Tosk, this proves that the term can be used in an encyclopaedia article.

<p>Δεαθηναι, have you not read a single word I've said? Who are we to say if Arvanitic is a dialect of Albanian or a separate language? The word <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">variety</a> is neutral it could mean any of the above. If you like however, let's play your game. Cantonese is discribed as being a dialect of Chinese, the standerd dialect being Mandarin. These languages are obviously more different than Arvanitic and Tosk, therefore, we can call Arvanitic an Albanian dialect, the standard version being Tosk. Brilliant huh? A (<a href="http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554362/Albanian_Language.html" class="external text" title="http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554362/Albanian_Language.html" rel="nofollow">respectable source</a>) refers to Arvanitic as a variety of Tosk, this is more reasonable than you non-existing sources.

<dd>You still didn't answer my question. Labelling Arvanitic "Albanian" is as offensive to Arvanites as labelling Croatian "Serbian" would be to Croats. These languages may descend from the same proto-language, but they are separate languages today because of the separate ethnic self-identification of their speakers. If the Arvanites considered themselves Albanians, then perhaps their language could be considered a mere variety of dialect of Albanian. But in their overwhelming majority, they do not. Insisting on imposing an unwanted label on the Arvanites is Albanian imperialism, pure and simple.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 18:01, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Have you noticed that ethnologue.com on the page about Arvanitic at the heading says <b>Arvanitika, Albanian</b>? How do you explain that?

<dd>You claim that acknowledging the status of Arvanitic as a separate language is "the far-right Greek line". It is nothing of the sort. The overwhelming majority of Arvanites <i>themselves</i> regard their language as separate from Albanian, <i>regardless</i> of their political persuasion. It is only Albanian nationalists who deny the status of the Arvanites as a separate people from the Albanians and of Arvanitic as a separate language. Furthermore, the word "<a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety.html" title="Variety">variety</a>" is not as neutral as you claim; according to the Wikipedia article you cite, it can refer to a dialect, a sociolect, a standard language, an idiolect or a register/diatype. Arvanitic is none of the above, <i>unless</i> of course you believe it to be a dialect of Albanian. This, by your own admission, would be the "far-right Albanian nationalist" line, would it not?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 19:18, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, it can be a dialect or a standard language. Furthermore you seem to be forgetting that the Wikipedia article is <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a>, not <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a>. And who made that change, I believe that it was ME (see how can I then be an Albanian nationalist). So, if you think about it, that in conjunction with the word variety ultimately implies that Arvanitic is a language in its own right and has a standard version. The <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> Greek stance, but it does not exclude the possibility of Arvanitic being an Albanian dialect. That would not enable Albanian nationalists to complain. See, the ideal combination. But of course, understanding this thought process requires impartiality, not being a narrow minded <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> Greek fanatic like certain individuals who I don’t care to name. Also, you didn’t answer my question: why does Ethnologue say Arvanitika, Albanian? That could constitute grounds for an Albanian nationalist to insist on Arvanitic being an Albanian dialect. I’m choosing to ignore that and insist on calling Arvanitic a variety of Albanian which both has the above benefits, but also is used by a fellow encyclopaedia, therefore it can be used and truly is neutral.

<p>Thank you MATIA. You are the only reasonable person here. Theathenae is utterly useless; he has yet to present a logical argument. While I believe that <i>Arvanitic shares a common origin with Tosk</i> is a perfectly fine answer, I believe that it has some major defects which <i>Arvanitic is a variety of Tosk</i> doesn't. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>It implies that Arvanitic is a language in its own right. Obviously this has not been officially established and can't be established as the Greek state denies the existence of the language.</li>
<li>Technically, when Arvanitic had not differentiated itself from the language of the other Tosk speakers it was still called Tosk (the common ancestor you mention), as opposed to Gheg (check the Helsinki Report). See it this way. Try saying that <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> is not a variety of English, but saying that it shares a common origin with <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a> (that common origin was still British English). It is just a pathetic attempt to acknowledge the links between the various varieties or the language while saying that they are now separate languages. As I have said above in the case of Arvanitic, this has not been officially established. Therefore your way of saying it is slightly misleading.</li>
</ul>
<p>I now urge you to try to think neutrally (just in case you aren’t). The word <i>variety</i> has no such defects, as it could mean <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> <i>and</i> it can mean standard language in its own right. If we use your way sooner or later there will be a dispute involving someone who says that Arvanitic is an Albanian <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> (don’t forget, they can find at least one argument supporting the fact that Arvanitic can be called Albanian, the heading at the entry on ethnologue.com). By using the word <i>variety</i> we might be able to avoid such disputes (unless of course he wants to call the page <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic.html" title="Arvanitic">Arvanitic</a>). Remember, the phrasing <i>Arvanitic is a variety of Tosk</i> is used by <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a>, which was written by professional scholars, not amateurs like us. They didn’t seem to have the same objections as you. You can’t challenge that. So, I think we should use that phrasing and end this insipid discussion. Just answer with a YES or a NO (including an explanation) please, because if you start commenting on something else, we’ll start going around in circles again. REX 21:15, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are of course aware that the ancestors of the modern Arvanites and Tosks called themselves <i>Arbërór</i> - Αρβανίται according to the contemporary Byzantine sources. Later on, the Tosks started calling themselves <i>Shqipëtarë</i>, while the Arvanites continued to use their original name. Therefore, Arvanitic is not a variety of Tosk at all. It is Tosk that is a variety of <i>Arvanitic</i>, or rather mediaeval or proto-Arvanitic. Using Tosk Albanian as the point of reference is misleading and anachronistic, when the parent language of both Tosk Albanian and modern Arvanitic was in fact called <i>Arvanitic</i> in all contemporary sources, <i>not</i> Tosk. Perhaps we should change <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian language</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosk_language.html" title="Tosk language">Tosk language</a> to reflect this.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 09:04, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

My wording acknowledges the genetic link to Albanian, while allowing for the <i>reality</i> of its separate evolution. Are <i>you</i> afraid of anything that deviates from your Albanian nationalist ideology? Because only an Albanian nationalist would be so intent on censoring any reference to the language's separate evolution.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 09:54, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">Variety (linguistics)</a> also implies a common origin. Don't two dialects or two closely related languages ALWAYS have a common origin? It is just that your terminology is slightly inaccurate given that that common origin was still (Medieval)Tosk.

<dd>I'm sure these same "professional scholars" would agree that modern Arvanitic descends from the same parent language (mediaeval Arvanitic) as modern Tosk but has developed separately over the course of the past five centuries. Their use of the terms "variety" and "Albanian" appear to be motivated by sheer convenience and a desire to keep it simple, as Albanian is undoubtedly the closest modern language with which most people are familiar. But a more in-depth study of Arvanitic would reveal its separate evolution from Albanian in Greece.

<dd>I believe you are misunderstanding my intentions. If the Arvanites identified as Albanians, there would be no issue. But they don't. Similarly, if the Cypriots for example did not identify as Greeks, their language could be referred to as a separate language, despite its common origin with Greek. No one is denying that Arvanitic and Tosk descend from the same parent language, but that parent language was called <i>Arvanitic</i>, not "Tosk", and referring to one as a variety of the other is misleading and offensive to the speakers of that language. Is Croatian a variety of Serbian? Is Portuguese a variety of Spanish? Or, for that matter, is English itself a variety of German? From a linguistic point of view, some may indeed make such assertions, but these languages are considered separate today because of the separate ethnic self-identification of their speakers.

Yet, on the page <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian_language</a>, I don't see it written anywhere that Tosk, Gheg, Arvanitic all descend from "parent language was called <i>Arvanitic</i>", as you claim. What is the basis for this claim? I'm genuinely interested. What was the parent language called, who coined this term, and where is it used today?</dd>

<dd>If you cast a quick look on the English site, you'll notice that it states that "English is a West Germanic language". Whether modern day Britons agree or disagree with that is besides the point.

<dd>I'm all for what you call "ethnic self-identification of their speakers", but this must be placed within its historic context. I'm Irish, and you might know that the vast majority of the poeple of Ireland do not speak that language. In fact, many of them detest it. There are clear historic reasons why this is the case, and the massive Anglicisation of Ireland in the 19th century was forced and not by choice. It was a complex affair, a result of cultural colonialism, which involved coercion (on the part of the authorities) and the grudging participation of the population. The situation of Arvanitic is not all that different in my opinion. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">Damac</a> 12:11, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The evidence that this parent language was called <i>Arvanitic</i> lies in the Byzantine sources dating from the Middle Ages. According to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html#Origin_and_history_of_the_name" title="Albania">Albania#Origin and history of the name</a>: <i>We first learn of the ancestors of the modern Albanians in their native land as the Arbanites of Arbanon in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Comnena_d65e.html" title="Anna Comnena">Anna Comnena</a>'s account (Alexiad, IV) of the troubles in that region caused in the reign of her father Alexius I Comneus (<a href="../../../1/0/8/1081.html" title="1081">1081</a>-<a href="../../../1/1/1/1118.html" title="1118">1118</a>) by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Normans</a></i>. In their own language, they called themselves <i>Arbërór</i>, which is still what the Arvanites of Greece call themselves today, in contrast to the modern Albanians who call themselves <i>Shqipëtarë</i> instead. Nevertheless, it is not my desire to impose the <i>Arvanitic</i> label on modern Tosk Albanian, despite the mediaeval sources that would support such a thesis. I am simply opposed to applying the "Tosk Albanian" label to Arvanitic, when in fact <i>Arvanitic</i> is the older and more historically accurate term. Describing modern Arvanitic as a variety of Tosk Albanian is an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a>: a modern <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnonym.html" title="Ethnonym">ethnonym</a> is being applied retrospectively to the language of a people who migrated to Greece many centuries before the dawn of modern Albanian nationalism. The Arvanites of Greece were not involved in the process of Albanian nation-building and cannot be included in that project, for the simple reason that Greece is the only nation they have known in modern times.</dd>

<dd>You are quite right that English is a West Germanic language, but this is not the same thing as saying that it is a <i>variety of German</i>. The problem lies in the lack of a neutral blanket term covering the entire language family. Based on the historical evidence, <i>Arvanitic</i> would be the appropriate equivalent term to <i>Germanic</i>.</dd>
<dd>The Irish situation is indeed interesting, but not quite analogous to what we are discussing here. The Arvanites came to Greece five hundred years ago and settled alongside the native Greek-speaking population, being gradually absorbed by the majority as has happened to immigrants around the world throughout recorded history. Your implication that the Arvanites would have chosen a distant Albanian identity had they been "allowed" to is entirely hypothetical and rather far-fetched, IMHO. In any case, Wikipedia is <i>descriptive</i>, not <i>prescriptive</i>, and the reality <i>today</i> is that, for whatever reason, the Arvanites identify as Greeks, not Albanians. They are not some poor, isolated, oppressed minority. They have participated fully and actively in the process of Greek nation-building, rising to the highest echelons of the Greek establishment and society. You are perhaps unaware of the numerous Arvanite prime ministers of Greece who spoke Arvanitic at home and with fellow Arvanites and never hid their distinctive Arvanitic identity. Describing them as "ethnic Albanians" would be as absurd as describing the modern descendants of the Anglo-Saxons in England as "ethnic Germans" and those of the Normans as "ethnic Frenchmen".--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 13:47, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm fully aware of the contribution made by Arvanites to the process of nation building. I'm also fully aware that in his books, Irish-born British ambassador to Greece, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Wyse_d1b7.html" title="Thomas Wyse">Thomas Wyse</a>, repeatedly refers to the Arvanites and their language. During his relatively long period in office in Greece, he toured the countryside, visting many villages where Arvanitic was the only language spoken. That was in 1850s. What interests me is the decline of the spoken language and my point with Irish was that government and education policy had a lot to do with that, as well as assimilationist trends among the Arvanites themselves. This process was certainly accelerated with the formation and development of the modern Greek state, a state which tends to single out the "Hellenic" heritage as the only heritage worth talking about in this part of the world. I never said that Arvanites were oppressed, nor have I claimed they were Albanians. Vlachs, Slavs, and others have by and large were absorbed into the majority culture but this was not always by choice as you suggest. We've far more in common than you think, and had I a vote in this country, I'd vote for the same party as youself.</dd>

<dd>The Greeks are by no means unique in having "singled out" a particular heritage around and upon which they have built a modern nation. In fact, that is how most if not all modern nations have been formed, especially in Europe, Éire included. There are few truly multicultural or plurinational states, and the ones that <i>are</i> have generally not enjoyed a great deal of success. <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> was perhaps the most tragic example of all, but <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> are not immune to the real possibility of dissolution either. Multiculturalism only seems to work either in relatively new nations with no ancient roots, like the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, where cultural differences are suppressed in the melting pot anyway, or <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, where one group predominates and all others are too small to challenge the dominant national culture in any serious way. <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, on the other hand, is in a state of perpetual crisis vis-à-vis <a href="../../../q/u/%C3%A9/Qu%C3%A9bec.html" title="Québec">Québec</a>, despite Ottawa's best efforts to promote a bilingual, bicultural and ultimately binational state. That is not to say of course that European countries cannot accept and integrate people from other parts of the world, but it is unlikely that the French will accept that they should surrender their Frenchness, <i>par exemple</i>, in order to accommodate the newcomers. It appears that people will always put their tribe before the common good of mankind, so getting them to feel they belong to the <i>same</i> tribe has been seen as desirable at least since the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the dawn of nationalism. In the case of Greece, foreign populations have been assimilating as Greeks since time immemorial, even before the creation of the modern Greek state and its supposedly coercive assimilationist policies. Indeed, the Arvanites actively fought for Greek independence and were among the founders of the new state. Perhaps they shouldn't have, but that is an endless and ultimately futile argument. <i>They did</i>.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 16:21, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

There is obviously no shortage of speakers of that language in Greece nowadays, many of whom would be more than qualified to carry out such a task.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 16:45, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that while Theathenae has the best intentions his edits are too POV. I have provided references from various respectable sources which clearly refer to Arvanitic as a variety of Albanian. I find it hard to believe that UNESCO, Encarta Encyclopaedia <i>and</i> Ethnologue are wrong ant Theathenae is right. He may be, but he still hasn't proved his point. His statement that <i>Arvanitic has developed separately from Tosk Albanian and has been heavily influenced by Greek over the course of the past five centuries, to the extent that it is today considered a separate language by speakers and linguists alike</i> is just untrue. There is no reference whatsoever to suggest that Arvatitic speakers and linguists view it as a separate language from Albanian. So far, Theathenae has indicated that he is not willing to cooperate and seems unwilling to understand that I am not prepared to accept only his word for such a questionable claim while respectable sources say the exact opposite. I do hope that he is willing to cooperate to find a truthfual and impartial solution. REX 13:51, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>MATIA I believe it. But if it can't be proved then it shouldn't be included in an encyclopaedia. REX 13:57, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that it should be pointed out that one nations language being another nations language is not impossible. The Flemings of Belgium speak a language called Flemish which could accuratly be called Dutch which is the national language of the Netherlands. In fact on the page <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> it is discribed as Dutch. Are we by calling the language of the Flemings Dutch denying their right to nationhood and self-determination? REX 14:05, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you believe it then why did you remove that phrase? I 've mentioned before that I have a lot friends who are Arvanites. One of them told me that he would bring me a book about Arvanites, but unfortunately he is too busy these days and we haven't yet met. I'd suggest if you believe it to check for sources that verify or deny it.

<dd>Oh REX can't you see you are going in circles, round and round and again on the same questions? Did anyone dispute that Tosk and Arvanitic have similarities? I even found a source (ethnologue) that verifies that. Before some years that Arbanon river was regarded as the reason of the name Albania. But now Arbanon river is thought by scholars (I think Bambiniotis is one of them) as the root-word for Arvanites and Albanian scholars support that Albania derives from Alps (or something similar, I can't remember exactly). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 17:26, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do those examples prove other than the obvious, namely that they are related languages? Shall I start posting <i>identical</i> examples of Serbian and Croatian and start agitating for Croatian to be defined as a dialect of Serbian? Your dismissal of Anna Comnena for no reason other than her Greekness is, for want of a better word, absurd, as we simply cannot afford to ignore the precious few mediaeval sources we have at our disposal. By the same token, we should ignore your sources because they are in English and because they ignore what the Arvanites call themselves and their language. If anyone had <i>bothered</i> to ask the Arvanites, I'm sure the results would have been very different. Your sudden concern for the sanctity of the UN is rather amusing, especially considering your performance at <a href="../../../r/e/p/Talk%7ERepublic_of_Macedonia_2460.html" title="Talk:Republic of Macedonia">Talk:Republic of Macedonia</a>.

<p>My dear friends, before we start worrying about Serbian and Croatian lets concentrate a little on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a>. This language is made up of various dialect with enormous differences between them. Each of these dialects is referred to as a variety of Chinese. If we follow your way of thinking then that would be inappropriate because each of these dialects was never called Chinese. In fact Chinese is a term which was coined for all of them on the unification of China. Before that they were languages in their own right and some people still consider them to be so. The fact that Anna Comnena was speaking Greek in her works is of much significance because all we learn from her works was that then the <i>Greek</i> name for these people was <i>Arbanoi</i>, not the name that they used for themselves (imagine saying that the Hungarian name for <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> is Ungaria because that is what it is called in Greek, the Hungarian name for Hungary is Magyaroszag). So the fact that you say that they called themselves Arbëror is just guesswork. We have no idea what they called themselves. What is imporatant here is that credible sources (ie UNESCO) refer to Arvanitic as an Albanian dialect. Why can't we? All you do is just keep changing the subject and refusing to answer the question: Why can't we refer to the language the same way that UNESCO, Encarta and Ethnologue do? If you answer this question, the going around in circles as you call it MATIA will cease. REX 18:18, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the real question is <i>why</i> are you so dogmatically <i>obsessed</i> with <i>explicitly</i> defining Arvanitic as Tosk Albanian, when you know very well how the Arvanites feel? It is entirely possible to say essentially the same thing, but in a more subtle way that doesn't offend the Arvanites' sensibilities. Remember the Helsinki report: <i>Arvanites are those whose mother tongue is Arvanitika (name in Greek - Αρβανίτες)/ Arberichte (name in their language); most linguists use the word Albanian for that language, but the community loathes its use, and it is therefore advisable that this sensitivity be taken into consideration unless researchers and/or human and minority rights activists do not mind alienating the very community they are studying</i>. Nothing in your sources precludes my more nuanced wording, whereas the source I cite explicitly rebuffs yours.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 18:51, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps you should write to the UN, Ethnologue and Encarta telling them that they are wrong whereas you are right. My sources were compiled by professionals. They know what they were doing and this proves that the scientific establishment views Arvanitic as a dialect of Tosk. Even the Helsinki report implies that researchers and/or human and minority rights activists have referred to Arvanitic as an Albanian dialect. If you are so so concerned about the validity of the Helsinki Report how can you explain that it says the following:<br />
<i>The first Christian <b>Albanian'</b> migrations to what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when <b>Albanians</b> were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 &amp; 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by <b>Albanians</b> (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Muslim Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these <b>Albanians</b> are the ancestors of modern-day Arvanites in Central and Southern Greece</i>. Are all those references to Albanians <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>? You seem to think that they were called something else, what was it? Oh yes, Arbëror (you didn't prove it mind you). The Helsinki report also doesn't seem to have a problem referring to the ancestors of the Arvanites as Albanians does it? Does that not mean that the language of the Arvanites' ancestors was Albanian given that their ancestors were called Albanians. Over the years the language of the descendants of these Albanians evolved into the four major dialects: Tosk, South of the Shkumbini River; Gheg North of the Shkumbini River; Arbëreshe in Italy and Arvanitic in Greece. REX 19:24, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll say it again. If UNESCO can call Arvanitic an Albanian dialect, so can Wikipedia. Even your quote from the Helsinki Report: <i>most linguists use the word Albanian for that language</i> proves that Arvanitic can be called Albanian. You are just trying to get politics involved aren't you? Wikipedia should be neutral like UNESCO. If all Arvanites resented the term Albanians then some of them wouldn't use the term Shqiptar to describe themselves (Helsinki report). You didn't really rebuff my arguments, did you?

<p>You have run out of arguments and you are now falling back on that old gambit. That is just your POV anyway (that it is Albanian nationalism).

<dd>We can say that Arvanitic belongs to the same language family as Albanian without deliberately offending the Arvanites as you wish to do. The sources you cite were most likely unaware of the Arvanites' sensitivities on the issue, but you have no excuse. Such a stance can only be motivated by Albanian nationalism. Your sources do not negate my wording, as I am not changing the essence of what is being said.

<p>Don't be silly, you don't know that all Arvanites resent being called Albanians. Some of them wouldn't describe themselves as Shqiptar if that was so, despite the fact that Greek extremists would like to believe the reverse. I am proposing that we use UNESCO's wording, Ethnologue's wording and Encarta's wording, whereas you are proposing something unheard of. Something entirely without references.

<p>User:REX's postiton: The Encarta and UNESCO Reports refer to Arvanitic as Arvanitika <b>Albanian</b> and the Helsinki report says that most linguists call this language Albanian. So obviously the language is still classed as a form of Albanian. The UNESCO Report also calls Arvanitic a <i>diaspora <b>dialect</b> of Albanian</i>. I think that it is clear now that Wikipedia policies <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> and especially <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> (this one requires us to use only sources, regardless of what we can demonstrate on our own) instruct us to say that Arvanitic is a dialect of Albanian. But, because I am a nice guy, I will only insist on saying that Arvanitic is a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">variety</a> of Albanian, because by calling Arvanitic a dialect, that means that we are asking for trouble as the entire <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> Greek <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">extremist</a> establishment will challenge this.

<p>Reading the RfAr that was just filed, if the issue is simply one of "language" vs. "dialect" then the best example of a compromise I've seen so far is the set of articles on the Chinese languages/dialects, for example <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin (linguistics)</a>. Note how the page title deviates from the standard conventions (e.g. <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French language</a>, not French (linguistics)). This is deliberate, in order to simply avoid the issue of having to define Mandarin as a dialect of Chinese or as a Chinese language. This is an example of an issue that is unresolved in reality and that we cannot expect Wikipedia to resolve. If that is indeed the issue here as well, it's best to describe the situation in neutral terms ("linguistic variant" or "variety"), and then simply state that there is a debate and describe what it is about. Again, <b>we do not need to settle real-world debates here</b>. Our task is to take one step back and describe them in neutral terms. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 13:50, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My saying that Arvanitic is a language but to refer to it as a variety is to compromise with you. UNESCO refers to Arvanitic as a diaspora dialect of Tosk Albanian. I could easily insist that we use that. It wouldn't be too hard given that you have no evidence whatsoever to support your claims that Arvanitic is a language. Take it thie way.

<dl>
<dd>The case of modern Chinese (and also modern Arabic) is very complex and it is highly POV to declare that Mandarin is a dialect of a larger Chinese language. That POV certainly exists and deserves to be documented, but it is politcally and culturally charged. That's why the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin (linguistics)</a> is very careful when dealing with this issue and avoids taking a position either for or against dialect or language status, while mentioning the diverging popular vs. academic uses of the term. If you cannot reach an agreement in the case of Arvanitic, I suggest you follow a similar approach where you avoid taking sides, and merely describe what the various positions are without singling out any of them as "correct". --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 23:42, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The present Albanian language is Tosk. The phrase Arvanitic shares a common origin with Tosk is correct. Tosk and Arvanitic developped seperately for the last 5 or 8 centuries.

<p>MATIA, why do you change the subject by falsly claiming that I make personal attacks and that I don't care for the Arvanites' history and language? You cannot prove your statement that Arvanitic is a separate language from Albanian. That is why? I have read the entire talk pages <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanites_53e1.html" title="Talk:Arvanites">Talk:Arvanites</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanitic_language_720d.html" title="Talk:Arvanitic language">Talk:Arvanitic language</a> and I find no reason whatsoever not to call Arvanitic a dialect of Albanian. I have found many reasons to call it a dialect of Albanian. As UNESCO's Report goes <i>Arvanitic (or Arvanitika Albanian to use the dialect's proper name) is a dialect of Tosk Albanian</i>. Nothing that you say can rebuff this. I am willing to not push to make the POV name for the article <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> use the more NPOV name <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a>, which can be done I remind you as Ethnologue and UNESCO refer to it this way while there are no credible sources to support its current name, but I INSIST on not distorting the facts. Credible sources (UNESCO) refer to Arvanitic as a dialect of Albanian. That is why WP shall follow suit and say <i>Arvanitic is a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">variety</a> of Tosk Albanian</i>. See variety, not <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>. That is for your benefit. That in conjunction with the fact that I am not pushing to call Arvanitic <i>Arvanitika Albanian</i> (which CAN be done I remind you) proves that I am not all bad (from your point of view at least).

<li>They will say that <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Comnena_d65e.html" title="Anna Comnena">Anna Comnena</a> says that the ancestors of the Modern Tosks and Arvanites called themselves <i>Arbëror</i> (ie Arvanites) and that the common origin which they insist was the common ancestor of both the modern Tosks and Arvanites were in fact called Arvanites. This is not true, because Anna Comnena was writing in Greek, so all we learn from her accounts is that the Greek name for these people was <i>Arbanitai</i>, not the name they used for themselves. Imagine saying that the Hungarian name for <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> is <i>Ungaria</i> because that is what it is called in Greek; the Hungarian name for Hungary is in fact <i>Magyaroszag</i>. Therefore their claim that the common ancestors called themselves Arbëror is plainly ludicrous because we really have no idea what they called themselves. Their claim that they used the name Arbëror is plain guesswork.</li>
<li>They will say that we can't call the ancestors of the Arvanites Albanians because they weren't called Albanians then and therefore it would be an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a>. According to the Helsinki Report:<br />
<i>According The first Christian <b>Albanian</b> migrations to what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when <b>Albanians</b> were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 &amp; 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by <b>Albanians</b> (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Muslim <b>Albanian</b> migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these <b>Albanians</b> are the ancestors of modern-day Arvanites in Central and Southern Greece</i>.<br />
Are all those references to Albanians <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>? They seem to think that they were called something else, what was it? Oh yes, <i>Arbëror</i> (they didn't prove it though). The Helsinki report also doesn't seem to have a problem referring to the ancestors of the Arvanites as Albanians does it? The Helsinki report was written by professionals who do call the ancestors of the Arvanites Albanians. So we have MATIA and Theathenae claiming that we can't call the ancestors of the Arvanites Albanians (they couldn't prove why. They said something about them been called Arbëror but that is pure guesswork isn't it) and we have the professional linguists who do call the ancestors of the Arvanites Albanians. Who should we listen to? The professionals of course!</li>
<li>They will say that Ethnologue calls Arvanitic <i>a language of Greece</i>. What you all should know here is that Ethnologue refers to all languages and dialects as languages. It even refers to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_language.html" title="Cantonese language">Cantonese</a> as separate languages of China. We know that this isn't true because the Chinese government calls these <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialects.html" title="Dialects">dialects</a> of on language <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>. Anyway ethnologue also says <i>Gheg Albanian a language of Serbia and Montenegro</i> and <i>Flemish a language of Belgium</i>. We know that all this is quite inaccurate. Unless of course Gheg is a separate language form Albanian and Flemish is a separate language from Dutch.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know now that <b>MATIA and Theathenae have no sources to support their arguments they are just asking us to accept their word over that of UNESCO</b>. Their entire Greek extremist theory collapses and becomes a sham. The only true and NPOV way to phrase it is to use the way that <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> uses, Arvanitic is a diaspora dialect of Tosk Albanian.</p>
<p>MATIA and/or Theathenae will probably claim that I am putting words into their mouths. Here is some evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theathenae: The evidence that this parent language was called Arvanitic lies in the Byzantine sources dating from the Middle Ages. According to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html#Origin_and_history_of_the_name" title="Albania">Albania#Origin and history of the name</a>: We first learn of the ancestors of the modern Albanians in their native land as the Arbanites of Arbanon in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Comnena_d65e.html" title="Anna Comnena">Anna Comnena</a>'s account (Alexiad, IV) of the troubles in that region caused in the reign of her father Alexius I Comneus (1081-1118) by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Normans</a>. In their own language, they called themselves Arbërór, which is still what the Arvanites of Greece call themselves today, in contrast to the modern Albanians who call themselves Shqipëtarë instead. Nevertheless, it is not my desire to impose the Arvanitic label on modern Tosk Albanian, despite the mediaeval sources that would support such a thesis. I am simply opposed to applying the "Tosk Albanian" label to Arvanitic, when in fact Arvanitic is the older and more historically accurate term. Describing modern Arvanitic as a variety of Tosk Albanian is an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a>: a modern <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnonym.html" title="Ethnonym">ethnonym</a> is being applied retrospectively to the language of a people who migrated to Greece many centuries before the dawn of modern Albanian nationalism. The Arvanites of Greece were not involved in the process of Albanian nation-building and cannot be included in that project, for the simple reason that Greece is the only nation they have known in modern times.</li>
<li>MATIA: Perhaps you should check Anna Comnene that Theathenae mentioned.</li>
<li>MATIA: I cited Ethnologue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously certain genaralisations have been made eg Theathenae does not mention ethnologue but this is a list of their collective arguments and I have demonstrated that their so-called sources are just jokes. They have no real basis to their arguments and are trying to promote something which seems sucpiciously like Greek extremism. That seems to be the way their mind seems to be moving. Why else would the reject UNESCO's statement in favor of a totally unjustifiable one of their own (<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>). Wikipedia policies <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> however dictate that only data with sources can be used. Sadly their wording CANNOT be used and if they try to enforce it without credible sources (<a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>) they will be guilty of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_spot_vandalism_bdf4.html" title="Wikipedia:How to spot vandalism">Vandalism</a> and that will be dealt with under Wikipedia's diciplinary procedures. I therefore urge them with all the sincerety at my command to drop this ridiclulous argument of theirs and stop wasting everybody's time. I hope that they will cooperate.

<p>Folks, please try to keep the discussion productive. In fact, I don't think additional debate will get you out of the current stalemate. Repeating myself: it is not our collective job to determine which POV is the "correct" one. This is not about who is "right" and who is "wrong". All relevant points of view should be discussed fairly and neutrally, but Wikipedia cannot and need not endorse any particular POV. I think the best way forward would be for you guys to make an inventory of the various points of view: please describe everyone's position in the "Dispute resolution" section above in a neutral, impartial fashion without making any value judgements, threats, snide remarks, etc. The faster you work this out, the sooner you can get back to editing the article itself.

<dd>A corollary: This isn't a game where you "win" by "discrediting" the most sources or refuting the most arguments. On the contrary, please respect everyone's opinions. We first need a list of what the various positions are. We're in the early stages of sorting this out, and don't want to throw out any a priori reasonable point of view. You can talk (in a civil manner) about the various points of view later, but first we need to identify everyone's positions without commenting on them.

<p>This is getting ridiculous. I wouldn't bet my last <b>penny <i>that MATIA and Theathenae have the guts to answer my statement above or to defend their position. I just proved their arguments to be totally baseless and factually inaccurate. MATIA will no doubt start complaining like he/she did on MarkSweep's talk page but he/she cannot defend what he/she wnats to say. It has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Arvanitic is a variety of Tosk.

There is no evidence there whatsoever to suggest that Arvanitic is a language in its own right. It just says that Arvanitic speakers and Gheg speckers can't understand each other. This is MATIA's tactic: to imply that he/she has evidence while in reality he/she doesn't. I ask now openly: prove to me here and now why we can't use UNESCO's phrasing? Are they wrong and you are right? This is just MATIA's POV. MATIA's deliberate violation of Wikipedia policy.

<p><a name="Fresh_Proposal" id="Fresh_Proposal"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fresh Proposal</span></h2>
<p>I have taken the liberty of drafting a fresh proposal in the interests of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a> and I sincerely hope that the disputing parties will take a few minutes to consider it and if they wish me to drop this proposal or make amendments I will require <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">conclusive evidence why</a>.</p>
<p>My objections are in reference to the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html#Demographics" title="Arvanites">demographics section</a>. I am proposing to replace what is said with the following:</p>
<p><i>Arvanites are predominantly Greek Orthodox in religious adherence. Their language, Arvanitic is a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">variety</a> of Tosk Albanian and has been heavily influenced by Greek over the course of the past five centuries. The language is in decline, partly due to emigration from Arvanitic-speaking villages to the Greek-speaking cities and partly due to its non-recognition by the Greek state: it has no legal status and is not taught in public schools.</i></p>
<p><i>Like the rest of the Greek population, Arvanites have been emigrating from their villages to the cities and especially to the capital Athens, which, incidentally, was populated by many Arvanites in the early 1800s, before becoming the Greek state's capital.</i></p>
<p>What is said above is entirely NPOV. It aknowledges the proven by Ethnologue, UNESCO and Encarta fact but still grants a slight concession to MATIA and Theathenae by referring to Arvanitic as a language (this is allowed because Ethnologue refers to all languages and dialects as languages). Other NPOV proposals are welcome but it has to be proven beyond reasonable doubt that what is said is endorsed by the scientific estblishment (like mine above). I now urge MATIA and Theathenae with all the earnestness at my command to consider this proposal carefully and to propose amendements or even to reject it only in the case that they have found a reasonable source saying what they want to say. If you don't have respectable sources and proceed in implementing your POV onto the article you will have violated Wikipedia policies <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> REX 11:12, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll provide you with sources later, but since Mr Tapani Salminen uses at least three times the term language and once the term dialect, you can consider this as my first source. We must have in our minds that his research on <b>Arvanitika language</b> is very poor (see <b>nothing</b>, or compare with reports for other languages on the official site).<br />
<b>COPYRIGHT</b>: unesco's red book is copyrighted by mr Tapani Salminen, and can be used only for personal use. I've copied it partially (compare dots with external link) here, so we can read it, and after we discuss it and agree with our interpretations of unesco's red book, I could erase these data from my comment. Probably the way I wrote it, with the usage of dots, is on the edge of fair-use (I didn't copy the whole red book, just a small segment, I am mentioning the source and the copyright holder, so I believe it's a reference and not a copy-vio).</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 23:21, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>MATIA, I suggest that you read the article <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>. It defines language as: <i>a system of finite arbitrary symbols combined according to rules of grammar for the purpose of communication. Individual languages use sounds, gestures and other symbols to represent objects, concepts, emotions, ideas, and thoughts</i>. Therefore <i>any</i> dialect can be called a language (ie form of speech) whereas you want to define Arvanitic as a separate language from Albanian altogether. That is why it calls Pontic Greek a <i>diaspora dialect of Attic Greek</i> but also refers to it as a language. If we do not make it perfectly clear in the article that the Arvanitic language is classed as a <i>diaspora dialect of Albanian</i> (a true fact) we will be supressing the truth. I don't understand. Are you rejecting my proposal? Because I also refer to Arvanitic as a language there. REX 08:24, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>REX, I had accepted the phrase <i>Arvanitic is an Indo-European language sharing a common origin with the Albanian Tosk dialect</i>, I find the phrases <i>Their language, Arvanitic has developed separately from Tosk Albanian and has been heavily influenced by Greek over the course of the past five centuries, to the extent that it is today considered a separate language by speakers and linguists alike.</i> neutral and more explanatory, and I would <b>suggest</b> an addition like <i>Arvanitika language belongs to the same language family as Albanian Tosk</i>. You have been arguing very intensely the last days that Arvanitic is a dialect not a language. And today you say it is a language and want to mention it as <i>diaspora</i>. Check your <i>fresh proposal</i> and you'll see no mention of diaspora. Tell me please, are Arvanitika a language or a dialect? And please share your thoughts about my comments on UNESCO's red book. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 08:52, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not mentioning it as a diaspora dialect for YOUR benefit (if you like we can mention it that way). The UNESCO report clearly says that this language is a diaspora dialect of Tosk Albanian, not a separate language. You are distorting the facts. Arvanitic is not considered a separate language by speakers and linguists alike. This phrase is just POV. There are no sources to suggest any such thing.</p>
<p><b>I ask you now a simple question: <i>Is Arvanitic a diaspora dialect of Tosk Albanian?</i> If you say NO, you are contradicting UNESCO without sources (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>), if you say yes, this whole discussion shouldn't be happening because we are agreeing anyway.</b> Also, ARE YOU ACCEPTING MY PROPOSAL OF REJECTING IT?

<p>MATIA, I don't get your point above. I expect you to tell me if you accept or reject my proposal, unless of course there are some questions that you would like to ask. In those circumstances I will only be too happy to answer them, but the questions have to be comprehendable. You can't say something like why: do you say thet I don't have sources? I do have sources, check <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanitic_language_720d.html" title="Talk:Arvanitic language">Talk:Arvanitic language</a> (this is just a fictional example). It would have to be drawing my attention to the specific points that you are raising. So in any questions you may have, ask the question and <i>quote</i> anything relevant instead of saying <i>look what I wrote above</i>. If you do in the end reject my proposal, please explain it in a few paragraphs begining in something like: <i>I reject REX's proposal beacuse ...</i>. So, having said that, let's discuss the Red book. (Also, don't you dicipline me again, when Theathenae behaves in that way you don't diciplice him.

<p>I am assuming that you are suggesting that the Red Book's report on Arvanitika Albanian is questionable because the author does not have many sources. All he has is <i>published and unpublished material (of the language): little</i>. I believe that he compiled the report based on the <i>little</i> published material he could find. What is important here is that we can rest assured that even that little information he could find about the language was vetted very carefully because he knew that every time there was a dispute over the status of the language, the researchers would go straight to his report and his report would be challenged. I also believe that you should note that I am not insisting on calling Arvanitic a diaspora dialect of Tosk Albanian (something that we would be justified in doing according to WP policies <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>), but calling it a variety of Tosk Albanian. <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Variety (linguistics)">Variety (linguistics)</a> has a good ring to it: we are not using the very strong word <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> but we are neither classing it as a langusge in its own right (this is not endorsed by any group of linguists that we can find references from). Even Ethnologue refers to what we call Arvanitic as Arvanitika Albanian. (I'll suspend Encarta for now because you haven't subscribed. You can if you like, the first two months are free). I mean, they both can't be wrong. We can't say that Arvanitic is a language in its own right because it would be a violation of WP policy (read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> please). My proposal above has it in the most truly suttle way possible (the links with Albanian are not overly emphasised, nor are they severed altogether). What is said is true (accoring to my sources). I can't find anything to suggest that Arvanitic is a language in its own right. REX 11:36, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> and his hypocrisy</span></h3>
<p>MATIA, I am afraid your "holier than thou" hypocritical attitude will not help you here. I also feel obligated to tell you that there is no point in your researching in the library. According to Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> your sources must be in English. Also, they should be <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>, this means that books which may transmit the author's POV should be avoided (suggestion from personal experience: avoid books published by Γέρου <i>Yéru</i> they are utterly POV, they claim that the Arvanites are descendants of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelasgians.html" title="Pelasgians">Pelasgians</a> who lived in the are which is now Greece them moved the to the area which is now Albania, transmitted their language to the ancestors of the Albanians then returned to Greece during the Middle Ages). I myself have found references to the Arvanites in my local library: mostly calling Arvanitic a dialect of Albanian (check Encyclopaedias Britannica, Webster and Hutchinson). Why do you not accept what UNESCO says: <i>Arvanitic is a dialect of Tosk Albanian</i>? It is true isn't it? I know it is not what <i>you</i> would like the truth to be because it conflicts with your perception of the Arvanites (ie your POV). And MATIA, for the last time, you do not have the authority to discipline me. Your pretending to be offended is just one of your tactics. Well MATIA, I have news for you. We have all got used to your tactics: saying that you are looking for sources because you say that you don't believe what UNESCO says and when we ask you how the search is going you say that you are offended. When you make fun of me I don't say that I am offended. As far as I am concerned, UNESCO is the authority on these subjects and no tricks on your part will ever change the fact that they call Arvanitic a dialect of Tosk. Even if you were to find some obscure book which calls Arvanitic a separate language from Tosk Albanian it is highly unlikely that they are likely to be right an UNESCO and the most respected encyclopaedias wrong.

<p>Yes, but you can't prove that it is untrue. All evidence suggests that Arvanitic is a variety of Tosk. What should we do? Accept your word for it lest I disobey the long awaited sources which may never come. We shall make the appropriate edits so that the articles conforms to WP policy and the sources we already have. What should we do. Make the article say the opposite because some sources we haven't found yet require this. When the sources you promised are produced then we may be able to say what you want, but to say it now would be a violation of WP policy. Also, you are not complaining about me because you have no evidence.

<dd>Let's look deeper, shall we? No one says (except of course Greek extremists) that Arvanitic (or to use the name that Ethnologue and UNESCO use, Arvanitika Albanian) is <i>considered a separate language by speakers and linguists alike</i> which is what you want to say. This has not been proven, so I removed that obviously POV reference from the article. UNESCO says that <i>Arvanitika Albanian is a diaspora dialect of Tosk</i>, its calling it a language is irrelevant read <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> to see why. It does not refer to it as a separate language from Albanian. I've been a nice guy so far but it is now time to be nasty (from the Greek extremist point of view). I now insist that the article <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> be moved to <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika_Albanian_507d.html" title="Arvanitika Albanian">Arvanitika Albanian</a>. This is the name by which UNESCO and Ethnologue refer to the language. What? Are they wrong and the unbelievably arrogant Theathenae and MATIA right? Not a chance. Also, given that UNESCO refers to Arvanitika Albanian as a diaspora dialect of Tosk we shall say that also. Anyway, Encarta, Britannica and the Hutchinson Encyclopaedia mention an Albanian dialect spoken in Greece. Gee, I wonder what that is. You should also not that the Helsinki Report says that <i>most linguists use the name Albanian for their language.</i> I'm afraid that <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> Greek <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremist.html" title="Extremist">extremist</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> POV will ever become part of a neutral Encyclopaedia.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">What do you think that you are doing?</span></h3>
<p>I've been doing some reading on this subject after REX's e-mail where he was pleading for help. In my view, MATIA and Theathenae are vandalising the articles. It is perfectly clear that this language is a dialect of Tosk and no word games on their part will change that fact. Actually I am puzzled over what REX said. If UNESCO and Ethnologue use the name <i>Arvanitika Albanian</i> as the primary name for this language, then why isn't it being used in place of this somewhat artificial name <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a>? If you read <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> you will see that its list of alternative names is often challenged. In my opinion again, I believe that the name at the heading (Arvanitika Albanian) is the only appropriate name, which incidentally happens to be the name used by the UNESCO report. I don't know what REX, MATIA and Theathenae think that they are doing. You cannot pick and choose what parts of sources to use and which parts to ignore at your discretion. Wikipedia works based on neutrality (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>) and given that our primary sources call this language Arvanitika Albanian, then why isn't that name used? This other name lacks <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> as <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>'s alternative name lists are often challenged, therefore the name Arvanitika Albanian is obviously the NPOV name. If you read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> you will find that Wikipedia policy requires that you unconditionally accept what it verified in reliable sources providing that it is relevant. If you lot think that you can pick and choose which policies to accept and which parts of which sources to use based on your personal whims, then Wikipedia will become a hopelessly lame encyclopaedia. I sincerely hope that the three of you will mend your ways and behave like responsible adults. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandfatherJoe_7423.html" title="User:GrandfatherJoe">GrandfatherJoe</a> 13:27, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because no one here seems to be interested in any progress or have any good-faith whatsoever, obviously I shall have to start it (as usual, all the Greeks do is revert and then not be able to explain why):</p>
<ul>
<li>UNESCO calls this language a diaspora DIALECT of Tosk</li>
<li>ETHNOLOGUE calls this language Arvanitika ALBANIAN</li>
<li>The fact that Ethnologue and UNESCO refer to this language as a language makes no difference. If you all read <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> you will see that this is just a figure of speech. All forms of speech can be called languages. That doesn’t mean that they are languages in their own right. That is not said anywhere. Dialect is a very specific linguistic term.</li>
<li>Calling this language a variety of Albanian doesn't mean that modern-day Arvanites are Albanians. Are the Flanders of Belgium been called Dutch because their language, Flemish is called a dialect of Dutch?</li>
<li>I am trying to compromise. You have to understand that it would be a reasonable thing to do to call the language Arvanitika Albanian. UNESCO refers primarily to it in this way and so does Ethnologue. Also we could call the language a dispora dialect of Tosk. I am not insisting in doing so for YOUR benefit. I am insisting in calling Arvanitic a variety of Tosk and leaving it to be called Arvanitic language. In the interests of Good Faith.</li>
<li>(this is not personal, this is just how the situation seems to be from my point of view, you are welcome to draft an equivalent for your circumstances or comment on mine for anything that seems inaccurate to you, but be specific) I believe that you are promoting narrow-minded <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> Greek <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremist.html" title="Extremist">extremist</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>. You are all grouped together either as an anti-human rights organisation or as sockpuppets of a single user. You move from article to article pushing POV like you did in not only Talk:Arvanites, but in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Talk%7EMacedonian_Slavs_b999.html" title="Talk:Macedonian Slavs">Talk:Macedonian Slavs</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Talk%7EMegleno-Romanians_8c7c.html" title="Talk:Megleno-Romanians">Talk:Megleno-Romanians</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbanians_7b16.html" title="Talk:Albanians">Talk:Albanians</a> etc. Most of your arguments contradict the views of established bodies such as UNESCO and scholarly facts from well-viewed institutions such as Ethnologue, Britannica, Hutchinson etc. What you are promoting is entirely without precedent and usually emerges from <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. No scientific body endorses your claims but yet you see fit to violate Wikipedia policies <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> (your statements are not verifiable, mine are) and <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> (my statements come from neutral sources, G-d knows where yours come from). You also seem to see fit to ignore what UNESCO, Britannica, Ethnologue etc say in favour of your POV!</li>
<li>What is said now in the article, that Arvanitic evolved on its own and is now viewed as a separate language by linguists and speakers alike is the most POV statement I have ever seen! There is not even a molecule of truth in it. Most linguists view it as a dialect of Albanian (Helsinki report, UNESCO, Ethnologue, etc the endless list of sources). It did not evolve on its own except maybe for the last 200 years (according to the Helsinki report Arvanitic was referred to as Albanian before the establishment of the Greek state!)</li>
<li>I have done my best to compromise. I have an open mind; I want this dispute to be over with. I DON'T want to have to have the UNESCO link at the bottom of the page and the readers saying: “Hang on! This article says that Arvanitic is a separate language and UNESCO says that it is an Albanian dialect. What a load!”</li>
<li>I now ask a simple question: <b>What is wrong with saying: <i>their language Arvanitic is a variety of Tosk Albanian</i>?</b> It is ACCURATE. The world is not made to please you, but there is no way in that I will accept any other wording that does not have sources (reliable sources, WP policy requires it). I simply cannot accept your word for it, especially when SOURCES say the reverse.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">About REX's edit war</span></h3>
<p>Arvanitis and Arvanitika, are Arvanitic words. So if Arberor is correct (I don't remember but it may be), the correct phrase would be:<br />
Arvanites (Αρbε̰ρόρ, Arbërór or Arvanites in Arvanitika). Arvanites, Arvanitika, besha (μπέσα), phara (φάρα) and other are loan words from Arvanitika that are also used in Greek.<br />
Shqiptar is the Albanian word for Albanians.<br />
REX had said in the past that he is Arvanitis, and later that he is an Albanian. Well, he can be whatever he wants, or he can claim that he is whatever he wants. <b>But</b> if he was an Arvanitis he would know how they call themselves, and the same applies for Albanian. Why he claimed to be Arvanitis or Albanian, (or Greek before 3-4 months) I can't say. and I don't care. But forcing names or labels, even if he doesn't know he is wrong, cannot be accepted.<br />
I must also note that he continues to force his personal pov on <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> while there's no consensus for his edits.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some advice</span></h2>
<p>REX asked me for advice on how to proceed. He hasn't yet taken it, but I am still optimistic. I think it applies to all parties in this dispute, so I tweaked it a little so that it's more general and I present it here.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a difficult one. I think the key here would be to be patient and listen. Do you know why your opponent is so wedded to his theory, and what his objection is to your sources? Would they be amenable to a version of the article that described the true situation as debatable and gave both versions? You've all been arguing loudly and behaving abominably, so it may take a long time for everybody to calm down, but if you treat people with respect they are more likely to do the same to you. So again, be very patient. Show that you're not going to edit war, and make sure that other editors are clear that you intend to avoid further edit warring, but stand your ground in the talk page. At the same time, examine criticism of your points and don't be afraid to admit it if someone makes a good counter to a point you have made. The only way out of this is for a version to be written that everybody can live with, and the only way to that is for all parties to act reasonably. Start by making sure that you act reasonably and then wait patiently for others to respond to that. Maybe others who are now repelled by the fighting will change their minds and get involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do hope all will read this and take it to heart. Haranguing one another hasn't worked. It's time to listen, to show mutual respect, and to stop edit warring. Maybe if you listen more you'll find that you aren't so far apart after all.</p>
<p>In any case there is nothing to be gained by shouting at one another like this. You're all breaking Wikipedia policy, so if this case escalates you all have a lot to lose. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:23, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">language vs. dialect</span></h2>
<p>Thought it might be useful to have input from someone who knows something of linguistics and identifies with neither Greek nor Albanian. I haven't read all of this dispute, so forgive me if I'm repeating what's already been said.</p>
<p>There are three contradictory ways of distinguishing 'language' from 'dialect':</p>
<ul>
<li>One is that a 'language' is a standardized idiom with literature and governmental support, while a 'dialect' is nonstandard, and often by implication substandard and spoken by the uneducated. This usage is why people often become offended if their idiom is called a 'dialect'. This of course is a social/political and often discriminatory definition: the 'a language is a dialect with an army' position.</li>
<li>Another is the test of mutual intelligibility. Generally, if a speaker of idiom A, who has had no exposure to idiom B, moves to a B-speaking area and can pick it up in a couple weeks, then A and B are considered dialects of language C. By this definition, Chinese, German, and Arabic are not single languages, while Russian and Ukrainian are dialects of a single language. (I know one Ukrainian who says he speaks 'a dialect of Russian'). Of course, this is a very difficult standard to meet in many cases. For example, is Mixtec one language, or forty? There are very very few languages where controlled studies have been done to determine whether, say, a representative population from town A can converse at FSI level 3 with a representative population from town B. So, although this might seem the most objective and linguistically most justified definition, it doesn't always work well in practice.</li>
<li>A third is ethno-linguistic identity. That is, if two peoples consider their idioms to be separate languages, then they are, even if mutually intelligible. A good example of this is Hindi and Urdu, which are commonly considered separate languages despite the fact that speakers very often can't tell the difference if they're not told what someone is speaking. A more recent example is Bosnian. There are problems here too, of course. For example, many Macedonians are of the opinion that they speak the Macedonian language, but many Bulgarians consider it to be 'just' a dialect of Bulgarian. Usually in such cases it is the opinion of the speakers of an idiom that are more highly valued, but of course speaker opionion may also be sharply divided along political, religious, or class lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, very often the word 'language' is used ambiguously in the sense of 'idiom', without implying either a language-level or dialect-level relationship with another idiom. "The American language" etc.</p>
<p>So my 2 cents are that simply calling something a 'language' or a 'dialect' is not very informative. There often is no simple answer. Rather, if you wish to convey the essence of an idiom to your audience, you need to cover all bases: how is the idiom perceived by its speakers? how is it perceived by outsiders? how readily intelligible is it to related idioms? what kind of recognition does it enjoy? Different readers might be interested in the social aspect, linguistic aspect, or political aspect, and I don't think it should be our job to decide for them which they should consider. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 01:09, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In other words, Arvanitika is perceived by most of its speakers as the language of the Pelasgians, by some other of its speakers as an Albanian dialect, by the vast majority of influential lingusts (such as the ones who wrote Ethnologue, UNESCO report, Helsinki Report etc) as an Albanian dialect. As for the other aspects, they currently are nil. The language is spoken by a few thousand people who are in their eighties, and in thirty years or so, it will be a dead language or dialect. The Greek government's assimilaion policy (the one mentioned in the Human Rights report) will be complete. The Greek state has succeeded in killing yet another language or dialect, and culture.

<p>Let me get this straight.

<p>I believe that it is now perfectly clear that the above, in conjunction with the Helsinki Report and UNESCO and Ethnologue and Encarta and Britannica <b>Arvanitika is a dialect of Albanian regardless if <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> like it or not</b>.</p>
<p>Also, the Helsinki Report says that the Arvanites of northwestern Greece (Epirus and Western Macedonia) call themselves <b>Shqiptar</b></p>
<p>Also, Ethnologue says that there are 150,000 speakers of Arvanitika.</p>
<p>Can MATIA and Theathenae explain themselves, they have not provided ANY sources to support their edits, all they do is revert and then not be able to explain why.

But if you read BJ you'll see that Arvanitika (apart from the greek words) is closer to that "common origin" than modern Albanian. And Arvanites called their language Arvanitika during those last 6 (or howmany they are) centuries.</p>

<dd>You realize that comparing editors to potential assassins might be considered a personal attack, and result in you being blocked? (I haven't read the above comments to know whether this is tit for tat, but in the end it doesn't matter; that would just result in everyone getting blocked.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, the reason I'm here is that +MATIA has asked me to evaluate some of his sources for the dialect/language debate. (BTW, I have no interest in either Greek or Albanian. I once tried swimming to Greece, but never made it, so I haven't even been to the Balkans.) All the sources MATIA provided except one agreed that Arvanitika was an Albanian (Tosk) dialect. One called it a sister dialect to the Standard Albanian dialect; another said that it was more precisely a group of dialects, not a single dialect. The one exception used the word "variety", perhaps to avoid the issue. However, these were all based on narrowly linguistic conceptions of mutual intelligibility, not on ethnolinguistic conceptions of self identity. One source specifically brought this up, but didn't try to resolve the issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In cases where speakers of two mutually intelligible speech varieties consider themselves to speak different languages, as in the case of Malaysian and Indonesian, or standard Hindi and Urdu, or Serbian and Croatian, then this is usually spelled out explicitly. Anything less is misleading. Calling Arvanitika and Albanian separate languages contradicts normal linguistic criteria; calling them dialects of the same language ignores the ethnolinguistic facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How about something along the line of "Arvanitika and standard Albanian are mutually intelligible varieties of Tosk Albanian. However, the people have distinct ethnic identities. Arvanitika has been stronly influenced by Greek, and they consider their language to be distinct from Albanian"? I don't know if that's an improvement, but from what I understand I don't think it misstates the case.

<li>Dialect vs language:Pointless dillema. Read: <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">Dialect</a>. The creteria of distinguishing a language from a dialect in our case are to a large extent political. Some Albanians want to consider Arvanites as Albanians, so for <b>political</b> reasons they like to consider Arvanitica as a dialect of Albanian language. Greeks don't like that, and for <b>political</b> reasons like to consider that a different language. Has Albanian or Greek nationalism much to do with the language itself as a form of comunication? No.</li>
<li>Arvanites as a national minority: Some Albanians want to consider Arvanites as an Albanian unrecognised minority. They have to have a look at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">Nation</a> (<i>The nationals (the members of the "nation") are distinguished by a <b>common identity</b>, and almost always by a <b>common origin</b>, in the <b>sense of ancestry, parentage or descent</b></i>). Do Arvanites have a common identity? They ancestors maybe did. Do modern Arvanites and Albanians have a common identity? I don't think so. Do Arvanites and Albanians have a sense of same ancestry, parentage or descent? Some Albanians have that sense. Do Arvanites have that sense too? No. Someone belongs to a nation if he/she believes that he/she belongs to it. If he/she believes otherwise, he is not a member of that nation. Do Arvanites feel Albanians? No.</li>
<li>Reference to NGOs. Do these organisations have a "NPOV policy"? Can they make mistakes or "mistakes"?</li>
<li>Language-minorities. Some greeks and some albanians cannot ditinguish between a <i>minority language</i> and a <i>language of a minority</i>. A <i>minority language</i> is a language that is spoken less than another language. A <i>language of a minority</i> is a language used by a religious or another distinguishable minority. Turkish in Greece, Greek in Albania are languages of minorities. Arvanitica in Greece and Gheg in Albania are minority languages, because they are spoken by the minority of people.</li>
<li>Greeks disliking that Arvanites may have a common ancestry with Albanians: What's so bad about having a common ancestry with someone that belongs to another nation? Having a common ancestry with an albanian or a greek or a german <b>doesn't</b> make you an albanian or a greek or a german. See above (my second point).</li>
<li>Nationalism in the most stupid sense. Living in a specific country does nececerily mean that you have to accept and fight for what you are told (or not told) in school? Why does a Greek or an Albanian have to argue to support the "NPOV" facts he/she is told from the day he/she is born?--Mik2 20:10, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rex, no, not all linguists would call Arvanitike a dialect. Most linguists are concerned with the grist of a language (the grammar and such), and they would call A a dialect based on mutual intelligibility. However, there is also an entire field of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociolinguistics.html" title="Sociolinguistics">sociolinguistics</a>. There are many many linguists would do not try to reduce a language down to its grammar, as if it were some sterile abstraction that could exist outside the people who speak it. Their conceptions of language are often ethnolinguistic, and many of them might call A. a language. (I say <i>might</i>, because I don't know any linguists who refer to it at all!) As I said above, any responsible linguist would cover both sides of the issue. If Wikipedia tries to present A. as either a dialect or as a separate language, without any clarification, then yes we would indeed look foolish. We need to do <i>both</i>. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 20:15, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">User:Kwamikagami</a>, you write above that "calling Arvanitika and Albanian separate languages contradicts normal linguistic criteria". Would this also apply in the case of Croatian and Serbian, which have separate articles and are in the event much closer to each other in their modern forms than modern Arvanitic and modern Tosk Albanian? In my view, <i>separate</i> languages need not mean <i>unrelated</i> languages, as the Albanian nationalists here fear. We have already established that Arvanitic is separate from Albanian ethnolinguistically, because of the Arvanites' distinct identity. However, modern Arvanitic is also different enough from modern Tosk Albanian to be considered a separate language in a purely linguistic sense as well. Remember, they are only <i>partially</i> mutually intelligible according to Ethnologue. The best analogy would probably be the relationship between Castilian and Catalan or Portuguese, which share a common origin and are partially intelligible but are different enough to suffer communication breakdown. Franco considered Catalan to be a mere dialect of Spanish, of course, but the idea has fallen out of favour since. You are quite right to point out that the main problem here is the lack of interest by linguists, who have rather cursorily associated Arvanitic with Albanian but have failed to study the language in any meaningful depth.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 08:47, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I would say that Serbian and Croatian are one language in the narrow sense (and standard Hindi and Urdu, and maybe Spanish and Portuguese as well). They are closer than the various dialects of German, Japanese, or Igbo. (I don't like my phrase "normal linguistic criteria"; "narrow linguistic criteria" might have been better.) In fact, I know of one Ukrainian who says that he speaks a "dialect" of Russian, which Ukrainian certainly is in the narrow sense! By this same criterion, most linguists would say that Greek is not a single language, that Tsakonian and maybe Pontic are distinct enough to be considered separate languages. As for the intelligibility of Arvanitike, all I know is what I've read in the various sources mentioned above, which indicate that there isn't any real difficulty in communication. Of course, whether the authors are correct or not is another question. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 12:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I changed Arbëror and Shqiptar to Arbërorë and Shqiptarë because that is the plural form. It goes as follows: Arbëror (Arvanite man), Arbërore (Arvanite woman), Arbërorë (Arvanites). Also, Shqiptar (Albanian man), Shqiptare (Albanian woman), Shqiptarë (Albanians). It is important to note that final -ë is not normally pronounced in Albanian AND Arvanitic, but lengthens the penultimate vowel.</li>
<li>I removed the five centuries evolution theory, because it is supported by no sources and is highly unliely anyway (see Helsinki report).</li>
<li>I removed the Arvanitis and Arvanitissa, because there is no proof that that is their name in English (we could say that it is the Greek name though).</li>
<li>I added the modern to Tosk, to reflect the fact that the <i>Albanian immigrants</i> stil spoke Tosk (check the Brian Joseph pdf).</li>
</ul>
<p>I urge you to accept these changes, as this may sweeten me into accepting the article title <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a>. You cannot have everything - compromise. If you remove them, then I may initiate negotiations to move <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> somewhere else again.

<li>The term Arvanitis dates back to the byzantines and I think it's an arvanitic not a greek term, like Arberor - I'll proove these later</li>
<li>Since Arvanites left Arvanitia (their terms) let's say 500 years ago, and as Brian Joseph (among others) prove that Albanian has evolved since then and Arvanitika has kept some archaic forms and inherited some Greek elements - the two languages(or dialects or whatever anyone wants to call them) have developed seperatedly. Notice as well the distance in km (or miles). Back in 1500 AD they didn't have TV, internet, wikipedia etc (compare with Colombus, he discovered America and it wasn't known for decades)</li>
<li>While I agree with you about "Modern Tosk" (sic) I don't know if the word modern is ok or we should use something more apropriate</li>
<li>Check also my other response. Take care. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 10:26, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see your point:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know about Arvanitis. As I've said, we could say that it is the Greek name for them, but the Albanian Singular Masculin name is <b>Arvanit</b>, Albanian Singular Feminine is <b>Arvanite</b> and Albanian plural is <b>Arvanitë</b>, but i thought that we agreed that their names for themselves was Arbërorë.</li>
<li>I don't want to sound lika a parrot, but saying that it evolved on its own is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. In the Helsinki Report it indicates that the Arvanites and the Albanians were the same thing with only local differences <b>until</b> 1830 (well not in those exact words). Therefore, Arvanitic has not been isolated from the rest of Albanian for 500 years. This is a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearsay.html" title="Hearsay">hearsay</a> statement of mine now, but I know that the Arvanitic translation of the Bible (the one advertised in arvasyl.gr) is in fact a Tosk Albanian version (written in 18**, I can't remember the exact year) which was used by "Albanians" in Greece and Cameria, so you cannot say that all links had been severed. Without unquestionable evidence of a seperate evolution, I think that it would be best to avoid mentioning the whole thing.</li>
<li>"Modern Tosk" is so far, the best i can think of, except Brian Joseph uses Shqip. That is a little misleading in my opinion because Shqip (Modern Standard Albanian) is based on the Tosk dialect, but has a deep and apparent influence from Gheg. I would recommend that Shqip be used, the only problem is that it excludes all other Tosk (the real Tosk) dialects (ie Shqip is not even Tosk, it's almost artificial). Modern Tosk will suffice, I think. It's not the most pleasing of words, but it is true as all we know is that Arvanitic is seperate from Tosk Albanian <b>now</b>. When it became seperate is unknown. 500 years ago, 300 years ago, 5 years ago, who knows? Modern Tosk is quite vague as it could mean anything and therefore is true and accurate in all cases. See <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_English_2227.html" title="Modern English">Modern English</a> and see how many years back it dates. If that can be used, the modern Tosk certainly can be used.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin of name</span></h2>
<p>There's been rather extensive debate over the use of the name Shqipere &amp; variants, and I assume this is because such a name could be used to claim Albanian identity. However, Arvanitika itself means 'Albanian', so it's kind of a moot point. Besides, conceptions of names change. The name "English" no longer means German, for example, so what does it prove if Arvanitika means Albanian, or if some Arvanitika use the name Shqipere? That could be entirely independent of ethnic identity. (But then it might not be. I have no idea.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a> has this etymology for 'Albania':</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Albania</i> is the med.L. and general mod. name of the country, which is called <i>Shqipnija</i> by the inhabitants, who call themselves <i>Shqipetars</i>; in med.Gr. <i>Ἀλβανία</i>, with variants <i>Ἀλβανητία</i>, <i>Ἀρβανητία</i>, the inhabitants being called <i>Ἀλβάνοι</i>, <i>Ἀλ-</i>, <i>Ἀρβανῆτες</i> (in Turkish ARNAUT).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Notice the variants in <i>Ἀρβανητ-</i>. This is the root of <i>Arvenitika</i>. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:20, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are many related (or almost related) names Arnaut, Arbanitai, Arvanites, Albanitai, it's a big list and I 'll try to write it. If we stick to byzantine sources Arvanites and Albanians are both recorded. If we go back, then it's Ptolemy's Albanopolis and Arbon which seems related to Arbanitai, and Arvanitai.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">reverts</span></h2>
<p>Matia, if an admin blocks Zogu for violating 3RR, s/he will have to block you as well, for you are equally guilty. (Actually, you violated 3RR first.) They cannot block Zogy for vandalism, because Zogu has not been vandalizing the page. You may not agree with Z's edits, but that's a difference of opinion.</p>
<p>Zogu, I would suggest that you engage in discussion on this talk page to justify your edits. (For one thing, it is appropriate to link Arvanites to Arvanitika language, where the dialect/language debate is discussed. Linking to Albanian only might be construed as censorship. Also, you appear to be removing useful information, such as the history of the people and the status of their language. Repeated removal of information, without showing that it is incorrect, will be construed as vandalism and will get you blocked.) When a page is in dispute, as this one is, it is considered polite to discuss your ideas here first, and to try to work out any disagreements before you make changes. At the very least, you should give evidence for your opinions.</p>
<p>If the article as it now stands is the concensus version, then I suggest that everyone who supports it revert Zogu if s/he doesn't justify the changes. However, it would be wise to discuss it here. For example, Zogu says that the Arvanites belong to the Albanian rather than the Greek church. That should be easy to verify one way or the other. If there are repeated, unjustified reverts of consensus, then I or another admin might block the reverter for vandalism. However, that won't happen if both sides violate witiquette. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:05, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

A word of advice, don't oversuse the <b>don't vandalise</b> templates. I know it probably makes you feel important when you do, but if someone is not vandalising, then it is just a personal attack.

<dd>As Rex said - voilating 3RR and personal attacks. (I once saw someone get blocked for a <i>month</i> once in arbitration, merely for calling someone a troll!) I've called people vandals and trolls too when it probably wasn't justified, so I can relate, but still, it makes it hard to take action against one side if the other isn't squeaky clean. And as I said to Zogu, continual reverts without justification could be taken for vandalism, but that's only if the editor shows bad faith, and not just because a newcomer gets resentful when someone reverts their edits without discussion. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 09:36, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have said before, that I agree with Zogu's edits. That doesn't mean that I am going to promote them, personally I agree with them (except that bit about the church), but as you are so dogmatically obsessed with promoting your POV, what else can I do? I'll consent to your POV within limits. <b>However</b>, Arvanitic does NOT share a common origin with Tosk, it shares a common origin with modern Tosk (or as BJ calls it, Shqip. ie standard/literary Albanian) AND Arvanitic has NOT evelved on its own for the past five centuries.

<dd>I've come across articles and deleted three quarters of the material in them, because I thought it was wrong, unsupported, POV, irrelevant, etc. Sometimes I was right, but sometimes I was wrong. That in itself is not vandalism. It would be vandalism if I knew it were correct, and just didn't like it, or if I were following someone around and reverting them as a form of harassment. Now, if the history of the article has been confrontational, it's certainly considerate to try to figure out what's going on before making changes. But lacking tact isn't comparable to blanking an article and replacing it with YOU ALL SUCK! or the like.</dd>

<dd>Since Arvanitika is mutually intelligible with other forms of Albanian, and if you were to draw a family tree, A would be a sub-sub-branch of Albanian, it's entirely reasonable to say that it's not a separate language. Calling it a separate language is POV. Of course, if it's the POV of the speakers themselves, we need to respect that, and to report it. But not everyone is going to agree: <i>if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, ...</i> This could certainly be an honest difference of opinion. And even if you can't see how someone could possibly believe what they're saying, well, people sacrifice their lives for all sorts of crap that I couldn't imagine anyone taking seriously, so that's hardly evidence of dishonesty. To make a community work, we need to assume good faith on the part of other editors. Newcomers especially will take some time to settle in. Often they're kids who don't know how to work with someone who holds the opinion you do, because they've never had to do it before. It's only when they demonstrate bad faith, either through hostility or refusal to work together, that we take action. Or if we have evidence of fraud, say that the editor is a sockpuppet or the like. Otherwise it's best to invite them to come in and talk, and ask them to support their arguments. Even then, I've come across editors who were mentally incapable of supporting the simplest assertion with evidence, or incapable of understanding that anyone could honestly disagree with them, and while that's pathetic, it isn't dishonest. I don't see anything Zogu's done that's vandalistic. S/he's made changes that are unsupported, but not unreasonable. They may be wrong, but that's what discussion and references are for. I've told Z that deleting information without showing it to be wrong or unsupported needs to be done with care, and not repeated against consensus without at least discussing the evidence. Certainly if I contributed to an article by removing some stuff I thought was wrong, and were accused of being a vandal for it, I would be offended, and I would not be inclined to cooperate with the person who attacked me. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 19:04, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Saying they share a common origin with Tosk makes A sound like a cousin to Tosk, rather than a daughter, as if Albanian were comprised of three branches, Gheg, Tosk, and Arvanitic. I think that pretty clearly misrepresents the situation. I simply said that "the Arvanitic language is a form of Tosk Albanian". Readers can then look up Tosk and Albanian and decide for themselves what that means; it bypasses the language/dialect debate altogether, but without being misleading as to how close Arvanitic and Albanian are to each other. Then I said that A has "been under Greek influence for centuries". I don't <i>think</i> that's being contested (is it?), and of course maybe not all A dialects have been equally influenced by Greek. It also doesn't deny that A and other forms of Albanian may have continued to influence each other while Greek was influencing A. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 19:52, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note, though, that this article speaks of the Arvanitic <i>language</i>, not 'dialect'. Rather like Hindi/Urdu. Standard Hindi is a form of Urdu, and Standard Urdu is also a form of Urdu. Urdu is, in turn, a form of Hindi (in the broad sense). Hindi and Urdu are dialects of the same language in one sense, separate languages in another; sisters in one sense and daughters in another.

<p>That may be so, however, no Arvanitic language exists.

<dd>I don't agree. Yes, UNESCO calls it "a diaspora dialect of Tosk Albanian". As I've said, in the narrow linguistic sense, it's a dialect of Albanian. However, your third source says "Arvanitika is generally regarded as an endangered or even dying language". That alone refutes your argument. What you're saying is that Croatian, Ukranian, Macedonian, Indonesian, etc. are not and cannot be languages, because they're intelligible with something else. But culturally, socially, ethnolinguistically, they are separate languages. I don't know any Arvanites, but if they have a separate language identity, than most linguists would have no trouble speaking of the "Arvanitic language", even if a paragraph later they describe it as a "Tosk dialect". It's not an either-or proposition. I think the article should make clear that, as far as communication is concerned, it's a dialect of Albanian, but its speakers (some? many? all?) consider it to be a separate language, just as we would say for Croatian or Indonesian. At least, I assume we have evidence that Arvanitic speakers think of their idiom as being separate from Albanian? Or do they consider themselves to not be ethnically Albanian, but admit that they speak Albanian? <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 21:18, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, opinion is divided, even amongst Arvanites. In sourthern Greece, they say that they have nothing to do with the Albanians, whereas in northwestern Greece they call themselves Albanians and their language Albanian (the call themselves Arvanites in Greek though, see the infamous helsinki report).

<dd>I'd think it would make sense for them to use 'Arvanite', since that's Greek for Albanian, or a derivative thereof, regardless of their ethnic identity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If opinion is divided, there is less of a case for considering Arvanitic a separate language. But note that this is the case elsewhere as well. I know a Ukrainian who says Ukrainian is a "dialect" of Russian. There are non-nationalist Serbs and Croats who say they speak Serbocroatian. Plenty of Indonesians admit their language is Malay, and there are both "Hindi" and "Urdu" speakers who call their language Hindustani. Yet all of these are recognized as separate languages, because they're reinforced with official status. The vast majority of the world's languages have no official recognition, and some would call them 'dialects' because of that. But if Albania and Greece were still part of the Ottoman Empire, with no official recognition, would we want to call Albanian and Greek 'dialects'? And note that official recognition is not always enough. Moldavian has official recognition, and there are even a Moldavian-Romanian dictionary to "prove" it's a separate language. Yet most Moldavians consider their language to be Romanian, and the Moldavian dictionary is widely seen as a farce.</dd>

<dd>According to the OED, the λ and ρ were variable, and Ἀρβανῆτες is also recorded as a Greek word for Albanian. Ἀρβανητία was also a word for Albania.

<p>It's the other way around. Some scholars, who have not studied specifically Arvanites, may call Arvanites as Albanians. The word <i>ethnic</i> in that copy-paste from Bri. is the possible <i>pov</i>. Perhaps we could say Albanians (without the ethnic) in the Albanian language article, and have a wikilink there to Arvanites (who are the majority of people who spoke a language that was close to Albanian and lived in Greece etc, and are the settlers etc). As for the copyvio I still believe that copy-pasting a phrase from a commercial encyclopedia should be avoided, and we should check this (if the phrase hasn't changed) with a wikipedia expert on copyrights. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 22:38, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As REX said an Albanian in Greek language is an Alvanos. In an english book about <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanderbeg.html" title="Scanderbeg">Scanderbeg</a> for example you'll might see Arnauts, Albanians, Arvanites etc grouped in one term "Albanians". In another english book about the 1821 revolution you'll might see Arvanites, Maniots, etc grouped in one term "Greeks". It's like seeing earth people from the Mars and then zooming into the Arvanites, if you don't zoom on <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">them</a> you'll might see them as... Europeans&#160;:)</p>
<p>The first paragraph of that Helsinki report (which I'm trying to crosscheck with various books) points out, that they have a very big problem (<i>they loathe</i> etc) if you call them Albanians (and as I've noted somewhere in the past, they'll probably react as if you have offended the honour of their mother). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 22:55, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>MATIA, do you have any idea how absurd it sounds saying that Britannica is POV. You yourself have emphasised that the Arvanites are not Albanians, why are you now trying to include them in the Albanian language article? Do you have any idea how inconcistent that is? It is not a copyvio, as it is a sentence. Copyrights don't apply to sentences. They apply to names, pictures, logos etc. You didn't think that that bit about the Greek and Italian enclaves was a copyvio, did you? I would also like to ask you what is your authority for saying that Britannica is POV. Are there no ethnic Albanians in Greece? What about the Shqiptar of Epirus? You pretend they don't exist right? What about the Chams and the 600,000 ethnic Albanian immigrants? They don't count, do they? Either Arvanites are Albanians, or they are not. Make up your mind. If they are not, then the Albanian language article is not refering to them.

<dd>Biris(1960) have no mention of Arvanites who self-identify as Shqiptars.

<p>So? The Helsinki Report mentions them, and that's sufficient. We cannot pretend that they do not exist because MATIA wishes it so.

<dd>Come on, English is my native language, but I'm not English. Ethnicity, nationality, and language are be independent variables, though they're highly correlated. And yes, any reputable encyclopedia in NPOV. And that 'correction' of the copy vio, Rex, you didn't even try! Yes, of course all that enclaves-in-Italy stuff goes too. (Keep the information, of course.) That's also cut &amp; paste. Don't just give in grudgingly so Matia "won't grumble"; I'd grumble too. We should be concerned with producing something of our own rather than parroting EB like all those Wikipedia mirrors that parrot us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From the Helsinki report, I would say that Arvanitic is several dialects, with limited intelligibility in some cases both with each other and with Albanian Shqip. Although traditionally considered ethnic Albanians, which is still the case in some areas, they consider themselves to be very much of Greek nationality everywhere, and today in the center and south are strongly opposed to any Albanian identity whatsoever. All that should be included, including the Shqiptar stuff. Of course it should.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But whether that makes Arvanitic a dialect of Albanian or a separate language is so hopelessly POV that no answer is going to be acceptable. Calling the language Albanian implies an Albanian identity (although that wouldn't have to be the case), and calling it a separate language denies the many Arvanites who consider their language to be Albanian. For language classification, Arvanitic is a series of Tosk dialects, just as Standard Hindi is a register of Urdu (or Hindustani, as it's now more often called). Whether people take offence at that is irrelevant: Cladistics does not reflect ethnic sensibilities: Arvanitic <i>is</i> Tosk. However, ethnolinguistically it is much more complicated. Arvantic may be Tosk cladistically but still not Albanian ethnically. Both need to be covered unambiguously.</dd>

<dd>No MATIA, it isn't analysed sufficiently since Theathenae POVized it. The H report in in English and takes precedence over Kollias and Moraitis. Those books represent their authors POV whereas the Helsinki report is in English and it's purpose is to be NPOV. The content of those books is imputed "selectivly" to us by you and is therefore only advisory. You cannot exclude what the H Report says. Also, the sociolinguistic aspect would be original research as I have not yet found any source which discusses it. The sociolinguistic aspect does not exclude the fact that it is a dialect from the point of view of the Arvanits of Epirus and Western Macedonia. That will be mentioned as well i trust.

<p>This is the link Kemla was referring to: <a href="http://arvasynel.gr/ellinoarv_lexiko.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://arvasynel.gr/ellinoarv_lexiko.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.</p>
<p>I am surprised that no one talked about the contents of the link Kemla provided. Of course, I should not be surprised being that this discussion page looks more like a warzone. Moreover, Aldux is of no help being that for some strange reason archaeological evidence of writings are somehow unimportant or at least "unworthy" of some sort of mention. So much for basing history on some semblance of physical evidence.</p>
<p>I am aware that this so-called "sensitive" topic is so radioactive that any slight mention of the Arvanites being either completely Greek or completely Albanian will lead to heated controversy beyond belief. Yet, if there is archaeological evidence that shows Greek-Arvanitic writings, then why should they not be included in the article? The more people know about the Arvanites, the better.</p>
<p>Frankly, I find the Arvanites to be Greeks through and through (and not just merely "Hellenized Albanians"). The incessant arguments over their origins will only lead to greater confusion for the average reader. Moreover, any form of "compromise" established between two or more groups will ultimately weaken or decimate any form of historical accuracy (in exchange for "appeasing" a particular group(s) that only cares about deluding itself into false historical complacency).</p>
<p>If people have a problem with Arvanites themselves showing their history through archaeological evidence, then this article will only fail to address the history of the Arvanites in an historically accurate fashion. If the Arvanites are Greeks and have proof of their origins, then the least Wikipedia could do is give their physical findings/proofs some mention. Simple. Over and out. - Deucalionite 12/10/05 8:19 P.M. EST</p>
<p>If you are an Arvanitis or if you want to learn more about them, try Biris book. It's about 25-30$ and it is one of the most NPOV books I've ever read (Biris uses a very scientifical approach). The only reason I didn't remove the reference on ancient greek inscriptions is that I've seen something similar somewhere (perhaps at the book Kollias has written). However, I wish you could understand how little this addition help people understand who are the Arvanites. Just for the record, Aldux is one of the very good admins and editors here at WP.

<dd>I am not an Arvanite (though I do appreciate the book recommendation). I am actually half Cretan and half Greek-Cypriot (though it does not matter to me since I am still completely Greek). Anyway, I apologize if I do not understand the supposed "insignifance" the ancient Greek inscriptions have on Greek-Arvanite history. I guess that just because something is small, it should not be given any attention. Kiss historical accuracy good-bye for the process of defenistration has been complete. I am in no position to judge your rating of Aldux as an administrator/editor. Yet, every time I edit something pertaining to the Greeks that is worthy of one's time and energy (with content that is informative and historically accurate), I end up having my edits removed by Aldux. Wonderful. I get insulted for my "insignificant" edits and I get badgered by Aldux for providing good edits. Don't mind my social commentary. Send Aldux my regards. - Deucalionite 12/10/05 8:52 P.M.

<dd>Also, just because Arvanites and Albanians were good soldiers does not prove that Arvanites were Albanians. The Sfakians were excellent guerrilla fighters and yet their military capabilities did not change the fact that they were Greeks. Just so you know, those who consider physical (well-documented, well-analyzed, and well-dated) archaeological evidence as "pseudoscience" are usually those who distribute pseudoscientific information. The Albanians have a huge case of Cognitive Dissonance and are scrambling for any "evidence" or "interpretation of evidence" in order to justify their existence. Granted, I can understand one's urge to possess an illustrious heritage and past. In a sense, it hurts for a proud populace to not have a glorious ancient past. However, social reality dictates that an illustrious past can only exist if the present time is filled with achievements in fields of knowledge and practice. For the Albanians to go off in a propagandistic fashion stating how Arvanites were Albanians is not news to me. When you deal with people who have extreme cases of Cognitive Dissonance, you need to expect the worst.</dd>

<dd>Of course, a common counterargument to what I have stated so far comes in the following package: "Well, the Greeks were propagandists too and they assimilated this people and that people and people over there blah blah blah, which is why the Arvanites were Albanians." To be honest, there are those who do not know that to the Greeks "assimilation" has a different meaning than what the standard definition of the word provides. When it comes to assimilation, people expect to see an innocent native non-Greek people being forced to become Greeks. However, social reality dictates that the tenets of Greek "assimilation" entail the unionizing of scattered Greek tribes into a more standardized Greek mainstream. Besides, it is not the first time that existing Greek tribes underwent a Hellenizing process in order to befit a more culturally superior Greek form (blame the Athenians for that trend). Even in medieval times the Maniots followed the tenets of "Romiosyni" (in short, they were "Hellenized" in the medieval sense of the word) during the age of the Greek Byzantine Empire. However, this does not prove that just because the Maniots were "Hellenized" in the medieval sense that they were not Greeks to begin with.</dd>

<dd>People have exploited the so-called grand "differences" between Greek tribes and have given modern populations a heritage that does not rightfully belong to them (example: F.Y.R.O.M.). The Albanians are no exception to this little fact of social reality. I, at first, assumed that the Albanians were in fact descendants of the Illyrians. However, as I conducted more research, I realized that the Albanians have claimed things that just do not belong to them. The claims were so outrageous (Socrates was Albanian, Odysseus was Albanian, Alexander the Great was Albanian, the Epirotians were Albanians, etc. etc. etc.) that I had serious doubts about the whole Albanians being Illyrians thing. Moreover, the claims have a legacy going back to Enver Hoxha who struggled to establish a "legitimate" history of Albania by any means necessary.</dd>

<dd>I have read the contents of this discussion warzone and realized that too much time is spent trying to "compromise" with Albanians and their "evidence." It would not be right for a person of your intellectual caliber to spend so much time arguing over useless propaganda and half-truths while ignoring a potentially important piece of archeaological evidence that could shed light on the history of the Arvanites (and possibly put a definitive stop to the useless ramblings of "Arvanites were Albanians").</dd>

<dd>I am probably going to expect people stating this little phrase to me one of these days: "But Deucalionite, you are an obviously blatant case of unadultered Greek bias." Tell me something I don't know. I am fully aware of my biases, but social reality dictates that every human being has a bias. Even neutrality is a bias because not all neutrally-minded people are historically accurate in how their understand social history. As they say, the bias of no bias is a bias in of itself. I digress. The point I am trying to make is that if a person is going to follow in the way of a certain bias, then the least the person could do is base his bias on reality or on realistic processes. Of course, I am in no mood to debate over empiricism even though it is needed to an extent (along with the subconscious "gut-instinct" that extends a person's understanding of his/her surroundings beyond the five common senses).</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I could write in this warzone until the arrival of Terminus. To repeat a question I asked earlier, if confirmation data on the writings were to be collected and presented, would you then be more inclined to place the information about the writings in the article?

<p>More data on those findings are needed. I've rewritten your addition and moved it at a seperate section (<a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html#Ancient_Greek_inscriptions" title="Arvanites">Arvanites#Ancient_Greek_inscriptions</a>). I must tell you that there are archaeological findings of Byzantine and Ottoman era (inscriptions in Arvanitika for example).</p>
<p>Arvanites self-identify as Greeks. While that's more than enough for me, they also have their history and their culture that are all the proofs that may be needed.</p>
<p>If you read more carefully my previous comment, you'll see that I've written they were soldiers, not writers. They fighted instead of writing poems or novels.</p>
<p>In that article I'm mostly interesting in Byzantine and Venetian historical records. While there can be many theories for X, Y, or Z people, the historical records are not just theory, but facts. Of course facts should be cross-checked, but that is easier than proving a theory for something that is not recorded by historians. I have many notes on Arvanites, from the various books I've found at libraries, that I haven't yet presented. Perhaps I'll try to do so within the next days. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 01:41, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Im quite familiar with most of these historical figures, and most if not all of them are of Greek Ancestry, this is the first time Ive ever heard of them being refred to as having Arvanitic ancestry, so basically the names of these histoical figures will be permenantly deleted from this article very soon if there is no <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufficient.html" title="Sufficient">sufficient</a> Non-<a href="../../../b/i/a/Biased.html" title="Biased">biased</a> <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidence</a> which can confirm each and every of the people listed are of Avranitic origins. ---<a href="../../../e/-/m/User%7EE-mail_adress_18c5.html" title="User:E-mail adress">E-mail adress</a>02:03, 12 Dec 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some <b>examples</b>: Botsaris phara was from Souli, the oldest historical records for that phara date around 1500. Pangalos was from Eleusina or Agkistri, both the general and his grandson has declared repeatedly their Arvanitic identity. Krieziotis was from Karystos an Arvanitic village. Engonopoulos has also declared his identity in interviews and has done some paintings with arvanitic themes (for example Mercouris Boua, an Arvanitis war-leader who fought the Ottomans). Most of these and many more can also be found at <a href="http://www.arvasynel.gr" class="external free" title="http://www.arvasynel.gr" rel="nofollow">http://www.arvasynel.gr</a> but I listed here only the people who I could verify from various sources. Some Arvanites claim that Kolokotronis was also an Arvanitis but this is disputed and so I haven't included him (and I don't know whether he was also partially an Arvanitis). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 17:23, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>First of all it is</b> Arvanitic <b>not Avranitic</b></p>
<p>Firstly I’m quite aware its “Arvanitic” as I used the word several times in my initial post and unintentionally misspelt it once, its called a <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typo.html" title="Typo">typo</a></p>
<p><b>Secondly this is a carefully selected and verified list of people.</b></p>
<p>Carefully selected by whom? By nationalistic fanatics in search of foreign history?</p>
<p><b>Third, vandalism of this article will be reported instantly</b></p>
<p>The only one vandalising this article is you and several others by adding historically incorrect misinformation, it is a violation of the wikipedia rules to intentionally add false unsourced information to articles. (see: Reliable_sources <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a>)</p>
<p><b>Botsaris phara was from Souli, the oldest historical records for that phara date around 1500</b></p>
<p>Yes precisely he was a souliot, I suggest you read up on <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souliotes.html" title="Souliotes">Souliotes</a></p>
<p><b>Pangalos was from Eleusina or Agkistri, both the general and his grandson has declared repeatedly their Arvanitic identity</b></p>
<p>Sources/Links:</p>
<p><b>Krieziotis was from Karystos an Arvanitic village</b></p>
<p>Sources/Links:</p>
<p><b>Engonopoulos has also declared his identity in interviews and has done some paintings with arvanitic themes (for example Mercouris Boua, an Arvanitis war-leader who fought the Ottomans).</b></p>
<p>If you keep making these assertions you are going to need to back them up with some authentic verifiable evidence from non biased NPOV sources.</p>
<p><b>(for example Mercouris Boua, an Arvanitis war-leader who fought the Ottomans). Most of these...</b></p>
<p>Most is not all, each and every one of these historical figures ancestry needs to be proven to be Arvanitic from an authentic historical source or it will be permanently removed and belive me I will personally go through the Arvanitic article with a fine tooth comb and remove anything which is innacurate and/or false.</p>
<p><b>Some Arvanites claim that Kolokotronis was also an Arvanitis but this is disputed and so I haven't included him (and I don't know whether he was also partially an Arvanitis)</b></p>
<p>Listen Matia.gr stop basing your judgements of these particular Historcal figures lineage on Arvanitic folktales. Some of the less well known people you stated may very well be Arvanites but what you need to provide is Authentic verifiable NPOV <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidence</a>, I’ll give you some more time to find evidence that clearly states that these people were Arvanites, if you cant I will remove their names from the article, Simple as that. <a href="../../../e/-/m/User%7EE-mail_adress_18c5.html" title="User:E-mail adress">E-mail adress</a> 12:22, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have also checked General Pangalos's memoirs, Krieziotis and Kriezis biographies (the author of the last biography, was a Kriezis himself and a member of the greek pariament, from Hydra). So <a href="../../../e/-/m/User%7EE-mail_adress_18c5.html" title="User:E-mail adress">User:E-mail adress</a> if you are familiar with these books, I am expecting your explanations on the subject you raised. In the past we had Albanian and other editors who claimed that Arvanites are not Greeks, however what Arvanites say and what Arvanites have done are the evidence for the opposite. If you want to claim that the books that I've listed in that article (most of them at the Bibliography section) are biased, I expect you to check the books first (start with Bires and Moraitis) and then we can talk about it. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 12:00, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>questions</b> for <a href="../../../e/-/m/User%7EE-mail_adress_18c5.html" title="User:E-mail adress">User:E-mail adress</a>: are the refugees from the 1922 disaster at Asia Minor less Greeks? Pontioi are less Greeks? Cretans are less Greeks? Eptanisioi (Επτανήσιοι) are less Greeks? What about the "native" inhabitants of Athens (Γκαγκαραίοι), are they more Greeks? (keep in your mind, before answering, that Γκαγκαραίοι were Arvanites). Read these carefully, along perhaps with previous discussions in that huge talk page and please explain your position. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 12:15, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pay attention MATIA and Stop straying from the preliminary subject and building strawman arguments, here we are discussing the “arvaniteness” of the people who you have listed as Arvanites. Im not interested in discussing the Greekness of the various populations you have mentioned, if you wish to discusss them go to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a>Talk Page. <a href="../../../e/-/m/User%7EE-mail_adress_18c5.html" title="User:E-mail adress">E-mail adress</a></p>
