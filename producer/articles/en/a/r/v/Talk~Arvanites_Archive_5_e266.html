<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adjective</span></h2>
<p>I think we should use the term "Arvanite" as an adjective rather than "Arvanitic". If you check the <a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" class="external text" title="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html" rel="nofollow">GHM report</a>, the only adjective they use is "Arvanite". --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 23:31, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Telex please check the rest of the refs to gain a better prespective of the adjectives (or whatever else) that are in use. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 07:09, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no opinion on the adjective issue really. Both forms seem to be in use. But in general I agree with Matia we shouldn't over-value the GHM report at this stage. Unfortunately I haven't got my other articles here right now, and I honestly don't remember what Trudgill or Tsitsipis used in their English. By the way, with a short test googling I hit on these two papers: <a href="http://lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/2ndSymposium_papers_pdf/Simeon_Magliveras_paper.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/2ndSymposium_papers_pdf/Simeon_Magliveras_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/abs/10.1525/ae.1999.26.2.412" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/abs/10.1525/ae.1999.26.2.412" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Comments? The first has some interesting remarks on the relationship between Albanians and Arvanites. The second is unfortunately access-restricted, but maybe someone could dig it out through some other channel. (As for the usage issue, the first uses "Arvanite" as an adjective, the second apparently "Arvanitic".) <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 08:01, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've gone on record repeatedly as one that is skeptical about the "related ethnic groups" field in the infobox in general, and my personal preference is to leave it out. Nevertheless, I think we should offer 87.203.*.* a bit more of an explanation for leaving it out, if (s)he wishes to have it. I mean, after all, if ever two groups <i>were</i> in fact related to each other, it surely is the Albanians and Arvanites, let's be realistic about that.

<dd>A) The Arvanites are not an ethnic group - B) It's original research. For the position of the Arvanites within Greece, see User:Telex/Ethnic identity in Greece. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 11:56, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the scholarly literature does call them an ethnic group, I thought we had established that? (I think whatever definition of "ethnic" one uses, any group that is defined historically by a distinct language will probably <i>always</i> qualify. And the common English usage, I think, does not treat "ethnic" groupings as necessarily mutually exclusive, so identification as Greeks doesn't entail they can't also be an "ethnic" (sub-)group themselves too.) But I generally like the approach in your draft there, of distinguishing groups on several different levels of "distinctness". <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 12:23, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Perhaps both Lukas and Telex might be as frustrated as myself in the un-sophisticated manner in which the term 'ethnic' is included to demarcate between peoples. Occasionally, some ethnic statistics for Greece, include a slot for Arvanites and Vlachs. I (and probably nearly all Greeks) are baffled, if not totally disagree with this crude assessment. Such statistics imply the existence of a culturally cohesive entity that enacts the separate, i.e. non-Greek, activities of an ethnic minority. But these are constituent peoples of the Greek nation - as surely as the arm and the lungs are constituent elements of a person's body. Whatever they enact, other Greeks tend to identify with it as their own - though not necessarily 'of their own village'. In this respect, the Greek nation (το γένος) is unthinkable without Arvanties and Vlachs, as it is unthinkable without Cretans, Corfiots, Rumeliots, Pontians, or Macedonians for that matter. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 13:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As for the term Albanian, it encompasses different tribes, and specifically the Tosks and the Gheks. Unlike the Gheks, many (or most) Tosks feel quite separate from the Kosovars - many (or most) Tosks seem to oppose a 'greater Albania' since they would immediately become a minority, especially since a huge percentage of them are Orthodox by religion. Also, the two groups speak different dialects, though, naturally, it is Albanian. But they definitly exhibit different morphological types. In this respect, it might be more appropriate to seek morphological, linguistic and to a degree religious comparisons between the Arvanites and the Tosk Albanians. I sign off by proposing that ethnic entities can be interpreted as consisting of a series of collapsable demarcation parameters; often these parameters depend on the prevailing socio-political winds. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 13:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As far as I know, in the modern world, the distinction between Tosk and Gheg is of little or no significance.

<p>I saw the text you quite rightly pointed to in support of Albanians seeing the Arvanites as an Albanian minority. Their text is not researched, it merely gives an impression of something that had no other echo than during the Berish presidency. The authors are not experts and make mistakes; for instance, the Arvanitiki language has not "been led to oblivion". If they cannot search what happens in Greece, how can we trust them with Albania? Finally, the article is about Arvanites, not how the rest of the world views them. Likewise, over 20 percent of Albanian citizens are Greek Orthodox; do we have to point out that some Greeks view them as ethnic Greeks? <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 13:35, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As for your last question: yes, we should, in the context of an article about the "Northern Epirus" issue, but that's unrelated to this article.</li>
<li>As for "been led to oblivion", it's a somewhat imprecise statement of what linguists describe as ongoing language death, but it's not really wrong.</li>
<li>As for the verifiability issue: I appreciate that the article is not an ideal source, as it deals with the question only with a single sentence in passing. The problem seems to be that the fact is just so obviously ubiquitous (just google through Albanian internet fora and the like, or look at the behaviour of Albanian editors right here!) that few academic sources would bother to invest much study in it. I know those first-hand observations aren't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. But as a source, what we have here is hardly worse than what we have for, say, the immediately preceding statement.</li>
<li>As for the relevance: it's not about how "the rest of the world" views them; it's about how they are viewed by the major most closely related group, of which they <i>have been</i> considered a part in the past, and of which readers might reasonably <i>expect</i> them to be considered a part still. That <i>is</i> relevant.</li>

<dd>We can always ask some Albanian editor to help out and find some Albanian source that expresses this view. Shall we?

<dd>Well, if we include this perception, it needs to be further down the text and contextualised in no more than a couple of lines. Also, I am not aware of any Albanian immigrants in Greece approaching Arvanites as though they are the same people and getting them to see themselves as a native minority. Arvanites are quite tough and, since they are an integral part of Greece, they would tell them in no uncertain terms where to get off. I could give you examples but that would be POV. Therefore, this preception originates from a particular political circle in Albania and can be dated to the mid 1990s.</dd>
<dd>Just take the British example. There are English people born of one or two Scottish parents. But can we seriously accept a Scottish person from Glasgow speaking of a native Scottish minority in England? Or can we accept figures of a native English minority in Scotland? Would we include such views if they appeared in the mid 1990s? We are all aware that we can find anything on the internet, but to include it would challenge anyone's sense of rationality. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 17:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question of perception by Albanians was just where it should be: In the paragraph that summarised their perception by themselves, by other Greeks, by the international literature, etc. As for Albanian immigrants regarding Arvanites as part of their own group, I checked the study by Botsi, it contains evidence for exactly that. As for your British example, I can't follow you at all: English/Scots individuals do not constitute a notable coherent group in the first place. Arvanites do. There is no "English-person-of-Scots-heritage" collective identity, but there is an Arvanite collective identity. If the description of such an English/Scots identity were ever an issue, then yes, of course we would describe all sides: how they see themselves, how the English see them, how the Scots see them. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 08:37, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am not aware of Botsi study. However, if I included my own overview, then we would have a picture indicating that there is no issue (that would be considered private research). But since the issue is not one of Greece and neither is it part of Greek-Albanian relations and exchanges, we should move carefully. As for the English / Scots issue, if someone was to publish a few lines pertaining to a "English-person-of-Scots-heritage" collective identity - how would we react? Probably by stating that someone is creating an artificial issues. That seems to be the case with the Arvanites / Albanian subject. But since some people may have their point, the question remains open, rather than shut. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 13:31, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History Section</span></h2>
<p>Well it seems the controversy will never die. However, I did my best to clean up the article as much as possible. Yet, the content in the section "Arvanites as Albanians" was quite confusing and fails to really shed light on the origins of the Arvanites.</p>
<p>The questions I hope one can answer entails the following (please no insults and no useless commentary):</p>
<p>1) If the Albanians were mercenaries, then what makes one assume that the Arvanite mercenaries/nomads were of Albanian descent? Just because the Albanians were mercenaries that fought in military campaigns in 1043 AD under the command of George Maniates? To be honest, Greeks have had a history of being mercenaries too (at least since ancient times with the Persian Empire).</p>
<p>2) What makes the Despotate of Epirus the supposed "ancient homeland of Greek-Albanian unions" or the "homeland of Albanians proper"? What if the Despotate of Epirus utilized the same social policies as did other Byzantine territories where they separated the main Greek population from foreign mercenary populations? Case in point, the Sclavinai.</p>
<p>3) Has anyone taken into consideration the fact that the Albanians today are experiencing significant levels of cognitive dissonance whereby they are having difficulty establishing a history of their own? Wouldn't this obviously compel Albanians to conjure up a history for themselves out of thin air?</p>
<p>4) Whatever happened to discussing about the locals of Arbanon? What if the descendants of the Greek locals of Arbanon took the name "Arbanites" because they came from that specific area?</p>
<p>5) Has anyone noticed how Albanians tend to consider anything that begins with the prefix Alb- or Arb- to mean Albanian? Case in point, is Grenada Greek because the name linguistically begins with the three-letter prefix of "Gre-" (who knows, but you get the picture)?</p>
<p>6) Is it just me or has anyone noticed the high levels of Albanian cognitive dissonance lately? I mean, I at first assumed that the Albanians were in fact the descendants of the Illyrians. However, this misperception on my part was eventually removed as a result of Albanians claiming things that rightfully belong to Greek history. The boldness of Albanians today is mindboggling. Odysseus was Albanian, Alexander the Great was Albanian, Socrates was Albanian, the fustanella was Albanian, the Souliotes were Albanian, the Epirotians were Albanians, etc. etc. (guess everything except the kitchen sink is Albanian). I think that the whole "Arvanites were Albanians" is an attempt by the Albanians to create an imaginative historical continuity based on anything they could find.</p>
<p>I hope someone answers my questions. Or not. I think something fishy is going on with the whole "Arvanites are Albanians" argument. The Greek sources may be interesting, but they conflict (in a large or small extent depending on interpretation) with other sources already existent in the article. I think that the viewpoints of the Greek authors be placed in the "Authors" section specifically. Over and out. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 23:28, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly oppose Deucalionite's proposal to split the history section into an "Arvanites as Greeks" and an "Arvanites as Albanians" section, as if these were two conflicting theories. They are not. The ancestors of todays Arvanites <i>were</i> Albanians; they later acquired Greek self-identification. There is absolutely no disagreement about either point in the literature, for all I can see. I'm cutting down the whole section, there's too much OR and speculation in there for my taste. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 07:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We'd need at least one source, reliably quoted and summarized, specifically claiming that the characterisation as Albanians is inappropriate.

Do we really want that? Sounds like trivialised left-wing rambling to me.</li>
<li>Many statements were redundant, both internally within that section and in relation to other stuff already elsewhere in the article.</li>
<li>Some questionable stuff:
<ul>
<li>Is it really plausible that the Arvanitic folk-songs provide information about the social structure <i>before</i> the upheavals of the 13th century?</li>
<li>Creation of the Despotate of Epirus a confirmation of an ethnic "bond" between Greeks and Albanians? That hardly sounds like mainstream historiography. Byzantine politics didn't normally place much attention on ethnic relations at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some questionable stuff in the old history section:
<ul>
<li>Alternative origin theories (Dorian/Pelasgic), marked as unsourced months ago, have still not be substantiated</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">to Matia</span></h3>
<p>To Matia, just about your arguments re. self-identification of medieval Arvanites as Greeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>What I see in Biris in the context of Scanderbeg, Thopias and others, all I can see is that they were trying to construct for themselves an ancient (i.e. Ancient Greek) identity <i>qua Albanians</i>, not a Greek identity <i>qua Arvanites, as opposed to Albanians</i>. See the difference? Whatever Scanderbeg or Thopias believed about their ancestry, they seem to have believed that they shared it with all Albanian-speakers, <i>not</i> just with a specific group of Hellenized Arvanites distinct from Albanians proper. So it strengthens rather than weakens my claim that we may properly call them Albanians.</li>
<li>In Biris, p.23, first paragraph you sent me, I read (my transl.:) <i>"Of the Byzantine writers who mention the Albanians [sic, 'Αλβανούς'], George Paxymeres, Mazaris and Nicephorus Gregoras characterise them as Illyrians"</i>. Now, look up <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazaris.html" title="Mazaris">Mazaris</a>, the passage is specifically discussed in that article: Mazaris is talking of 15th-century Peloponnesian groups, i.e. Arvanites in our sense. If Biris summarises Mazaris' talking about Arvanites as talking about "Albanians", that means even Biris himself considers medieval Arvanites to have been Albanians. Okay?</li>

<li>Kollias has a pic with the phrase (in Greek) "These are the signs of Carlos Thopias" (or something similar)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did Scanderbeg and other tried to connect to Ancient Greece, or among them were Greeks too? I find the last more probable (but perhaps both things happened).</li>
<li>The ancestors of Arvanites were (mostly) called Arvanites by others. When they didn't call themselves Arvanites, they used <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_the_Greeks_c009.html" title="Names of the Greeks">Greek variations</a>.</li>

<dd>You are right of course about your reading of the Thopias quote - but then, what is it supposed to show? That he used Greek for his official business? Well, of course. It's not as if he had much choice, did he. That says pretty little about his ethnic identity either way.</dd>
<dd>The Scanderbeg thing as related by Biris seems pretty clear to me: he speaks about the supposed ancestry of his whole ethnic group, i.e. Albanians, apparently using "Albania" as the geographical definition (but I don't know in what language the original was written, it's obviously a translation). Biris himself evidently assumes that Arvanite and Albanian are synonyms when dealing with that period.</dd>
<dd>What it all boils down to is: <i>Of course</i> these guys were <i>also</i> Greeks, in the cultural-political-religious sense of "Romioi". But that doesn't stop them from being <i>also</i> Albanians in the ethnolinguistic sense, and it is this ethnolinguistic identity that people like Scanderbeg seemed to be interested in. If you wanted to show they were <i>not</i> Albanians, you'd have to demonstrate that as early as <i>before</i> the migration, there was already a conceptual division between to-be-hellenized-proto-Arvanites-who-were-going-to-move-south on the one hand, and non-hellenized-Albanians-proper-που-θα-κάθουνταν-στ'αβγά-τους on the other. And I still cannot see the slightest indication that such a thing existed prior to the 19th or even 20th century.</dd>

<dd>This discussion seems interesting to me, so i decided to add my comment. i'm talking about Scanderbeg and the term 'Romioi'... why his original surname was Kastriotis? doesn't this seem a greek name? why he used the byzantine double-headed eangle, the emblem of the Paleologus family, at a time that the scholars say that the byzantine empire ended its millenium life as a <i>greek nation state</i>? apropos, the term 'Romioi', or 'Rums' (as the Turks say) is <b>still</b> applied to the Greeks, not to the Orthodox in general... I am aware that in the first centuries of the turkish occupation of the Balkans, it meant all the eastern christians, but later other millets were established. i am curious to know if in the 16th-17th centuries (for example) the Arvanites were considered still part of the 'Millet y Rum' or not. --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 17:06, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I've been asked by a couple of people to comment on this. I'd like to point out firstly that considering that I voted keep on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanisation.html" title="Albanisation">Albanisation</a>, I may not be considered a <i>neutral</i> party here.</p>
<p>That out of the way, the lead reads perfectly to me. The history section is a bit higgledy-piggledy, I note that it seems to have been translated from the Greek. This is probably a bad idea with such a contentious article. I would advocate starting from scratch using English language sources where possible.</p>
<p>Demographics section seems ok, might want to link to <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>. In the language section, "Greek state institutions are reported to have sometimes followed a policy of actively discouraging and repressing the use of the Arvanitic language". Drop the "are reported to have sometimes" replace with "have". In the Minority status section, 'Many Arvanites are also reported to be strongly opposed against the idea of obtaining any kind of officially recognized "minority" status', either drop this or source it. In the Folk culture section, I would recommend dropping the "Folk".</p>
<p>Some of the stuff in Names could be split out into a "Related groups" section?</p>
<p>There are my initial thoughts. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 16:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. The situation of the history section is that a big chunk from el: was recently translated but not yet optimally integrated. But the current discussion, apart from how best to clean up the history section, is mainly about whether the lead section should also contain a statement that they "are descendants of Albanian settlers". Albanian editors have in the past requested such an addition, Greek editors dislike it, my own take is that the references do not yield any good argument to reject such a statement. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:44, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Providing the controversy (and I'm guessing there is one) is covered in the article, I see no reason to include or exclude it.

<dd>Well, there is a controversy among editors here, but not really one in the literature as far as I am aware. It's not so much about the "settlers", it's about the "Albanians". Some of the Greek editors don't like to use the ethnic name "Albanians" to be used <i>avant-la-lettre</i> for the medieval populations. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">it is not logical</span></h3>
<p>It is not logical to apply "Albanian" identity to a group that had Arvanitic/Greek identity in a time that the Albanian identity (of Albanians themselves) was almost non existant. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 07:28, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(Continuing thread from above:) This seems all to have been gone through earlier (see <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanites_Archive_3_b5e7.html" title="Talk:Arvanites/Archive 3">Talk:Arvanites/Archive 3</a>, towards the bottom). Point is: The medieval "Arvanitic/Greek identity" you are talking about <i>was</i> the Albanian identity of the time. As the article states, apparently <i>all</i> Albanians called themselves "Arvanites" then, they just changed the name later but that doesn't mean they changed identity. So we still have no indication of a <i>separate</i> Arvanite identity at that early stage. The ancestors of today's Arvanites were an integral part of the same group that is <i>today</i> called Albanians.</dd>
<dd>That leaves us with the purely semantic question of whether it's appropriate to use the modern name in retrospect. And here it's not a matter what you or I find logical, it's a matter of what the literature does. I repeat my challenge: Find me one source that explicitly claims calling them Albanians is inappropriate.</dd>
<dd>Apart from that, I personally could live with a solution where this is kept out of the introduction (as you said: state what they are, not what they were). But then we should strengthen the point in the history section. It might also mean we'd have to live with continued challenges from Albanian editors; I could understand it if they wanted to insist on the point in the intro. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 07:52, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And please keep in your mind (and everyone else interested) that we are editing <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> not <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a>. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 08:13, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've certainly seen sources describing the identification of the modern people as Albanians as offensive, but nothing arguing against the identification of the medieval ancestors, sorry, no. Not the same thing. And I'd be opposed to shying away from clearly stating the latter just because of the hypothetical possibility that some readers might confuse it with the former and have their precious national sensitivites touched.</dd>
<dd>As for the Jirecek line, of course we know that parts of the Albanian area were under Greek cultural influence, but that doesn't mean that no non-Greek ethnicities could have constituted themselves in that area. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 08:25, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not my style to "shying away" etc. I agree more or less with the rest.</dd>
<dd>On your comment on Jirecek line, I'd like to repeat that we cannot force albanian identity on Arvanitic people, before even the Albanians had such an identity (it happpened long after Scanderbeg - even if we suppose that Scanderbeg started it). The US Stade Dep called Arvanites as Albanian settlers or something like that, but thank God they've changed that line.</dd>
<dd>I believe, since the Arvanites also exist today, and they did use that name for themselves in the past too, we should work the article in that direction. This article shouldn't describe Arvanites as an Albanian this or that, but it should describe what they are, what they were, what they've done, what they are doing etc. <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> not <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a>. Perhaps the Albanian editors would be interested in writing at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a> that they were called sometimes <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>. But scholars who have actually studied <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> (and not just mention them in two lines), aren't simply labeling them Albanians or Albanian settlers. And for WP shake, we should write down that medieval Arvanites were bilinguals too. <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">talk to</a></small> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> 09:13, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>To be fair, Matia, I don't think they all were bilinguals, just the Tosks were. According to Biris (p. 27), the Byzantines used to refer to the Tosks as "Albanoi" and to the Ghegs as "Illyrioi" (apparently the terms "Tosk" and "Gheg" came about after the Ottoman conquest). He is unclear on whether "Arvanites" used to refer to both groups collectively or not. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 09:50, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting, but probably an over-simplification. <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazaris.html" title="Mazaris">Mazaris</a>, for instance, uses "Illyrians" for Peloponnesian Arvanites, i.e. Tosks. And the reference of "Albanoi" in the earliest sources (Attaleiates) has been disputed, it might be referring to entirely different peoples. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 09:58, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'll nevertheless test out an intransigent position here. Let's see:
<ul>
<li>No, the principle of self-identification does not apply. Arvanites have every right in the world to define who they want to be today. But they do not have the right to expect us to censor their history according to their likings.</li>
<li>Especially not if the POV <i>allegedly</i> preferred by the Arvanites has never even been proposed in the literature, and we don't actually know what it is supposed to be. I'm still waiting for those quotes, and I won't give in until they are provided.</li>
<li>If we are going to take national sensitivities into account, then those of Albanian readers count just as much. Albanians have every right in the world to regard the medieval settlements as part of <i>their</i> history too. Members of their nation were expanding across the Balkans. What's wrong about them wanting to see that represented here?</li>
<li>The thing about the Albanian settlers is a very simple, entirely undisputed fact of fundamental importance for the definition of the topic of this article. Apart from the Greek sensitivities (which I personally find entirely misguided), there's no good reason <i>not</i> to have it in the intro. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 11:52, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a name="Origin_of_term_Arvanites" id="Origin_of_term_Arvanites"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin of term Arvanites</span></h2>
<p>According to Babiniotis 2002 (Dictionary of Greek language) and Stefanaq Pollo and Arben Puto, The History of Albania, 1981, the term Arvanites originates from a specific place. Babiniotis writes [translation by Politis]: "Arvanitis ...person who speaks Arvanitika. SYN: Arnaoutis, Kolias (from Nicolaos). 2. Colloquially, denotes a person who is headstrong and obstinate. ETYM: Medieval origin from a toponym Arvana from the Albanian Arbena. Arvana was the original name of the mountain range stretching between the rivers Mat and Ischmi, west of lake Ohrid. The people of that region were called by the Greeks Arvanitai…” He states that the Arvanite are Greeks of remote Albanian origin, they are found in various parts of Greece (districts of Corinth, Argolida, Attika, Boiotia, Thespotia and some islands). Since the 14 and 15 centuries their fate has been interlinked with that of the struggles of Hellemism.</p>
<p>Stefanaq Pollo and Arben Puto concur with the origin of the name, “...The Byzantine writer of the eleventh century, Michael Attaliate [writes] that among other tribes the Arbanites (Αρβανιται), inhabitants of the country of Arbanon (Αρβανoν) took part in 1078 in the revolt of the Duke of Dyrrachium, Nicephore Basilakes, which is confirmed point by point by another writer of the timie, John Skylitzes. ...The name of Abanon was at first that of a small region with Kruja at its centre and which kept the historical name of Arbeni until quite late. It was a regional name.... In the ninth century, when the Byzantine power was re-established,, the Arbanon region consisted of a distinct diocese..." They state that it expanded, merged and developed into the Arbanese bishopric and went on to gain distinct autonomous status. This meant they needed their own name, Albanoi... They say that the word Arbanitai is of geogrpahic inspiration, liked to the region where they lived. They write that, “The name Arbanite or Albanian in the 11th century was, therefore, not so much of ethnic foundation, but of political and religious foundation. It could not be applied to all the inhabitants in the Albanian linguistic area, but only to the populations of the indeginous and [the by now] Catholic province of the Arbanon. The Albanians from other regions continued to be called by scholars and contemporary chancellors in both the east and the west according to the pollitical and religious community to which they belonged, Romaioi or Graeci or Skavinoi, or Sclavinus or Bulgaroi or Bulgarus.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, indeed the term refers to Greeks of ancient Albanian stock; we cannot identify it primarily as ethnically Albanian but as a term given by Greeks to the inhabitants of a region.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cultural links between Greeks and Albanians are more complex (I would say more interesting) than nationalist gun slingers make out. For instance, the ethnically Greek Albanian, Constantine Christophoridis (1830-1895) published a translation of the Bible from the original Greek into Albanian, as well as other books. He wrote: “If the Albanian language is not written, there will shortly be no Albania on the surface of the earth nor will the name Albania appear on teh map of the world”. [re: Histori e Shqiperese, 1984. p.37] He advocated a single Albanian alphabet. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 15:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We don't want to purposely include controversial information to the article, especially not your expectation about the origin of the ancestors of the Arvanites. You know why the neutrality and factual accuracy of this article is disputed? Because of the users with Greek background refusal of accepting the fundamental and essential fact that the ancestors of the Arvanites were Albanians and not Albanian-speaking, albanized or albanophone Greeks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An article from the encyclopedia <b>Britannica</b> regarding the Albanians in Greece writes following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The origins of the Albanians (<i>Albanoi/Arvanitai in Greek</i>) remain uncertain. They appear to be the descendants of the Illyrian populations who withdrew into the highlands of the central Dinaric chain. Their name may originate from the valley of the Arbanon (along the Shkumbi River) in the theme of Dyrrachion (Durrës/Durazzo), in which they were first noted by outside commentators. Their language probably evolved from ancient Illyrian (formerly classed with the Hellenic group of Indo-European languages but now generally recognized as an independent member of the latter family), but it is heavily influenced by Greek, Slavic, and Turkish, as well as medieval Italian. <i>For reasons not yet fully understood, the Albanians began in the 14th century to advance into the western coastal plain, where they served both Byzantine and Serbian overlords as well as ruling independently under various warlords and chiefly families; they were also present in considerable numbers in Thessaly, Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnese, serving as soldiers and as farmers, colonizing deserted lands. Albanians arrived in large numbers in the Peloponnese during the reign of the despotes Manuel Kantakouzenos, who brought them there to serve as soldiers and to resettle depopulated regions. The impact of their presence on the region's existing ethnic and linguistic structure remains debated.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can find on the book <b>Albanian identities: Myth and History</b>, in chapter The Perception of the Albanians in Greece in the 1830s and '40s: the role of the press, by Elias Skouliads from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Ioannina_e85e.html" title="University of Ioannina">University of Ioannina</a>, page 179: writes following: <i>the term 'Alvanoi' was also used to describe the Arvanites.</i></p>

<dd>Interesting stuff, especially that Pollo &amp; Puto quote. Of course, nothing of that contradicts what I've been saying: By the time the settlements in the south took place, there was an ethnic group which everybody in the literature today identifies with the modern term "Albanians", no matter how they were calling themselves at the time. And those guys who went to settle down in Greece to become the ancestors of today's Arvanites differed in no way from the other members of that same ethnic group who were left behind in what is today Albania. Guys, what else are we squabbling about still? <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 17:04, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Luka, you're probably right. What I don't get, is how this info is not evident in the article and why we have to put it in the intro as well, while it is NOT the current term. Examples from within the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>2nd par <i>Foreign sources sometimes still refer to Arvanites as Albanians...</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2nd par <i>Many Albanians, on the other hand, regard Arvanites as an Albanian minority group.</i></dd>

<dd>You're quite right. All these different mentionings of "Albanian" could be slimmed down quite a bit, if we could just bring ourselves to mention the Albanian connection once and for all, simply as a matter of course, as every sensible other author would. But since every possible way in which Arvanites could conceivably be related to Albanians has been objected to and disputed <i>ad nauseam</i> here, it has until now been necessary to very very carefully introduce and discuss and weigh and hedge and justify and source and attribute <i>every single one</i> of them. Relation in terms of historical descent, in terms of language, in terms of self-perception, in terms of perception by others, in terms of shared ethnonyms. The more Greek editors object to each of them, the more often the word "Albanian" will in the end appear in the article.</dd>
<dd>As for the tags, well, I do think until we agree on something here they should stay. The old history section was de-emphasizing the Albanian connection in its wordeing too much. Say about Albanau what you want, but where he has a point he has a point. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 20:49, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, Lukas. Will you do me the favour and count how many times we mention Albanians in the intro?

<dd>After reading it again, I think that your idea "<i>The more Greek editors object to each of them, the more often the word "Albanian" will in the end appear in the article.</i>" is unacceptable.

<dd>No, don't get me wrong, I don't really want to use the "A" word much more often there.&#160;:-) But it's true, the fact that I had to use it so often in the February version was exactly because there had been so much debate before. If a point is strenuously disputed, it will end up being bolstered up with an extra amount of sourcing and arguments, and in the end get more weight in the text than if people just accepted it as a matter of course. - I'm currently considering if it would be a good idea to move some of the "calling them A. or not" stuff out of the intro to releave it from the over-use of the "A" word, but then maybe put the "settlers" bit back in? As for the point below, I think Albanau's English is at fault, "immigrants" is not the appropriate term.

<dd>I propose the erasement of following unnecessary nonsense:</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>While most historians regard the ancestors of today's Arvanites as part of the same medieval population groups that are also the ancestors to present-day Albanians,[5] some Arvanite authors have argued that the settlers were not ethnic Albanians in a true sense. They hypothesize that Arvanites were either descendants of originally Greek populations who had only intermediately become Albanized; or that they were descendants of some other Thraco-Illyrian tribes and as such related but not identical to Albanians proper;[citation needed] or that Arvanites are descendants of the original pre-Greek "Pelasgian" population and as such actually autochthonous to southern Greece. These views have no echo in mainstream scholarship to date.[6] Some Arvanites characterise the Arvanite settlement in Greece as the modern Dorian invasion[4][7].</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, that the theory is incorrect prestented. The Arvanites Pelasgian theory is that Albanians and Greeks are the descendants of the Pelasgians that develop two different identities, Greek and Illyrian (Albanian), and that Albanians (Arvanites including) are brothers with Greeks.According to the books of the Arvanite author Aristh Kolla. I think this theories are very unnecessary and lack encyclopedic value.</dd>

<p>If this goes - as suggested by Albanau, then we certainly have to remove all 'un-encyclopedic' theories, including that, Albanians consider the Arvanites an ethnic minority - a fact that is so thinly researched as to read like POV. But I agree that Albanau has a point about the wording and it could do with some re-phrasing. For instance:</p>
<p>"Most historians consider that the Arvanites and today's Albanians share similar roots amongst the medieval Albanian populations [5]. Other Arvanite authors forward a Pelasgian theory that Albanians and Greeks are both the descendants of the Pelasgians but developed at an early stage two different identities, Greek and Illyrian (Albanian), and that Albanians (Arvanites including) are brothers with the Greeks. A few Arvanites propose that the Arvanites were the descendants of Thraco-Illyrian tribes - hence not identical to Albanians proper;[citation needed]. These views have no echo in mainstream scholarship to date[6]. Some Arvanites characterize the Arvanite settlement in Greece as the modern Dorian invasion[4][7]." <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 09:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article is not about minorities in Greece but Arvanites</span></h2>
<p>There are articles dealing with minorities. This one is about Arvanites. Please focus. The minority issue of the Arvanites was introduced by the then President Berisha and forwarded to a degree by Gens Polo (son of the Albanian historian Polo). But I have no idea what Albanau is proposing, opposing, rejecting or forwarding! <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 10:41, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Politis the arvanites are, (or better to say was since they by force have been assimilated), a minority in Greece, because they did speak Albanian, and had in many ways a different culture from the Greek. If Arvanites were not a minority than they would not been called something else than Greeks, what do you think? It is very logically.</p>
<p>In England, we have people who were born of Scotish or Welsh grand-parents or ancestors. Some of their ancestors / parents used to speak a gaellic language. But there is no recognition of a Scotish or Welsh minority in England. Why? Because they do not want to be considered a minority. The same applies to the Arvanites, they do not want to be considered a minority in their Greek homeland. They are not Pontian (Greeks), or Alexandrian (Greeks), or Cypriot (Greeks), but Arvanites (Greeks). There is no democratic precedent where outsiders impose the qualification of 'minority' on people who do not want it - to do so is to discriminate against them and show contempt for their identity. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 17:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, we should clarify the wording with respect to "historical settlement areas" versus "present-day presence" of Arvanites. Point taken. But I'd still want to see a wording that makes it clear that basically <i>all</i> of Attica and adjacent areas was <i>solidly, predominantly</i> Arvanite-speaking up until the 19th century. They were neither a minority among a larger Greek-speaking population, nor restricted to isolated enclaves within Attica, but really covered the whole area. The sources seem to agree on this (Fourikis, Sasse and others as reported by Trudgill, Botsi, Tsitsipis etc.) <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 12:28, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All...<i>?</i> The population of the city of Athens was mostly Greek and Muslim. Also, most of Attica - including its moutains and most of its coast, was unihabited, and, of course, Attica prefecture did not exist until after independence. Perhaps you mean, <b>until</b> the 19thC., most of the inhabitants of Attica were Arvanites. Remember that with the 19thC, the influx of inhabitants after Athens became the capital, were not Arvanites. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 12:57, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, sure, the growth of the capital (from the <i>Mid-</i>19th cent. onwards) was what changed everything. Have you got any data for the inhabitants of Athens (was it a "city"??) before it became the capital? - By the way, there seems to be something interesting somewhere in Biris, where he demonstrates how the Arvanite element was so strong even within Athens until well into the mid/late 19th century that even the German immigrants who had come with the Bavarian kings got linguistically Albanianised before they got Hellenised.

<p>Data on population not immediately available. I think around 13,000 inhabitants and it went up to 35,000 by 1840. Foreign travellers to Athens spoke of Greeks and Turks and only occasionally of 'Albanians'. As for the term 'Albanisation', it cannot comfortably apply to most of the 19C because there was no central Albanian state generating an Albanian cultural matrix and there was no generic 'Albanisism', in the sense that there existed a generic 'Hellenism'. The Arvanites were local Greek Orthodox populations, speaking their own Arvanito-(Hellenic) dialects. Of course, travellers in their writings might have labelled all Greek Orthodox populations as 'Greek' and all Muslims as 'Turks'. Whatever the case, the notion of 'Albanisation' is a perception generated with hindsight, not on factual evidence (excluding the linguistic element). To conclude, I am convinced that one might more usefully trace a linguistic shift / continuum of 'Albanian' speaking populations along certain Balkan axis, as one might do with a Slav speaking shift / continuum from the southern Balkans to the Arctic. This does not mean the inhabitants along that 'shift' would identify today with Tirana, Skopje or Kiev. To this day, the creation of nation-states acts as a linguistic magnetic field that distorts certain terminology and imposes on it a 'nationalist', if not irridentist agenda. The disagreements (in our field) on wikipedia, stem from the real or perceived misappropriation of certain terms. (make sense? if not blame it on the heat) <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 14:10, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Albanian and Arvanite were used in the same way as <i>Anglos</i> and <i>Englezos</i> are used today to refer to <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English people</a> today. The Muslim Albanians were referred to as <i>Turkalvani</i>, and they were the distinct nation (millet). Even today, the Encyclopedia Britannica says that Albanian is spoken in Attica and Boeotia. Today, Christian and Muslim Albanians are considered the same nation, and the Arvanites in Greece are considered part of the Greek nation. This is a fact, but it was not always exactly like this, and only a nationalist would have a problem with pointing this out.

<dd>Thanks Telex, I of course agree with what you say. We should still try to get the whole section rewritten some time soon, Deucalionite is at least right in saying the current version is way unsatisfactory. - As for the Illyrian bit, I don't remember where it came up, can you give me a hint where it was discussed? <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 17:51, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rewrite</span></h2>
<p>As promised, I'm proposing a substantial rewrite now. I've tightened and shortened the history section and some of the others too. I've also eliminated the old "trivia" section and some of the things that had been moved from there into other parts, because they were, well, trivial. (Names of ouzo brands and the like). I also left out the bookcover pictures, because we had no fair-use rationale for them, so they would have counted as copyvios. There are, however, now better pictures available of some famous Arvanites, especially <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markos_Botsaris_a8e9.html" title="Markos Botsaris">Markos Botsaris</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laskarina_Bouboulina_8a79.html" title="Laskarina Bouboulina">Laskarina Bouboulina</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melina_Mercouri_274f.html" title="Melina Mercouri">Melina Mercouri</a> (if she is one, as Matia said). The Greek WP also has a picture of Engonopoulos. We could either use those for a new image gallery in the info box, or put them somewhere in the text.</p>
<p>Another thing I left out is the "Studies of the Arvanites" section. Two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it was giving "undue weight" to some of the less scholarly and more fringy authors (Kollias, Dede) - if we wanted the real good ones, we should have had Trudgill, Breu, Fourikis, ...</li>
<li>Second, we really don't have any such section anywhere else on Wikipedia. No article on "X" usually has a section "Studies of X". The role of various relevant authors and works should simply emerge from how they are quoted in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text is currently not quite as densely footnoted as it used to be. If anything is in doubt, just place a few fact tags; there's lots and lots of literature to back this all up but I've annotated it rather loosely for the moment. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deucalionite's proposals</span></h2>
<p>Re. these changes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;diff=69875612&amp;oldid=69792236" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanites&amp;diff=69875612&amp;oldid=69792236" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>: Deucalionite, you are (again) playing fast and loose with the two historically different concepts of Greekness: the modern, predominantly ethnolinguistic concept (speakers of the Greek language), and the historical concept of "Romaioi" (i.e. citizens of Byzantium / Greek Orthodox Christians). Where historical sources call Arvanites "Greeks", it is obviously in this latter sense; however, we are writing this article for present-day English-speaking readers and therefore need to use the term "Greek" in its present meaning. Moreover, the sources that use "Greek" <i>never</i> (as far as I can see) use it to imply "non-Albanianness", i.e. a distinction between the "Greek" Arvanites and some other, non-Greek Albanians proper.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Albanian-speaking Greek settlers": still baseless. The modern literature calls them Albanians, pure and simple.</li>
<li>Geographical designation "Greek territories of Albanitia" (and footnote 1). It's entirely irrelevant what a late-18th century Greek geographer called that area, and the question of how "Greek" it would have been back four hundred years earlier can only be left to modern historians. The footnote is irrelevant. For our purposes, the area is "what is today Albania", full stop.</li>
<li>Footnote Tselalis: Who's that guy? What's the bibliographic details? Why a full literal quote in Greek? The text is obviously not a scholarly treatment - we can <i>perhaps</i> use it somewhere as an example of how Greek authors at various times have attempted to Hellenify the Arvanites, but we can't use it as a reference to prop up the claim that they actually were Greeks.</li>
<li>Footnote Commines about the <i>Stradioti</i>: a Westerner using the term "Greek" (when? In the 16th century?) would obviously understand it in the sense of "eastern orthodox" - those guys couldn't have cared less about the finer details of Balkan nationalities. And why quote it in that terrible Katharevousa translation? Of course, all these primary sources with respect to the Stradioti are quite useless here, since we have perfectly usable secondary sources. Why not just quote the Pappas article from the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratioti.html" title="Stratioti">Stratioti</a> page and be done with it? It has quite an insightful discussion of the partial Hellenization of these Arvanite groups.</li>
<li>All the other footnotes in that section: same issue; why use primary source quotes (with no proper bibliographic reference) when you yourself have <i>obviously</i> been taking them from some secondary work? Quote that, so that we all know what you are working with.</li>
<li>..."While fighting, they would profess their identity as Greeks"... do I take it you mean that whenever those Arvanites went to battle, they would continually mutter to themselves "I'm a Greek, I'm a Greek, I'm a Greek"? Sorry, but that sentence just sounds stupid. The whole thing you've added here is just a big and weighty POV-pushing elaboration of a simple fact that was already stated adequately and in appropriately neutral encyclopedic style in the previous version: <i>"Many of them became bilingual and culturally assimilated to the Greeks"</i> If you want a reference, quote Pappas or whomever else and be done with it. The rest is just national feel-good rhetorics.</li>
<li>..."obligated themselves to helping"... That's not English.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Future Perfect's critiques?</span></h2>
<p>I think you should skip the comments as to whether I am "fast and loose" with the so-called "different" concepts of Greekness. And you wonder why we cannot get along.</p>
<p>Just so you know (since you never ask the right questions), the concept of "Greekness" possesses a paradigm that entails ethnicity, religion, culture, and language. Each component has its place in Greek identity. However, language was never the single-most defining aspect of being Greek (unless deliberately made so for ulterior political purposes; example, Athenians and the "barbarian" concept). Though Greeks have been able to speak their own tongue (in its various forms), they did not allow language to serve as a barrier in separating Greek peoples (again, unless there were ulterior political motives involved). Throughout history, Greeks have spoken non-Greek languages and incorporated foreign words into their various dialects. This, however, did not change their ethnic make-up or their ability to identify themselves as Greeks.</p>
<p>The reason why you see a "difference" between the modern Greek worldview and the medieval Greek worldview is because you are influenced by the highly politicized conflicts between classicists and medievalists. Both groups each wanted to have their respective form of Greek heritage to be the defining (and perhaps only) hallmark to the development of the modern Greek nation-state. However, social reality dictates that ethnic Greeks always had a place for both their ancient past and their medieval past.</p>
<p>As for your English-speaking readers, it would be wise to explain honestly that the autocephalous concept was a puissant influence in the minds of many different Orthodox Christian populations. Irrespective of which ecclesiastical institution had the most influence in a region or millet, the autocephalous concept remained whether Western European academia accepts this fact of social reality or not. It is through this concept that Orthodox Christian populations should be seen through the prism of ethno-religion and not just religion.</p>
<p>As for your shopping list of critiques, I have made some minor improvements to the article. However, many of the critiques you have provided are just plain nitpicking (you are an automaton editor so pat yourself on the back). To spare you the agony of reading long responses, I will only expect you to understand the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is nothing wrong with calling the Arvanites "Albanian-speaking Greek settlers". This coincides with the statement in the introductory paragraph that states how Arvanites speak a form of Albanian and self-identify as Greeks. The Arvanites' language never served as a barrier for them to help other Greeks consistently. This proves simply that language does not define ethnicity. For you to blindly concur with what Western Europe states as "pure and simple Truth" (capital "T" truth and not little "t" truth) is just plain wrong (actually it contradicts with whatever code-of-conduct you may have as a supporter of NPOV).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The geographical name "Albanitia" comes from a source, doesn't it? The source in question could very well possess information that is cited from older texts. To assume that only modern scholars have a right to give a name to the land from which the Arvanites came from is quite narrow-minded. To also assume that modern scholars (or Western European scholars) are superior to a late 18th century Greek geographer is slightly arrogant (maybe even discriminatory).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I will make whatever changes are necessary in order to somehow convince you (which would take a miracle) that information (and life in general) is not subject to what the Albanians and what Big Brother W.E. have to say. Though you have to admit, both parties do have some close political relations, which in turn does influence W.E. academia. I will continue to make any necessary additions to the article irrespective if you (or Aldux or Telex) revert the article continuously. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 23:45, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">False Judgments</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately Future Perfect, your thinking is erroneous. To assume that I am a (pseudo-)researcher (kind of offensive; <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>) shows that you criticize everything and never ask the right questions.</p>
<p>I recommend that you ask yourself the following questions before making any future judgments:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I had not continuously altered the Arvanites article, would have had a significant incentive to alter the history section that you agreed was filled with errors?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How can I be, as you claim, a "(pseudo-)researcher" if the edits I provided are sourced?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How can I be an unworthy contributor when in fact I respect your hard work in refining the history section?</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not pay attention to these nuances and you go off making false assumptions about me. You need to think beyond the typical dynamics of "good user" - "bad user". There is at least <b>three shades of grey</b> that you have yet to take into account. As for the contents of the above section, you simply dismissed what I stated about language not defining ethnicity and the autocephalous concept. Fine. However, you unfortunately assume that I came up with these concepts as if by magic.</p>
<p>No one doubts that you are a superb editor Future Perfect. However, you need to expand your mind and not just assume everything is picture perfect in the world of academia (the notion of "pure and simple" in academia can only be achieved through the finding of both compelling and conclusive evidence that coincides with reality; difficult to achieve).</p>
<p>In the end, what will you prove? That you are superior? If it makes you feel any better, I give you permission to ignore me and revert my edits that contain sources and references. So, happy reverting and good luck proving whatever point(s) you have to make.

<p>The article is missing certain facts. Here is a question the article doesn't answer: <i>When did the Arvanite migrations end?</i> The answer: <i>ca. 1600 AD</i>.</p>
<p>Troupis, Theodore K. <i>Σκαλίζοντας τις ρίζες μας. Σέρβου.</i> p. 1036. <i>Τέλος η εσωτερική μετακίνηση εντός της επαρχίας Ηπειρωτών μεταναστών, που στο μεταξύ πλήθαιναν με γάμους και τις επιμειξίες σταμάτησε γύρω στο 1600 μ.Χ.</i></p>
<p>All things (more or less) have an end. Socio-historically, it doesn't make much sense to only explain the beginning and peak of a migration and not its nadir or end. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 18:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. According to summaries of the literature elsewhere, the main waves of migrations were in the 14th and 15th century, but I've also seen 13th-16th mentioned (I've only checked the GHM report and Botsi right now, though). Is the book you are quoting a reliable historical study? <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 19:53, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the book is reliable. However, the only drawback you will probably find is that it is focused on the region of Serbou. If the other literature does not mention any other major/minor migrations past 1600 A.D., then wouldn't we have to safely assume that the migrations ended at 1600 A.D.? <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 20:09, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, even if an exact date is not provided, a circa date is better than nothing. I was thinking of putting in this sentence to complement the sentence you already wrote (your sentence: "The main waves of migration into southern Greece started around 1300 and reached a peak some time during the 14th century"). After your sentence, why not put in something simple like, "By around 1600 AD, most major Arvanite migrations ended." Even if Troupis only provides a ball-park estimate of when the migrations ended, it is still something that would verify the sentence source-wise and would generally answer the question.

<p>Here is another question the article doesn't answer: <i>What were the names of the Arvanite clans?</i> The answer: Langadinoi, Kalavritinoi, Vergos, Liapis, Brakatsis, Goutis, Schizas, Daras, Katsepas, Boras, Bolokas, Katsiapis, Katsoulas, Bouloutsos (the list could very well go on and on).</p>
<p>Troupis, Theodore K. Σκαλίζοντας τις ρίζες μας. Σέρβου (Τεύχος Ε’). p. 686. <i>Οι Λαγκαδινοί μαστόροι δεν είναι Μοραίτες. Μήτε οι Καλαβρυτινοί είναι Μοραίτες. Και οι Λαγκαδινοί και οι Καλαβρυτινοί είναι από την Ήπειρο.

<p>It seems that a lot of clans from Epirus settled in the Peloponnese. Their names are known (thanks to Troupis) and should be listed. Wouldn't make much sense to talk about the functionalities of Arvanitic phares without actually knowing the names of the phares themselves. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 23:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd find such a list interesting, but I see a problem: How many such phares are there? As you say, the list might well go on and on. If the number of notable clans is reasonably small, let's have the list. But if it's more than two or three dozen, and we have no chance of ever covering it completely, let's not have it. Better to have no list than a list that pretends to be comprehensive when in reality it's just a random selection. That would be <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">"listcruft"</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 05:51, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Troupis provides a list of the most prominent Arvanite clans in the Peloponnese (or at least the most well-known Arvanite clans). Also, the list (if placed in the article) would only provide 14 prominent Arvanite clans in the Peloponnese. This, in turn, would not pose a problem being that the list's general purpose is to verify that Arvanite clans do exist historically.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If, by any chance, someone has information pertaining to a certain number of non-prominent Arvanite clans, then one solution would be to create a separate Arvanite clans list. Of course, such a solution would be up for debate.</dd>

</dd>

<dd>Overall, the small list of prominent Arvanite clans would be verified by Troupis source-wise and would also answer the question posed in the beginning of this discussion.

<dd>I haven't seen the book you're quoting, but the sentence you cite doesn't sound like it was making any claims to either comprehensiveness, representativity, coverage of more than a small geographic area, or scholarly reliability. It may well be a nice book, but it's certainly not a scholarly treatment of Arvanite demographics, is it? If these are the names of just some clans found in the few locations mentioned there, then the total number of such clans across Greece must be quite large. Unmaintainable, I'd say. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 17:50, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, of course there are numerous Arvanite clans. I do not expect anyone to actually list every single Arvanite clan in the article. The purpose of the cited sentence is to verify the names of some of the Arvanite clans existent in the Peloponnesus. If you feel hesitant in having a list shown in the article, then why not use the names of the Arvanite clans cited by Troupis as part of a new sentence?</dd>

<dd>The sentence I was thinking of putting into the article incorporates the following: "The Arvanite clans that settled in the Peloponnesus were the Langadinoi, the Kalavritinoi, Vergos, Liapis, Brakatsis, Goutis, Schizas, Daras, Katsepas, Boras, Bolokas, Katsiapis, Katsoulas, and Bouloutsos clans."</dd>

<dd>The above sentence can either be placed in the history section or in the phares section. If placed in either one, the sentence would actually enrich the overall information provided on the article. Actually, the sentence would significantly complement the sentence you already wrote (your sentence: "Arvanites first reached Thessaly, then Attica and finally the Peloponnese."). This is one way to have Arvanite clans listed in the article without actually providing a list.

<dd>Not convinced, I'm afraid. Whether you format it as a list or include it online in the text doesn't make much of a difference. And the unreliability is demonstrated by the very summary you provide: "Kalavritinoi" is obviously not such a clan, or at least not one as it was named when they actually migrated - it obviously just means "inhabitants of Kalavrita". <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, your arguments aren't very convincing either. First, the format does make a difference when it comes to incorporating information in an article. Newspapers, magazines, books, etc. are all published with a good portion of time focused on format and typesetting. Of course, you already know this. If you still assume that formatting has no relevance, then I do recommend you read "Stop Stealing Sheep and Find Out How Type Works" (you've probably read it already). Even if you were to forego the format, the point of the entire matter is to provide in a general fashion the names of actual Arvanite clans.</dd>

<dd>Well, my main arguments are those above (not those in my last posting), and they still stand. I have severe doubts that Troupis' list is or even purports to be what you claim it is: a list of the "most prominent" or "most well-known" clans. It sounds rather like a random list of whatever names happened to come first to his mind. This list is most likely not representative, just like Kalavryta and Langadia are not representative of the set of placenames where Arvanites settled. And even if Troupis' list was intended to be representative, I'd doubt its reliability, given its decidedly non-scholarly style. But we've already spent a ridiculous amount of argument on this very minor issue, don't you think? <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 13:15, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you're missing the point. Troupis provides actual Arvanite clans. The least we could do is answer the general question I posed in the beginning of this discussion. Whether the Arvanite clans in question were prominent or not is up to interpretation. Also, to correlate unreliability to "non-scholarly" styles of writing is sort of like saying that because a reliable historian has poor penmanship, he/she should not be considered an historian. Every scholar and every historian has his/her own unique style of writing, formatting, typesetting, etc.</dd>

There is an answer to the question that is verified by a source. If the question needs to be further elaborated (ex: which Arvanite clans were prominent?), then editors will have an easier time to make changes to the article based off of the answer first presented to the general question. Really, what harm would befall the article if a basic list (or sentence) with Arvanite clans were to appear?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arvanites are Albanians</span></h2>
<p>The second group of ethnic Albanians in Greece are called the Arvanites. They migrated to what is today central and southern Greece as early as the 11th-12th centuries. These early migrations were part of Byzantine invitations to settle depopulated areas in the south of what is today Greece. Other accounts mention that they were fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks. They are said to number from 300,000 and up to 2,000,000 by some Arvanit accounts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.40.114.51 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.40.114.51.html" title="User talk:68.40.114.51">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.40.114.51_562c.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.40.114.51">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Sure, you can speculate all you want, with no sources at all, no problem... Let's see what the literature has to say:
<ul>
<li><i>"...In a survey conducted in the 1970s, 97% of Arvanite informants, despite regularly speaking in Arvanitika, considered themselves to be Greek. A similar concern with being identified as Greek is exhibited by the bilingual Arvanites of Eastern Argolid."</i> (Ethnic identity in Greek antiquity, Jonathan M. Hall)</li>
<li><i>"...The Arvanites fully identify with Greek co-nationals, and generally only the older generations now speak Arvanitika, or Albanian intermixed with Greek, Turkish and Slavic."</i> (Richard Clogg, Minorities in Greece).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>While I'm not disputing that some Arvanites may not identify as Greek and as Albanians - some may even consider themselves an ethnic group separate to both Greeks and Albanians - we're talking about a very small number and we have no proof at all that there is at least one Arvanite who does self-identify as Albanian.--<a href="../../../e/u/t/User%7EEuthymios_18b7.html" title="User:Euthymios">Euthymios</a> 23:21, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are many theories cooked up by the Arvanites on the origin, each as dubious as the next. One of my favourites is that the Gheg Albanians are the "true" Albanians (descendents of the Illyrians etc) and the Tosk Albanians are Greeks of Epirus who adopted the Gheg language (Albanized/Ghegized Greeks), thus the much heavier Greek influence on Tosk. Therefore, not only the modern Arvanites whose origin are Tosk Albanians who immigrated to central Greece in the middle ages of Greek origin, but all Tosk Albanians are of Greek origin. Incidentally the homeland of the Tosk Albanians is south of the Shkumbin River which just happens to be the northern frontier of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Epirus_35d0.html" title="Northern Epirus">Northern Epirus</a>. Therefore, the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of Northern Epirus are of Greek origin and the region should be ceded to Greece. "Albania" should be limited to the traditional homeland of the "true" Albanians - the Gheg Albanians. Thulium 10:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Actually the Tosk Albanians who did have Greek origins would have been a mix of the Gheg Albanians and original Greek inhbitants, therefore making them still primarily Albanian, having the culture, language and origins.The Tosks are by no means merely Albanized Greeks and the disinction of them as Albanian from Greeks is long as nay historical record can account. No matter what Greek origins they may have, they would still also be of Albanian origins.65.92.92.176 08:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Renewed discussion about ethnicity</span></h2>
<p>A renewed debate about the ethnic characteristics of the Arvanites was closed and archived here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;oldid=99488017" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;oldid=99488017" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. Please do not continue this discussion. The question of how "Albanian" and how "Greek" the Arvanites are and were was discussed for one and a half years. The answer to the question is now in the article. Read it. And read the literature. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 14:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
