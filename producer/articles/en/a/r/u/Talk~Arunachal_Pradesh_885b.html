<p>I agree what you say. However, the Christians are growing fast and traditional religions are in decline, although it needs to be somewhat neutralised. Well, I think you follow up at the links stated on the links page.</p>

<dd>About the Christian population growth, the same can be said in an encyclopedic tone rather than accusing missionaries of "killing" tribal customs.

<p>The only reason it's growing so fast is because they're trying covert as much as possible in asia and africa. It's practically dead in europe and it will probably die in 100 years in america. too bad it'll take so long</p>
<p>that's because xtianity is repressive and the clergy is full of pedophiles.</p>
<p>The above statement can only be from a filthy hindu beggar. Choke on a dick and die you hindu scum. May be if hinduism was not such a dirty religion with it's caste system and other filthy practices you could speak some. I am from Arunachal Pradesh and proud of it. Hindu's are our oppressors. They treat any mongoloid looking north easterner very badly every time we go to India.</p>
<p>Look at what hinduism did to India.. It's full of beggars. The country is poor and people die on the streets. The west has Christianity it's flourishing and all Indians want to go there to work for a fist full of $$. So stop talking non sense and shut the fuck up you hindu scum.</p>

<p>I don't hate Christianity. But I cannot tolerate the way the Europeans and Americans are doing to Asians, and acculturalisation is really taking place. You said that <b>Christianity is not dead at all</b> is all nonsencial. In America and Europe, 90% of the population are Christians. Where the heck you said that it's dead?</p>
<p>To <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a>:</p>
<p>I have already cleaned up slightly on the article, notably the Christians. However, in relations to the External Links in this older version, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arunachal_Pradesh&amp;oldid=10067324" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arunachal_Pradesh&amp;oldid=10067324" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, I think that it should be put up, but in a different orientation. See how I did on <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_Buddhism_4073.html" title="Korean Buddhism">Korean Buddhism</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I hope that we can help together by cleaning up the article, making it similar to your <b><a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikkim.html" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a></b> style in a month's time.</p>

<dd>I've had a look at the external links. Most of the articles are not published by reputed media organisation. We need credible links, one that is published by established media organisations, not some shady websites having a propaganda to achieve. Next there will always be VHP rants on conversion. Everyone in India take their sayings lightly as their "proofs" are known to be dubious. References of conversions should be taken from reputed sites such as the <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_of_India_92b2.html" title="Times of India">Times of India</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Express_be3f.html" title="Indian Express">Indian Express</a> etc.</i> where a report or investigation is done by a reporter rather than publishing of sayings of an extremist member of an organisation. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> 18:58, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not denying that there is a growth in Christian population in Arunachal Pradesh. What I am saying is that if anything unethical is going on, a credible media source should be cited. I have some matter on AP (a few reference books), though AP remains India's least known of state. I collect information from newspapers and add the information to Wikipedia. AP is rarely mentioned, though I have some info on the new species of monkeys recently discovered there. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> 18:55, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The xtians in america and europe are only nominal. They don't really practice true xtianity. Yes, there is some growth with evangelicals. But they mostly send there funds to convert in Asia and africa. The pope himself self even stated that soulds in asia need to harvested. In doing so, they start more wars and exploit more poor people. NicolasP is a product of such work done.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangerous-Boy_5f44.html" title="User:Dangerous-Boy">D-Boy</a> 23:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Look at Korea. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_in_Korea_35c2.html" title="Christianity in Korea">Christians</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_Buddhism_4073.html" title="Korean Buddhism">Buddhists</a> are torn between half-half, and torn by identity! To me, I do not hate christianity, but I believe that the evangelicals have some very wicked and bad intentions among the spiritually weak Asians. Yes, they can preach and convert, but I think that that should only be done in small numbers. I also believed that they should educate the people about the differences between Christian and indigenious religions seperately, not just <b>merely</b> scaring people to convert and hypnotise them to convert by saying that <b>oh, we know that we are sinners</b>, and so on. In Singapore, many of these people has done such stupid things.</li>

<dd>Mr Tan, I'm afraid I cannot commit 100% of my effort on Arunachal Pradesh at this moment. I'm still going through the extremely stressful after effects of taking care of the Sikkim page when it was an FAC. I really need a wikibreak. I have cleaned up the info table if you've noticed. Please go ahead with your work on this page. I will add what I know on AP soon. Meanwhile what is really needed are pictures and references on the state. Once you fill in some more info I can start to work because as of now I am pretty busy. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> 20:38, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Go ahead then. I will improvise and clean up the article. However, after your wikibreak, can you please notify me that you have returned? By that time, I will tell you what and where I need your help. I will also add some pictures in it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good Luck.</p>

<p>Mr Tan: Is the image of the districts of AP copyright free? You would have to tag the image if it is under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> or in <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Domain_4d3d.html" title="Public Domain">Public Domain</a>. I've checked my references -- <i>Manorama Year Book 2003'</i> for Arunachal Pradesh but I have nothing much to add. I just have basic information on the districts, that 80% of the people are tribal and 2/3rd of the state is under forest cover. Not much to add I'm afraid. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> 18:22, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See my reply on <a href="../../../s/o/u/Talk%7ESouth_Tibet_cbca.html" title="Talk:South Tibet">Talk:South Tibet</a>. As for the map, you'll notice that Arunachal Pradesh/South Tibet is in light blue, which equals "Claimed by PRC as part of TAR" It's not in red, orange, or yellow, which signifies that it's part of Historic Tibet (as claimed by Tibetan exile groups.)</dd>

<dd>When did the Indians call it Arunachal Pradesh? After 1972? Before 1972 it was called as North East Frontier Agency (NEFA),right? <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsyrie_4e02.html" title="User:Ksyrie">Ksyrie</a> 11:34, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but that's not the point. The Tibetan's didn't call it South Tibet. --<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 01:20, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tibetan exile groups are living in India, so they're probably not going to repay India's hospitality by making claims on what India considers to be its own territory. But this wasn't the case before the move to Dharamsala:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1938, the Survey of India published a map of Tibet, which showed the Tawang tract as part of that country. Even the first edition of Jawaharlal Nehru's Discovery Of India showed the Indo-Tibetan boundary as running at the <b>foot of the hills</b>.</i> [my bold - this is in agreement with the Chinese claim line today!] <i>The Tibetans did not accept this 'annexation' of the Tawang tract and challenged the British attempts to expand their government into this area. But they tacitly accepted the rest of the McMahon demarcation. ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Indian government did move into the Tawang tract in force in 1951, overriding Chinese/Tibetan protests. ...</i> <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/21spec.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/21spec.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Tawang, at least, was ethnically Tibetan, and regarded as a part of Tibet by Tibetans. But obviously these claims have been dropped by the Government of Tibet in Exile.</p>
<p>As for what the Tibetans called / call South Tibet, I suspect that there's a name out there somewhere, but until someone who knows Tibetan shows up, this will unfortunately remain a mystery to us. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 13:30, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since much of the area of this state is claimed by the PRC, it would be useful to know how the nothern boundary of the state as depicted on the map relates to the various demarcation lines described in the article -- the McMahon Line, the Line of Actual Control, etc. Also, which of these lines are used as reference for the area and population stats in the infobox? --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a> 19:51, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The area of Arunachal Pradesh is 83,743 sq km. I know that China accuses India of possessing some 90,000 sq km of Chinese territory, mostly in Arunachal Pradesh. 90,000 - 83,743 = 6,257 sq km... Maybe somebody knows all the states of India which are involved in dispute? Is Assam involved in it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>90,000 sq km is almost certainly a gross overestimate. The actual area in dispute doesn't include all of AP and is probably 60,000 to 70,000 sq km. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 13:30, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: I have read N. Maxwell's book about the war between India and China. Quotation: "Chou En-lai replied to Nehru's letter on September 8, 1959, and reaffirmed the basic point that the Sino-Indian boundary had never been delimited, further arguing that the 56,000 square miles between the McMahon Line and the foothils had been Chinese". 1 mile = 1.6 kilometre. 56,000*1.6=89,600 sq km (~90,000 sq km). Articles about the Simla Convention mentions 90,000 sq km too. So, it cannot be a gross overestimate...</p>
<dl>
<dd>... but it has to be a gross estimate. After all, we can't fit 90,000 km² into 83,743 km², it just doesn't make sense to have the disputed area *larger* than Arunachal Pradesh when it's *inside* Arunachal Pradesh. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 00:57, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please stop trying to cover up facts, I have been to Arunachal Pradesh myself and talked to the people there. The Baptist Church has been funding several terrorist groups, the biggest of which is the NSCN. They themselves have admitted to forceful conversions and violence.</p>
<p>I am concerned about this cover up and also about the fact that so many people support this violence .It seems that these tribals in Arunachal Pradesh are emphatically labelled as non Hindu, except when there is violence, when they become Hindu fanatics.</p>

<p>It's better to be Christian in my land then be a dirty hindu. Hindus are our oppressors. They call us tribals and treat us like untouchables. It may be acceptable behavior in India, but in my home, please keep your dirty hindu ideas to yourself.</p>

<p>How come only Adi,Monpa and Nishi are official languages of Arunachal Pradesh. If you see the diversity of Arunachal tribes and sub-tribes you will find every district are speaking different dialects. Only Hindi and English are mostly spoken languages. I myself donot speak Adi,Monpa and Nishi dialect........ and am very much from arunachal pradesh. When you create any information about particular state it should have proper information otherwise it creates confusion for every one. Most appropriate and true information about arunachal pradesh is that every districts speaks own dialects and most importantly hindi is spoken almost every corner of arunachal pradesh.</p>

<p>"Arunachal Pradesh is divided into fifteen districts, each administered by a district collector, who see to the needs of the local people. Especially along the Tibetan border, the Indian army has considerable control over the territory due to the continuing concern about Chinese intentions. In the Northern areas and areas near the Indo-Burmese border and Nagaland, where Naga-Christian militant groups have been alleged of harassing the local people, special permits are needed to enter the area."</p>
<p>What do we mean by Indian Army has considerable control. I propose to change it "Control" to "presence". Also, a permit issued by the Secretary (political) called the Inner Line Permit(ILP) is mandatory to enter any district of the state, and not only the 'Naga-christian' dominated areas.
