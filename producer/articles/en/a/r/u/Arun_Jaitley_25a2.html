<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/u/Arun_Jaitley_25a2.html" title="Edit section: Track Record">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Track Record</span></h2>
<p>Arun Jaitley as General Secretary has managed 6 Assembly elections as of February 2007. Most recently, he oversaw the BJP's success in Punjab.</p>
<p><b>Gujarat</b> In 2002, Arun Jaitley helped his close associate, <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narendra_Modi_d1c1.html" title="Narendra Modi">Narendra Modi</a> win the Gujarat Assembly Elections with a landslide mandate, winning 126 out of 182 seats. This partnership has rewarded Arun Jaitley with Rajya Sabha nominations.</p>
<p><b>Madhya Pradesh</b> In 2003, Arun Jaitley, managed the Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh. He along with <a href="../../../u/m/a/Uma_Bharti_0f19.html" title="Uma Bharti">Uma Bharti</a> won a thumping majority of 173 out of 230 in the MP Assembly. Uma Bharti, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Minister_1cd5.html" title="Chief Minister">Chief Minister</a> and Arun Jaitley would then fall out leading to the former's expulsion.</p>
<p><b>Karnataka</b> Arun Jaitley was specifically put in charge of Karnataka, which went to polls simultaneously with the Lok Sabha in may 2004. Karnataka is the only southern state in which the BJP has a sizeable presence and a positive mandate for the BJP was expected. The results were excellent. The BJP won 18 out of 26 Lok Sabha Seats in the State and emerged as the single largest party in the Assembly, capturing 83 seats, as opposed to the Congress' 68 and the Janata Dal Secular's 59. The Congress and JDS forged a coalition to form the government with the Congress' Dharam Singh becoming Chief Minister. This however, did not last. In January 2006, disgruntled JDS leaders, led by H D Kumaraswamy decided to form a coalition government in the state in partnership with BJP. The understanding was that after half the remaining term of the Assembly, the BJP would have its own Chief Minister in the State. As of now, the BJP's B S Yediyurappa is the Deputy Chief Minister in the State.</p>
<p><b>Bihar</b> In 2005, after the February elections resulted in a hung verdict, re-elections were held in November. This election was fought by the BJP in coalition with the <a href="../../../j/d/%28/JD%28U%29_0eff.html" title="JD(U)">JD(U)</a>. He was the chief strategist of the NDA combine. <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitish_Kumar_5937.html" title="Nitish Kumar">Nitish Kumar</a> of the JDU was instated as Chief Minister and the BJP's Sushil Kumar Modi was installed as Deputy Chief Minister.</p>
<p><b>West Bengal</b> In 2006, BJP President <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajnath_Singh_e8ef.html" title="Rajnath Singh">Rajnath Singh</a> shifted Arun Jaitley's charge from Tamil Nadu to West Bengal. Traditionally, West Bengal is a Left stronghold. The Left swept the 2006 assembly elections leaving no seat for the BJP.</p>
<p>""Punjab"" In February 2007, Arun managed the BJP's campagaign in Punjab and coordinated a strategy between the party and its ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal. Out of the 23 seats the party contested, it won 19, a a figure that surpassed all expectations and is the party's best-ever performance in the state.</p>
