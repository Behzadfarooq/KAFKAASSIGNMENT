<p>"Aryan (/ɑːrjən/)is an English language". Really??? Source, please.</p>
<p>--Goldwin 18:03, 12 december 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't be daft. It's in English dictionaries so it's part of the English language. There is no need to "source" something so obvious. Like many other English words it was originally borrowed from another language. The point is that the form "Aryan" is English, just as the form "Arier" is German. It has specific meanings in English which it does not have in Sanskrit. The purpose of this sentence is to avoid claims that there is some true "original" meaning of the word and that other usages should be excluded or declared in the article to be "distortions", "erroneous" etc. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 17:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>attention please it's in English dictionaries so it's part of the English language!!!</p>

<dd>Yes, that's what defines being part of the English language, just like "restaurant", "eskimo" and "curry". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 11:09, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OP, re-read the sentence.. it does not say "Aryan is an English language." It says it is a word in the English language.Qureus1 08:41, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Listen carefully...instad of just going by what Paul said, why dont u read the information YOURSELF...If u read the history of the Aryans, meaning the actual text such as The Vedas, you will what a joke the information is by Paul Theime.</p>

<dd>Have you ever actually read the Vedas? Have you ever read the UPanishads?

</dl>
<p>Under my Herodotus talk section I point out how Arayan could mean stranger to the Ancient Greeks seeing that they had three major recorded wars with them over a period of 2000 years.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of the foremest scholars on this subject is not any kind of a joke. The point of this passage is to refer to theories and speculations about the <i>earliest</i> meaning of the word, <i>not</i> to the more specialised and developed meanings it has in Sanskrit. Thieme is trying to work out how the meaning of the word emerged in spoken laguage before any of the scriptures were written. So you are not going to find this meaning in a "Hindu book" are you? Thieme is speculating that its earliest meaning had to do with hospitality - with people who were "strangers" in the sense that they were not your own family and friends but who would nevertheless help your family rather than steal from it or try to murder you all if you approached them. In other words the earliest recoverable meaning of "arya", in his opinion, was something like "hospitable tribes" as opposed to "barbarian tribes" and from that developed the later meanings associated with people who, as it were, follow the moral path, or are "noble". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 14:08, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Precisely, but since that can be read up in detail on Wikipedia itself, I just don't see why we have to point this out to everyone who stumbles on these talkpages instead of just <i>reading</i>. This is an encyclopedia, not a giant reference desk where stewards jump to rephrase our content to suit your individual cognitive faculties. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:26, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I feel the same way....What makes Paul and his strange opinions so important? Their are lots of scholars who have written strange opinions about anything in life. BUt this is a page about Aryans and should stick with facts. WHen you mention the strange opinion from Paul, and so fast in the article, people tend to take it as fact....IF his opinion is soooo important to you, then either put it at the bottom of the page or make a new article up for him!....I mean why are u picking and choosing his opinon? Why dont u get every scholars strange opinion on Aryans....U dont make any sense <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 18:45, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because there's nothing "strange" about it, it's perfectly normal. He is an imporant scholar. The opinion is attributed to him, not presented as mere "fact", but it is a notable one, nor is his view unique to him. Other theories are also given. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 00:05, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So ok let me recap here...Their is no Aryan scritpure saying that the word means stranger...Their is no Aryan writing that says anything about the Aryan word having to do with "Stranger"....And yet your telling me that we have to show Paul Theimes opinion on how he thought that it meant stranger?....Im sorry how does that make sense? <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 01:15, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because he is reconstructing the meaning on the basis of surviving usage, notably the fact that in the RV some tribes are referred to as "Arya" and others are not, and because of the connotations of the term in early Iranian texts. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 01:22, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Your not answering my question....Have you ever actually read an ACTUAL ARYAN SCRIPTURE? Have u ever read any Aryan scripture from India? Their is nooo mention of Aryan meaning stranger. THe world Aryan is mentioned god knows how many times, an has no reference to the word stranger.....So why does it matter what this Paul Theime says?

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your questions <i>have</i> been answered. Yes I have read a number of Hindu scriptires, but that's rather beside the point, since we are discussing what Thieme says, not what I say, and anyway, the word is not "owned" by Indians. Iran has something of a claim on it too. If you want more details on Thieme's arguments, go read Thieme's books. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 14:40, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Your not making sense....In ancient times their was no seperation between the Indians &amp; Iranians...They were the same people....Their was no boarder between India &amp; Iran...It was all considered one land....THE LAND OF THE ARYANS....I never implied the word was OWNED by India...But the Aryan teachings were made by....Hindus....and where did Hindus live?....Around INdia &amp; Iran....India &amp; Iran became seperated, gradually over time, when Islamic invaders came.....But listen...you are not answering my question as alaways.....NO Aryan scripture talks about an Invasion, MIgration, the word "stranger", or any of the stuff this Paul guy believes in....SO for the 100th time im asking you again....Why is this part of the Aryan page? <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 19:21, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well this is already well beyond Thieme's theory, but the sad thing about the article and nearly all the talk is that there's nary a mention of the Avesta. The Vedas are not, in any way shape or form, the only source of textual knowledge about the ancient Aryans (incidentally, "hinduism" didn't even exist until the last of the Upanishads was being written, several hundred years after the RV--Vedic culture is not Hindu culture). You're also implying that no political boundaries existed in ancient times--that's patently false. At least as early as the Achaemenids, the easternmost part of that empire was bounded by the Indus; the Zoroastrians were also very culturally separated from the Vedic culture long before that. That said, getting back to the topic, Paul Thieme was a highly respected philologist and indoeuropeanist (i.e., he specialized in indoeurpoean languages). His theory on the meaning of the proposed PIE root word *əri meaning "stranger", right or wrong, has been a very influential on other indo-iranicists and it is a verifiable source (read the Wiki Rules--it doesn't have to be correct). I personally disagree with this theory, but he was hardly a fool--there is a well-known issue in the Vedas regarding odd usages of the word <i>ari</i> to describe certain hostile people that Thieme was trying to figure out.--<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmijisti_b66e.html" title="User:Almijisti">Almijisti</a> 06:40, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just to follow up on the specific matter of what I called "odd usages: of the word <i>ari</i>. I mistakenly left the impression that the word actually means hostile persons, but rather should have noted that the word is often used to mean "wealthy", albeit in a distinctly perjorative sense--a phenomenon that is well known to both western and Indian sholars of the Veda. I prefer Bailey's derivation of the words <i>ari</i>, <i>arya</i>, and cognates as derived from I-Ir *ar-, meaning "to acquire" or "to beget", thus the later common usage of <i>arya</i> as "noble" (undeniable in Classical Sanskrit) may simply connote one who is well born in the sense of having wealth. See, e.g., Bailey, H.W., "Iranian arya- and daha", Transactions of the Philological Society 1959; Bailey, H.W., The Second Stratum of Indo-Iranian Gods," in Mithraic Studies. Proceedings of the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies, v. 1. Manchester 1975.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Examples of such usage include RV viii,2,14:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The utterance of a cow-less man, even while it is being recited, the <i>Ari</i> ignores, he ignores also the song while it is being sung." (Bailey's translation, Bailey 1959).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Other examples of ambiguous usages of <i>ari</i> cited by Thieme occur in RV vii,83,5 and vii,21,9. Thieme, P., <i>Die Fremdling im Rigveda</i>, Heidelberg 1938. He compares this usage with the Latin <i>hospes</i> and <i>hostes</i> meaning rival and host depending upon the context. Thieme, P. "Vorzarathustriern un bei Zarathustra," ZDMG 107, p. 67-104, 1957. The term <i>arya</i> is itself relatively rare in the RV and the eponymous group, <i>ari</i> is typically treated almost contemptuously in this, the oldest of the Veda. This ambiguity is not an "orientalist" theory, it is evident in the texts themselves and was even commented upon by numerous indigenous commentators for centuries. I disagree with Thieme's theory, as stated, but it is simply naive to pretend that the word <i>ari</i> (which is the word Thieme was commenting upon, not <i>arya</i>) isn't highly ambiguous.--<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmijisti_b66e.html" title="User:Almijisti">Almijisti</a> 04:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cant believe in 2006 their are still people who believe in an Aryan invasion theory....as anyone actually ever read an Aryan scripture?....THey came from India &amp; Iran!...It was all just one land known as the Land of the Aryans....I mean ADOLF HITLER believed in the Aryan invasion theory....What does that tell you? <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 05:55, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aryan invasion theory is largest lie i have heard, unbeleivable that after the world found out that hitler was a lie, one of his lies continue and that is the aryan invasion theory.</p>
<p>you have to look at the cold hard facts, no presumptions here. while in iran the kings were playing polo, and had mastered agriculture and music, while in egypt they had advanced documenting systems and india too there was much advancement - the northern europeans were still living in caves and using clubs - there was a ridiculous gulf between the east and the west back then, it took 5000 years for the agricultre revolution to reach britain ( funny how britain was the last to get the agriculture revolution, but the ones who started the next ones , industrial revoluiton) nevertheless it is silly to even consider a less advanced group of people to take over a region wich was the cradle of civilisation.</p>
<p>could the aboroginals of australia ever come and occupy britain and impose there culture on the british empire. considering this and just this, only a feeble mind could ever beleive the aryan invasion theory.</p>
<p>there is not enough time to even point out the colder harder evidences from iran and india wich proves the aryans origins and identity. IRAN the word itself mean LAND OF THE ARYANS, darius carved and claimed himself of aryan lineage unto stone thousands of years ago, names like eraj wich are also thousands of years old mean LEADER OF THE ARYANS. the word aryan riddles the avestan and sanskrit, iran and india aryan connection is evident in the mass use of the swatstika in there holy sites. heredotus himself, the greatest biased author of all claimed the iranians to be aryans.</p>
<p>DARIUS tried to invade Greece a people who were always indigenous to their land &amp; the neolithic indigenous greeks &amp; italians such as the villanova culture always decorated their burial items &amp; sites with swastikas before the rise of the Persian empire, does not the swastika belong to ancient neolithic greece &amp; rome it would still be used in later times. Dont forget Alexander the Great hellenised Persia &amp; this is where the Iranian got their name from the Greek Arayan.123.3.2.189 18:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>it is true that germans and the irish are in ways aryan, but im sure as hell it did not start from cold landscape of northern europe. remember that people first emerged in africa, developed themselves in the middle east and moved around the world.... nobody originated from europe/ lets not forget that cool genetic discovery they made that us white people are genetic mutants, that black skin was the original colour and those who have mutated skin gene are white! hahaha that sucks for us.</p>

<p>Hello. Well, the first edit of mine in the Wiki world will be to comment on this talk section. There is a wealth of archaeological and historical evidence from other regions that can be utilized in support of an historical definition of <i>arya</i>. After all, as little as 10% of the original Avesta survives and only a single redaction of the RV survives, though as many as five might have existed at one time. In contrast, the entire land mass is still there (minus what is lost to the earthquakes that occasionally rattle the region) and a surprising number of sites have been studied and many more lie buried (dozens of unearthed mounds are visible from the air just in the Helmand valley, a particularly important region for this research). Getting back to the Thieme theory of <i>ari</i> means <i>stranger</i> or rather <i>guest</i>, it is based entirely on the philological reconstruction, itself open to doubt though, as noted below, <i>arya</i> very well could be used to describe not only a stranger, but a mortal foe.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>arya</i> does not refer to either an ethnic or linguistic group in the Bronze Age texts (i.e., Gathas and RV ii-vii, as well as later anachronistic texts such as the SV and RV x. In these texts, the distinction between <i>arya</i> and <i>anarya</i> is simply that between those who practice the soma ritual and those who do not--regardless of ethnicity. Indeed, this is the only consistent connotation of the word across the spectrum of the texts. Some <i>arya</i> are clearly foes of the composers of the texts, and some <i>dasa</i> are clearly allies. Whatever it might have meant in the PIE era, by the time the texts are depicting (the Gathas are probably the only contemporaneous texts in the whole literature) <i>arya</i> denoted "those who practice the soma ritual"; perhaps this can be equated with "civilized" in a broad sense, but then there are many cruel and primitive <i>arya</i> (Zarathrustra constantly rails against the evils wrought by certain <i>arya</i>).--<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmijisti_b66e.html" title="User:Almijisti">Almijisti</a> 05:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>aryans are one of the root races in theosophy. this article needs to point this out.</p>
<p>- I agree. Helena Blavatsky's use of the term "Aryan" had profound impact on race research and philosophy throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, and there should at least be a short paragraph about that and a link to Blavatsky. However, it should be pointed out that the most relevant significance of Blavatsky's work was to inspire widespread European study of Aryan history.</p>

<p>I have often heard of the Aryans moving around in the 4th &amp; 2nd Milleniums BC but have never heard of any of the evidence upon which this has been based. I do think it would be a good idea to put a question over references like this until the sources for their emmergence can be found. I have read a lot of work by soviets and those under a recieved soviet hegemony where they are trying to assert that central Asia was Satem culture in order to justify Russian (Slavs are also Satem) occupations in those areas and in preparation of the annexing of Afghanistan -which never happened. The satem theory has fallen out of favour but the legacy of Satemizing the area remains i.e. in that those satem peoples were in fact Indo-Aryan. Anyway all archeological &amp; Historical evidence points to a gradual conquest to the East &amp; south of Indo-Aryan peoples starting from Kurdistan in the 1st Millenium BC. There is nothing Indo-Aryan before that just a lot of speculation. Plenty of caucasoid skulls but as we all know not all caucasoids are Indoeuropeans. I am not someone who says this because I always offer strange bits of theories from here and there in case someone with more knowledge can add to it or extract the truth from it and expose the origin of the falshood. But when one of these theories finds its way into the mainstream without having had this process applied to it, I am critical. So can anyone help by offering the original sources for these theories? Or is it all based upon religious scriptures without any kind of historical coroboration? (in which case the suspect nature of the theory should be explained in the article)<a href="../../../z/e/s/User%7EZestauferov_8a0a.html" title="User:Zestauferov">user:zestauferov</a></p>

<p>The Persians may have invaded or waged a war upon them they were very warlike</p>
<p>Yeah right. And on what evidence is this based? DONT MIX LINGUISTICS WITH HISTORY! - Linguistics is part of the evidence. Genetic evidence is another part of it. Archeology is a part of it, and so is comparative religion, not to mention Iran and India's internal histories. The Aryan Invasion Theory stands on high ground. Speaking of which, didn't there used to be a category in this section on the Aryan Invasion Theory?</p>
<p>"Aryan Invasion Theory stands on high ground"??? DEAR EDITORS, PLEASE TAKE A NOTE: With the Discovery of Dwarka, the ancient city of Lord Krishna, THE ARYAN INVASION THEORY HAS BEEN FALSIFIED. Please take note of it, and check this article: <a href="http://www.indiacause.com/columns/OL_051212.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.indiacause.com/columns/OL_051212.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiacause.com/columns/OL_051212.htm</a> I suppose the Invasion theory has no solid ground or proof. If Max Muller is believed, there is enough grounds for Mahabharata to be treated as a fact and an actual accord of an ancient Nuclear War.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hardly a new discovery. See <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkaim.html" title="Arkaim">Arkaim</a>. The article you refer to also says that Japan was an Indo-Aryan culture. That's an improvement on Hitler. He only gave the Japs the title of "honorary Aryans". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 23:12, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason for Hitler saying that was because he allied with them. He would obviously want to keep on good terms, but the fact that Japs have the same bloodline has Indians or even european is stupidity beyond the needed. It is known now that the Aryan Invasion theory is false and was only created due to eurocentrism, but the fact that people still argue for it proves that there is still ignorance which needs to be thrown out. STOP trying to say that ANYONE BUT INDIANS AND PERSIANS ARE ARYAN.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Maybe I should put this in the AIT page, but since it's raised here, here goes. Early assumptions of when Indoaryans (a term I prefer to differentiate them from the Iranoaryans) arrived in India, or that they "arrived" at all, were based on very inadequate knowledge of the material cultures of ancient Iran and India. There were no Bronze Age excavations in the entire region in Muller's day--not even Mohenjo-Daro or Harappa had been discovered. When excavations finally took place late in the 19th century, the hypotheses of early Indo-Iranicists were uncritically adopted by many of these archaeologists, resulting in much circular reasoning. That is, archaeological dating (pre-Carbon 14) was based upon linguistic conclusions about dates that themselves were originally based upon outdated or non-existent archaeological evidence. Most "dating" of I-Ir cultures by linguists simply lacks credibility in archaeological circles today. It has, in fact, proven practically impossible to date the RV based upon material remains, however. The RV rarely describes any distinctive objects and those that are described, tend to be ritual paraphernalia, almost entirely composed of impermanent organic materials. The geography of the RV covers a wide area including the Kabul River region, the Punjab, the Indus, and the westernmost reaches of the Ganges. It necessarily follows that the RV was composed at a time when it's users were familiar with these regions (or at least had a cultural memory of them). Beyond that, using the RV itself to try to date the culture is an exercise in futility--it's not a history book, it's a collection of ritual hymns that, while containing some quasi-historical material, was never intended for such purpose.</p>
<p>It is a simple fact that nowhere in the RV is migration or invasion mentioned, though it is, however, full of violence. But AIT was never based upon anything in the texts. It was and is a theory based upon the undisputable fact that I-Ir languages are related (sometimes very closely) to other IE languages. When the Indus Valley sites were excavated by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, it was he who first came up with what is now the "classical" Aryan Invasion Theory--he based this upon the mistaken belief that the cities were destroyed by some sort of carnage (there is some evidence of fires, but this evidence eventually proved to be limited in scope and ambiguous at best), and his own notoriously poor comphrension of the texts themselves. AIT was, nevertheless, a reasonable theory when it was in high vogue, regardless of whether it is or can be proven wrong (it's doubtful that any explanation of the IE dispersion can be "proven" for the reasons stated above). At present, there is far too much emotionally charged nationalist or anti-nationalist sentiment that has "invaded" Vedic studies such that little useful research into the question has been done in over 20 years; meanwhile up to the rise of the Taliban, valuable archaeological work was taking place in the Helmand valley in particular, and throughout Afghanistan in general, and also in Margiana--all of which sheds light on the problem. I have my own theories and research, of course, but WP's well-considered prohibition against allowing original research prevents their disclosure at this time.--<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmijisti_b66e.html" title="User:Almijisti">Almijisti</a> 05:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>69.29.255.17 23:28, 16 November 2006 (UTC)Yes, there is a linguistic connection. The AIT however, vastly predates the excavation of certain revelatory Harappan artifacts. Harappa does also tend to disprove the AIT in two key ways. It is a thriving city with no signs of invasion or foreign influx, whose civilization is thriving in the exact same spot at the exact same time that the Aryans are supposed to be. Finally, the AIT as a real theory and not a genocide tool was really used to explain the arrival of the Vedas into India. Well, the city of Harappa is where the single oldest piece of Vedic artwork has been found. I'm trying to find any information that the Aryans actually existed. All the evidence I can find points to the acts of the Aryans being falsely attributed to them from a number of other civilizations.</p>

<p>The initial definition of Aryan in this article as "the people who spoke the parent language of the Indo-European languages" is only one of the modern western understandings, let alone modern Indian and Iranian understandings.

<p>Yet this is an article about "Aryan" and not what Europeans think of it... good game.</p>
<p>"Aryan" was originally the term used to self-describe a nationality. That much is clear from the statement of Emperor Darius of Iran ("I am...an Aryan having Aryan lineage."). Furthermore, Herodotus was quite clear and saying describing several distinct groups (Persians, Medes, Scythians, etc.) as being originally part of the same Aryan group. What the ancients said is the most reliable source of information, because for them it was recent history. What the Europeans said about Aryans was based on a theory that Europeans, particularly Germanic Europeans, were racially and historically connected to the ancient Aryans. These theories are still just theories today, but are supported by linguistic and genetic evidence. Religious evidence of ancient connections is unreliable because Aryan / Zoroastrian religion was spread throughout Europe again after Alexander's invasion of the Persian Empire, and much more so when the Roman Empire adopted Zoroastrian Mithraism as the official religion of the Roman Empire, under the title "Sol Invictus". The swastika itself was a Mithrain symbol, but its existence in Europe cannot be used as evidence of the Euro-Aryan connection unless its archeology comes from pre-Roman Empire times.</p>
<p>its archeology does come from pre roman times, before Alexander the Great even in neolithic italy &amp; greece such as the villanova culture burial items were decorated with swastikas signifying a particular religious belief, the swastika was a sacred indo european symbol in neolithic times before the bronze age, example italy &amp; greece.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Naqs-i Rustam inscription, at A,8-15, does not necessarily imply that Arya was a self-referant for a nationality or tribe, as you claim. An equally good translation of this is "I am Darius the King...and Arya of Arya seed," but the most one can say is that to Darius, <i>arya</i> was a bloodline. I guess I don't know what you mean by "nationality" here, given that the very concept of a nation is a late 17th century CE invention--doesn't this just beg the question? In the RgVeda, the <i>arya</i> are contrasted with <i>dasyu</i> on the basis of adherence to the sacrifices: "With distinct judgement know the Arya and those who are Dasyu; to the one who has the Barhis, make those who lack vows of worship subject by punishing them." (RV i,51,8). Besides, even if <i>arya</i> denoted a certain tribe or "peoples" by the time of Darius, this is indisputedly centuries after the RgVeda and the Gathas were composed, so it doesn't prove anything about what the word might have meant originally. <i>Arya</i> is never used in any lineage-sense at all in either the Gathas or the RV; it refers to one's status within the society that the text is directed to. In the case of the Gathas, the society was those who were mazda.yasnins (worshippers of mazda); in the case of the RV it's a bit more complicated because the text was, by its own terms, directed only to those who performed the sacrifices, thus it was written for the <i>arya</i> alone; nevertheless, the sociolocial environment of the RV was not homogenous and not strictly I-Ir, either. The RV itself contains numerous Dravidian and Munda borrowings, and even suggests that many non-Arya had prominent status in the society, despite their failure to perform the sacrifices.--<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmijisti_b66e.html" title="User:Almijisti">Almijisti</a> 05:28, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Believe it or not, the oppression by the British Raj was actually very minimal. It is about as much oppression as the American colonists received. This concept is commonly misunderstood.

<p>This article, on such a contentious topic, needs to <i>identify</i> the major authors of the ideas, and follow the scholarship forward in time, tracing it as it developed. A start might be to distinguish theories of "Aryan" linguistics from theories of "Aryan" race.

<p>There is only one true definition of the word "Aryan" -- it means people who descended from the Iranians, Indians, or some Europeans. It means nothing else... all the other bastardizations of the word were done by stupid Europeans (mostly continentals). Shashir 05:42, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your statement is misleading. It is believed that nomadic groups, as they moved north out of Africa, settled in the Middle East, then begane moving in various direction. By your definition, everyone is Aryan, witht he exception of the ancestors of people who remained in Africa.</p>
<p>That is incorrect. The original Aryans originated in the areas of the Caucasus mountains, and then they migrated. One group when to South Asia (but not the parts of southern India), another to the Iranian plateau, and the last to northern Europe. The Germans claim to be Aryans. They are a Germanic people, apparently mixed with Aryans. The Kurdish people are the closest people to the original Aryans. After them, the Persian people of Iran are the most similar, but they have been heavily mixed with the dark, indeginous Elamites, along with the Greeks, Arabs, and Monogols. and the the Pashtoons of Afghanistan and Pakistan and Tajiks are Aryans too, but they have a much more east oritenal genetic influence, mainly the Mongols and Chinese.</p>

<dd>Damn people have no sense.</dd>
<dd>1) Anatolia/Armenian Highland = Cradle of Civilization</dd>
<dd>2) Obviously most cultures and languages will be somewhat related.</dd>
<dd>3) ARYAN DOES NOT MEAN YOUR APART OF A NATION. IT SAYS THAT YOU ARE A WORSHIPER OF THE GOD AR, OR :PERSON OF THE SUN.</dd>
<dd>4) As Iranians are actually not really the same people who lived back in the days of Aryan (Persians were as far I am concerned, Iranians are more of an Arabic people).</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
STATEMENT 4 here is completely wrong. Persians/Iranians are the only people with a real claim to being part of an authentic "Aryan" race. Also, don't differentiate "Persians" from "Iranians". They always called themsleves Iranians. "Persians" was the name given to them by the Greeks. The Greeks also named the Canaanites "Phoenicians"</p>
<p>This is wrong the Phoenicians were the Minoans - what the english refer to as Minoans because of the Minotaur-Bull &amp; their ceremonial dance with the bulls, also their God Baal was symbolised as a Solar Bull. The Phoenicians or Minoans also had settlements in modern day lebanon &amp; israel as well as their main homeland crete. Their is no archeoligical evidence which proves that their were a people called the cannanites, the only evidence is that the Phoenicians were Minoans &amp; they were also called Philistines in the bible, they all worshipped the same Gods in the same ceremony which is traced back to Crete the land of the Minoans &amp; the Minoans also had links to Mycenean Greece. Archeology has proved this. If you wish to use the term cannanites then we must assume that they were Minoan, Phoenician, Philistine or Mycenean Greeks, they were all Greeks just different names have been used by different scholars &amp; historians over time. Also the bible was first written 2000 years ago so it can not speak accuratly of cultures that existed 5000 years ago &amp; earlier, only through archeology can we learn of the real cultures that lived in those times.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>and they named the Ashurians "Assyrians". Arabs are Semitic people with a completely different lineage. This is true linguistically and genetically. Arabs are of the same origin as the Canaanites (Phoenicians), the Syrians, the Assyrians (Ashurians), and the ancient Hebrews (today's Sephardic Jews). The Aryans/Iranians come the Caucausus mountain area. The Aryan peoples settled south, but battled the Indus Valley Civilization in the east, and the Semitic Assyrians in the West (the Arabians were desert nomads and were mostly irrelevant to history until about 700 AD).</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Ancient Assyrians originally came from the Caucausus mountain area aswell with the Aryans but they settled in their capital at Nineveh.

<p>First, no I'm not Armenian, I'm from Sweden. I just took an interest in the subject a while ago. I'm don't really involve myself with more recent histories.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that at all, all I'm refering to is that Armenians have lived in that part of the world longer than most people living there. Plus the language and alphabet remains nearly unchanged for about 1600 years. All I'm pointing out is that if you want to find a meaning you could look into the Armenian language for meaning. And it has a clear meaning of what "Aryan" would mean. Writing the the term "ar" or "arh" has no inherent meaning is just stupid because *SURPRISE* a language that has remained nearly unchanged for 1600 years happens to live in the area.</p>
<p>On the part of cradle of civilization, it is becoming a more accepted theory that the Turkish(Anatolian) and Armenian highland (not referring as the ACTUAL Armenia existing then) that civilization started there. Many towns and monolithic structures are found in this area that predate the Sumerian city states. If you want a reference look at "Carahunge", a building very similiar to Stonehenge, however it is much older.</p>
<p>Just to let you know, the former Armenian Kingdoms did include eastern Anatolia (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/master8885/Maps/cama_1840.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/master8885/Maps/cama_1840.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/master8885/Maps/cama_1840.jpg</a>). All the kindoms before that too, like Urartu etc., were succeded by Armenians, however Armenians did live in that area before that (I think the Armenians moving from the Balkans about 7th Cent BC is bull. Why is do Armenians all share the common knowledge that their first king Haik established their nation about 2400BC, and still even hold their new year according to that calendar?).</p>
<p>I am not trying to discuss the origins of Indo-Europeans (this was necessary to show where Armenia and its language stands on this matter) rather to tell you that refering to the Armenian language for a translated meaning for "Aryan" would yeild good succes. As far as I gathered it from the language; Ar - There are a lot of words in Armenian with "Ar", which basically means - Sun/Star/Solar. Weird as it happens that their mythological patriarch "Haik"/"Hayk" is a legendary Archer and is a demi-god of some sorts (reminds me of Orion constellation, hence in relation to star/solar etc..). yan - I noticed that almost and nearly every name in Armenian families end in -yan. So I asked an Armenian friend for a translation; son. Like in Swedish we have "Sven Andersson" last name meanining son of Anders, in a name like Hakobyan: Hakob is a Armenian name, yan meaning son. Conclusion: Aryan = Star/Sun person/son. In ancient times I see a lot of people referring themselves as the sons of a god or something. The reason why I believe Aryan is such a hard word to localize to a certain type of people or culture is because; Since most indo-european languages stem from one or two ancient proto-language it can be concluded that the word Aryan stuck around with everyone in the ancient world. Why? Because the predominant gods and religions dealt with stars/solar or just a religion based on the Sun. Denying that the Sun was a major religion icon back then would be just stupid. What would you do if that big thing in the sky that gave you light, warmth, and food always showed up but you couldn't really explain what it was? So therfore couldn't Aryan just refered to the people who practised the a sort of religion or cult rather than a national thing? Plus I see it hard to put things in a national sense in the classical era and earlier than that. Why becuase it seems like most cities and "countries" were actually alliances of independent city states rather than a defined nation as we try to see today. Remember some things may not mean the same thing back then than they do today. Don't immediatly relate Aryan to Iran because they sound similair, infact I don't think they have a relation becuase the Iranians don't call themselves in the phonetic sense "Iranians".</p>
<p>"Iran" comes from a phrase meaning "Land of the Aryans." Iranian is synonymous with Aryan.</p>
<p><br />
I am also informed that when Armenia converted to Christianity in A.D 301 that almost all non-Christian religious icons where destroyed along with their temples (one, Garni, which still stands today) which housed nearly all the books and written scripts of the Armenian language prior to the conversion. The Armenian Alphabet was reinstated later so the Bible could be translated into Armenian. However due to the conversion massive amounts of knoweledge was lost due to the purges and continueous invasions by other nations. That's why most Armenian written texts seem to appear after that period about 5th Cent.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK I see a lot of bull here. Iran doesn't mean 'Land Of Aryans', Arya Varta (a.k.a INDIA) DOES. I am not denying that Iranians are Aryan...because they are but these are the ancient Iranians who have now mostly migrated to India as they were opressed when Arabs took over. India is the true Land Of Aryans. They are genetically the most closest as throughout the country the genetic patter is similar, while other countries such as Kurdish and Armenian etc. have mixed with Arabian people, thus mixing their 'aryan' lineage, if they had any in the first place. India though, widely remains unchanged in its culture, religion and genetics and today still mostly consists of true blooded Aryans. Anyone who defies this point doesn't know enough to be speaking on this.</dd>

The theory cherished in Nazi Germany, on the other hand, was that the "Aryans" <i>originated</i> on "German" soil. The sentence "the German people have a direct ancestry with the people of the Arya region in Iran" pretty much expresses what is accepted by virtually everybody, but instead of "people of the Arya region" we might as well say Albanians, or Slavs, or any other IE group. As to the belief in a particularly close relation of Iranians and Germans, this is afaik not something the Nazis (or anybody) assumed. If we want to quote it as a minority view, it should be attributed to specific scholars, and not to "German and Soviet" scholars collectively. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 08:27, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do we really need the discussion of the Nazi's here? I don't think a particular use of the term should be relevant to the actual meaning of the term. If the Nazi use is mistaken, then including and discussing its use promotes the mistaken definition.</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes we do. the term's semantics has been severely influenced by the Nazis. And, Nazis or not, theirs was just <i>one meaning</i> historically attributed to the term. There is no 'actual meaning', only a list of meanings that have been in use. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:34, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Unfortunately, because of widespread misconceptions, people seem to use the term "Aryan" as simply a word meaning "White", and though the term "Caucasian" may be somewhat accurate, that aspect of "Aryan" is more theoretical than what can be understood from the ancient history. Furthermore, the Nazi's used the term, "Aryan" not just to signify a pre-existing race, but more so to encourage the creation and development of a new, paradigmically German race, that would be homogenous throughout the German Empire. Again for clarity, people think "Aryan" means "White", but the Nazi's used "Aryan" to signify a new race they were creating through eugenics and immigration control, based upon a strong belief in a glorious ancient race of Aryan people who had reached an evolutionary level that the Nazi's hoped also to reach.</p>
<p>-I think the original question is really not "do we need to discuss the Nazis", but "do we need to debate the Nazis". Every discussion about the word Aryan seems to involve an attempt to deny that there was ANY racial or ethnic group called the Aryans - people who are crusading against Nazism are hijacking the topic just as brazenly as the Nazis themselves were.[[User:johan77]</p>
<p>The Nazis did not invent the correlation between Aryan and White-European; that was a very well-established convention that was almost universally accepted (even in India) since about the 1830s, particularly after the works of Gobineau. It does have to be discussed here because it is an important subject directly relevant to the "real" meaning of the word Aryan and it is an historical definition of the term, whether or not there is any basis to the gloss of Aryan=white race in its ancient, original usage. It is not a different word or a case of disambiguation. In fact, it is probably a more well-known conception of the word in the modern world and its genesis needs to be explained; the Nazis obviously were the most extreme proponents of the Aryan=white ideology, therefore it is absolutely proper for this topic to be discussed under this heading. The point is, when people use Aryan to mean "white person" or european, they are not using a different word nor is it simply a case of misunderstanding (even if in ancient times that isn't what the word meant). It is an accurate definition of the word as it was used in a particular historical context (i.e., from the mid-19th century to the present), even by those who abhore the nazis--regardless of the philology.--<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmijisti_b66e.html" title="User:Almijisti">Almijisti</a> 06:02, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What... does it hurt to know the truth about "Aryan's" true meaning? I mean... after all that Nazi propaganda... it hurts to truly pull apart the concept of Nordic and true Aryan....</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you making a specific point here? It doesn't sound like it. OK, to reply to Shashir.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Aryan does not mean 'Indian'. At most, when used in an ethnic sense rather than with its spiritual meaning, it can mean 'North Indian' - i.e. native speaker of an Indo-Aryan language. It has never meant 'citizen of India.'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Indo-Iranian is bracketed to explain the <i>particular</i> usage of the term Aryan in this context - i.e. a speaker of the proto I-I languages, but <i>not</i> a speaker of <i>all</i> the I-E languages. The latter is a different usage, and that's the one that eventually led to the Nazi meaning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know these distinctions are complicated and confusing, but they have to be kept as clear and distinct as possible because of the multiple uses of this word.

<dd>I disagree with the sentence: <i>It can also be used as a synonym for the Indo-Aryan peoples of North India.</i> This would only be correct linguistically, if it refers to speakers of Aryan as opposed to Dravidian languages. But in other senses (culturally and spiritually) this is wrong. For example, in one of the meanings, Aryan refers to people who for example belong to an Aryan religion, accept the Vedas. There is no clear definiton of Aryan, but it can (and did) also refer to people in South India.</dd>

<dd>Machaon, I disagree with your reasoning, Aryans never did refer to people of South India, who are Dravidians. The term Aryan is used as synonym for 72% of Indias population who have North Indian origins. For Instance Norwegian speakers of Italian languge would not be called Italian, similarly Dravidan people who speak of an Aryan languages like Hindi or Sanskrit would not be called Aryan. Aryan refers to the people, their culture (South Indian culture is very different from North Indian), and language - User: samirmokashi 0100, 5th August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I'm not too happy that comment either. It was added as a kind of concession to Shashir. That usage does exist, but it's not common. I accept what you say about the spiritual meaning of Aryan, but it can apply to Buddhists as well as to Hindus, so I don't think it's just about accepting the Vedas. In any case, the Vedas have played a pretty minor role in some forms of South Indian Hinduism. In any case, 20% of Indians are not Hindu. And there's the difficulty of equating followers of the 'Arya Dharma[s]' with 'Aryans', which is not a common usage. However, change it if you think fit. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 21:48, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry man... I was too rash in criticizing you. I understand what you mean... and I do believe that you are correct to some extent. However, the word Aryan characterizes personalities or social order more than anything elese in India. A person can be Aryan if he shows generosity of good behavior... or if he was born into a revered social class. In regard to people, Indians (north) associated more with Persians in history than anyone else... considering Indians generally used to look upon them as the same people. When the word did reach Europe, it made something of a change in its meaning to suit whatever certain despots needed of it. --Shashir 08:06, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Herodutus was a Historian of those times so we must accept his teaching as being accurate he did refer to the members of the Persian empire as the Arayan its a historical accepted fact &amp; has been for countless centuries. Seeing that Herodutus named the members of the Persian empire as being Arayan then no doubt other ancient greek &amp; probably roman works also point out the same. Their were three major wars between the Ancient Greeks &amp; the Arayan, the Trojan war, the Persian War &amp; the war of Alexander the Great. The main languages derived from 'Aramaic the imperial language of the Persian or Arayan empire' are arabic, hebrew, farsi &amp; turkish &amp; its quite possible aramaic influenced the development of the sanskrit language. Also the swastika was used it italy &amp; greece before the Villanovan culture 2000 bc, their may even be earlier records of its use in art &amp; ceremony. It is possible the swastika was a symbol of solar worship in relation to agriculture &amp; it could have been inherited from the Arayan tribes of Anatolia, (hittites) or it could have been a indigenous symbol of their own.</p>
<p>Is their a record of the swastika being used in ancient egypt ?</p>
<p>Also the first christian missionaries were egyptian, the apostle Mark was egyptian &amp; so were many other apostles &amp; disciples, note the Greeks were complicit in influencing Titus to purge Judah &amp; crucify many people, Jesus may have been one of them, in revenge the so called Christians burnt down the libary of Alexandria in Egypt which held a vast amount of pre-christian or pagan knowledge. These christians as they were called spoke Aramaic the language of the Persian empire though others spoke both Aramaic &amp; Greek. Scholars have claimed throughout the centuries that Jesus spoke Aramaic the language of the Persian or Arayan empire.</p>
<p>Is their a connection between Arianism &amp; the Arayan, the followers of Arianism made the claim that Jesus was a creature who did not exist &amp; many people in Europe would follow Arianism for hundreds of years, as opposed to follow the teachings of Jesus. They were regarded as heretics by the early church.</p>

<p>All what you saying it isn't truth.</p>
<p>In some parthian bareliefs, Aryans pictured with bashlyks(Ancient turkic aiguille hats) &amp; their horses had cuted tails. Only Kypcak(Ancient Turkic people) has cuted horses tails in that time.</p>
<p>P.S Many think that Sakae &amp; Scythian people was so-called 'indo-europeans'. But I have explain of this myth, most ancient ancestors of turkic people was blue-eyed! But it doesn't mean that turks was europeans, no. Their Ancestors has migrated south to Iran &amp; India, this an explain that sanskrit &amp; some european languages have same-like words.</p>
<p>But if you want to see, that ancient mythical ancestors, you need only to seen Sámi people, they are most great proove of this theory. (from M.Adji book 'Kypçaks'.)</p>

<dd>so you're basically saying the Aryans were really Turks, yes? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:37, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And this theory asserts that the Sámi are the progenitors of the Turkic peoples?! Whaaaa? Isn't that anachronistic like saying <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture_53d9.html" title="La Tène culture">La Tène</a> was settled by the Irish? I think Richard C. Foltz and Paul Kriwaczek's theories, though often speculative (and admittedly so by the latter), are more grounded in if nothing else, geography. <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a> 03:36, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, from what I've studied, the Turks believe themselves to be the same people as the ancient Sumerians, which was a non-Semitic race that was conquered by Semitic Akkadians and Assyrians. Between a white, non-Semitic race in Mesopotamia, and the Persians right next door, there could be a direct link (though it's highly speculative). That would account for a Turkish claim to being Aryan, originally. Today, however, Turks are a mix of ancient Turks and Mongols, due to the days of the Mongol invasions, and the rise of the Tartars.
<dl>
<dd>What a people <i>considers</i> itself to be, ethnically speaking, has often been shown to be motivated by collective self-aggrandizement. Compare the Ethiopian conviction of a Salomonic origin, or the Roman insistence on Aeneas of Troy as their progenitor:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Trojans were (Anatolian turkish hittites) ancestors of the Sumerians according to archeoligical findings that pre-date Sumeria, though their culture in Sumeria became more advanced than their original culture in Turkey, this adds favour to the Armenian connection mentioned. Many Trojans from Turkey migrated to southern italy around 2000 bc after their city was trashed by the Greeks, they may have influenced the indigenous peoples of Italy. This also explains why southern italy has many dark hair &amp; eyed peoples.</p>
<p>it means nothing but what popular legend ascribes to it.</p>

<p>Paul Barlow's deletion of my sentence is strange to say the least. Arya and Aryan are two forms of the same word. As the word was orignially Iranian-Indian it needs to be understood it is still used in India. It is also important to understand that this Indian usage has no relation to the what happened in early 20th century Europe. To say the section makes no mention of Nazis is not convincing, the reason why Aryan is no longer acceptable in Europe is because of the Nazis. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">Jayanta Sen</a> 04:12, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point of the introductory section is to explain the complex interconnected usages of the term to mean, in different contexts, "Proto-Indo-European", "Indo-European", "Indo-Iranian" and "Indo-Aryan". We decided some while ago that the specific Indian and Buddhist usages would go in the article "<a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a>", though of course with a mention here. This was intended to avoid too much confusion here about a concept that's confusing enough as it is! Of course the distinction is to an extent artificial - just as the distinction between "Iranian" and "Aryan" is artificial, since they too are "two forms of the same word". But the point of maintaining these distinctions is to avoid the blurring together of different, and sometimes inconsistent, usages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Nazi usage arises from the meanings "Indo-European" and "Proto-Indo-European", with the added significance of "non-Jewish". This is explored in the <i>Racist connotations</i> section. If you think it should be in the introduction, fine, but I think we need to explain the Nazi usage first. As it is, your sentence is added to section in which two as-yet unexplained usages – one of which has <i>not even been mentioned</i> – are taken as already understood. The Nazi usage <i>and</i> the Hindu/Buddhist/Jain one are both discussed in later sections. So I think either the intro needs a bigger rewrite, or the sentence should go elsewhere.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 10:09, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I stated up above in another section, the Nazi usage of "Aryan" was actually in the creation of a NEW race (via eugenics, the Nuremberg laws, and immigration control), based upon what was believed to be the glory of the ancient Aryan peoples, whom the Germans perceived as their ancestors. Since this NEW race that the Nazi's wanted to create specifically excluded Jews, Aryans under the Nazi's definition would have to be non-Jewish. Furthermore, the Jews of Europe were Slavic peoples, and Hitler, in Mein Kampf, specifically viewed Slavs as being non-German, and would clearly have excluded them from the race he wanted to create, which explains his perception of Poland and Czechoslavakia as specific threats.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Paul removed your sentence because this is already explored, amply, earlier in the article. We link to <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a> in the intro. We have an "Indo-Aryan" section, <i>before</i> the "racist connotations" section, where we link to <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a> again. The entire <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a> article is about Vedic and post-Vedic sociological connotations of the Sanskrit term. Your edits were to the "racist" section, and offtopic there: that section is precisely <i>not</i> about the Indian meanings, already explained. There is no need to repeat the same point over and over again; read the article, and you'll know. Skip the article, jumping directly to the "racism" section, and you'll read about racism, don't blame the article for that. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:06, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Germans are linguistically connected to the Iranians and Vedic Sanskrit Indians, and the ancient German and Scandanavian religions are closely connected to the Avesta and the Vedas, of Iran and India respectively (and also to the Sumerian religion). Thor is basically the same character as the Zoroastrian Mithra, and Odin/Wotan is the same character as Ahura Mazda. Also, it's likely that, like the Scythians, other Aryan warrior tribes migrated north into Europe, and those seem to be the old Teutonic peoples.</dd>

<dd>-I think your arguments above are way too biased in favor towards Iranian peoples. Aryan does not exclusively mean synomity with the Iranian groups. Iranian groups are a part of the Aryan ethnicity but the ONLY part. Another major part of the Aryans are the Indo-Aryans who are the older branch. And the branch that has preserved much of the older Indo-Iranian roots better than the Iranian languages. Aryan doesnt just mean Iranian. Iranian is just a branch of the Aryans, not the entire Aryans themeselves.</dd>

<dd>Yes, but 51% of what are now referred to as "Iranians", are racial Persians, which are of the Old Persian race, in the same way that a large percentage of Americans did, in fact, descend from the British people who founded this country. By "the Iranians" I was referring to those Iranians that had not intermarried with foreign peoples. Zoroastrian tradition in Iran, which is still alive among Iranian Muslims as "Iranian custom", demands that Iranians not intermarry with foreign peoples. Of course such intermarriage has happened, but to a minimal extent - maybe not as minimal as in Japan, but close.</dd>

<p>I noticed that someone on here stated that a large percentage of Americans or at least half descend from the British founders. This is utter garbage. The good majority of white Americans actually are of German origin. Only something around less than even a quarter, probably even just 5-10% of white Americans descend from English people. Germans dominate the White American gene pool. <a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">Afghan Historian</a> 22:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Germans dominate US Gene pool? Not really. This comes from the US census where the largest group out of AMERICANS ABLE TO STATE ANCESTRY is German (15.2%). Many (white) Americans are unable or unwilling to state their ancestry and put “American” (7.2%) instead. The areas with the largest "American" ancestry populations were those mostly settled by English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish during colonial period. This suggests that percentages listed for those groups should be larger than as stated in the census: Irish (10.8%), English (8.7%), Scottish (1.7%), Scots-Irish (1.5%), Welsh (0.6%). This would give clear majority to ancestry from the British Isles*…if you exclude the Irish 10.8% and divide the “American” 7.2% in a conservative half….that still gives a majority from the current UK nations. This is from the 2000 census. In addition the studies show that top 15 surnames in the US are "British" -- which is interesting but doesn't even reflect race much less ethnicity.</p>

<p>It is saddening to see the efforts by the "moderators" to push forward "Aryan Invasion Theory" and the "Indo-European" centric origins as a legitimate foundation to the ancient aryan and vedic civilization that flourished in the Indian subcontinent. It is saddening because the notes on the Wiki pages seem to validate a theory that is widely suspected and championed by a narrow group of intolerant self-professed scholars. A neutral discussion/notes would have dealt the subject in its pristinity with enough room for all pertinent view points in the subsequnet expositions. But unfortunately, the Wiki pages have become the showcase of a potent but dying clique that want to revive a moribund racial-centric theory. The introductory paragraph/definition for the Aryan section is a simple example cleverly targeted at the new readers to buy the AI Theory at first sight than to give a unbiased introductory account of origins of Aryan word.

<p>What I am talking is very obvious. The entire text in the Aryan related articles is about elaborating an authentic migration theory with appendages on other audacious factional (and fictious) material. An excellent, sophisticated and comprehensive compilation of all the discussed material from the school of AIT/Indo-European/PIE. Hope you will agree with this. However, given the fact (if you agree) that the decades old theory is not undisputed the quality of the text is in jeopardy (because it fails to keep the disputants equidistant). By placing the AIT central to any description/exploration the Wiki page material is clearly motivated and adherent to an "established, obvious and real story". Whatever is the truth about the aryan civilization the material is based on a theory that is at loggerheads. The consequence is not just misinformation but failure to recognise and accomodate revealing knowledge where everything "else" is reposited as an appendage and sidelined.</p>
<p>The current pathological situation is probably not entirely due to a robust wilful tirade against a rival school but also related to the diagnostic darkness corresponding the ignorance. Darkness induced by a defective knowledge, or by one's own racial/national/political positions/affinities/disaffinities or due to one's own trusted intellectual and reasoning abilities or a mix of these or due to complete ignorance. The result a grand mockery of science, history and investigation. Sriwiki 04:50, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The theory is only in "jeopardy" or "disputed" when one believes the propaganda of certain fringe groups. It may seem surprising, but in reality the identification of the Indo-European language family, the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, and the historical veracity of the Aryan migration theory (and of the other migrations and cultural changes that are associated with the spread of the IE language family in the rest of Eurasia) are in no danger of dissapearing in some cloud of uncertainty brought on by apparently "revealing knowledge" from the fringe of academia. The evidence is clear, and although many people have alternate views, these are just that; alternate. Particularly the Out-of-India theory, much like the Nazi's claim that Indo-European culture originated in Northern Europe, seems to be influenced primarily by nationalist sentiment rather than actual evidence, and as such enjoys nowhere near the same level of support among pre-historians and linguists. The current way wikipedia deals with the issue accurately reflects this situation. --<a href="../../../k/r/s/User%7EKrsont_b3c0.html" title="User:Krsont">Krsont</a> 22:53, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the end, there are two conceptions of the word "Aryan".
<dl>
<dd>There's the ancient civilization described by the Avesta and the Vedas, from which Iran descends, and from which India is partially composed of (the other part being the dark-skinned Dravidian peoples).</dd>
<dd>The other conception of "Aryan" is the theoretical one, which claims that the Germanic peoples are also rooted in the ancient Aryan civilization. This theoretical conception, in one of its forms, claims that actually the Aryan civlization was based in the North, BEFORE it settled in Iran and invaded India. The "North" though, refers to antediluvian continents, meaning Ultima Thule, or perhaps Iceland. This branch of the theoretical conception of Aryans has merit because there were, actually, warm island continents in antediluvian times, and there WAS a period of worldwide flood and cataclysm for hundreds or maybe thousands of years at the end of the last ice age, where, if there had been a great civilization on a continent in the North, then it certainly would have been smashed and spread apart. This period would have been somewhere around 10,000 BC, according to earth scientists.</dd>

<dd>There is mention of Blavatsky here, but more detailed discussion of her views is in the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_race.html" title="Aryan race">Aryan race</a> article. Her views were only influential on the more esotericist participants in the debate. Hardly anyone disputes that "Germanic peoples" are rooted in "Aryan civilisation", if by "Aryan" you mean Proto-Indo-European. Perhaps the word "civilisation" might be queried. But there's no reason to single out Germanic peoples - the same is true of Greeks and Romans and others. The North European homeland theory does not derive from Blavatsky. Neither does the Atlantis theory - that comes from <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_Donnelly_af3a.html" title="Ignatius Donnelly">Ignatius Donnelly</a>.

<dd>I don't think I said anything about Blavatsky in describing the different conceptions of "Aryan". Atlantis theories discuss evidence of ancient civilizations with technology that was lost before recorded history (e.g. advanced navigation, astronomy, masonry, etc.), but Atlantis theorists make no discussion of what races were involved. However, racial theorists in Europe worked off of Atlantis theroists to detail a back-history for the Aryan race that stretched into antediluvian times. But this is not a matter of science, so much as it is a matter of doctrine and belief held by the Nazi's and other Rosenberg type theorists. The Atlantis aspect of the theory has some merit, at least to the extent that there were ancient civilizations who had, at least, the ability to build ships that could sale the oceans, and perhaps have built pyramids. What gives weight to the Aryan theorists is that such advanced civilizations are described in the ancient Aryan texts, the Vedas, and the Avesta.</dd>

<p>Actually, Indian Hindu civilization isnt even just part Aryan, its is derived from the Aryan culture in general. Dravidian influence was great yes, but the structure, actual synthesis of beliefs and framework was set up by the Aryans. Therefore, it was founded by them. The fact that both the North and the South use the caste system and use Sanskrit as the liturgical language attests to the fact that the Hindu framework is still dominated by the Aryans. The origins, however, do derive from the Dravidians in a great deal. <a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">Afghan Historian</a> 22:05, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, truely speaking I am quite confused about this division. Isn't there's just one word: Arya. The 'n' is added after it in English to make it sound like an English adjective. Is this two word formula "Arya" vs. "Aryan" really used by scholars or is it just invented on wikipedia for our convenience? I agree it's quite handy, but it gives people the wrong impression that Arya and Aryan are two different concepts, which we know of course is untrue. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 06:26, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well, 19th century scholars were careless about separating language and race, from today's perspective. In the 19th century, "Aryan" simply lumped together "Ancient Indo-European", people, race, language and all. Then there was fascism and WWII with all its racialist madness, and after 1945, people were extremely careful about equating language and race, for several decades, the topic was practically taboo. Today, good faith discussions of concepts of "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>", and their connection to linguistics, are again possible, but the term <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_race.html" title="Aryan race">Aryan race</a> is strictly and exclusively a historical fascist concept. This whole discussion is really divided from India now, it is deeply connected with European history. In linguistics, good faith use of "Aryan" never really died out, and it is well possible, if a bit old-fashioned, to use "Aryans" as a synonym of "Indo-Iranians", <i>in a strictly linguistic</i> sense. So you see, the topic of <i>this</i> article is to explain the history of the term in the West in the 19th and 20th century. Today, the term is not <i>needed</i> in academic discussion, but you have to be aware of it because it's in the older literature.. All of <i><a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a></i>, <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_race.html" title="Aryan race">Aryan race</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-Iranian_56d9.html" title="Proto-Indo-Iranian">Proto-Indo-Iranian</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryans_3ed8.html" title="Indo-Aryans">Indo-Aryans</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranians.html" title="Iranians">Iranians</a> are articles with unambiguous topics while this article is about the term itself.

<dd>There are not just two meanings, but many - Iranian(s); Vedic peoples; spiritually ennobled peoples; Indo-Iranian (peoples; languages); PI-I (peoples; languages); PIE (peoples; languages); Indo-European (peoples; languages); esoteric "Root Race" from Atlantis; Nordic/Germanic peoples. This list of meanings is so bizarre that some attempt at explanation must, I think, be made. Just having a disambiguation page may simply fuel confusion. With <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic.html" title="Gothic">Gothic</a> it's not so important, as there is a straight chain of connotations generating new denotations: Gothic peoples - Goths seen as barbaric - "barbaric" architecture labelled Gothic - Gothic generalised as a term for medieval art and design - the Gothic style becomes synonym for Medieval culture - Gothic literature emerges as revival of mystical medieval Romance literature - 'Gothic' generalised to signify supernatural - Gothic extended to refer generally to supernatural stories - Gothic appropriated by subculture as name for people who wish they were characters in such stories! <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 08:30, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I disagree with the premise and believe that these articles (<i>arya</i> and <i>aryan</i>) should qualify for merger, except with respect to a specific philologically based meaning of the word <i>arya</i> (if that were even possible), which in any event, should appear in Wikidictionary, not here. Irrespective of one's opinion regarding the Nazi party interpretation of the conception of <i>arya</i> or <i>aryan</i> in the ancient texts, it is simply impossible and intellectually dishonest to separate the question of what <i>arya</i> meant in ancient times from an historical description of the word <i>aryan</i> itself. The usage of the latter is inextricably bound up with the interpretation of what the former means. By creating a dichotomy between the one and the other, it leads one to believe that there is only an accidental relationship, if any, between the two. The basis of the Nazi use of <i>aryan</i> was not simply the result of delusional fanatics imposing some notions created out of whole cloth--it was the logical extension of what was, without question, the most widely held European thesis regarding the meaning of the word <i>arya</i> at the time. That the 19th and early 20th understanding of <i>arya</i> led to the particularly unfortunate usages of <i>aryan</i> is an historically significant fact that has had tremendous repercussions for not just the field of I-Ir research, but the whole modern conception of what ethnicity, race, and language actually are (e.g., one need only recall the "ebonics" debate in the US a few years ago).--<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmijisti_b66e.html" title="User:Almijisti">Almijisti</a> 02:22, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Based on the Indo-European roots section in the American Heritage College Dictionary, I have deleted the reference to "E/ire," the Irish name for Ireland, being related to Aryan. The dictionary instead gives the root *pei@, suffixed form *pei-wer- "fat; fetile" as the source "Iueriu" -- Celtic languages lose initial PIE /p/ -- and this has the benefit of being an actual attested ancient form of the island's name.</p>
<p>PIE /a/ vowels remained unchanged in the transformation to Celtic, and so the long /e:/ in "Eire" makes no sense if descended from *ar-yo-.</p>
<p>"Aristos" however IS descended from this root, but "heir" is not.</p>

As for "aristos", do you have recent sources?<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 14:46, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>aristos should be widely accepted; and yes, I agree it is well to note that the Eire connection was proposed in the 19th c. even if it is untenable today. I don't know about 'heir' though - a connection with this word would have been untenable even in the 19th c.; I say we strike that until a reference is brought forward who exactly supposed a connection of 'heir' with 'arya'. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:06, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So it would be interesting to see a discussion of the accuracy or inaccuracy of the purely descriptive/archeological aspect of the Nazi claims. That is, are Germanic peoples (say, Franks, Teutons, Aller Manni) actually descended from the Indo-Aryans or proto-Indo-Iranians or whoever? More so than, say, the Ashkenazim are? I genuinely don't know, and am kind of curious. Hopefully this question can be discussed independently of the racist Nazi mythology. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:00, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well, they just descend from the Proto-Indo-Europeans linguistically, and <i>partly</i> genetically (there is always a local substrate that stays in place when new groups arrive). See <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Germanic_47a8.html" title="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_peoples.html" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic peoples</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic_Bronze_Age_605c.html" title="Nordic Bronze Age">Nordic Bronze Age</a>. The Slavs and Balts are likely closer to the Indo-Iranians, not to mention the gypsies, who <i>are</i> Indo-Iranians, all of which were considered inferior by the Nazis. Your point is valid, of course, in that the North European "Aryan homeland" was once an innocent academic possiblity, say around 1880, as good as any other. It was only <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_mysticism.html" title="National mysticism">national mysticism</a> that turned a hypothesis (which is now, moreover, untenable) into an atrocity.

<p><i>Today, the concept of Aryans and Dravidians, as applied in India, is generally accepted to have been a tactic used by the British to subjugate the peoples of the Indian sub-continent, by using the age old divide-and-conquer paradigm, by pitting the northern and southern populations against each other. True to third world expectations, the Indian populace fell for this myth, and have perpetuated it to this day to serve their individual egos.</i></p>

<dd>Per the revert attempt: I didn't delete this because I disagreed with it, but because it's expressed in unencyclopedic language and because it's in the wrong place -- it doesn't have anything to do with the linguistic component of the "Aryan" concept.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Cutting out the attack on "the Indian populace", the central claim of the paragraph appears to be that "the British" used "the concept of Aryans and Dravidians" "to subjugate the peoples of the Indian sub-continent".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My perception of the truth of this claim is this: There is no question in my mind that the British used, very successfully, <i>divide et impera</i> tactics. They played caste against caste, region against region, religion against religion, thus both fragmenting any nationalist opposition and making their own presence seem necessary as a "disinterested" arbiter presiding over a pot of communal tensions -- some of which, it's fair to say, would have been there anyway even without the British. It was after all not a united and peaceful India which the British took over in the late 18th-early 19th century.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, the British administrators, while they were intensely caste- and color-conscious -- traits they probably imported from their experiences at home and in other colonies they had -- were not linguists or anthropologists, and to them one foreign language was as alien as the next. They do seem to have favored lighter-skinned northwestern Indians over other inhabitants of the peninsula, based partly on racial theories (and partly on the breakdown of loyalties in 1857), but although most of these groups were speakers of Indo-Aryan languages, the prejudice did not work any more to the detriment of Tamils or Telugu-speakers than it did to the detriment of the indisputably "Aryan" Bengalis. British administrative divisions never recognized linguistic communities (unlike modern India) and I'm unaware of any British administrative classification of Indians by language <i>type</i>, although they obsessively classified the Indian populace by almost every other measure. As far as <i>divide and conquer</i> tactics, pitting "northerners against southerners" would, if employed, have been far less effective than the known tactic of dividing Indians by religion (particularly Hindu vs. Muslim), as that had effective consequences in every urban center in India, while the Dravidian-speaking areas of the south -- then divided among a large number of provinces and "princely states", was not even recognizable as a unity, much less as a political force.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If the accusation is that the British "invented" the contrast between "Aryans" and "Dravidians" and left it as a ticking time-bomb under the seat of the nascent Indian state, I can only be impressed by the degree of foresight it attributes to the British -- who could not even foresee the end of their own empire. There is a real linguistic contrast to be made between languages of Indo-Iranian origin and those of other origin in India -- the latter including several other small groups beside the Dravidian group. This linguistic contrast does not, however, necessarily translate into political unity or factionalism, unless linguistic commonalties become an easily identifiable raft on which other, more relevant grievances can be floated. If modern-day Indians are talking up "Aryan" or "Dravidian" identity, it probably has more to do with local imbalances or inequities in wealth and power, rather than with any long-term sinister project by the linguists of an empire sixty years dead. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 16:38, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no doubt that "Aryan" exists as a first name, and as a surname. That it is a "common" name in "various" languages needs some sort of reference. Also, is it "Aryan" or "Aryān"? (I suspect the latter for I-A languages). That the surname is "categorized into" (whatever that is supposed to mean) the Arora community in particular also will need some sort of refenrence. These are precisely the sort of likely statements nobody bothers to check on Wikipedia, only to discover after a year or two that they are horribly inaccurate. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:47, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

It sounds like he hasn't a clue what he's talking about, especially since he doesn't even acknowledge that much of the ancient use of the word is Iranian, not Indian, and that many historians consider the Gathas to be older than the Vedas. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 11:40, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know every time I see a Wikipedia article about something that has to do with India, someone seems to not want to give INdia credit for its history....And this article is a perfect example....It starts by saying Aryan was derived from Sanskrit &amp; Iranian lol....NOw what kind of combo is that? If you use the word Iranian then u have to say Indian as well....However if you prefer to say Sanskrit instead of Indian, then u should type Farsi instead of IRanian lol....I mean it should say INdian &amp; Iranian, or, Sanskrit &amp; Farsi... 71.107.54.199 06:02, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apart from the usual absurd Indian-victimhood-paranoia, I can see no logic to what you are saying. "Iranian" is the name of a language group. See <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_languages.html" title="Iranian languages">Iranian languages</a>. "Indian" is not the name of a language group. "Indian languages" covers three completely distinct main language groups, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_languages_310e.html" title="Indo-Aryan languages">Indo-Aryan</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_languages.html" title="Dravidian languages">Dravidian</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munda_languages.html" title="Munda languages">Munda</a>, plus many lesser ones. It is generally accepted that the Indo-Aryan languages are <i>all</i> derived from Sanskrit. So it is linguistically nonsensical and uninformative to use the word "Indian" when referring to a language, especially as the central point here is the fact that Sanskrit is <i>related</i> to the Iranian languages, while Dravidian and Munda are not. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 09:21, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You start of by saying Iranian and Sanskrit? THat makes no sense.

<dd>Its you again, mr paul b....Why do u get to decide what goes and what stays when your not even an Indian person that is familiar with Indian scriptures.....all im saying is this.....If you type in Iranian, then be fair and type in Indian as well.....But.....if you prefer to type sanskrit, then be fair, and type in old persian or farsi......I dont understand why your typing in Iranian and Sanskrit....Iranian is a nationality.....and Sanskrit is a language <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 23:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Indian' is not a language group, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_languages.html" title="Iranian languages">Iranian languages</a> is. Read what it says above, and read <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_languages.html" title="Indian languages">Indian languages</a>. There are not "a bunch of other Indos", the prefix Indo- refers to the existence of an Indian <i>branch</i> of a language group, which also has branches elsewhere. Language group have no respect for national boundaries. Purely Indian languages do not have the Indo- prefix. Indo-Aryan is a partial anomaly, since the "Aryan" component originally functioned to refer the broader Iranian and Indian family. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 23:13, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>YOur going by a technicality....IRANIAN LANGUAGES ARE A BRANCH of the Indian-European languages.......anyway mr. paul....u havnt answered my question....who the hell gave u the right to say what goes and what doesnt?....u havnt read one ancient aryan text....i cant say that with 100% knowledge, because if u have read any aryan text, u would see what a joke this page is....i mean u still believe in an aryan invasion theory, and that alone erases anything else u type cuz the aryan invasion theory is a joke.....ive offered to talk tou about this on the phone, because typing online gets people nowhere, but of course u refused...which doesnt surprise me.....see this is why alot of people get sick of wikipeia because of users like u.....u bully people into accepting articles the way U WANT IT <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 09:07, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term "aryan" means:</p>
<p>1. an indo-iranian (sanskrit arya, iranian airya) 2. perhaps an indo-european, if the term indo-european *aryos was the auto-ethnonym of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. In the XIXth century, "aryan" meant "indo-european" (Indians, Iranians, Germanics, Slavs, Greeks... and so later) because the specialists thought that the auto-ethnonym was indeed "aryan".</p>
<p>The existence of an indo-european god whose name was based over the root *aryo- seems to show that the XIXth century specialists were true, as Max Müller, Müller who fought the racial nordicist theories... This god is the indo-european *Aryomen, which became the indian Aryaman, the iranian Airyaman/Erman, the irish Eremon and the germanic Irmin. So if this god *Aryomen exists not only in India and Persia but also in Celtic and Germanic world, we may think that *aryos was indeed the auto-ethnonym of the Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>About the AIT Theory,</p>
<p>The indian nationalists said that the Indo-Europeans come from India and not from Europe. This is a nationalist behaviour. I have even readen an albanian historian saying that the Proto-Indo-Europeans 'd come from Albania. No proof about that. And even if the indusian civilisation (Harappa, Mohenjaro) was sanskritic or indo-european, that is not a proof of origin. Perhaps the Indo-Europeans have come to India not in XVIth century A.C but in XXVth century A.C for example.</p>
<p>The fact is Southern India and a little Pakistan (Brahui region) are composed by dravidians. They have not appeared by spontaneous generation. So, the Dravidians were in India before the "Aryans" and then the "Aryans" must have come into India at a non determinate date. Harappa indo-european ? Why not but that is not a proof of indo-european autochtony in India.</p>
<p>Indians, Iranians and Europeans (except Basques, Caucasians and Uralics) are all indo-europeans, simply that. Because indo-europeanity is at first a linguistic question. The origin ? Paleolithic European (for Mario Alinei and so...) ? Kurgans ? Iran ? India ? Central Europe (Lothar Kilian) ? Scandinavie (Kossinna) ? Is it so important ? I do not think so. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 83.203.172.160 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.203.172.160_e6ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.203.172.160">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Look at this persons logic.....The first Aryan scriptures were the Vedas (Of India)....There original teachings are of old Hinduism (Of India)....There first language was Sanskrit (Of India).....In there own writings they dont talk about coming from a far away land or pushing down Dravidian people to southern India....And last but not least....Any and all evidence about Aryans are from the Indian &amp; Iranian area.......BUT OOO NOO.....This person ignores all that.....And says...."The Indian nationalists who say Indo-Europeans come from India and not from Europe have a nationalist behaviour"........Amazing isnt it? <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 22:45, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
