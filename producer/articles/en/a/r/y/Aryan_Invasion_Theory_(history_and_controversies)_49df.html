<p>"<b>Aryan Invasion Theory</b>," (AIT), is a hypothesis and controversial term used in the context of discussions of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asian_47ff.html" title="South Asian">South Asian</a> prehistory, related to the scholarly debate about Bronze Age <b><a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_migration_fce8.html" title="Indo-Aryan migration">Indo-Aryan migration</a></b>s.</p>
<p>It concerns the prehistoric linguistic, racial and cultural origins of the people of South Asia in the period of roughly the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_millennium_BC_027b.html" title="3rd millennium BC">3rd millennium BC</a>. It is typically used to refer to an invasion model that had backing in the early 20th century, at which time the violent aspects of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_migration.html" title="Human migration">human migration</a> were emphasized by some scholars, while others argued for <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diffusion_%28anthropology%29.html" title="Diffusion (anthropology)">diffusionism</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Graham_Sumner_7bbc.html" title="William Graham Sumner">William Graham Sumner</a>).</p>
<p>Strongly invasionist scenarios are widely rejected by modern scholars, many of whom believe a non-military migration may still have occurred. Because of the racialist implications of the model, the phrase "Aryan Invasion" is now often used to refer only to the predecessors of the modern theory of an Indo-Aryan migration into India.</p>
<p>It is not known exactly when and who coined this specific term, but it derives from theories developed in Europe during the 19th century concerning the advent of Indo-Aryan culture in India. As a polemical term in contemporary <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> propaganda, it is pitted against its opposite, the "<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Aryan_Theory_1511.html" title="Indigenous Aryan Theory">Indigenous Aryan Theory</a>".</p>

<p>The theory has a number of implications for the people of India and has been a topic of considerable debate. There has been much debate as to the suggestion that Vedic teachings originated from outside India and thus affecting the view of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> in Indian society. Some interpretations of the theory also suggest that a primitive <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_people.html" title="Dravidian people">Dravidian people</a> adopted their religion from the light-skinned Aryans. Recent archaeological evidence has allowed the growth of scepticism at these concepts of the theory. The scientific progress and organization of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indus_Valley_Civilization_cc8b.html" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a> seems to disprove the idea that a more technologically advanced light-skinned race could have conquered the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indus_Valley_282f.html" title="Indus Valley">Indus Valley</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In fact, some <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> parties oppose the AIT completely, saying that Aryans invaded Eastern <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> after originating in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asia_cf77.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a>.

<p>The modern history of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_studies_3aa6.html" title="Indo-European studies">Indo-European studies</a> and indeed of linguistics begins with <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jones_%28philologist%29_586a.html" title="William Jones (philologist)">William Jones</a>, writing in the <a href="../../../1/7/9/1790s.html" title="1790s">1790s</a>, who was the first to relate the kinship of Sanskrit with classical European languages and to propose that an earlier language "which perhaps no longer exists" was the common source of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin. He also suggested that the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_languages.html" title="Germanic languages">Germanic</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_languages.html" title="Celtic languages">Celtic languages</a> may have derived from the same source.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Later theorists confirmed this and identified that the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_languages.html" title="Slavic languages">Slavic</a> languages also derived from the lost proto-language.</p>
<p>Some early scholars, notably <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Schlegel_4be2.html" title="Friedrich Schlegel">Friedrich Schlegel</a> in 1808, postulated that India was the source of this original language. They adopted the term "Indo-Germanic." Others preferred "<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_languages_7b20.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European</a>," which is now the standard term. Like other European writers Schlegel was of the opinion that India was the "cradle of civilization". For example <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire.html" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> had written some years before Jones's discovery that "I am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges, astronomy, astrology, metempsychosis, etc...,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> and said: "It does not behove us, who were only savages and barbarians when these Indian and Chinese peoples were civilized and learned, to dispute their antiquity."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other scholars, including Jones, attempted to fit the spread of languages to the Biblical model of human orgins, following earlier debates about the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Confusion_of_tongues.html" title="Confusion of tongues">confusion of tongues</a>" following the fall of the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_Babel_05fa.html" title="Tower of Babel">Tower of Babel</a>. It was widely speculated that the Biblical <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japhetic.html" title="Japhetic">tribe of Japheth</a> had expanded from <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> into the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus.html" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and thence into Europe. Such a migration would be consistent with the expansion and differentiation of languages from a common root, and would place Iran and the Indus close to the supposed origin of the migrations.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840s.html" title="1840s">1840s</a> the distribution-pattern of the languages had led several scholars to conclude that India was an unlikely origin-point, since it was at what was then believed to be the easternmost extension of the languages. (<a href="../../../t/o/c/Tocharian.html" title="Tocharian">Tocharian</a>, once spoken by the inhabitants of the <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarim.html" title="Tarim">Tarim</a> basin in what is present-day <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, had yet to be discovered.) Statements made in the Iranian sacred texts about a northern homeland, along with descriptions of battles in the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rig-Veda_806b.html" title="Rig-Veda">Rig-Veda</a>, led scholars to conclude that the original Aryans must have migrated to India. This theory is most associated with the linguist <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Max_M%C3%BCller_8462.html" title="Friedrich Max Müller">Friedrich Max Müller</a>, who argued that the Aryans had migrated to India at around <a href="../../../1/5/0/1500_BC_5bdf.html" title="1500 BC">1500 BC</a>, from an earlier homeland in <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bactria.html" title="Bactria">Bactria</a> or further north, in the Central Asian steppe. Like Jones, Müller also believed that the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">gods</a> of the Vedic <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheon_%28gods%29.html" title="Pantheon (gods)">pantheon</a> were related to the gods of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_mythology.html" title="Roman mythology">Roman</a> and of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse_mythology.html" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a>, so he argued that the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">pagan</a> culture of Europe could be traced back to the Aryans, who must have expanded both eastwards and westwards from their homeland.</p>
<p>Other discoveries in linguistics, such as the role of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatalization.html" title="Palatalization">palatalization</a> in Indo-European language change, discredited the idea that Sanskrit could be the mother of other IE languages.</p>
<p>Müller dated the Rig Veda to 1500-1200 BCE, but he also said that these dates were provisional and that he has "repeatedly dwelt on the hypothethical character of the dates... All I have claimed for them has been that they are minimum dates."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> And he also asserted: "Whether the Vedic hymns were composed 1000, or 1500, or 2000, or 3000 years BC, no power on earth will ever determine." (Müller 1891:91)<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> He also wrote on the homeland of the Aryans: "if an answer must be given as to the place where our Aryan ancestors dwelt before their separation,... I should still say, as I said forty years ago, "Somewhere in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>," and no more"<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Max Müller's contemporary critics have pointed out that "the whole foundation of Müller's date rests on the authority of <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somadeva.html" title="Somadeva">Somadeva</a>.. [who] narrated his tales in the twelfth century after Christ [and] would not be a little surprised to learn that "a European point of view" raises a "ghost story" of his to the dignity of a historical document."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Some critics have alleged that Müller's dating of the Vedas was influenced by a desire to bring Hindu chronology in line with Biblical chronology (4004 BC for <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_Creation_d668.html" title="Dating Creation">Creation</a> and c. 2448 BC for <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Flood_e368.html" title="Noah's Flood">Noah's Flood</a> according to the <a href="../../../u/s/s/Ussher-Lightfoot_Calendar_5bd7.html" title="Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar">Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar</a>).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The common heritage of the Indo-European languages is one of the most powerful and unexpected discoveries of modern science and elicited incredulity which is still to be encountered today. Max Müller recounted that any remarks on Sanskrit were treated with contempt by his teachers and that "no one was for a time so completely laughed down as Professor <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Bopp_49d8.html" title="Franz Bopp">Bopp</a>, when he first published his Comparative Grammar of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zend_language.html" title="Zend language">Zend</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_language.html" title="Gothic language">Gothic</a>. All hands were against him."<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Aryan invasion theory was controversial from its beginning and thus was sometimes subject to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racialization</a>, mostly by people who believed in <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacy.html" title="White supremacy">white supremacy</a>. While many of these views were disputed at the time, or quickly proved to by false, they are still sometimes used by <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">Neo-Nazi</a> groups.</p>
<p>From early on some scholars had argued that the transfer of the Indo-Aryan languages into India was accomplished by white-skinned invaders, who subordinated dark-skinned natives. The famous German philosopher <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Schopenhauer_22d8.html" title="Arthur Schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> proposed just such a theory, observing the "fairer white color" of the ruling caste of the non-local Nordic <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahman.html" title="Brahman">Brahmans</a>: "The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands.”<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The derogatory application of the word "anasa" (interpreted to mean "noseless") to the <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dasa.html" title="Dasa">Dasa</a>, the enemies of the Aryans, was explained as a reference to <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negroid.html" title="Negroid">negroid</a>-type flat noses. Other arguments were derived from alleged references to the "golden" hair of some Vedic deities. From these arguments scholars derived the idea that the Aryans had subordinated or displaced earlier inhabitants of India. Because of the distribution of the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_languages.html" title="Dravidian languages">Dravidian languages</a>, which are unrelated to Sanskrit and the other languages of the Indo-European group, it was often speculated that Dravidian speaking peoples had been the aboriginal inhabitants.</p>
<p>By the 1880s several scholars were arguing that the original home of the of Indo-European speakers was somewhere in Europe.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> At this time these people, now known as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-Europeans_5fc0.html" title="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Proto-Indo-Europeans</a>, were referred to in English as the "primitive Aryans", to distinguish them from the historical Aryans of Iran and India. By this date <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwinism.html" title="Darwinism">Darwinian</a> ideas had replaced the biblical model of human origins. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Huxley_2093.html" title="Thomas Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a> in his essay <i>The Aryan Question</i> (1890) summed up the thinking of the day,</p>

<p>Huxley favoured Penka's theory, taking the view that what he called the "primitive Aryans" were of Nordic race, writing that "typical specimens have tall and massive frames, fair complexions, blue eyes, and yellow or reddish hair–that is to say, they are pronounced blonds." Huxley's view was shared by other writers such as Charles Morris in his <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a> book <i>The Aryan Race</i>, and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietszche_644f.html" title="Friedrich Nietszche">Friedrich Nietszche</a> in <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Genealogy_of_Morals_c830.html" title="On the Genealogy of Morals">On the Genealogy of Morals</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>). These and other later writers argued that the Aryans were a warrior people who had imposed themselves over others by their ruthless military energy, based on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chariot.html" title="Chariot">chariot</a> warfare. The invaders were thought to have entered the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> from the mountain passes of the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_Kush_1f3b.html" title="Hindu Kush">Hindu Kush</a> (present-day <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>), bringing with them the domesticated horse, probably previously unknown in India.</p>
<p>Isaac Taylor<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> noted that "German scholars have contended that the physical type of the primitive Aryans was that of the North Germans - a tall, fair, blue-eyed <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolichocephalic.html" title="Dolichocephalic">dolichocephalic</a> race", while French writers have maintained that they were <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brachycephalic.html" title="Brachycephalic">brachycephalic</a> <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gauls</a>. This increasing preoccupation with race led Max Müller to point out that language and race are not necessarily coterminous: "I have declared again and again that if I say Aryans, I mean neither blood nor bones, nor hair nor skull; I mean simply those who speak an Aryan language… To me an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar."<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even in the 19th century, several theorists had criticised the use of the term "primitive [i.e. primal] Aryans" to refer to the earliest speakers of Indo-European languages, wherever they may have originated. They argued that the word should only describe the cultures in which the term "Arya" was used – those that occupied Iran and northern India. The tribal name of the earliest speakers is unknown, hence the term <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-Europeans_5fc0.html" title="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Proto-Indo-Europeans</a> is now used. Such writers stated that equation of the Indo-Iranians with northern European invaders was unjustified. There was no reason to believe that the peoples of Iran and northern India were ever Nordic. There are references in Sanskrit literature where the <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair.html" title="Hair">hair</a> of Brahmins is assumed to be black. For example, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atharva_Veda_6777.html" title="Atharva Veda">Atharva Veda</a> 6:137. 2-3 contains a charm for making "strong black hairlocks" grow and in <a href="../../../b/a/u/Baudhayana.html" title="Baudhayana">Baudhayana</a>’s Dharma-Sutra 1:2,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> we read the verse "Let him kindle the sacrificial fire while his hair is still black". And apart from a few gods associated with the sun, there is in Sanskrit literature only one golden-haired (hiranyakeshin) person , i.e. Hiranyakeshin, the author of the Hiranyakeshin-Shrauta-Sutra.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>More recent writers have taken the view that racial arguments are irrelevant to the theory. Hans Hock (1999b) studied all the occurrences that were interpreted racially in Geldner's translation of the Rig Veda and concludes that they were either mistranslated or open to other interpretations. He writes that the racial interpretation of the Indian texts "must be considered dubious." (p.154) Hock also notes that "early Sanskrit literature offers no conclusive evidence for preoccupation with skin color. More than that, some of the greatest Epic heroes and heroines such as <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">Krishna</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draupadi.html" title="Draupadi">Draupadi</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/j/Arjuna.html" title="Arjuna">Arjuna</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakula.html" title="Nakula">Nakula</a> and (...) <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damayanti.html" title="Damayanti">Damayanti</a> are characterized as dark-skinned. Similarly, the famous cave-paintings of <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajanta.html" title="Ajanta">Ajanta</a> depict a vast range of skin colors. But in none of these contexts do we find that darker skin color disqualifies a person from being considered good, beautiful, or heroic." (p.154-155) Hans Hock also notes that the world of the Aryas is often described with the words "light, white, broad and wide", while the world of the enemies of the Aryas is often described with the words "darkness or fog". And in many of these instances, he notes, a "racial" interpretation can be safely ruled out. <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a> and many others are also described as dark-skinned. Ravana, who was often described as Dravidian, came from a Vedic family in Gujarat. On the other hand <a href="../../../s/i/v/Siva.html" title="Siva">Siva</a> who is considered by many invasion-theorists as a Dravidian god is often described as fair-skinned. Also, <a href="../../../v/y/a/Vyasa.html" title="Vyasa">Veda Vyas</a> who compiled the Vedas and wrote the great Hindu epic <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabharata.html" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> was dark-skinned. In RV 2.3.9, there is a verse about a son and hero who has a pishanga (tawny, reddish brown, golden) complexion.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> The Rishi Kanva is described as having a dark complexion.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to another examination by Trautmann (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>), the racial evidence of the Indian texts is soft and based upon an amount of overreading. He concludes: "That the racial theory of Indian civilization still lingers is a miracle of faith. Is it not time we did away with it?" (p.213-215)</p>

<p>The theory provided an argument for an alliance between the British and the Indian ruling classes. The claim that the original Aryans were northern Europeans who had migrated into India was used by some British imperialists as an <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideological</a> justification for British control of India, on the grounds that the founders of Indian culture were of the same race as the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> invaders who established the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Raj_db3a.html" title="British Raj">British Raj</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> In others, the idea of a pan-Aryan unity was adopted, as in the writings of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Laing_%28science_writer%29_6df2.html" title="Samuel Laing (science writer)">Samuel Laing</a><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, some Indian nationalists also took the view that the Aryans had originated outside India. In <i>The Arctic Home in the Vedas</i> (1903) <a href="../../../b/a/l/Bal_Gangadhar_Tilak_299b.html" title="Bal Gangadhar Tilak">Bal Gangadhar Tilak</a> argued on the basis of astronomical data that the Vedas could only have been composed from an Arctic location – the Aryan bards having brought them south after the onset of the last <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_age.html" title="Ice age">Ice age</a>.

<p>Some Hindu thinkers like <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Aurobindo_796e.html" title="Sri Aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a> reacted against the Aryan Invasion theory on spiritual rather than historical grounds, claiming them to be "materialistic." Sri Aurobindo interprets the descriptions of war in the Rig Veda often as descriptions of spiritual warfare or as nature-poetry. He also warned against the misuse of the theory: "So great is the force of attractive generalizations and widely popularized errors that all the world goes on perpetuating the blunder talking of the Indo-Aryan races, claiming or disclaiming Aryan kinship and building on that basis of falsehood the most far-reaching political, social or pseudo-scientific conclusions."<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> Some Hindus have emphasized the fact that there is not an explicit mention of an Aryan invasion in the Hindu texts. Aurobindo thus writes: <i>"But the indications in the Veda on which this theory of a recent Aryan invasion is built, are very scanty in quantity and uncertain in their significance. There is no actual mention of any such invasion..."</i><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup> Also <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivekananda.html" title="Vivekananda">Vivekananda</a><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> remarked: "As for the truth of these theories, there is not one word in our scriptures, not one, to prove that the Aryan ever came from anywhere outside of India, and in ancient India was included <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.

The debate has produced a lot of polemics on both sides.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> Supporters of migration are faced with several accusations.

But it was also pointed out that Western and Russian Marxists were often critical of the AIT.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup> Some modern opponents of the Aryan-Vedic continuity in India, like <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romila_Thapar_c3c2.html" title="Romila Thapar">Romila Thapar</a>, are <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a>. Some others like <a href="../../../v/2E/t/V.T._Rajshekar_f11e.html" title="V.T. Rajshekar">V.T. Rajshekar</a> (<i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit_Voice_cdea.html" title="Dalit Voice">Dalit Voice</a></i>) are proponents of the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit_%28outcast%29.html" title="Dalit (outcast)">Dalit (outcast)</a> movement.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup> Such writers have alleged that the Aryans were nomadic plunderers who invaded and destroyed civilizations from Europe to India, especially the Harappan civilization. Missionaries in India have utilized the Aryan Invasion Theory for their own political goals. They claim for example that the AIT proves that Aryan Hinduism is as much a foreign import as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup> It was thus proposed by some Christians and Muslims that "<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> should be deleted from the Eight Schedule of the Constitution because it is a foreign language brought to the country by foreign invaders - the Aryans."<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup> Some Marxists, Missionaries and others have thus questioned the legitimacy of Hinduism (e.g. as a native religion) because of the Aryan Invasion Theory. According to Elst (1999), "the ridiculous argument of doubting the legitimacy of a community's presence in India on the basis of an ancestral immigration of 3500 years ago has been launched in all seriousness by interest groups wielding the AIT as their major intellectual weapon, not by the critics of the AIT."</p>
<p>In contrast, the proponents of a continuous, ancient, and sophisticated Vedic civilization are seen by some as <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindu nationalists</a> who wish to dispense with the foreign origins of the Aryan for the sake of national pride or religious dogma. Another motivation may arise from the desire to eradicate the problem associated with the Indian <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> system; the hypothesis that it may originally have been a means of social engineering by the Aryans to establish and maintain a superior position compared to the Dravidians in Indian society may be a source of discomfort.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrikant_G._Talageri_59a9.html" title="Shrikant G. Talageri">Shrikant G. Talageri</a> (1993: 47) thinks that the question of whether the Aryans came from outside India is not very relevant to Hinduism itself, whose holy places are all in India (in contrast to other religions like Christianity, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and Islam). He noted that "Even if it is assumed that a group of people, called 'Aryans,' invaded, or immigrated into, India,... they have left no trace, if ever there was any, of any link, much less the consciousness of any link, much less any loyalties associated with such a link, to any place outside India."</p>
<p>Scholars who have been critical of the AIT are often stereotyped as "Hindutva", even if they are not Indians or Hindus themselves. This has been criticized as a kind of Indological <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCarthyism_56ee.html" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, whereby anyone reconsidering "long-held assumptions pertaining to the Indo-Aryans is instantly" and a priori dubbed a "Hindu nationalist".<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup> It was thus remarked that scholars such as "Renfrew and Gamkrelidze and Ivanov can radically challenge established Indo-European homeland theories in the West, but the academic culture in India has developed to the point that anyone attempting to even question established paradigms ...is in danger of being dubbed a Nazi."<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup> Sometimes all opponents of the AIT are bracketed with other writers like P Choudhury who make inordinate claims.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics of the AIT have also claimed that pro-AIT (or pro-AMT) scholars refuse the debate by dismissing arguments against the AIT as politically motivated or that they replace arguments with mud-slinging.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup> A book by <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrikant_Talageri_d3df.html" title="Shrikant Talageri">Shrikant Talageri</a> that was critical of the AIT was strongly dismissed in an academic publication by Michael Witzel and G. Erdosy. However, they condemned Talageri's book without even having read it. Talageri noted that „this strong condemnation of a book, unread and unseen by them, is both unacademic and unethical.“<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>It should however be noted that many scholars who have written for or against the Aryan Invasion Theory are not politically motivated.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup> Moreover, the AIT was accepted by Veer Savarkar,<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup> Tilak and other Indian nationalists.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup> The AIT was also criticized by some Indian Marxists.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup> <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambedkar.html" title="Ambedkar">Ambedkar</a>, an icon of the Dalit movement, was dismissive of the AIT: "There is not a particle of evidence suggesting the invasion of India by the Aryans from outside India...The Aryan Race theory is so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago."<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup> Ambdekar also claimed that the racialist and invasionist interpretation of the Rig Veda is "a perversion of scientific investigation" by western scholars who are on a mission "to prove what they want to prove, and do not hesitate to pick such evidence from the Vedas as they think is good for them."<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
