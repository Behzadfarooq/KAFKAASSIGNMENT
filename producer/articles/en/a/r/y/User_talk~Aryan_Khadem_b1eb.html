<p>I am not violating any copy right laws as I have asked and gotten permission from the author before hand. However you are right I will personalise it, I was given permission to do this, and asked if possible to reference the author Dr. Kaveh Farrokh. Which I will, I will spend this week on the article and try to shed the political parts and concentrate not on what they did but what it is. And add their claims etc. The object of my goal is to explain exactly what Turanism is, thier objectives and what they represent and claim.</p>
<p>I am hoping that is ok with wikipedia and not against any of its policy?</p>

<p>Hi. Welcome to Wikipedia. I did not erase your contribution. I reverted it back. You should have read the discussions before editing a major part of the article. It is better to talk and agree before such edits. Small edits are ok. But your edit was a major one and one sided. We can not take sides here in Wikipedia. Wish you have a great time and thank you beforehand for all you future contibutions. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> 01:26, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi. To upload pictures, you can use the upload file option from the toolbox panel to the left. But lately there have been some improvements and other related works in wikipedia, therefore you might have some difficulties in uploading files. Also make sure that the files are not copy right material. About your contributions. Again, I have not deleted any of your contributions. I have reverted it back. You need to work on those a bit. You can not say something like, <b>However, there is no historical record of a people by the name of "Az."</b> You should write according to <b>whom</b> there is no such thing. You can not say I think so or according to my research, because original research is not allowed in wikiedia. You have to cite a source. Any source. Even a weak source or a scholar not generally accepted is preferrable to any kind of personal research. I hope it is clear a bit. And please write to my discussion page, not my user page. OK? Bye now. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> 05:56, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aryan,</p>
<p>I removed your contribution because stuff like that requires you to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite your sources</a>. Please do so. Thanks. --<a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHottentot_55b5.html" title="User:Hottentot">Hottentot</a> 07:26, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok what about the explanation of the word Azerbaijan? I will give several references just to be safe, but it is a more elaborate explanation of the Persian word and the origanl form, as stated it is a Persian word, as for the AZ, by stating there is an AZ people is the same as someone saying there isn't, there is no anthropological or archaeological evidence for such people so it must be therefore excluded. I do not see a reference to such people existing. --Aryan Khadem 10:02, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can you see my discussion on Azerbaijan, I the reasons I bring up the name because it exists in 2 different countries, I am from Azerbaijan in Iran, and not the republic of Azerbaijan we have 2 different histories according to you wikipedia page, I can bring many many sources that dispute the name Azerbaijan being used for the republic but I rather have 2 links mainly because the province is different from the country.</p>

<p>text taken "with permission" cannot be used on wikipedia as that is not compatible with GFDL license which wikipedia uses. Sorry, I have to take it back again. -- ( <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">drini's <small><sub>vandalproof</sub></small> page</a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini"><big>☎</big></a> ) 07:30, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest you read what other admins put up on my talk page or message page, I do not believe it violates anything in Wikipedia, I have e-mailed some other admins about you deletion, I think you should leave discussion on the discussion page and leave my article alone. --Aryan Khadem 07:39, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you have a problem with the topic, then look at it further as Pan-Turanism is a political movement and I just expanded on what was said before, all references were given according to rules and regulations of wikipedia. SO leave a notice but do not delete, even you could be in violation for attacking the article. --Aryan Khadem 07:41, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problems with the topic. I do have problems with using the text from those webpages. And I'll continue removing them for the reasons I mentioned. Copying text fro manother page is NOT accord to wikipedia regulations. Ah and by the way it's not <b>YOUR</b> article. Articles aren't owned in wikipedia. -- ( <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">drini's <small><sub>vandalproof</sub></small> page</a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini"><big>☎</big></a> ) 07:49, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not all of it was copy text, I removed the parts form the original that went too far or were some in appropriate, as I also deleted and changed some words, this if you read the first post was mentioned and I did it, I can reword the whole article and it will still be the same, I give the appropriate references again Permission was granted. For you to delete it out right with no regard to all or consultation was in my opinion rude, talk to me about it first before out right deleting and threating to ban me. --Aryan Khadem 14:08, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>How do we depolitise a political moevemenr or racist movement? How do we try to be unbais when describing a political movement that teaches propoganda? For example do we take netural stance on explaing Nazi movements, The Nazi's themselves or the propoganda they taught and people they persecuted? Do we just say, well this is what they thought, lets leave out all the nasty things they did or taught or said, because we try to be unbais and as wikipedia we should be netural, then my next question is how come many sites ie Azerbaijan continues to exist? but in the end we must describe political movements as they are. As long as reference is given, what is the crime? or unbiasism of it? --Aryan 15:58, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
