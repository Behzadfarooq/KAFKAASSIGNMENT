<p>Hey Aryan. It looks like you're coping it a little here and that maybe you don't know exactly what you've done wrong? Thought I might help out a little (I'm not involved in any of those, I'm not an admin or anything special like that, just trying to help you out).</p>
<p>Basically, Wikipedia maintains a strict <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> policy. We do this simply to avoid losing/scaring away new users who might make a mistake every now and then. If we can spare them the insult of "hey that edit was so stupid you are dumb" etc. we hopefully don't deter them from contributing and they learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>You've made some edits recently that seem to be a form of personal attack (see these links: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASikhism&amp;diff=62030156&amp;oldid=61928311" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASikhism&amp;diff=62030156&amp;oldid=61928311" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sikhism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61932510" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sikhism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61932510" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sikhism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61928311" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sikhism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61928311" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). If you disagree with someone's edit, that's fine. There is, however, no need to say things like "You are a typical example of a hardcore SIkh...You only go by what you hear and u never actually take the time to read the actual Hindu teachings....U dont bother to learn anything and u just go by what u hear.". If you think an edit someone made is factually incorrect, you should bring it up on the article's talk page (which you did) and provide <a href="../../../e/_/_/WP%7EE_6d39.html" title="WP:E">evidence</a> (external evidence such as a website, we're unable to accept your own knowledge as verifiable evidence which is especially important in editing disputes like this one) as to why you think the edit might be wrong (which I can see you definitely attempted in this edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sikhism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61930726" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sikhism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61930726" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). Remaining <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> through this process is also essential - rather than insulting the intelligence of the user who made the edit (even - <i>especially</i> - if the user was indeed wrong) not only means that people are likely to be more receptive towards your evidence, but also that you will not run foul of other editors who might take insult at what you say.</p>
<p>Basically, we're here to write an encyclopedia. Part of that is having intelligent, evidenced, proper discussion about facts in articles. If editors decide to take the easy way out - by calling their fellow editors names and insulting their intelligence - not only do we lose factual accuracy, but we also lose good contributors who feel unwelcome. Keep this in mind, and you'll have no problems around here. <code>:)</code></p>
<p>You should also see this link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Trolling_on_Talk:Sikhism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Trolling_on_Talk:Sikhism" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> where your case is being discussed by administrators. If you've got any questions or need any more help, let me know.

<dd>Ya but I dont understand....these guys who im debating, get to call all the shots....They are deciding what stays and what goes in the articles....Its as if they are the ones in charge of the article....I mean i understand everyone has opinions...but all I wanted to do was put in a 2 sentence change in the article, which sets up a link, to another article...why?....For people who want to learn something else....and these guys are telling me basically NO...SORRY....NOT GOOD ENOUGH...I mean they make edits with no back up...and I cant do anything <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 21:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I told you initially that your edit was conjecture and for such a controversial claim cited no sources <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sikhism&amp;diff=60586757&amp;oldid=60558933" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sikhism&amp;diff=60586757&amp;oldid=60558933" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. All that occured was a big rambling about Hinduism and Sikhism being the same. All I ask is you provide a reputable source (a published book preferably, not some fringe web site) that mentions the point you're trying to make. If you have that, we can add it to the article - simple! Instead of providing a source, you got into an argument on the talk page.</dd>

<p>Note that some neo-Nazis use "88" to indicate "Heil Hitler": H = 8, you see. Thusly, 818 could be interpreted as "Heil <i>Adolf</i> Hitler"; combined with "ARYAN", this is simply unacceptable.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've unblocked you. Sorry for the inconvenience -- we get a lot of vandalism from nazis and racists, and admins have become very sensitive to anything which could give away such attitudes. I've asked the admin who blocked you not to block you again for this reason, and I have added a notice to your userpage about it.

<p>Hello Aryan,</p>
<p>I had not seen the comments above when I unblocked you. Please do not blank your talk page -- it makes it harder to see what discussions have already happened. The point has been made above that the number "818" is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=818" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=818" rel="nofollow">nazi symbolism</a>. I've never seen it used as such -- Google certainly doesn't indicate that it is very popular -- but I can understand the concern. Would you consider <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogin_5f6a.html" title="Special:Userlogin">creating a new account</a> with a different name, without the number "818"?

<dd>My apologies about this misunderstanding. If you do decide to get a new account, I strongly suggest you get your current account renamed (at <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a>), so that you keep the contributions you have already made.

<dd>True, see <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_818.html" title="Area code 818">Area code 818</a>. The area code of San Fernando valley in Los Angeles is indeed 818. And Aryan is indeed a common Indian name, with no relation to Nazi-related connotations of the word "Aryan". Actually, communities in India have been calling themselves Aryan for more than 2500 years at least. Hitler only "borrowed" the term <i>recently</i> (compared to 2.5 millenia). --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 08:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>it's the combination of the allcaps ARYAN, the number 818 (reminiscent of 88, 18), and the user's aggressive behaviour on race/ethnicity related topics. If user would just do harmless spellchecking edits, I think no-one would have commented on the name. As it is, the name is unsuitable, and if user has a genuine interest in contributing (rather than provocation), he could easily pick another name. It seems evident that user is not interested in contributing and should be classified as a troll (and be blocked on those grounds alone). With Ragib's reasoning, we couldn't block a user "Adolf88" claiming that his first name was Adolf (a perfectly normal first name), and his house number was 88. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:34, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the edit-warring in race-related pages is definitely harmful, and combined with the user name, it makes the users claims questionable. I would suggest ARYAN asks for a user name change, otherwise, people would continue to comment on the Nazi connection. (I'm not commenting on the user's edit patterns, on which I agree with dab.</dd>

<p>Please do not block this username citing "appropriateness" without discussion. The conclusion that the username has Nazi connotations is very subjective and the user might have a valid reason that it may be something else. If there is a problem with the username, file an RFC.

<dd>I do agree with Rama. The saying goes - <i>what is there in a name?</i> But, we can not expect everyone to accept this reality. When a person belonging to the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> could take offence to one's user name in an RfA, persons not exposed to names of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> may certainly take serious objection to a user's normal user name on account of their <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infatuation.html" title="Infatuation">infatuation</a>. It is better to change your user name, if you wish to have a smooth life here.

In view of such a reality, please think over the matter, and please get your user name changed as suggested by Rama. I have seen a user (a personal friend of mine) blocked (killed) for ever after 10 or 12 edits simply because his/her name was similar to certain names used by real or perceived sock-puppets.

<p>Aryan, you are continuously disrupting article talk pages by placing comments at the top, while the norm is to place comments choronologically at the bottom. I already told you how to do so, if you need, a step by step screentshot can be provided (1. grab your mouse. 2. move the cursor to the top bar where you see "+", press the left button of the mouse and release it). Please refrain from adding your rants at the top of talk pages. Thank you. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 05:47, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why is it such a major issue? DOesnt it make more sense to add things to the top of the page? When people view the discussion, most of them dont go to the bottom of the page and work their way to the top....Common sense <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 23:54, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I have ethnic Indian roots and know two people who have the names of Aryan. Aryan is a very beautiful name and the 818 code is rubbish because any set of numbers can be converted into an evil message. I do however, recommend that the caps go (doesn't hurt the eyes) and you read all of Wikipedia's policies and be as kind as possible to anyone. It is time that people lose their prejudices over names like yours just because it was used by Hitler. They should grow up and learn how he changed Indian words into Nazi instead calling half of India as Nazis. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 08:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, when you post messages on talk pages and want to emphasise something, it is better to bolden the word rather than put caps. eg. <b>this</b> instead of THIS. I'm not sure it is official or anything, but it is a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> rule, one step to making your life at Wikipedia better. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 09:07, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aryan, as usual you miss the point - I criticize your username, not your name. The fact is I believe you must change it because you cannot avoid the fact that it does reflect a neo-Nazi symbol. As striking a coincidence it is, it is unfortunate that you picked this very combination of words and numbers when signing up.</p>
<p>The core issue between us is your behavior on <a href="../../../s/i/k/Talk%7ESikhism_e90a.html" title="Talk:Sikhism">Talk:Sikhism</a>. You should not use capitalization, or speak derogatively to Sukh and others. Almost every statement you've made is in deriding and rude tones. We are all human beings, and everyone deserves equal respect. Unfortunately, you are pushing the envelope too far on this, as you have already been warned many times by many administrators.</p>
<p>You will find that a change in your behavior will see a major change in the way other editors talk to you. You will earn respect, and you'll find people willing to listen and respect your work. <b>I went through this exact same thing in November 2005</b>.</p>
<p>Frankly I believe you need to start by apologizing to Sukh. Start the dialogue again, with total respect for other people. And the incivility of Elven6 or anyone else is never an excuse to be rude yourself.</p>
<p>So relax, calm yourself and clear this bad blood between you and other editors. Give yourself a fresh start and realize that Wikipedia is about knowledge and nothing else. No grudges, conflicts or exchanges between editors will ever bear any importance here. So as you start over,</p>
<p><br />

<p>I've seen the contributions you have made and as a Sikh I don't agree with your views. However, one thing that I have noticed about you is that you seem to have a warrior's spirit.

<p>Dravidian is a classification for a family of aboriginal ethnic groups throughout the Indian Sub-continent from Pakistan all the way down to Sri Lanka. Just like the term Oriental was used as a clssification of the ethnic groups in China and Japan. You are right that the average South Indian would not say that he or she is a Dravidian, just like a Chinese or a Japanese would not tell you that they are an Oriental. Also, one cannot say that Dravidians are just only in South India since. Even though they are densely populated in Southern India and Sri Lanka, they are also scattered throughout Central and Northern India too. In the case of Central India and some other parts, there have been intermarriage between both Dravidians and Indo-Aryans. Also, as far as linguistics go, there are Dravidians of Central India and Northern India who speak Indo-Aryan languages, and those whose language is mixed in between Dravidian and Indo-Aryan words. So, to say that Dravidians do not exist, is like saying that Indo-Aryans do not exist. Let me ask you a question. Do you consider Tamils and Punjabis the same group of people? I understand the importance of the unity of India is through diversity. Live and let live. Regards.</p>

<p>Then you haven't read Tamil literature which talks about Tamilakkam or the Tamil country of present day Southern India. After all, isn't Dravidian a Sanskrit or Greek term for Damila = Tamilian? If you are saying that there is no such thing as a Dravidian, you are saying that there is no such thing as an Indian. Can you tell me in which ancient literature (Sanskrit, Tamil, Kanadda, Bengali, etc.) which mentions the word "Indian" or "India"? The word India itself is a derivation of the Greek term Indica, which was derived from the Persian or Indo-Iranian word for the Indus Valley or Hindu. Otherwise there was really no India. I unerstand that the original name for "India" was Bharat which consisted of 16 Mahajanapadas or republics. But, that only consisted of present day North India, Pakistan, part of Afghanistan and part of Central India. As for the Dravidian South, or Tamilakkam if you may, it was its own separate entity with its own kingdoms. Even in Asoka's rock inscriptions III. and IV. It mentions of the boundaries of his empire, and states that the kingdoms of Chera, Chola, and Pandya (Tamilakkam) were outside his realm. The whole sub-continent became united under one administration during the 1700s.</p>
<p>I will admit that the term Dravidian was invented by an outside source to describe the Tamilians and their sister groups such as the Telugus, and Kannadigas. Correct me if I am wrong, but in Vedic literature, do they not mention of Damilas, or Dravidas? How about the Indian national anthem? We can learn a lot from each other. Anyways, I would like to have contructive historical and cultural discussions with you instead of arguements. My olive branch to you: Can we work together collectively and humanely? Regards.</p>

<dd>Sorry if I sounded a little confusing, but what I meant to explain was that the terminology <i>Dravidian</i> is a classification or name of a family of simliar ethnic groups. While the terminology <i>India</i> was given as a name given for the country itself. So, in reality, both the terms <i>India</i> and <i>Dravidian</i> do exist. Furthermore, both names <i>Dravidian</i> and <i>India</i> have been given by the early Europeans. Did you know that the terms Australia and aborigine were names given by Europeans, Greek to be exact? Furthermore, a separate and distinct group of ethnicities do exist in Southern India whom are categorized as Dravidians. Lastly, please use a little more civility while posting discussions or engaging in debate on wikipedia. Thank you and Happy New Year. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 04:45, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you would allow me to intrude, Dravida is not a word invented by outside sources. It is mentioned in Vishnu Purana as 'Pancha Dravidas' and includes Gurjaras, Maharashtras, Telugus, Kannadas, and Tamils (strangely, it does not include Mayalalas), perhaps in the sense of North Indian and South Indian. Padma Purana mentions Dravidas and Dakshinas separately. I have mentioned this in Talk:Hindu. <a href="../../../a/u/p/User%7EAupmanyav_8378.html" title="User:Aupmanyav">Aupmanyav</a> 07:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What I meant by outside sources is that either the word Dravida was invented by the Greek travellers, or in the Indo-Aryan language of Sanskrit which was outside sources (outside of the Tamil country) at the time during the rule of the Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas. I am glad that someone else also agrees that the word Dravidian exists also in historical texts. I have heard of the Pancha Dravidas (Pancha meaning five in Sanskrit). So the five Dravidas were namely the Gujuras, Maharashtras, Telugus, Kannadas, and Tamils. By the way, the Malayalam language was not around during those days. It is a mixture of a lot of Tamil words and Sanskrit words, but became its own independent lanuage around the 8th century. Also, the Tamil Chera Kingdom was known as Chera Nadu which evolved into the name Kerala. So ethnically, the Pancha Dravidas were of the Dravidian family of ethnicities. In regards to the linguistic part of the Pancha Dravidas Gujurati and Maharashtran languages are of the Indo-Aryan family of languages, while Kannada, Telugu, and Tamil are of the Dravidian family of languages. It is interesting how the Dravidian and Indo-Aryan ethnic and linguistic families have interchanged with each other in Central India. Once again, thank you for speaking up on this.

<p>To whom exactly is this statement “anything” referring to? Are we considered as "things" now? Is this in regards to the name ‘’Dravidian’’, or the indigenous people of Southern India? OK, let us set aside the word ‘’Dravidian’’ and not think of that now. Logically speaking, who are we? Yes, as a nationality we can say ‘’Indians’’, but I am not talking about nationality. I understand what nationality is. However, on the other hand linguistically speaking, it is more than obvious that the languages and language scripts of North and South India are totally different like night and day so we do not need to get into that. Now, on the lines of ethnicity, who are we? Are the Tamils, Telugus, Malayalees, and the Kannadigas Aryan? If we are not Aryan, then to what ethnic family do we belong? What is our heritage? Do we not have our own heritage? Why do I keep mentioning about the word ‘’Indian’’ even though the term is not being disputed? Well, the reason is because that too is not an indigenous word, just like ‘’Dravidian’’ is not an indigenous word. Therefore, both terms ‘’Indian’’ and ‘’Dravidian’’ fall in the same category of being named from non indigenous or outside sources. For some odd reason, the fact that the word ‘’India’’ itself is not an indigenous name is blatantly avoided. On the other hand, the term ‘’Dravida’’ gets attacked at every given moment. Furthermore, the term ‘’Dravida’’ is mentioned in Sanskrit sources like the Vedas, while the term ‘’India’’ is not mentioned in any South Asian literature (be it Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Punjabi,etc.). The people who should be concerned or, if so, upset about the term ‘’Davidian’’ are the people who are categorized as ‘’Dravidians’’ themselves.</p>

<dd>Dont get picky about my sentence of "THINGS"....An ethnic group can be any group of people.....The North &amp; South Indian languages are different....But there are many many similar words....The only thing similar about Dravidian and Indian are the fact that there both made up.....THe difference is that people call themself Indian &amp; no one calls themself Dravidian lol....Thats why Dravidian gets attacked and not Indian.....Another reason for the attack is when u mention Indian u are uniting a billion people....When u mention Dravidian u are separating millions of people from the rest of India......U asked one good question....If there not Aryan....who are they?.....Well....They are Aryans as well in some sense arent they?.....An Aryan doesnt have to be light or dark skinned, short or tall....If u want to get technical Indian people are part of the caucasian race <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 02:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cannot believe that someone would post something like this on Wikipedia. First your statement <i>"the term Dravidian is a racist term made up by Europeans..."</i> is an accusation against the Europeans and calling them racist. <i>"Dont u people get it by now!..."</i> is posted. Just what on earth is that supposed to mean? "u people"? Is this statement directed towards us, or the ethnic groups in Southern India? And then the message is ended with, <i>"Brrrrrrrruah Punjab India!"</i>? Correct me if I am wrong, but am I sensing some kind of superiority aura here?</p>

<p>What exactly does "in the bigger picture" supposed to mean? I'm sorry, not everybody thinks the same, or can read other peoples minds, but please be more descriptive. The more we discuss into detail about the ethnic cultures of India, the weirder and eerie it gets.

In the first place nothing crossed my mind about that particular user name since I understand that it stands for Indo-Arya. There is already a disclaimer message in bold face cap letters on your site. It is not the user name that is offending people, it is this discourteous attitude of intolerance towards other people’s cultures and heritage, and I am not talking about nationality. The above statement posted on my user talk page sends me the message that the indigenous people of Southern India in general do not exist, and should not exist.</p>

"Since this topic concerns both of us, so I thought it better to post on your page. Aryan, of course, is welcome to join us, <br />
if he so desires. Here is what I would like to add. You said on Aryan's page that Aryans (and Greeks) called South Indians <br />
Dravida, it may or may not be true. There might have been people who called themselves Dravida. The writers of Vishnu <br />
Purana and Padma Purana might have picked up the name by which these people knew themselves, e.g., Marwari for those who <br />
lived in the earstwhile state of Jodhpur and Mewari for those who lived in the state of Udaipur. I will also contest your <br />
view that Bharatvarsha was only North India, otherwise Kalidasa's Meghdoot would not have taken the trouble to travel all <br />
the way from Kanyakumari to Himalaya, travelling from Vindhyas would have been enough. And if Dravidians signifies <br />
aboriginals then those in the South India are not the only ones, you have other aboriginals in UP, Bihar, Bengal, and <br />
Orissa. So all aboriginals of India cannot be termed as Dravidas. This was the real mischief done by christian <br />
missionaries, they turned the name of a people into a race and separate from Aryans. <a href="../../../a/u/p/User%7EAupmanyav_8378.html" title="User:Aupmanyav">Aupmanyav</a> 12:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Firstly, I will have to ask you to please show a little tolerance of other religions, since a lot of us in the South are Christians. Secondly, the aboriginals, tribals, backwards castes, and untouchables throughout the whole of India (with the exception of Eastern India) are ethnically related to the Dravidians of southern India. I am talking about both the ethnic and linguistic families in India. There have been historians, of not only European background, but from India itself, whom have stated in their books about Southern Dravidians, Central Dravidians, and Northern Dravidians in relation to ethnicity and languge. Some of these authors, linguists, anthropologist, and historians:<br /></p>

</ul>
<p><br />
Once again, Dravidian is just a term to classify the non-Aryas of the country. If the term Dravidian is disliked so much, then let us change it to non-Aryas. I do not know why the term Dravidian causes such a ruckus to some people. For goodness sake, live and let live. We are not going into Northern India and telling everbody how to live their lives, and what to call themselves, etc. We are just minding our own business.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - Dravid merely means south. Dravidian = South Indian its quite simple. People that believe in a Dravidian race and people that believe in an Aryan race are both wrong. Both are in fact racists in their own way (though one is obviously made out to be more racist - even in India).

<dd>This is part of the problem; when people start their responses with aggressive phrases like "Ok listen to me carefully" they immediately put up the backs of the other person. The peculiar texting-spellings and use of four dots as punctuation also makes what you say hard to read, which doesn't help. As a courtesy to others, could you use correct spellings and punctuation?</dd>
<dd>More importantly (or, at least, more pertinently to the issue of your name), it doesn't matter who made it bold and all-caps, the fact is that it's difficult to read and is the sort of style favoured by disruptive editors; you'd be much better advised to change it. Moreover, the mere fact that you say "I shouldn't be blocked because of my name", and that some other people agree, isn't a magic shield against different opinions. There are far more people writing to this page who advise you to change than there are people who advise you not to.</dd>
<dd>Many of your questions are answered by what's been said above, which you don't seem to have read carefully enough. Perhaps the main point is this: it doesn't <i>matter</i> why some people find it offensive; that many do would make a courteous and considerate person consider changing it. For example, another editor (<a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">user:Budgiekiller</a>), with a much less provocative name, has just changed it despite its being perfectly innocent in origin, because other people misunderstood it. (Just for the record, note also that I didn't argue on the basis of offensiveness, nor did I say that it's the "818" that's the main problem; I argued that it creates more work for vandal-fighters, and I pointed out that you'd either misread or misunderstood Zoe's original question.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:13, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For some odd reason, <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> is missing the point here. It seems that he feels he is being blocked only for his name without realizing it is also including his intolerant abusive behavior. Just because there is a warning on his user page not to remove his name since it is part of his heritage does not give him the license to abuse others, regardless of their backgrounds. He makes it seem like that pointless statement on his user page is his insurance for admin to provide him assurance that he would not get kicked out of Wikipedia for his acts. <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> also feels that he is intolerance/ abuse exempt due to someone writing in bold not to remove this individual because of his user name on his talk page as well. However, he does not realize that through his actions he is turning his talk page into a resume for bad behavior and thus legitimization for grounds of termination.</dd>

<dd>Lastly, there are people who argue that the Nazis have taken the term Aryan and the symbol of Swastika and have demonized it. However, believe it or not, there are folks from Indo-Aryan supremacists groups in India who idolize Adolph Hitler and the Nazis for popularizing their name and symbol. Furthermore, these particular groups in India are following the same model as the Nazis through intolerance of other ethnities and religions different from theirs.

<dd>It is truly sad that there are groups in India who idolize Adolph Hitler and his Nazi party just for the fact that they have promoted their usage of the terminologies of <i>aryan</i>, <i>swastika</i>, and <i>nastika</i> (reversed swastika, also later changed to <i>nazi</i> in Germany), and also for the parallel of beliefs of superiority. Apart from <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818s</a> intolerance of other people’s backgrounds and beliefs, his talk page shows a six month chronological history of other negative actions such as personal attacks, controversial edits, and removing other peoples edits without valid reason. It also shows that he has been blocked a few times in the past. <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> has been taking various warnings and blockings for granted.

<p>I need to make my position clear. I personally don't find the username offensive, and have no objctions to it. I do, however, object to Aryan818's very short temper and inability to discuss issues in an adult way.</p>
<p>It must be recognised, though, that an innocent name in one place <i>can</i> be offensive in another, and it's surely only good manners to go along with the language-group of a place (just as it's good manners, for example, not to use gestures or wear clothing that, while perfectly innocent at home, are offensive in the country one is visiting). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:30, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not commenting here on the users edit patterns or his contribs. I am just commenting on the objections raised towards the user name.

It'd simply imply that since Swastika has racist connonations in the west, Hinduism related templates should not use them.<a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidhishsinghal_5350.html" title="User:Nidhishsinghal">nids</a><a href="../../../n/i/d/User_talk%7ENidhishsinghal_a3a7.html" title="User talk:Nidhishsinghal">(♂)</a> 22:53, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it would imply nothing of the kind. there's an essential difference between what goes into Wikipedia articles and what happens behind the scenes, in the community of editors. In the former case, truth and accuracy trump offence; that some people are offended at the sight of a swastika is irrelevant — we display the symbol and explain what it means, how and why it's been used, and so on. That's the rôle of an encyclopædia, and we'd be going against the essential point of the enterprise if we bowed to ignorant offence. That an editor insists on using a certain name despite the offence of his or her peers is not at all the same thing (would you think that a Hindu editor who insisted on using the name "Swastika Boy" was being reasonable?).</p>
<p>Note that Wikipedia is plagued by people who want to undermine the project by pushing extreme, fanatical, often racist views, and they often use names like "Aryan" and the like. It's surely a simple courtesy to hard-worked editors watching out for such attacks not to use such a name, however innocently it was originally meant. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:55, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aryan, would it hurt to change your username at least the 818 part because it will prevent any misunderstand. It is a coincidence that both Aryan and 818 are related to you but I believe you. If you change your name to for example "Aryan Surname" it will be clearer that Aryan is your name, therefore you have no intention of insulting Jews. I'm requesting this for <b>your</b> sake, not mine or anyone's else. It will make your experience of Wikipedia more enjoyable. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 00:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If people want to unite a particular nation together, the first thing one does not do is to eliminate other peoples languages and erase their cultural history and identity. Revising history and re-inventing the wheel does help either. FYI: Dravidians are not only in India, but in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. One just cannot go around and make up something expecting the world to follow as fact. Can you tell me if these three people belong to the same ethnicity, leave alone belonging to the Caucasian ethnic family in <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wikiraja/drav-arya-mon1.JPG" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/wikiraja/drav-arya-mon1.JPG" rel="nofollow">this picture?</a> By the way, skin color has nothing to do with what we are talking about, even though that tends to be the favorite use for debate. I have never touched on the issue of skin color, since I feel it is irrelevant to this topic, and of course the oldest tool for argument in the book.</p>
<p>The reason why some of the Dravidian languages have certain Sanskrit words was due to early contacts with each other through trade and certain religious practices. Similarly, Malay and Indonesian have adopted Tamil words in their languages due to historical interactions of trade and commerce with the Pallava and Chola Dravidian kingdoms of the early Tamil country. This doesn't mean that these languages are the same. If both Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages were of the same family of languages, then the very basic words in their languages would have a lot of commonalities. An example of this would be in the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wikiraja/drav-aryalanguages.JPG" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/wikiraja/drav-aryalanguages.JPG" rel="nofollow">words for numbers</a>. But, as we can see, this is not true.</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Dravidian is a racist term....Many Europeans went to India trying to understand INdian history and very very badly understood<br />
it....Alot of them came up with this idea that Aryans came from Europe, went through Iran/India, and mixed in with the<br />
Darker Dravidians lol....And they say the "tall light skinned Aryans pushed down the dark skinned Dravdians (Which to them<br />
explains why north Indians are supposedly lighter then south Indians)......ANd whats wrong with Brrrruah Punjab India<br />

<p>And just who belongs to these so called "sub-culture" groups? "Sub-humans"?</p>
<p>Since many people have blocked you because of your name, it was also because of your intolerant attitude towards other people's ethnic, national, and religous backgrounds. Lastly, the term "race" tends to be a favorite word to use as I have seen in most of your postings. Just remember one thing, there is only one race which is the human race.</p>

<dd>Aryan, she said the Aryan part was okay but it became too much when it was added with 818, a number associated with the Nazis. The coincidence is too great. Changing your username isn't such a hassle, just go to <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a> and follow the instructions. It doesn't take very long. I am requesting this for <b>your sake</b> not anyone elses. You will enjoy your time on Wiki if you change your username slightly, at least remove the 818. One suggestion is to add your surname so everyobody realises Aryan <i>is</i> your first name.

<li>Your user page doesn't explain the 818 part, which becomes two coincidences. Maybe that Wiki member doesn't know about the 818 connection.</li>
<li>I only saw one warning. The thing is even if Aryan is a common name (I know it is, I have Indian origins), it doesn't stop the name being confusing and misleading like I said before. It isn't inflammatory or troublesome, because you didn't <i>intend</i> to insult Jews, but lesser educated people will misunderstand.</li>

<dd>If I was you...I would quit Wikipedia...Its not worth the agravation of dealing with these arrogant jerks sitting in their basements with nothing better to do than pretend how important they are because they can edit in Wikipedia...As for the name...you're saying that is your name and I believe it...No one is going to put himself through so much grief if it wasn't...Good God, people, look at the crap you have put this guy through...you think anyone would go through all this nonsense so that they could vandalize one of your precious pages AND WATCH IT GET REVERTED BACK BY ONE OF THE BOTS OR ADMINS ALMOST INSTANTLY?...Get a clue...as for the dots...these are common in early telegraph communications in parts of the world...of course you will probably accuse me of being ARYAN818 as well... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.96.18.5_fb8a.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.96.18.5">204.96.18.5</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.96.18.5.html" title="User talk:204.96.18.5">talk</a>) 20:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>You know what's funny is that I would indeed advocate banning Aryan because of the fact that his "arguements" are rubbish. Everyone else seems to want to force him to change his usernmae as if this is going to magically change his personality or perhaps make his comments more palatable...If Adolf Hitler went by the name of "Percy Wentworth" and did the things he did, not only would no one want to have the last name, but he would still take a beating on Wiki, among other places for using the name "Percy" or "Wentworth" in an username even if he was a bright reasonable person who presented his arguements congenially...Something Aryan can't do...this is why I am mocking this exchange with Aryan because again, I think that most of his objectors are proceeding from a false arguemnt with forcing a name change...Then again, I should remember the old saying about arguing over the interent..."Even if you win, you're still mentally handicapped"...Art8641 March 7 2007</p>
