<p>Further research into the location and activities of the <b>Aryan Brotherhoof</b> would improve the article.</p>
<p><br />
Predominately?? Shouldn't it be 100% since it's Aryan and all...</p>
<p>This article has no place in a WikiProject on Facism. The Aryan Brotherhood is a criminal prison gang, not a political one.</p>
<p>Second, the contention that the AB has ties to the White Supremacist Arayn Nations is at best, questionable. I would like to know the source and if it has been confirmed. The AB, again, is a criminal prison gang, not a political or religous group. What spiritual/religous beliefs they have are rooted more in their own interpetations of Nietszche than in Christian Identity. AB members tend not to like the political White supremacists in prison, as they have very different goals.</p>
<p>The statement that the AB has a presence in NY homeless shelters also needs to be looked at. I have never come across such a thing.</p>

<p>This article is disgracefully written and it is a complete embarassment to wikipedia that it has allowed to stand as is for so long. It needs, to put it mildly, extreme revisions in order to make it even somewhat respectable. I plan on working on it and I hope others will join me. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 14:47, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The New Yorker article mentions that one of the principal AB members, TD Bingham, is half Jewish and has a Star of David tattoo. Another member is named Tom Silverstein. This reinforces the argument that the AB is a prison gang rather than an "Aryan Nations"-style "extremist" group. Furthermore, having members of Mexican descent or with Spanish-sounding last names doesn't mean that a group has "non-White" members, since "Latino" is a cultural term and doesn't denote any particular race and many Mexicans are "White" as well.</p>

<p>I would like to say this article certainly needed a more neutral POV edit. I am not knowledgeable in prison sociology or criminology, so I would not want to begin it.</p>
<p>The prose style by the writer is certainly very passionate and makes it an easy read. But this approach makes it impossible for opponents to fact correct without vandalizing the article.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Wiki I must call on both sides of the debate on this article to try to stick to a neutral POV.</p>

<p>the general tone earlier was actually taken from a book on gang tatoos: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gangs-Their-Tattoos-Identifying-Gangbangers/dp/1581600992/sr=8-1/qid=1162165034/ref=sr_1_1/002-5736522-0420068?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/Gangs-Their-Tattoos-Identifying-Gangbangers/dp/1581600992/sr=8-1/qid=1162165034/ref=sr_1_1/002-5736522-0420068?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Gangs-Their-Tattoos-Identifying-Gangbangers/dp/1581600992/sr=8-1/qid=1162165034/ref=sr_1_1/002-5736522-0420068?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books</a></p>

<p>also the Arizona ab is an offshoot of the original and main ab of california. So I wouldn't use it as a source.</p>

<p>Neither John William King nor any of his associates were or are members of the Aryan Brotherhood. It seems like "Aryan Brotherhood" is becoming a generic catch-all term for any White prison gang, sort of like refering to everyone who rides a Harley Davidson as a "Hells Angel" See: <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/jasper/king/228293.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/jasper/king/228293.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/jasper/king/228293.html</a> "Sammy Buentello, assistant director of the Texas prison system's gang task force, said both King and Brewer had been monitored for possible affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate Knights of America (CKA), a skinhead group, while they were housed at the Beto I Unit in Tennessee Colony. But none of the three suspects was linked to membership in the Aryan Brotherhood, one of the most violent gangs operating inside the state prisons, Buentello added.</p>

<dd>Another source disagrees with your source, which doesn't necessarily surprise me. This could be written as "John William King may have joined the Brotherhood in jail (source), but this assessment is disputed by Sammy Buentello, assistant director blah blah blah (source)." That seems like a good compromise to me. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 22:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess it would depend on which source would be credible in terms of direct familiarity with both King and with gangs in the Texas state prison system. King's actual jailer, located in Texas, seems just a little more likely to have personal knowledge of the facts than an "analyst" for the SPLC that fails to cite sources, and relies on information from anonymous posters who purport to be somehow linked to AB-like groups while posting on the "Stormfront" website. It wouldn't be considered credible to just cite the anonymous "Stormfront" "internet warriors" as a source. Why should it be any different when SPLC does the same on their website? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.27.203.131_0de9.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.27.203.131">208.27.203.131</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.27.203.131.html" title="User talk:208.27.203.131">talk</a>)</small></dd>

<dd>Well, I disagree that King's jailer is an automatically more credible source than any journalist. The head of a prison easily can have an agenda to downplay gang activity, particularly in the case of someone who left jail and then proceeded to drag someone behind a pickup truck. Also, just because someone didn't directly join the Aryan Brotherhood doesn't mean they weren't influenced by the Brotherhood's actions while in jail (this interpretation has not been expressed in the article so far). Finally, while Wikipedia doesn't cite original research, it is completely unavoidable to not cite sources that use original research. The definition of a secondary work, which is what Wikipedia relies on for citatations, is one that uses primary sources to argue a point or tell a story (i.e. original research). In this particular case, I couldn't interview a jail official and publish the information here, but if a newspaper reporter does so and publishes that interview or part of it in a story, it becomes okay as a source.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the solution here would be to just relay the information given by the sources and allow the reader to decide on their credibility, rather than making that judgment for them. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 19:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well... I never suggested that Mr. Buentello was "automatically [a] more credible source than any journalist." Furthermore, if you consider cribbings from anonymous posts on racist websites like "Stormfront" to be valid secondary sources, why don't we just throw objectivity out the window and surrender to the demons of subjectivity. The bottom line is, including reference to King in an article on the AB serves only for shock value and is needless distraction at best, particularly because of the notorious nature of his crime. Meanwhile, there is little or no credible evidence that he even came into contact with a PRISON GANG that is primarily based in the California and Federal systems while incarcerated in Texas. If "original research" is of any value, I attended the recent RICO trials of AB members in Southern California and heard numerous witnesses for the prosecution and the defense testify that AB is NOT affiliated with the "Aryan Nations", (KKK, nazi groups, etc.)and that their primary purpose is advancement of the gang's power base and economic interest behind bars. That included black gang members testifying for the defense that the AB war against the D.C. Blacks was "gang business" and not racially motivated. But then, maybe twisting the race angle makes it a little more spicy than just writing about a bunch of aging bullies and career criminals who have killed just as many white prisoners (including their own members) as blacks in order to advance their much more pragmatic agenda of drugs, money and power. BTW, don't forget: "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not Court TV.

</dl>
<ol>
<li>To say the "King's actual jailer... seems just a little more likely to have personal knowledge of the facts" seems like you're saying he is a more credible source. That may be, or it may not be, but I don't think it's for either you or I to decide.</li>
<li>I did not, nor would I ever claim, that a threaded discussion group is a valid secondary source. I am saying that an article, in this case published in SPLC's magazine, is a secondary source that is using discussion group postings as primary sources.</li>
<li>The article does not claim that the Aryan Brotherhood is a purist white supremacy group, and notes their cooperation with Asian gangs, the Mexican Mafia, and other groups. However, the gang did start as a white supremacist organization and does use white supremacy and racism to recruit and motivate, so it cannot be ignored in a discussion of the Aryan Nations.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>So far, the only complaint that you have made is about the murderers of James Byrd, but you also took out sourced information indicating that Aryan Brotherhood members commit hate crimes and other crimes when they are released from prison. I am going to restore that section, although I will leave the bit out about the King and his cohorts until this is resolved.
