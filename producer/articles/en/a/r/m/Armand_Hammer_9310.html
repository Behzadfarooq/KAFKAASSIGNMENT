<p><b>Armand Hammer</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">May 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a> – <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_10.html" title="December 10">December 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>) was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> industrialist and art collector. Hammer was CEO of the <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occidental_Petroleum_Company_7991.html" title="Occidental Petroleum Company">Occidental Petroleum Company</a>, an <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">oil</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_gas.html" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> exploration and development company.</p>
<p>Hammer was born in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan%2C_New_York_f91a.html" title="Manhattan, New York">Manhattan, New York</a> and attended <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_College_of_Columbia_University_6f7e.html" title="Columbia College of Columbia University">Columbia College</a> and then <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_school.html" title="Medical school">medical school</a> at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> as a young man; he received his medical license in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> and, though he never practiced medicine, he relished being referred to as "Dr. Hammer."</p>
<p>Instead, after graduating from medical school, Hammer extended earlier <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrepreneur.html" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneurial</a> ventures with a successful <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">business</a> importing many goods from and exporting <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical.html" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceuticals</a> to the newly-formed <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. He moved to the USSR in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> to oversee these operations, especially his large business manufacturing and exporting inexpensive pencils. After returning to the US, he entered into a diverse array of business, art, cultural, and humanitarian endeavors, including investing in various U.S. oil production efforts. These oil investments were later parlayed into control of Occidental Petroleum.</p>
<p>Throughout his life he continued personal and business dealings with the Soviet Union, despite <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboos</a> against such dealings by Americans. In later years he lobbied and traveled extensively at great personal expense, working for peace between the United States and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communist</a> countries of the world, including ferrying physicians and supplies into the Soviet Union to help <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernobyl.html" title="Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> survivors.</p>
<p>Politically, Hammer was a staunch supporter of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">party</a>. He boosted <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">presidential</a> campaign with tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. He was convicted on charges that one of these donations had been made illegally, but was later <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardon.html" title="Pardon">pardoned</a> by Republican U.S. President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Hammers' name was widely used in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> by the Soviets. The contradiction between Hammer's open sympathy for the Soviet Union and his success as a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a>, as well as his involvement in international affairs and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>, have made Hammer a subject of suspicion and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> for many; further, his close relationship with former <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic</a> <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Gore%2C_Sr._e6dd.html" title="Albert Gore, Sr.">Albert Gore, Sr.</a>, despite Hammer's own party affiliations, has been the subject of especially broad scrutiny and speculation.</p>
<p>Hammer was also an avid collector of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionism.html" title="Impressionism">Impressionist</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-Impressionism_acc2.html" title="Post-Impressionism">Post-Impressionist</a> paintings. His personal donation forms the core of the permanent collection of the <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a> <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammer_Museum_ee62.html" title="Hammer Museum">Hammer Museum</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>.</p>
<p>Despite popular myth, the relation between Hammer's name and the household product <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arm_and_Hammer_89d3.html" title="Arm and Hammer">Arm and Hammer</a> <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baking_soda.html" title="Baking soda">baking soda</a> is coincidental. The pun was not lost on Hammer, though: during the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, he attempted to buy <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_and_Dwight_7c84.html" title="Church and Dwight">Church and Dwight</a>, makers of the Arm and Hammer line of products; he succeeded in buying a sizable minority interest and eventually sat on its <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_directors.html" title="Board of directors">board of directors</a>.</p>
<p>He claimed that his father Julius Hammer had named him after a character, Armand Duval, in <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i> by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandre_Dumas%2C_fils_d4d0.html" title="Alexandre Dumas, fils">Alexandre Dumas, fils</a>. In fact, according to Carl Blumay, his biographer and former press agent, Armand Hammer was named after the "<a href="../../../a/r/m/Arm_and_Hammer_89d3.html" title="Arm and Hammer">Arm and Hammer</a>" symbol of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Labor_Party_d74a.html" title="Socialist Labor Party">Socialist Labor Party</a>, in which his father had a leadership role at one time. (After the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a>, a part of the SLP under Julius' leadership split off to become a founding element of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_the_USA_36bd.html" title="Communist Party of the USA">Communist Party of the USA</a>.)</p>
<p>Hammer was a philanthropist, supporting causes related to <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>, medicine, and the arts. Among his legacies is the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armand_Hammer_United_World_College_of_the_American_West_01cc.html" title="Armand Hammer United World College of the American West">Armand Hammer United World College of the American West</a> (now generally called the UWC-USA, part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_World_Colleges_daed.html" title="United World Colleges">United World Colleges</a>). He embraced a kind of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> view of world affairs, in which personal relationships could overcome <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geopolitics.html" title="Geopolitics">geopolitical</a> tensions. Through the mid-1980s, he tried to make his own life a model of this, and bragged that he was the only man to have known both <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Lenin_a39d.html" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>.</p>
<p>His generosity and <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy.html" title="Diplomacy">diplomacy</a> were recognized around the world, and by the time he died, Hammer had won the Soviet Union's <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenin_Order_of_Friendship_Among_the_Peoples_429f.html" title="Lenin Order of Friendship Among the Peoples">Lenin Order of Friendship Among the Peoples</a>, the U.S. National Arts Medal, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>'s <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Honor_431f.html" title="Legion of Honor">Legion of Honor</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>'s Grand Order of Merit, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>'s Royal Order of the Polar Star, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>'s Knight Commander's Cross, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>'s Hilal-i-Quaid-Azam Peace Award, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s Leadership Award, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>'s Order of Andres Bello, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>'s National Recognition Award, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>'s Jubilee Medal, and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>'s <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Crown_342a.html" title="Order of the Crown">Order of the Crown</a>. Hammer hungered for a <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>, and was nominated for one in 1988 for his outreach to end the Cold War, but the award went to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenzin_Gyatso%2C_14th_Dalai_Lama_f095.html" title="Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama">Tenzin Gyatso</a> (the 14th Dalai Lama).</p>
<p>He also appeared on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cosby_Show_5174.html" title="The Cosby Show">The Cosby Show</a></i>, saying that a cure for <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> was imminent. His confidence was not justified, as he died of <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_marrow.html" title="Bone marrow">bone marrow</a> cancer in December 1990. He was 92 years old.</p>
