<p>ArmanJan, threats are a poor substitute for reasoned arguments. Why do you object to the photo link? I believe it is relevant; it adds to the resources immediately available to the reader of "Military of Iran," which is hardly detailed enough. And, as long as I'm asking, why did you add the Eagle Claw link? <a href="../../../p/r/r/User%7EPRRfan_ba7e.html" title="User:PRRfan">PRRfan</a> 00:54, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is relevant, however it is not relevant to add these pictures on the main site of the Iran military. The link to these pictures is already on the operation page. If extra links and pictures of everything is added the page would look very different. If people are interested about the operation, they will go to that link and check the pictures, but not on Iran's military page. User:ArmanJan</p>
<p>Yes, you keep saying that. But a) the page is not very long, so any more information would seem to be useful at this point; and b) you yourself have included a link (<a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Eagle_Claw_7cdb.html" title="Operation Eagle Claw">Operation Eagle Claw</a>) with less apparent relevance than photos of an action that actually involved the Iranian military. Why do you think that the Military of Iran page needs less information than presently presented? <a href="../../../p/r/r/User%7EPRRfan_ba7e.html" title="User:PRRfan">PRRfan</a> 17:01, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you go back in the history of that page you will see that the page was very long, with a lot of information. However, it was then divided in many pages, and the Iranian military page links to them all. This is how we would like to keep it (those who attend to the iranian military pages). I added Operation Eagle Claw because I see it as just as irrelevant as the other operations. Someone feld it was needed to also add the small battles, so here you go. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmanJan_72ca.html" title="User:ArmanJan">User:ArmanJan</a></p>
<p>Well, if the battle has already been fought to slim the page down, then I won't try to bulk it back up. (Not sure about your reasoning on the last point, tho.) Cheers. <a href="../../../p/r/r/User%7EPRRfan_ba7e.html" title="User:PRRfan">PRRfan</a> 21:13, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've tried to narrow down the dispute to a few key areas. Could you review the list at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Iranian_military_industry#List_of_disputed_points" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Iranian_military_industry#List_of_disputed_points" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Iranian_military_industry#List_of_disputed_points</a> and confirm that it has all the disputed points.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Zulfiqar1.jpg</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear.

If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<dd>Hi ArmanJan. It may very well be that it's okay to use the picture of Nasrallah, but if so you must provide better information than you have done. The fact that you know the owner of the site and that he has said that it's okay to use the picture, doesn't necessarily mean that it is true. You claim that it is a promotional picture. If so, you must, according to the Wikipedia rules, show why you think so: who owns the copyright, for what purpose was it originally published, and why you think it can be tagged as promotional. In this case, "promotional" basically means that it must have been sent out to the press by Hezbollah, and that Hezbollah owns the copyright.

<dd>Hi again, ArmanJan. I'm sorry I had to remove your latest picture addition to Wikipedia's currently most important page. Just like you, most of us would desperately like to see other illustrations than those put out by IDF, but unfortunately it's very hard to find pictures from the Lebanese side that can be used without violating copyright. I wish at least one Wikipedian in Beirut could venture out with his/her camera and take a picture that we could use without any problem, but until then we must stick to the rules. Taking pictures that are owned by news agencies like AP is an absolute no/no. Sorry. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 15:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why did you tag it as "unfree"? Not only had I already added the source, but I also know the owner of that site. You obviously had other reasons for doing that. Anyway, you may contact the owner at: <a href="http://www.shiaimages.net/index.php?template=about" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shiaimages.net/index.php?template=about" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> if you wish.

<dd>Hi ArmanJan. It may very well be that it's okay to use the picture of Nasrallah, but if so you must provide better information than you have done. The fact that you know the owner of the site and that he has said that it's okay to use the picture, doesn't necessarily mean that it is true. You claim that it is a promotional picture. If so, you must, according to the Wikipedia rules, show why you think so: who owns the copyright, for what purpose was it originally published, and why you think it can be tagged as promotional. In this case, "promotional" basically means that it must have been sent out to the press by Hezbollah, and that Hezbollah owns the copyright. Best regards <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 14:37, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand what "promotional" means. That site also makes pictures and they distribute these pictures for the purpose of advertising (Iran, religious figures, etc..). That is why I used "promotional". <b><a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmanJan_72ca.html" title="User:ArmanJan">ArmanJan</a> 14:44, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>"Promotional" would only apply if the site is 1) an official Shia site (i.e. run by a recognised Shia organisation), and 2) the site owns the copyright (i.e. the site owner of one of its staff has taken the picture, or the site owner has bought (or been given) the copyright from the photographer. If the owner, who you say you know, owns the copyright, the easiest thing is to get an okay from him and publish that okay together with a more appropriate tag, such as a Creative Commons {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}} tag. I hope you can sort it out, because it is a good picture and I would like to see it stay, but Wikipedia has very strict rules regarding copyright. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 15:04, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm aware it's a different image; you'll note I said <b>images from news sources</b>, not this particular picture. And no, it isn't free in use, as you claim, or at least if it is, you haven't tagged it as such. You've used a tag that says it's fair use, which is a different thing. However, the tag you've used (if you'll read it) says, and I quote, <i>This is a copyrighted image that has been released by a <b>company or organization to promote their work or product in the media, such as advertising material or a promotional photo in a press kit</b>.</i> This tag does not apply to photos taken by newsmedia. Therefore, unless you have evidence of it being 'free use', then the image should not be in the article. Believe it or not, I'm as unhappy as you - I'd much rather use the Beirut photo, it is much better than the tank. But the tank is allowed, your photo is not. --<a href="../../../i/o/r/User%7EIorek85_1fc0.html" title="User:Iorek85">Iorek85</a> 10:02, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a very tough time understanding why you choose to ignore the truth, and rather spread Anti-Israeli propoganda. If that's your purpose, just open a blog. This is an encyclopedia. It has been reported by all the major news agencies, inluding Reuters and Associated press, as well as documented by footage (which I don't have here to show you but I'm sure you have seen it or can find it somewhere), that the Israeli border patrol was attacked on Israeli soil while patrolling the border. There were two Humvees, one with 4 soldiers and one with 3 soldiers. Both where attacked at 9:05 AM, and their last radio to base was: "This is border patrol 5 (I think that was their number), we have been attacked." Upon reaching the site of the attack, the rescue force found two burnt Humvees, Three dead bodies, another seriously injured, one physically unharmed but shocked soldier, and two soldiers were missing. This is the truth, and it is clearly obvious that whoever reports otherwise (which so far have been, what, two lebanese policeman who are obviously anti-Israeli???) is a liar. I'm an Israeli reservist, and if my officer told me to infiltrate Lebanese territory on my last day of service, hours before I can go home to my family and friends, I would have refused his order and gone to prison, as would have any other Israeli soldier. Such an order is an order considered in the Israeli army an "Clearly Illegal order", and has no chance of being given by anyone. Your persistence in posting these lies only hurts this article and the truth. Seriously, if you wanna post what you think, go open a blog. Tweekerd 11:34, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've laid out reasons on the article's talk page, I've brought citations. I've made an edit which still has the very flimsy claim in it, despite the fact that I think it has no place in wikipedia (not because it is false, but because it is poorly sourced and cited). The claim is false, and presenting it as a competitor to Israeli claims is not NPOV -- it is an extraordinary claim given the amount of citation to the contrary, and I urge you to read <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_evidence" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_evidence</a>, which explicitly lays out WP's approach to such claims. In the meantime, it is sheer POV and bias to include a graphic displaying a big "soldiers captured here" when there is so little to support the claim. The image itself, alone, is POV because it has red lettering laying out what is not even cited as hezbollah's position on the matter, while giving zero display to the claims of pretty much the rest of the world. Although it personally makes me feel like taking a shower, I am talking to you and trying to resolve this in the Wikipedia Way. Stop making reasonless reverts, go to the talk page where I have laid out a course of action, and participate instead of bias editing. If nothing else, it should make you feel ill that you are helping to promote this lie. Like I said, I have firsthand knowledge of the issue, and although that gets me nowhere in wikipedia, I hope that a personal appeal will somehow light a spark in your conscience.
