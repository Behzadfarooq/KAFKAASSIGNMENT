<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_control.html" title="Edit section: Enactment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enactment</span></h2>
<p>Arms control treaties and agreements are often seen as a way to avoid costly <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_race.html" title="Arms race">arms races</a> which would prove counter-productive to national aims and future peace. Some are used as ways to stop the spread of certain military technologies (such as nuclear weaponry or missile technology) in return for assurances to potential developers that they will not be victims of those technologies. Additionally, some arms control agreements are entered to limit the damage done by warfare, especially to civilians and the environment, which is seen as bad for all participants regardless of who wins a war.</p>
<p>While arms control treaties are seen by many peace proponents as a key tool against war, by the participants, they are often seen as simply ways to limit the high costs of the development and building of weapons, and even reduce the costs associated with war itself. Arms control can even be a way of maintaining the viability of military action by limiting those weapons that would make war so costly and destructive as to make it no longer a viable tool for national policy.</p>
<p><a name="Enforcement" id="Enforcement"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_control.html" title="Edit section: Enforcement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enforcement</span></h2>
<p>Enforcement of arms control agreements has proven difficult over time. Most agreements rely on the continued desire of the participants to abide by the terms to remain effective. Usually, when a nation no longer desires to abide by the terms, they usually will seek to either covertly circumvent the terms or to simply end their participation in the treaty. This was seen in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Naval_Treaty_72ed.html" title="Washington Naval Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> (and the subsequent <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Naval_Treaty_648a.html" title="London Naval Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a>), where most participants sought to work around the limitations, some more legitimately than others. The United States developed better technology to get better performance from their ships while still working within the weight limits, the United Kingdom exploited a loop-hole in the terms, the Italians misrepresented the weight of their vessels, and when up against the limits, Japan simply left the treaty. The nations which violated the terms of the treaty did not suffer great consequences for their actions. Within little more than a decade, the treaty was abandoned. The <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Protocol_8851.html" title="Geneva Protocol">Geneva Protocol</a> has lasted longer and been more successful at being respected, but still nations have violated it at will when they have felt the need. Enforcement has been haphazard, with measures more a matter of politics than adherence to the terms. This meant sanctions and other measures tended to be advocated against violators primarily by their natural political enemies, while violations have been ignored or given only token measures by their political allies.</p>
<p>More recent arms control treaties have included more stringent terms on enforcement of violations as well as verification. This last has been a major obstacle to effective enforcement, as violators often attempt to covertly circumvent the terms of the agreements. Verification is the process of determining whether or not a nation is complying with the terms of an agreement, and involves a combination of release of such information by participants as well as some way to allow participants to examine each other to verify that information. This often involves as much negotion as the limits themselves, and in some cases questions of verification have led to the breakdown of treaty negotiations (for example, verification was cited as a major concern by opponents of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comprehensive_Test_Ban_Treaty_d49b.html" title="Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty">Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</a>, ultimately not ratified by the United States).</p>
<p>Nations may remain in a treaty while seeking to break the limits of that treaty as opposed to simply withdrawing from it. This is for two major reasons. To openly defy an agreement, even if one withdraws from it, often is seen in a bad light politically and can carry diplomatic repercussions. Additionally, if one remains in an agreement, competitors who are also participatory may be held to the limitations of the terms, while withdrawal releases your opponents to make the same developments you are making, limiting the advantage of that development.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_control.html" title="Edit section: Theory of Arms Control">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theory of Arms Control</span></h2>
<p>Scholars and practitioners such as John Steinbruner, Jonathan Dean or Stuart Croft worked extensively on the theoretical backing of arms control. Arms control is meant to break the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Security_dilemma.html" title="Security dilemma">security dilemma</a>. It aims at mutual security between partners and overall stability (be it in a crisis situation, a grand-strategy, or stability to put an end to an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_race.html" title="Arms race">arms race</a>). Other than stability, arms control comes with cost reduction and damage limitation. It is conceptually differentiated from <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disarmament.html" title="Disarmament">disarmament</a> since the maintenance of stability might allow for mutually controlled armament and does not take a peace-without-weapons-stance. Nevertheless, arms control is a defensive strategy in principle, since transparency, equality, and stability do not fit into an offensive strategy.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_control.html" title="Edit section: History of Arms Control">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of Arms Control</span></h2>
<p>One of the first recorded attempts in arms control was a set of rules laid down in ancient Greece by the <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphictyonic_League_2fb2.html" title="Amphictyonic League">Amphictyonic Leagues</a>. Rulings specified how war could be waged, and breaches of this could be punished by fines or by war.</p>
<p>There were few recorded attempts to control arms during the period between this and the rise of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Church. The church used its position as a trans-national organisation to limit the means of warfare. The <a href="../../../9/8/9/989.html" title="989">989</a> <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_God_2ad7.html" title="Peace of God">Peace of God</a> (extended in <a href="../../../1/0/3/1033.html" title="1033">1033</a>) ruling protected noncombatants, agragarian and economic facilities, and the property of the church from war. The <a href="../../../1/0/2/1027.html" title="1027">1027</a> <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truce_of_God_4476.html" title="Truce of God">Truce of God</a> also tried to prevent violence between <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a>. The <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Lateran_Council_6e40.html" title="Second Lateran Council">Second Lateran Council</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/3/1139.html" title="1139">1139</a> prohibited the use of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">crossbows</a> against other Christians, although it did not prevent its use against non-Christians.</p>
<p>The development of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearms.html" title="Firearms">firearms</a> led to an increase in the devastation of war. The brutality of wars during this period led to efforts to formalise the rules of war, with humane treatment for <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoners_of_war.html" title="Prisoners of war">prisoners of war</a> or wounded, as well as rules to protect non-combatants and the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillage.html" title="Pillage">pillaging</a> of their property. However during the period until the beginning of the 19th century few formal arms control agreements were recorded, except theoretical proposals and those imposed on defeated armies.</p>
<p>One treaty which was concluded was the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strasbourg_Agreement_%281675%29_fd19.html" title="Strasbourg Agreement (1675)">Strasbourg Agreement</a> of <a href="../../../1/6/7/1675.html" title="1675">1675</a>. This is the first international agreement limiting the use of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_weapon.html" title="Chemical weapon">chemical weapons</a>, in this case, poison bullets. The treaty was signed between <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/8/1/1817.html" title="1817">1817</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush-Bagot_Treaty_1ac7.html" title="Rush-Bagot Treaty">Rush-Bagot Treaty</a> between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> was the first arms control treaty of what can be considered the modern industrial era, leading to the demilitarisation of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Lakes_2a98.html" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Champlain_5cc6.html" title="Lake Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> region of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. This was followed by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Washington_%281871%29_385b.html" title="Treaty of Washington (1871)">1871 Treaty of Washington</a> which led to total demilitarisation.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution led to the increasing mechanisation of warfare, as well as rapid advances in the development of firearms; the increased potential of devastation (which was seen in the battlefields of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>) led to <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_61a9.html" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Tsar Nicholas II of Russia</a> calling together the leaders of 26 nations for the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Conventions_%281899_and_1907%29_6818.html" title="Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)">First Hague Conference</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>. The Conference led to the signing of the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Conventions_%281899_and_1907%29_6818.html" title="Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)">Hague Convention</a> (of 1899) that led to rules of declaring and conducting warfare as well as the use of modern weaponry, and also led to the setting up of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration_fdb2.html" title="Permanent Court of Arbitration">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Conventions_%281899_and_1907%29_6818.html" title="Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)">Second Hague Conference</a> was called in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a> leading to additions and amendments to the original 1899 agreement. A Third Hague Conference was called for <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, but this was abandoned due to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>.</p>
<p>After the First World War the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> was set up which attempted to limit and reduce arms. However the enforcement of this policy was not effective. Various <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_conference.html" title="Naval conference">naval conferences</a> were held during the period between the First and Second World Wars to limit arms.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Naval_Conference_c32e.html" title="Geneva Naval Conference">Geneva Conference</a> led to the banning of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_weapon.html" title="Chemical weapon">chemical weapons</a> (as toxic gases) during war as part of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Protocol_8851.html" title="Geneva Protocol">Geneva Protocol</a>. The <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellogg-Briand_Pact_04d9.html" title="Kellogg-Briand Pact">Kellogg-Briand Pact</a>, whilst ineffective, attempted for "providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy".</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> was set up as a body to promote world peace.
