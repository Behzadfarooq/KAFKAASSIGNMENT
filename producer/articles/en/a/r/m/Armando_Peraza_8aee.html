Although primarily known as a bongocero and conguero, Peraza is also an innovative and accomplished dancer and composer.</p>
<p>Significantly, and uniquely amongst the great Cuban percussionists, Peraza has for many years been an important socio-political figure, a symbol of Afro-Cuban achievement through his virtuoso musicianship and his refusal to be defeated by racism. His work with Shearing and Santana brought him international fame.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_Peraza_8aee.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Born in Lawton Batista, <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> in 1924, he was orphaned by age 7 but made a living selling vegetables and gaining a reputation as a sportsman, being proficient at <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a>. At one time he was a boxing coach. A natural musician, a chance encounter at a baseball game led to his first professional gig with famous local bandleader Alberto Ruiz. He then made his reputation as drummer and dancer playing with the cream of Havana’s small bands or “conjuntos”, the most famous being Ruiz’s Conjunto Kubavana.</p>
<p>He left Cuba for Mexico in 1948 with his great friend, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conga.html" title="Conga">conga</a> drummer <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongo_Santamaria_89ce.html" title="Mongo Santamaria">Mongo Santamaria</a>. They subsequently arrived in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in 1949, where Peraza cut his first record date with Charlie Parker and Buddy Rich. He also recorded with <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slim_Gaillard_f61e.html" title="Slim Gaillard">Slim Gaillard</a> in New York in November 1949, a session that produced an exemplary virtuoso performance from Peraza on "Bongo City". After a period in Mexico, he returned to the US and settled in the West Coast. Here he worked with Dizzy Gillespie, Gaillard and ran an Afro-Cuban dance review at the Cable Car Village club attracting a clientele that included Errol Flynn, Marlon Brando and Rita Hayworth.</p>
<p>In San Francisco he met British pianist George Shearing, a collaboration that found Peraza at the forefront of a new wave of popularity for Afro-Cuban music. Shearing’s music is now regarded as “light” in jazz terms, but the rhythms and harmonic structures Peraza introduced to the pianist’s music were unerringly authentic. It was during his time with Shearing that Peraza emerged as a composer. With Shearing developing Peraza’s nascent ideas pieces like “Te Arango La Cabeza” (a song perhaps inspired by boxing!), "Mambo in Chimes” and “Mambo In Miami” were recorded. These recordings were at the heart of the "<a href="../../../m/a/m/Mambo_craze.html" title="Mambo craze">mambo craze</a>", which was sweeping the US and the world and Peraza became highly visible, a major achievement for an Afro-Cuban.</p>
<p>Peraza’s extraordinary technique and expressive power as a hand drummer became a feature of Shearing’s performances. He toured America with Shearing and experienced persistent racism. For instance, in Miami during dates with Shearing and Peggy Lee in 1959, Peraza was not allowed to stay at the same hotel as the other band members on racial grounds. Shearing and Lee resolved the situation by threatening to pull out of the performance unless Peraza was “allowed” to stay at their hotel.</p>
<p>In tandem with this he worked with vibes player <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Tjader_27df.html" title="Cal Tjader">Cal Tjader</a> and they cut the famous track “Guachi Guaro” which has recently enjoyed renewed popularity in the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_Jazz_4804.html" title="Acid Jazz">Acid Jazz</a> club scene. In 1959 Peraza joined Mongo Santamaria for the classic 'Mongo' album, one of the most important recordings of Afro-Cuban “folklore” music ever. It included conga drummer <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Aguabella_b6a4.html" title="Francisco Aguabella">Francisco Aguabella</a>, another contemporary and friend of Peraza, and “Afro-Blue”, a song that became a jazz standard once <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Coltrane_0f9b.html" title="John Coltrane">John Coltrane</a> had recorded it.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Armando was encouraged to perform and record in Southern California by his friend, Jazz drummer Shelley Mann. Armando performed throughout the area at such venues as Shelley's Manhole (owned by Shelley Mann)and The Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach. A highlight was performing with the Stan Kenton band celebrating the opening of the Hollywood Bowl. Through his friendship with Mann, Armando was introduced to the living legend Judy Garland, who immediately signed Armando to play in her orchestra for the "The Judy Garland Show", which was a television event during 1963-1964.</p>
<p>Although Peraza's personality was best suited to being a member of other leaders' bands he did record one solo album in 1968. His "Wild Thing" LP on the Skye label features performances from pianist Chick Corea and Japanese saxophonist Sadao Watanabe. He had previously been featured as a solo artist on the 1959 album ‘More Drums On Fire’. His performance on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conga.html" title="Conga">conga</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bongo.html" title="Bongo">bongos</a> on the piece ‘Artistry In Rhythm’ was widely lauded as a standard-setting masterpiece.</p>
<p>Adaptability and an open mind are the hallmarks of Peraza’s approach, so that when rock took hold of the business in the late 60s, Armando was amongst the first Latin percussionists to add conga drums to a rock track, notably on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Mandel_657a.html" title="Harvey Mandel">Harvey Mandel</a>’s 'Cristo Redentor' album in 1968.</p>
<p>In 1972 Peraza joined the Santana group, which was embarking on its most creative period. Peraza remained with Santana for nearly twenty years and played to millions around the globe, partnering other outstanding percussionists like Chepito Areas and Orestes Vilato. The profile of Latin percussion had never been higher. While with the Santana band, Armando wrote and co-authored a total of 16 songs which were recorded by Santana. The best known is probably “Gitano” from the album ‘Amigos’and has Armando singing the lyrics he wrote himself. His jazz-inflected piece “Mandela” was cut on the ‘Freedom’ album. Santana’s recordings featured many outstanding performances from Peraza, notably his conga solos on “Hannibal” (‘Zebop!’), “Bambele” and “Bambara” (both ‘Viva Santana’), and “Mother Africa” (’Welcome’). His bongo performances on “La Fuente Del Ritmo” (‘Caravanserai’), and “Flor De Canela” and “Promise of a Fisherman” (a sequence on ‘Borboletta’) are outstanding. John Santos says that Peraza is “perhaps the greatest bongosero in the history of that instrument.”</p>

Armando Peraza in London, 1999.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Armando retired from the Santana band in 1990, although he did travel to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_de_Chile_5555.html" title="Santiago de Chile">Santiago de Chile</a> for a major concert with Santana in 1992 in front of a crowd in excess of 100,000. The video 'Viva Santana' includes memorable footage of a Peraza conga improvisation shot in 1995.</p>
<p>Now in semi-retirement and living in California, Peraza continues to hold workshops and play at jazz festivals around the world. Now in his 80s in 2005 he appeared on a recording by <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Bay_Area_b47d.html" title="San Francisco Bay Area">Bay Area</a> musician John Santos. Santos' "20th Anniversary" set included the piece 'El Changüí De Peraza', which highlighted Peraza's superb bongo playing. He returned to his native Cuba in 2002, his first trip to the island in more than 50 years.</p>
<p>In July 2006 Peraza, at 82 years of age, made a rare appearance with Santana at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. This was the first of a number of summer live appearances. Later, in August 2006, Peraza appeared at the San José jazz festival in California, sitting in with the Julius Melendez Latin Jazz Ensemble, as well as giving a drum clinic with Raul Rekow and Karl Perazzo, both of Santana. Also in 2006, Armando recorded with Bay Area pianist Rebeca Mauleon's album "Descarga en California" (Universal/Pimienta). He also co-wrote a tune on the album titled "Cepeda Forever", honoring his longtime friend and baseball Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda.</p>
<p><b>Reflections on Armando Peraza:</b></p>
<p>Candido Camero: “Many times after a gig I would see Armando hanging out at clubs like Cabaret Carioca... and he would be doing some of the most incredible steps I’d ever seen. He would incorporate steps from Afro-Cuban folklore. He would combine these steps with his own inventive moves. People talk about break dancing and think it is so hip. Armando was doing it forty years ago and better.”</p>
<p>Walfredo Reyes Snr: "Still one of the greatest ever to come out of Cuba. If you are a percussionist, you should listen to Armando."</p>
<p>George Shearing: “My ears became attuned to authentic Afro-Cuban music thanks to Machito, Al McKibbon, Armando Peraza and Willie Bobo. Armando always had ideas and he would contribute compositions… he sang and drummed every tune we were going to record. For my Latin sessions I depended on Peraza to select the Latin percussion section.”</p>
<p>Carlos Santana: “He has brought to this band a supremely high standard, not only in music, but in all facets of his life. His vitality and strength are qualities I will always treasure.”</p>
<p>Odie Hawkins (in his work “Menfriends”): “I wandered through the crowd, drawn by this small Afro-Cuban brother. I’d never seen anyone that proud…… Sugar Ray Robinson had it, Manolete, Pelé… Bob Marley, Richard Pryor in his salad days, a few others…. Armando Peraza.”</p>
<p>John Santos: "Armando Peraza is much more than a national treasure. He is an international symbol of artistic excellence, humanitarianism, and elegance who has enriched the lives of millions of people."</p>
