<p>Hi, with regards to what the <i>For the mediation committee</i> means. This is where Committee members decide whether the case should be accepted as a case. The case is then added to a list of unassigned tasks. You are most welcome, indeed encouraged as a nominee, to accept one of these open tasks to mediate. All you need to do is leave Essjay a message saying which case you wish to do, and then get in contact with all the invovled parties. You'll find that this will help people judge your nomination, as we can then see what you are actually like at mediating a case on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 23:28, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you already replied to another issue on my talk page I would like to ask for some advice. Some admin had blocked me, claiming I was a sockpuppet of a user I had never even heard of. He did not present any evidence. I looked it up at the checkuser page, there was none either. I looked up what the users I was accused of being identical with had edited, and there were not even similarities in the articles they focussed on with mine. I requested to be unblocked, but the blocking admin did not answer, and others told me I should email him. I could not because I already get enough spam and do not want to provide an email address. So I asked another admin, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_Knott_a4ea.html" title="User:Theresa Knott">Theresa Knott</a>, and she was very kind and replied fast and asked <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> who had blocked me. All he replied was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theresa_knott&amp;diff=58788376&amp;oldid=58556734" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theresa_knott&amp;diff=58788376&amp;oldid=58556734" rel="nofollow">this</a>, showing he actually had no evidence supporting his claim. Am I over sensitive if I find this offensive? My impression is that he blocked me in order to censor my support of another user who had been blocked without any basis. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> 13:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would not say that you are being oversensitive, persay - most people would be offended if they were blocked for something they didn't do. However, try not to assume that Jayjg had any ill intent (i.e. that with or without good reason, he actually believed you were a sockpuppet, and was not simply trying to censor you). Often, admins are overwhelmed with a large number of tasks, and do not investigate each situation before making a decision as perhaps would be preferable. This is an unfortunate consequence of having such a large number of users compared to admins, not something we should blame the admins for. I reccomend you assume it to be a misunderstanding, and try to provide proof that you are not a sockpuppet without providing personal information. (E.g., your edit history.) You may also wish to point out that supporting another user is does not necessarily mean, or even provide a <a href="../../../a/s/g/WP%7EASG_a382.html" title="WP:ASG">good reason to suspect</a>, that you are that user. As for email, my reccomendation would be to create a separate email account, so that your main account would not be spammed, but you could still communicate by email with an admin. I would reccomend Gmail, which has good spam-blocking features. If you want an invite, you may email me. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 14:02, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks a lot, you are very kind. I already got an invitation for gmail but I do not want to use it as gmail users allow to get every message scanned for keywords that are interesting for advertisers. Even the mails <i>sent to</i> gmail. This makes using gmail an attack on the privacy even of those who want to communicate with you. Yahoo is not any better, they even sell the information about accounts to others, including information like "played this online game for x hours, looked at these yahoo groups, bought these products at yahoo shops". Terrible.</dd>
<dd>Another thing, irrespective of my specific case, is it ok to block a user without presenting any evidence for the accusation? <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> 14:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While Gmail does scan messages, this is completely computer-automated - a human never sees the resutls. In fact, the advertisers don't even know how often their ads are displayed. See <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/more.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/more.html" rel="nofollow">an explanation of Gmail and Privacy</a>. Nevertheless, if this is not acceptable to you, you may want to consider <a href="../../../g/p/g/GPG_2c56.html" title="GPG">encryption</a>, though this is only possible if the person you are emailing has a public key. As for blocking users without presenting evidence of the accusation - yes, it is a common practice to provide minimal evidence. As I said, admins tend to be very busy, and often do not have time to investigate each case as thoroughly as could be hoped. However, blocks are always disputable, simply remember to do so politely, with the good-faith assumption that they did indeed believe the accusation to be true. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 15:08, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think you failed as a mediator. Mediation requires two willing parties. I am more and more convinced that Socafan is a troll. What new user gives a full edit summary on his first edit, and adds properly formatted wikilinks to his fourth edit summary? About his 25th edit ever was to AN/I to defend Dabljuh, and he made 11 posts to AN/I that night. Even without the CU returned as "inconclusive" there are dozens of admins who might have properly banned Socafan as a likely sock. I pointed out that he was extremely sophisticated for a new editor and he admitted to having edited the english wikipedia before, along with others possibly, but he is still hiding behind "assume good faith" and "benefit of the doubt", as if he is completely unaware that his unusual first day editing pattern would attract negative attention. I don't think you failed as a mediator because Socafan was never mediate-able to begin with. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:48, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also failed at making <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a>, who was blamed for following a policy, feel supported. And I'm not willing to get give up on Socafan yet - I once saw an editor who was far more clearly wrongly accused of vandalism (by a bot, and subsequently blocked by an admin - which is perfectly understandable) lose it a lot worse... there was an edit war on the bot's talk page, with clear-cut personal attacks being removed and replaced (the person kept switching IPs)... it seemed to stop shortly after I refactored one of the removed comments.... Well, in any case, Socafan seems to be handling the situation much better than that. Tommorrow morning I was going to try to write some examples of how Socafan could present his or her case politely, in a way that would be unlikely to offend. As for starting off as a sophisticated editor... I myself waited until I was sufficiently familiar with standards on Wikipedia that I wouldn't get reverted the majority of the time before actually getting an account, so it's understandable. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 05:07, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My dear, don't blame yourself, you've done an admirable job, and I find it refreshing that you still have hope. To be honest, you've been trolled, but the fact that you're willing to hold out hope that such is not the case is an even bigger testament to the kind and valuable contributor you are. We're all marked by our "battle scars" around here, and I hope you won't let this one keep you down long. I insist that you put your request to join the Mediation Committee back up; your good faith attempt to find a solution to this, and your unwavering belief that it could be solved, is indicative of exactly what we need desperately on the Mediation Committee. My sincere apologies that you were caught up in this, and my hope that you won't let it deter you in the least.

<p>Well, don't be discouraged by the request for a more experienced mediator. Ours was probably a really tough case to try to do first anyway-- there are some really super complex issues about the proper interpretation of NPOV policies and such. Some really excellent legalistic arguments are being made about the page, and Thomas probably just felt it was more of a "Supreme Court" kinda case than a "Trial Court" case. But just a temporary setback-- in scrutinizing you before I agreed to accept you as mediator, I came to the conclusion you will make a very good mediator, and I'm sure you'll be on MedCom in no time. Years from now, when you are rich, famous, and a member of the Arbitration Committee, remember me, the first person who agreed to be mediated by you.

<dd>Hi, I've had a look through the open cases, have you though about doing <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_Lost_episodes_478f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Lost episodes">this one</a>. It's got a lot of people invovled but only two issues, so it may be a good one to do. Alternatively there's <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_Talk%7ERoss_Jeffries_6cb4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Talk:Ross Jeffries">this</a> which doesn't have as many invovled parties. I wouldn't advise doing the only other case, the Hunger Project one, as I'm helping one of the parties in that (in my role as an advocate) and it needs an experienced mediator. If you need a hand with whichever case you decide to do, let me know. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 01:44, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just want to say that I appreciate your principled approach, and your well-considered comments.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the way you mapped out what needs to be done: "References would help. And maybe intros regarding how all being on the same channel number in different places connects the channels... but be careful not to cross into <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>."</p>
<p>If someone actually did this... but I mean <b>really</b> did it, not some contrived window-dressing but some surprising-to-me, important, interesting connection between every station occupying channel 11, whether on broadcast or cable... yeah, I'd withdraw my nomination. ("Because of the significance of the number 11 to members of thus-and-such religious denomination, many of the television stations on this channel are owned by this denomination." Like that...)</p>

<dd>Thanks!&#160;: ) I'm not sure about a topic-wise connection, but there are certainly technical connections, at least for broadcast stations. For example, from the article <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_channel.html" title="Television channel">Television channel</a>, <i>in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, "channel 2" refers to the broadcast frequency of 55.25 MHz video/59.75 MHz audio, and may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on one's location and service provider.</i> The broadcast frequency does provide some sort of connection, which can probably be easily verified for all of the lists. As for cable/satellite (non-broadcast), I guess it's up to the company, but perhaps further research would reveal more. Channel 2 might also be somewhat interesting, given the history of why it is the first channel instead of Channel 1<a href="http://members.aol.com/jeff560/tvch1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.aol.com/jeff560/tvch1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. (Yes, I know that's a bad reference, but its existence suggests that a better reference may exist somewhere.) Anyways, I'm willing to help some with those articles, but I was hoping the people who created them / people interested in editing TV-related articles would take on the project mostly. Perhaps we should move this discussion to the AfD? <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 17:27, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this would be a better place to reply. Anyway, yeah, I tried to keep the stress off wikipedia, however there were lots of stresses off the wiki. Largely, because I was trying to help JD_UK became a better editor, and I felt it was throwing back in my face. I was considering leaving wikipedia, and I knew I at least needed a short break to calm down. However, I knew I'd need a block otherwise I'd never take a break.

They may not have been <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets</a>, they might have been meatpuppets.

<dd>Good point; I should have done it. I didn't know about that template back then and my actions were probably influenced by the (pretty nasty!) personal attacks that I was a target of.

<dd><i>Thanks! Just FYI, if your RfA were still open, I would have voted oppose, but then struck that out and voted support per your willingness to change. Hopefully you won't have to deal with too many personal attacks as an administrator, but admins do seem to be targets, so the best of luck! <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 00:10, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
