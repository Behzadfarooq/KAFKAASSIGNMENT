Ok Im requesting unprotect of Armenia so we can add our reference to citation needed of the Antiquity part "Bartholomew, along with Saint Jude Thaddeus is reputed to have brought the new religion of Christianity to Armenia in the 1st century. Thus the Armenian Church is called the Armenian "Apostolic" Church, as both saints are considered to be the patron saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church." - <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartholomew_the_Apostle_0c41.html" title="Bartholomew the Apostle">Bartholomew_the_Apostle</a> article</p>
<p>"Saint Gregory the Illuminator or Saint Gregory the Enlightener, the founder and patron saint of the Armenian Apostolic Church, was born about 257." - <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_the_Illuminator_7a23.html" title="Gregory the Illuminator">Gregory_the_Illuminator</a> article</p>
<p>It sounds to me that there are three patron saints...<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 01:23, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Though Saint Gregory the Illuminator is credited as the "Apostle to the Armenians", when he baptised King Tiridates III of Armenia in 301, converting the Armenians, Saints Jude and Bartholomew first brought Christianity to Armenia in the first century. Thus the Armenian Apostolic Church is called the Armenian "Apostolic" Church, as both saints are considered to be the patron saints of the Church and so are under the protection and patronage of both apostolic saints." - from the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Jude_Thaddeus_d81f.html#Saint_Jude_in_Armenia" title="Jude Thaddeus">Saint Thaddeus</a> article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It sounds to me like the Gregory the Illuminator article may need some rewording, because both the Thaddeus article and the Bartholomew article say that they are <i>the</i> patron saints, with the Thaddeus article pointing out that Gregory is the "Apostle to the Armenians," not the patron saint. I know I'm no authority on this, but going by what these 3 articles say, it sounds like the error is in the Gregory article...<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 01:48, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> contributed a significant amount of aid to the Armenians during the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>. Shown here is a poster for the <i>American Committee for Relief in the Near East</i> vowing that they <b>(the Armenians, Greeks, Syrians and Persians)</b> "shall not perish.</p>
<p>I don't think we need to add what's in bold, because this article is about Armenia, and the caption doesn't exclude those groups, it simply doesn't mention them. And that is fine, because this article is about Armenia; someone looking at the image will clearly see (at the bottom) that the relief is for much of the Near East, not only Armenia. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 23:26, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, "someone looking at the image will clearly see (at the bottom) that the relief is for much of the Near East, not only Armenia". Even if the article is about Armenia the caption should have some clarifying for the reader. The current version confuses a bit: "the American Committee for Relief in the Near East vowing that they (the Armenians) "shall not perish." Also seems a bit POVish. I propose "the Armenians among others" or "the Armenians and others" again because not only Armenians are mentioned in the poster. I would like to read a source which affirms that the poster refers directly and/or specifically to Armenians. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandmeister_dd66.html" title="User:Brandmeister">Brand</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBrandmeister_a312.html" title="User talk:Brandmeister">спойт</a> 23:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citations</span></h2>
<p>I am a member of Wikiproject Ancient Egypt and one of the members who helps maintain pages from vandalism and other factual inaccuracy. Recently, two or three IP-adress-only users have come through and changed all the references to <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitanni.html" title="Mitanni">Mitanni</a> in these pages to somthing like the "Armenian Kingdom of Mitanni" or mitannian kings to "Armenian Kings".<br />
Now, as to what this has to do with you. These users have used the fact that this page here says that mitanni is part "of the Armenian Ethnogenesis," to use their words, as their justification for making all these changes. Now, beside the fact of that being an illegitimate citation for the pages that I watch, this page does claim such a statement, which all my sources lead me to believe is equivocal at best, lying at worst. Twice I have stuck a citationneeded tag on the claim, looking for so much as a single source to back it up, and it has been "reverted" by one who appears to be a normal editor of this page, and the other time by one of the IP adresses, who was rather angry that I would dare to challenge his or her assertion. It is my understanding, by reading <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html#Tagging_unsourced_material" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Tagging_unsourced_material</a> that I am well within my rights to demand a citation for any claim which is dubious and has no citation. I really must insist that such a claim be cited or removed, and I will be restoring that tag once again. Apologies if I sound angry, it's just that I've been trying to clean up after these IP adresses for several days now, and as far as my literature tells me, the statement I take issue with may as well say that <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_AstronomerAmateur_caa8.html" title="User:Jnc/AstronomerAmateur">the moon is made of green ~~cheese</a><a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 22:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Edit War"</span></h2>
<p>While I can't fault roaming Admins for calling this an "editing dispute," the problem here is that Ararat Arev keeps blanking material cited with reputable sources, not that there are two . Blanking is <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Vandalism</a>, plain and simple. While it is possible to remove content in good faith, Ararat Arev has shown himself to believe fully that his position and only his position is the scholarly accepted position, and has called any attempt to add the "dissent" (though technically the identification of Armenians as Hurrians should be the dissent since noone actually argues that in scholarly literature) "Vandalism" on more than one occasion, both in editing summaries and on other people's talk pages. As Dab had said, this behavior was getting in the way of people trying to make a legitimate effort to improve this page, and now it has formally made that impossible until this "dispute" has been resolved.</p>
<p>Every time Ararat Arev has been asked to defend a challenge to his "evidence," he responds by repeating the same stuff he gave as "evidence" and has accused us of not reading it well enough, as if anyone with half a brain should be able to see why it's right. Now, that's inappropriate and disrespectful, especially to those of us like myself who have spent years in school and have spent hours upon hours upon days researching this very topic of the origins of the Hurrians, and have put forward the majority opinion with the citations of where it comes from. This issue needs to be solved, either by Ararat Arev coming here and playing nicely, or by a RfC or some other appropriate action being taken. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 05:28, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's that "lie" accusation you keep throwing around. That's unacceptable behavior. Ararat Arev, I have read those references which you have given me, and the only way someone can read them and think they say what you think they say is if his mind is coloured by overexposure to that crankery from Armenianhighland, which you have admitted reading. And yet you have not once actually responded with a real defense to this challenge, "Your sources do not say what you say they say." Hmm... I wonder why? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 18:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just a suggestion guys. Remember the "don't bite newcomers" rule on Wiki? Maybe if we respond to Arev calmly and non-adverserially, he will be more amenable suggestions. We can be firm (delete suspicious edits) and still civil. Just a suggestion.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 19:38, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We've all tried that to begin with. You have to realize that sometimes the problem is the newcomer. He refuses to cooperate, and thus cannot be helpful. "If we respond to Arev calmly and non-adverserially," I can assure you that he will not behave any differently, since he never behaved appropriatly to begin with. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 21:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, just be concise with him. Eliminate the "you are doing this/you can't understand this" part, answer "yes" or "no," if the responses are too wordy or incomprehensible, delete them from the talk page. When he asks "why," just give the bare minimum: "It's original research. read NOR"/"limit your response to 2 sentences." If he sees that his posts are getting deleted, he will get the idea. Practice is much powerful teacher than preaching.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 22:28, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a brief note to settle this quote once and for all. It's a quote known pretty much by every student in Armenia above grade 8. The significance of it is that it's written in Hurrian syntax but completely in Armenian words, which leads Armenian historians to conclude that it was written by someone who thought Armenian.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 19:38, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since the sentence is written in Hurrian syntax but completely in Armenian words, the suggestion is that the author was trying to write Hurrian while his native tongue was Armenian.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RfC</span></h2>
<p>Another RfC without a proper section. Sigh!</p>
<p>My comment is: Armenia is geographically in Asia, obviously and there's little doubt about that (I mean: it's 100% south of the Caucasus range, conventional border of both continents.</p>
<p>Said that it's also true that Armenia, as country of Christian tradition, is nowadays more linked to Europe (as this tradition has mostly vanished in West Asia under the pressure of Islam) and politically it belongs to it, together with all other Caucasian states and Turkey (<a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Europe_83e9.html" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/c/OSCE_64d2.html" title="OSCE">OSCE</a>). Central Asian republics also belong to the OSCE.</p>
<p>I understand that the disputed paragraph is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Culturally, historically, and politically, Armenia is considered to be part of Europe. However, its location in the southern Caucasus means that it can also be considered to be at the arbitrary border between Europe and Asia: in other words, a transcontinental nation. However, both these classifications are entirely arbitrary, as there is no easily definable geographic difference between Asia and Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I do agree that the border between Europe and Asia is fundamentally arbitrary, specially in Russia, Siberia and Khazakstan, that Europe can well be considered a subcontinent of Asia (as much as South Asia is) and that the most correct cultural-historical-ethnological region is West Eurasia, including West Asia and North Africa with Europe in a sigle unity, standard coventions obligue me to rule that Armenia is not a transcontinental state (not more than, say, Argentina or New Zealand). Only culturally can be considered so but not from the viewpoint of physical geography, as its usually agreed.</p>
<p>The paragraph is in brief fundamentally incorrect (and therefore POV). I'd suggest something like the following:</p>
<p><i>While according to usual conventions Armenia is placed in Western Asia, there are many historical, political and cultural reasons for Armenians to feel Europeans rather than Asians. Armenia is part of several pan-European organizations, etc.</i></p>
<p>In brief, I'd put the emphasis in the feeling European and the cultural, political and historical links to Europe. But saying that Armenia or Vladivostok are not in Asia is just plainly POV. It's easier to argue that Paris is in Asia (per Eurasia) than that Yerevan is in Europe, except in an spiritual sense, of course. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 22:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>the big fallacy in all this is the assumption that "Christianity is historically associated with Europe". Christianity is a Middle Eastern religion for crying out loud, that <i>spread</i> to Europe. Christianity was historically very much Anatolian, Caucasian, Aramaean(!), Egyptian and what have you, it was only with the Islamic conquest that the appearance arose that "Christanity is European". Armenia is a remnant of SW Asian Christianity, not some outgrowth of European Christianity (such as the USA, which isn't counted as "European" because of this either). Saying that Armenia or Vladivostok or New York are in Europe is not "pov", but simply incorrect. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 17:08, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hey, that's much better. Instead of stating "Culturally, historically, and politically, Armenia is considered to be part of Europe", which as it stands is pure nonsense, we can state that there is some group called "European Armenian Convention" and that they have issued some declaration somewhere at some point. The question may have some weight in Armenian politics, if so we shall by all means treat it under "Armenian politics" no problem. That still doesn't change anything about historical or geographical facts. I also find it interesting that '<b>recently</b>, with the rise of the <b>EU</b>, Armenia seems to have shown interest in moving politically closer to Europe. That has nothing to do with "culturally, historically", but amounts to a simple statement that "<i>in recent times</i>, Armenia has focussed on establishing political ties with Europe", that's it. If Armenia and/or Turkey were to join the EU, this would simply mean that the EU extends beyond Europe, not that Armenia or Turkey were suddenly "part of Europe". People seem to forget that there are also quite a number of European countries that are <i>not</i> in the EU.

<dd>I honestly fail to see how I can be construed as an anti-Armenian, never mind "rabid".

I cannot follow how my statement to the effect that Armenians can be proud of their heritage of early Christianity is "anti-Armenian". If anything, such statements make me an Armenophile. I am neither pro-Europe nor anti-Orient, in fact, I happen to be more into Oriental than European topics on Wikipedia (which is why I am commenting here in the first place), and I can only conclude that you somehow think "European" has a ring of "superior", which is, like, an opinion, which I do not happen to share. If we can attribute the "close ties" etc. stuff to some official source, hey, that's even better. I do learn that Armenia appears to seek to enhance its "Europeanness" recently (which is understandable for a country that has less than harmonious relationships with its immediate neighbours). That's perfectly fine with me. Armenia is welcome to join the EU for all I care, no problem. That will still make the "Europeanness" trend a <i>recent</i> phenomenon, and that will still not change the fact that Armenia is a country in SW Asia, this is really my entire point. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 15:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Armenia does not want to join the EU for strategic reasons it's the EU that wants Armenia to join eventually, can you please understand that? EU is not the reason why Armenia is a European country nor is it Christianity. Ethiopia is also Christian. Anything that happened between 1375 and 1828 is irrelevant. Was the Cilician Kingdom not European lol That's when Armenia was under nomadic savages. As Mr. Sugarian said: "To conclude, we would like to emphasize that the Armenian people – both in Armenia and in the European Diaspora – regards itself as a European people. This people was separated from the main European stream by unfortunate historical circumstances and is now resolutely committing to an in-depth reunification with the European family.". For as long as there has been an Armenia and a concept of Europe, Armenia has been part of it! Hell even under the foreign occupation when so many oriental influences affected Armenia (they are being cleaned out to this day) travellers to both Persia and the Ottoman Empire could tell that Armenians are different along with the Greeks! <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphonse_de_Lamartine_7d4e.html" title="Alphonse de Lamartine">Alphonse de Lamartine</a> called Armenians "the Swiss of the East.” LOL! Henry Finnis Bloss Lynch said that: "In the Armenians we have a people who are peculiarly adapted to be the intermediaries of the new dispensation. They profess our religion, are familiar with some of our best ideals, and assimilate each new product of European culture with an avidity and thoroughness which no other race between India and the Mediterranean has given any evidence of being able to rival. These capacities they have made manifest under the greatest disadvantages.Their intellectual capacities are supported by a solid foundation of character, and, unlike the Greeks, but like the Germans, their nature is averse to superficial methods; they become absorbed in their tasks and plumb them deep. … These tendencies are naturally accompanied by forethought and balance; and they have given the Armenian his pre-eminence in commercial affairs. He is not less clever than the Greek; but he sees farther.” Dr. James L. Barton, secretary of the American Board of Foreign Missions, and former president of Euphrates College in Turkey, says: “I know the Armenians to be, by inheritance, religious, industrious and faithful. They are the Anglo-Saxons of Eastern Turkey" LOL--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 15:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't give a <i>damn</i> if and why Armenia joins the EU, that's the entire point. I respectfully but firmly disagree with your "Anything that happened between 1375 and 1828 is irrelevant." And Armenia wasn't in Europe in 1374, or 200 BC, that's simply nonsense. I can appreciate your "the Swiss of the East", "the Anglo-Saxons of Eastern Turkey" quotes, but that's not "the Swiss of Eastern Europe", that's, if anything "the Swiss of <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near_East_da5f.html" title="Near East">the East</a>", "the Anglo-Saxons of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Eastern Turkey</a>", isn't it. Your quotes, it goes without saying, are fron colonialist Eurocentric sources all and sundry, precisely the mindset that tends to perceive all virtue as essentially "European".

<p>Hell, even changing the passage to "The Armenian people – both in Armenia and in the European Diaspora – regards itself as a European people." will be better than the outright falsity that we give in Wikipedia's voice right now.

<dd>Wrong Db, it's outright falcity according to you and your pre-conceived notions! It's not black and white, thus you have to nitpick stuff like Ottoman musical instruments, heh. The quote stays Db! Like it or not. File a THIRD RFC or go through another channel for Georgia, Armenia and Cyprus. That's right all three, otherwise you're targetting Armenia for reasons one can only wonder. You have no chance in hell for doing that because there is no geographical boundary of Europe set in stone, it just doesn't exist! On the cultural, political and hsitorical fronts you have no chance in hell either. Two people already spent months and failed.

<dd>sigh, I am not objecting to any quote, I am objecting to the statement <i>in Wikipedia's voice</i>, precisely <i>because</i>, as you agree, the matter is subjective. And I thought you were a reasonable editor, but that was probably just compared to Ararat arev&#160;:) We don't need an rfc to remove a subjective statement in Wikipedia's voice, that's simple Wikipedia policy. You are most welcome to keep any number of quotes, as long as you attribute them. Even if you could show that 99% of Armenians believe Armenia is in Europe, we'd still only say "99% of Armenians believe that Armenia is in Europe", and <i>not</i> "Armenia is in Europe". <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 16:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Mr. Bachmann, I would appreciate if you wouldn't make insinuations that Armenians are somehow "ashamed" of being called Asian. *That* does sound anti-Armenian, as if we have some kind of complex. We are proud of our ancestry and everything that is Armenian, regardless of its origins. Now, you two may continue your fight about whether they are Asian or European.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 02:52, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have no idea why that should be "anti-Armenian", because like you, I find the proposition of being ashamed of being Asian ridiculous: You are welcome to take up the issue with Eupator, who does seem to insist on the position you just described as a 'complex', but I am in complete agreement with you. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 11:24, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sigh...We have already spent several months debating, over several different talk pages and with mediation, whether or not Armenia was European. It was a long, intense, and bloody battle. But eventually the xenophobic Calgivla (or however it was spelt) gave up and retreated. And no changes were made. Unlikely any will be made this time, either. Personally I think the article speaks for itself. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 06:09, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I realize that Caligvla was a blatant Armenophobe. That has, however, nothing to do with the question "is Armenia in Europe". To allege that the statement that it is not is "anti-Armenian" because it happened to be stated by an admitted Armenophobe is a simple <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">association fallacy</a>. As you can read above, I have no problem with having all sorts of statements of why and how Armenia is particularly close to Europe, politically, culturally and what not, in spite of not being located in Europe, as long as they are qualified (sourced). What is the problem? All claims on Wikipedia should be sourced, this one is no exception. Yes, we can state some sources count Armenia as European while others don't. Saying "is considered part of Europe" in the article body while leaving "some online atlas places it in Europe, oh, but the UN places it in SW Asia" to the footnotes is hardly 'due weight'. If there is any neutral authority for defining such regions, it's the UN, so the UN definition should be placed first. After that, there can still be lots of qualifications and links to blogs that say otherwise. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 13:35, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>alright, I am sure we can come to a satisfactory solution. I assure you I have no hidden agenda of any sorts, and my only concern is accuracy and due weight. My source for the UN classification of Georgia is the map posted to the right, I didn't verify this, but it states that Georgia as being <i>Cis</i>caucasian (from the European pov) is classified differently.

<dd>I have to agree here with Dbachmann on one point, which I'm quite familiar with: the "historically" part. To say that Armenia has been historically part of Europe and leave out that other half of Armenian history (that of Eastern influence) would be a partial account of Armenian history. For much of its history, Armenia has been divided among two powerful civilizations, one from the West (Greece, Rome, Byzanitine Empire, then Russian Empire), the other from the East, (Persian Empire, then Ottoman Empire). (This of course isn't to say that Armenia hasn't been an independent state at times; it has, but often within the political influence of a neighboring civilization, at least after the Ardashesian dynasty.) I might rephrase the "historically" part of this dispute with something like: Historically Armenia has been at the crossroads of civilizations, where East meets West. (Now "culturally" and "politically" are another issue; the former is certainly subjective, and the latter is objective, with Armenia having a Western political orientation, although it maintains very close ties with Iran as well, which remains its "friendliest" neighbor, despite religious differences.) <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 07:29, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My thoughts on Armenian culture: it has some native Armenian elements (e.g. Armenian architecture, language, alphabet, music), influences from the West (e.g. operas, lingual influences, Greek/Roman gods in early history), and influences from the East (e.g. food, Zoroastrian gods, lingual influences). Keep in mind that certain regions of Armenia at times were more "Western" or "Eastern" in culture, depending on their proximity to an influencing civilization (i.e. what side of the "border" they were on...). This, of course, isn't to say that the two sides didn't have anything in common; just two flavors of the same juice. Nevertheless, given the roots of today's Republic of Armenia as part of the USSR, I think the influence of European culture (specifically, Russian culture) has been greater than ever, at least in geographically Eastern Armenia (which historically - that is, before Russian expansion into the region - had been under the influence of an "eastern" civilization). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 07:57, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If I may just say a few words here, Dbachmann has a point which would made which would make this entire issue shrink drastically. We must change "is considered" to "is considered by $SOMEBODY". Obviously someone considere Armenia european, or there wouldn't be a dispute. Say who does so and most of this problem goes away. If the UN, say "is considered by the UN" If by some other association, say "By the EU, by such-and-such, by whoever" and cite the report that classifies it as European. Historically European? Perhaps there are historians who believe it's European. say "By historans x,y,z". If Armenians consider themselves European, say "by x% of Armenians" and cite the survey. However, "is considered" standing alone is in violation of the citation and weasel-word rules. There are a thousand different ways you could do this, so take your pick, however the specific one you've got right now is much too vague considering the controversial nature of the issue. When a topic is controversial, ambiguity is the enemy. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 08:11, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Eupator, there is a term "Urartian people". Look at website about Armenian culture: <a href="http://www.aua.am/aua/research/ecrc/SoEnew/english/countrv/culture.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aua.am/aua/research/ecrc/SoEnew/english/countrv/culture.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aua.am/aua/research/ecrc/SoEnew/english/countrv/culture.htm</a></p>
<p>I quote: "Urartian people had various myths and legends, unfortunately those were lost within the time." This term is used in many academic books.</p>
<p>But we can say also that people or population which lived in Urartu was different from Armenians. It is not about language alone - I stress again. Britannica points that Armenians came later to that area. So do many renown scholars.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 02:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanatosimii let me give you the example of different peoples language and writing system used:</p>

<p>Mitanni is also IE with Hurrian. Proto-IE which afterwards Persians and Indians (Aryans) seperated from us.</p>

<p>First of all, it is very questionable how people who lived in Urartu and other ancient state participated in ethnogenesis of the Armenian people. Sources say that Armenians came later. However, I can accept that the mixture of newcomers and old inhabitants can occur. Then, if we say so - I mean about continuity of Urartu and Armenia links, we should say also about opponent views for reaching NPOV. Now about sources Eupator mentioned above. There is no open statement there that Armenians and Urartians has bonds, except Chahin book where he compares Armenians relations to Urartu like French to Gauls. But this is an assumption, even not strongly supported. Again - if even we accept that or other like-minded dubious assumption, then surely we can state the opinion of other renown scholars. Historical documents first time mentioned Armenians in 6 BC. And for sources itself - we should refer to more neutral ones (I accept Redgrave), then Diakonov and Britannica should be also accepted. Now it is a bunch of books published by Armenians about their history - they are quite questionable, in terms of stating about bonds between Urartu and Armenians. I quoted on other page the following book, and I do it again here: Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology (New Directions in Archaeology). Page 157: "<i>No less problematic are heavily slanted interpretations of the Urartian kingdom, the first historically attested state in Transcaucasia (ninth to seventh centuries BC). Armenian chauvinists must explain why this state, a worthy adversary of the neo-Assyrian Empire of northern Mesopotamia and one that expanded over much of "historic Armenia," composed its royal cuneiform inscriptions in Urartian, a non Indo-European ( i.e., non-Armenian) language, related to Hurrian and ancestral to the Northeastern Caucasian family of languages spoken today by different peoples in Daghestan, Chechenia, and Ingushetia (see Jankowska 1991:231). Reasonable historical hypotheses can be advanced for a Proto-Armenian component to this kingdom, and there is a real sense in which the Armenians are the cultural heirs of Urartu, but an essentialist view of Armenian culture which equates it precisely with the Urartian kingdom cannot be sustained. One must distinguish between popular and professional Armenian interpretations of Urartu, the latter being subtler and more difficult to evaluate. Thus, popular reference to the "Piotrovskii problem" is based on the fact that B.B. Piotrovskii, the late Director of the Hermitage in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and former head of the excavations at Karmir Blur (the ancient Urartian capital of Teishebaine now located within the city of Yerevan), had quite reasonably maintained that the mighty Urartian Iron Age kingdom did not constitute the first Armenian state for the reasons stated above; the "problem" only existed for those who wanted Armenians always to have lived in and controlled "historic Armenia" until the later ravages wrought by Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Turks. More discriminating professional archaeologists, who may accept the reasonable theory that the ethnogenesis or formation of Armenian culture occurred during post-Urartian Achaemenid times, extol the might of the Urartians and see them exercising political control over most of eastern Anatolia, western Iran, and Transcaucasia; in this respect they remain the direct precursors of the Armenian kingdom under Tigran II</i>."--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 14:51, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Armenian Anthem</span></h2>
<p>I just read at a Armenian news site that for now there is no official Armenian anthem as there are plans to change it. I think its worth bringing it up as Azerbaijan is not allowed to publish its unofficial national motto (Land of Fire), then why is Armenia allowed to publish its unofficial national anthem? The news site is posted below: <a href="http://groong.usc.edu/news/msg173190.html" class="external free" title="http://groong.usc.edu/news/msg173190.html" rel="nofollow">http://groong.usc.edu/news/msg173190.html</a></p>
<p>Could somebody get a good look at this, I think we need to remove the national anthem of Armenia for now.</p>

<dd>That's true, but only for a limited time. The song “Mer Hayrenik” ceased to be the national anthem on December 6 as the Armenian parliament failed to meet a constitutional deadline for reaffirming it or introducing a new state symbol.

<dd>Thank you for getting to my point. I'm not disputing paragraph. Those refs need to explicitly state something that would support that Armenia is historically, politically and culturally considered part of Europe. Again, I'm not at all disputing orientation of todays Armenia (even less so geography!). I have absolutely no reason to do so. If there was written that "today is Armenia oriented to Europe and its values and organizations" I'd be first to defend such statement. But it reads very differently, please read the sentence in the article and read what you find in the sources - it's two different things.

<dd>This consensus isn't supported by source (may be a little more by nationalism), it's all I'm saying from the beginning of this discussion. You saw those sources yourself, you know that they don't support claims about Armenia being historical and cultural part of Europe. Unfortunately it's also not true or at least not generally accepted view. I would agree to political part of Europe since things are changing rapidly (and it is somewhat (not very well) sourced), may be cultural, but historical? That would need strong source and in fact other sections of article contradicts this. But you know this, you know history of Armenia much much better than I do. Governed and opressed by Ottoman Empire and Russia makes Armenia hardly historical part of Europe. It really shouldn't matter where you draw the line between Europe and Asia but historical involvement of Armenia in European matters can be disputed. I now see that the whole point is exactly the geographical line but people that are not involved with Armenia and its problems read this sentence differently. It implies that Armenia is somehow hisorically bound to Europe. Combination of historically, politically and culturally also suggests that it always has been. The sentence doesn't read like it was about line in the map but rather like political statement. But lets leave it here, I'm not pushing this any more unless some other oppinion emerges. If nobody else comments on this I'm leavig it this way. I will only repeat that I'm not suggesting that Armenia is in Asia or that it matters where the line between Europe and Asia is or has been or anything like that.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPethr_1b0f.html" title="User:Pethr">Pethr</a> 04:00, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm sorry but it doesn't. It may support geographic location and present political orientation but no historical and cultural belonging to Europe.

<p>I think that the sentence is intended to convey the sense that Armenia is now connected and integrated into Europe; it is a part of Europe. The way it reads, though, is that Armenia has always been a part of Europe, and its culture and history is entirely European, to the exclusion of any other influence. This is peculiar, because I get the sense from the previous paragraph that Armenia predates Europe. More importantly, the Culture section of the article contradicts that sentence when it speaks of Armenia as having its <i>own</i> culture - a culture that is neither Asian nor European nor African nor from anywhere else. I'm only looking at reference #2, (it's one of the references suggested by <a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">User:Eupator</a>, above) and on pp 4, 5 it does place Armenia in Europe. I think that <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPethr_1b0f.html" title="User:Pethr">User:Pethr</a> accepts this and isn't questioning it. The issue, I believe, is the historical and cultural status of Armenia, and same reference states, near the top of page three, that "<i>Armenia's President, Robert Kocharian, has declared only recently that the European direction is a priority in Armenia's foreign policy. Only very recently, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Andranik Margaryan, when meeting the World Bank Executive Director had said that Armenia 'will continue its course toward European integration and EU membership.'</i>" If these are only recent developments, then what was the status of Armenia before this time? I expect that the writers of this page know much more about Armenia that I do, but it seems to sell Armenia short to say that it's "culturally, historically, and politically" a part of Europe, when really, isn't Armenia's culture richer and older than that sentence suggests? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 07:19, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anything and everything in Armenian politics is recent, a little more than a decade ago Armenia was part of the USSR. I don't understand how Armenia can predate Europe?

<dd>Ah - I had understood that even within the Soviet Union, places such as Ukraine, Georgia, &amp;c continued to exist, just not as independent nations - certainly I remember seeing them depicted in contemporary maps - and I was under the impression that Armenia had a similar history. As for whether Greece predates Europe, that's an interesting question. I suppose it would depend on how we define <i>Europe</i> and <i>Greece</i>. A good argument can be made that Europe has existed since before our ancestors diverged from those of the chimpanzees: certainly, the land itself was there. From a cultural standpoint, (though it has been many years since I studied this) I think that Greecian culture predates the concept of Europe as an entity, but I may be wrong. I don't know that Athens and Sparta considered themselves to be part of the same nation or region.</dd>
<dd>But I think your question may point to the heart of the matter: how are we defining <i>Armenia</i>? If we don't consider Armenia to have existed prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, then I expect you are absolutely correct. Some of the writers of this article seem to have taken a different definition - not neccessarily any better or worse - that Armenia traces its history back through the time of the Soviet Union, before the World Wars, before even the birth of Christ. I expect that is the source of the confusion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 03:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point is that Armenia's historical orientation has always been western (in a broad sense), i.e. towards the Roman Empire, then towrds Christianity, then towards Russia/USSR which are all associated with Europe. It has fewer associations with Asian polities (like the Caliphate), or traditions (like Islam). The sentence is fine since its sourced. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 12:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The question of weather armenia is in europes is simple t o meAnything west of the URALS is Europe. That is why the old question of what countries are in both ASIA and EUROPE is a great one as the answer is Turkey and Russia which everyone gets but the final one is khzakstan as people usually forget that one however a portion of it is west of the urals. ARMENIA is part of europe just like the part of russia that touches it is the european part of russia. Just my 2 cents.MoneyOx 20:06, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My changes to that paragraph are based on sources. Armenia is no longer considered Mostly free nor more free than Norway in 2007 report.

<p>I don’t deny that Armenia has increased in corruption in recent years, but you comment on it being 'fastest growing in region' and 'very corrupt' are not stated in the referenced text and therefore (unless you can find a more direct source) is <b>Original research</b> and likely POV.</p>
