<dd>Ok, so I have gotten some advice from other users on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28assistance%29_e548.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)">Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)</a>. I was told that I should place my source as a footnote on the end of the sentance. I was also told that "regressed" would be a better word than "digressed". Other than that I was told to leave a note here on your talks page and on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Talk%7EForesters_Falls%2C_Ontario_6fbe.html" title="Talk:Foresters Falls, Ontario">Talk:Foresters Falls, Ontario</a> so that there will be no edit war. Since you haven't responded to me in two days I'll go ahead and add my sourced, factual, NPOV statement. I trust that if you demand its deletion after this you will take it to the talks page first.--<a href="../../../o/l/s/User%7EOlsdude_2ba4.html" title="User:Olsdude">Matt D</a> 00:22, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To ArmadilloFromHell: Would it be possible to establish a seperate subsection of Wikipedia for fans of unsigned bands to go and learn a few tidbits about the regional underground music scene, and get an idea of which ones to keep an eye out for? Following the deletion of the article Deadflat, I feel that if the purpose of wikipedia is to amass all knowledge, then these unknown, unnoteworthy bands certainly deserve a place in its archives. Please reply with your thoughts, Rattlehead05</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for asking, and I wish I could give you an answer, but I don't have the experience. One problem is the shear volume of bands being submitted, that range from a couple of out of tune kids in a basement (most of which should never be listed) to a viable band. The problem is that new articles have to be judged very quickly and if the intial article does not show the bands notability, then it's likely to get deleted in a few minutes. I think you should ask your question in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a> --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 02:33, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, sorry dude. I'm trying to get the hang of this place, ok? I was putting things up and testing how it looks.

<dd>There is no mercy - I wish the whole things worked differently. Before anyone new wrote an article they should get a warning to build a pretty complete article to begin with, or it's likely to get deleted. I know the feeling, the first article I wrote disappeared in less than a minute, and I thought I forgot to save it. I had a copy and posted it again, then I got told it was too short and it got deleted again. It's a hard way to learn. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 06:09, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please read the text of CSD A7 carefully, please. If an article stresses importance of somekind, more often than not, it's not speedy material. Try using PRODs, next time around.

<p>Ok no prob on the Guardian page I put up,I guess it can be considered as such.Even though Advertising is: PAID promotion of goods, services, companies and ideas by an identified sponsor.No biggie just wanted to help people needing life saving services to know where to find some. But on the confined space rescue page you mean to tell me the other two commercial links are acceptable? Only reason I put us up there is because I saw those links there and thought to provide people with a link on a company that actually provides confined space rescue!</p>

<dd>Evidently you created the article at least twice and it was deletd both times. I probably tagged it for possible deletion (but I have no ability to delete articles), so at least one other editor agreed. Based on your notes and edit history - you have created pages for a number of related people - all of which have been deleted. Wiki is not a place to list everyone who lives, people must be notable and if you create an article you must provide infomration that proves the person as notable.

<dd>You have a curious concept of what vandalism is. I don't think that change a link to a picture that didn't exist anymore is vandalism. Whatever. I won't do it anymore. Have a nice day.

<dd>I would like you to notice that there is a picture (<a href="../../../c/o/w/Image%7ECow.gif_c3aa.html" title="Image:Cow.gif">Image:Cow.gif</a>) in commons that is exactly the one you had. Here in wikipedia you have another picture with the same name.

<dd>And that's where the error is, the name of the picture in commons, it got renamed in error, instead of being deleted, there is a picture in Wiki with the same name and if two picture have the same name, the one in Wikit gets used. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 13:31, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed you prod of the above article and changed it to a different procedure. When you discover a copyright violation you have a few options (prod is not really useful): if the article was created within the past 48 hours and it infringes a commercial website, it is speedable with the tag <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">{{db-copyvio|url=url of source}}</a>. If unfit for that speedy tag, then the article should be blanked and the text replaced with {{copyvio | url=insert URL}}--~~~~, if and only if the copyright infringing text is the first edit (then follow the instruction given in that tag for listing at today's <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> page, and don't forget to warn the user with {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENothanks-drm_273a.html" title="Template:Nothanks-drm">nothanks-drm</a>}}). If it is an addition of copyrighted text to a preexisting article, revert the article to a prior version and note the copyright violation in your edit summary.

<dd>Yeah I think I submit at least a couple of copyvio every day - but that one was not so clear. Not all the content was copied, and the site it came from seemed to be a copy/summary of a book - it was not obviously copyright problems, but it was copy and paste and unacceptable from that point of view. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 01:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm. I just looked at it again and every word is a direct cut and paste from that website. It's a violation whether or not the site is quoting a third source--you can't copy the text of books either. Anyway, glad you didn't need the above tutorial and I hope you didn't grit your teeth too much. I too sometimes get advice I already know well, but you'd be shocked how many editors with 5,000 edits know nothing about how to deal with copyright violations.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 01:40, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I do not have the authority to delete it, I just tag it for possible deletion. An admin has to delete it, so at least two people have to agree on that.

<p>Armadillo, You have shown interest in an article related to Kerla, India. I would request your watcful gaze over an unbalanced and biased (at placed pure propaganda) article named Nair.

<dd>It would be difficult for me to comment on the removal, since I do not know if the removed text is factual or not. It is possible they were removed since they may be considered defamatory statements. I does not seem to be obvious vandalism. If someone would add those statements back in and attach/provide a reference/source for their validity, and then they were removed it might be a problem. The best thing would be to discuss it in the articel talk page. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 03:30, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe you did anything wrong. It was, however most confusing, at first it looked like a nonsense article (of which there are many) so I tagged it for speedy deletion, you would have been wrong to remove that, but you did not. Then I think I tagged it again but differently, then I had second thoughts that it might be a spelling problem and changed the "speedy delete" to a "prod" . I'm not sure who removed that, but it was ok if you did. You then provided the alternate spelling to prove it was legitimate, and all worked out ok. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 20:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where I grew up, the term "cum tree" is a very common term for a particular species of tree. It is true that I did not exactly know what tree, but I considered it the purpose of a wiki that someone (such as yourself) would add to the entry, modify it, make it better rather than deleting it.</p>
<p>I say this because you, yourself, refered me to a species of tree; that is, you recognized the colloquialism and directed me to the scientific name. So, this means a few things: the colloquialism does signify something, the signified is identifiable between people, and that "cum tree" is a legitimate sign as it does what it is supposed to, conjure up a certain tree.</p>
<p>So. The legitimacy of the term seems to be taken care of, but somewhere else it seems you imply my logic breaks down. If wikipedia is not a site for colloquialisms, then wikipedia is not what I had been told it was. If, rather, you felt my tone to be unacceptable, then I should alter my tone. If, rather, there is some other reason, let me know.</p>

<dd>I happen to be familiar with the concept, because I saw someone try to make similar edits in the past, and thought it was a total hoax, so I researched it. Changes were made to an existing tree article, I forget which one, but then removed. I think several different trees have this kind of smell (I think Chinese Chestnut is one). If you have references that the term "Cum tree" is used you could possibly add it.

<dd>Thanks, however I'm confused, many are routinely using db-repost for all reposts, same as I do, it should be rephrased to indicate it's only for AfD. Currently it says <i>The given reason is: It is reposted content that was removed in accordance with Wikipedia's deletion policy.</i> and points to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> - which covers all three types of deletion. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 15:42, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello. Just to clarify, {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}} is intended only for a "substantially identical copy" of a page or article deleted through one of our consensus driven channels, and is not a general catch-all for previously deleted articles. For example, if a given article was speedy deleted on the grounds of being nonsense or a copyvio, we wouldn't want to a prevent valid, well written article on the same subject down the road. I wouldn't worry about this too much though, if someone is repeatedly posting blatant nonsense, it is going to be deleted regardless of what template is used, we just need to make sure we're not stifling potential good articles from newcomers without giving things like notability a chance to be established. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 20:29, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. I'm currently helping my Grandfather get into Wikipedia by working on this article that you recently tagged for deletion.

<dd>Hi, I tag articles that I don't think fit, they range from pure nonsense to well-intentioned but incomplete to hoaxes. With hundreds or even thousnads of biographic articles being added every day, we have to have some kind of filtering. Your article is about an author who does yet have a published book. In my mind it's borderline. I do not make the decision to delete, so it is now out of my hands at this point. Adding <i>hangon' is good, but you should provide additional information at Talk:Joan Tollifson to try and prevent it being deleted. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 16:42, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Second, I do not have the ability to delete articles, I only tag them for possible deleteion, and someone else has to agree with me and then delete the article. Since I tag so many articles for deletion each day, I have no idea what yours was about. All I can tell you is that you created it twice, and it was deleted twice. That's a pretty sure indication that the article is unsuitable. Articles about people must be about notable people and provide the information that proves their notability. Simply saying someone is important is not adequate. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 15:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize about the comment on your user page. I only ask because I would assume that I am not the only one to create an article and save it before I am truely done editing it and it's somewhat frustrating to have an outside person immediately criticize it before I'm done. Perhaps you could suggest an article needs clean up only after it's older than 10 minutes old. I will promise to never refer to brand new articles that I have compiled myself as "my article" I can see how that is truly offensives and the utmost confusing for all those I communicate with.

<dd>That's unforunately is how things work, my first article was deleted before I finished it. It's a common error to create an article with only a title, and expect to add content an hour later. Articles like that usually get deleted within five minutes. When I'm monitoring New page changes, I expect to read and tag them within less than a minute. I can't keep track of what I see that needs changing, and go back and check them ten minutes later to see if it got fixed. It's not uncommon for someone to create an article, another person to tag it for cleanup, and two of three other people to jump in and do the cleanup all within ten minutes of an article's creation. I happen to enjoy it when someone sees some changes I make, fixes any errors and omissions I made, and improves upon it. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 05:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
