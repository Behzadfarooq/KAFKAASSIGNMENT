<p>Hi, I happened to see your question on Karmafist's user talk. There is no "technical" solution to move your edits to your username, however you can simply state on your user page that you used to edit as this or that IP adress. You can link to the contribution list of that IP adress by typing <tt>[[Special:Contributions/&lt;IP adress here&gt;|&lt;IP adress or descriptive text here]]</tt>, see the "Stuff I have created" section of my user page for an example of <i>one</i> way of doing it. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 13:05, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to provide some closure, I've seen this question asked at <a href="../../../h/d/_/WP%7EHD_6530.html" title="WP:HD">the help desk</a>, and the answer given was this: If you'd come earlier in the project, it was as easy as asking a developer to play around with the database and reassign the edits to you. However, with a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">close to a million users and articles</a>, the developers don't really have the time for such tasks anymore. Right now, the best solution is the one provided above, as I'm sure you've figured out by now.--<a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/f/g/User_talk%7EJfg284_403e.html" title="User talk:Jfg284">you were saying?</a></sup> 15:52, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks to all three of you! I had just wondered if I'd missed an "automated" way of having my ip edits become associated with my account. I definitely take <a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a>'s point -and I wouldn't want to waste the developer's time anyway. Possibly in the future this sort of function will be added to the Wiki software because I'm sure that there are many people like me who "dip a toe in" only to find they love it and want to sign up. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 00:35, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Armon, thanks for your edits to the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Peacemaker_Teams_d5e9.html" title="Christian Peacemaker Teams">Christian Peacemaker Teams</a> article. I think they were helpful in making the article a bit more NPOV and clarifying it and broadening the context. My one concern is with your addition of the world "liberal" in this sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"but today has an ecumenical base among some liberal Christian denominations"</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cpt.org/annreport/2004/YearinReview2004.php" class="external text" title="http://www.cpt.org/annreport/2004/YearinReview2004.php" rel="nofollow">CPT 2004 Annual review</a> lists these supporting denominations and organisations:</p>
<p>Supporting Denominations &amp; Organizations Denominations:</p>
<pre>
   * Church of the Brethren (COB)
   * Friends United Meeting (FUM)
   * Mennonite Church Canada (MC-Canada)
   * Mennonite Church USA (MC-USA)
</pre>
<p>Organizations:</p>
<pre>
   * Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America (BPFNA)
   * Every Church a Peace Church (ECAPC)
   * On Earth Peace (OEP)
   * Presbyterian Peace Fellowship (PPF)
</pre>
<p>I don't think that any of these churches qualify, as a whole, as liberal according to the definition laid out in the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Christianity_a0cb.html" title="Liberal Christianity">Liberal Christianity</a> article you linked to. The possible exception is the Quakers, but they are already mentioned in an earlier sentence which mentions the roots in the historic peace churches, of which the Quakers are one. My proposed wording for the sentence would be this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"but today has an ecumenical base including peace groups within mainstream Christian denominations such as the <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist_Peace_Fellowship_of_North_America_645e.html" title="Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America">Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America</a> and Presbyterian Peace Fellowship."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This clarifies that it is not the whole of those denominations that support CPT and makes it more specific without using broad labels. What do you think of this proposal? <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMennonot_5078.html" title="User:Mennonot">mennonot</a> 15:31, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Mennonot Yeah, I take your point re: "liberal". I should have pointed to Social Gospel or Progressive Christianity to be more specific. But even that could be problematic because of the differing trads of the churches involved. My problem was with the original sentence "but today has a broad ecumenical base among many Christian denominations" as suggesting more support than they have (think of numerical superiority of say, southern Baptists). I suggest we avoid the problem altogether and just list the supporting churches and orgs explicitly. I nominate you to do it (if you agree of course) because i have to sleep now... cheers Armon 17:02, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank Armon. I've made a number of changes to the paragraph to try to make it more specific. I've also added back in mention of education work but changed the wording.

<p>Your reversions to the Helen Clark are not in the best interests of Wikipedia. You insisted on claiming that Helen Clark was in the car with the Doones, but I see you have finally discovered she wasn't. You insist on adding verbosity to the first sentence which downgrades the quality of the article. You insist on POV supposition -- "unclear if it caused her any lasting political damage" -- but when that is quite clearly debunked with fact you revert to your POV version. Your last edit summary was totally misleading and I must confess I am having some difficulty in assuming good faith. The summary said <b>"rm Clark in the car"</b> but what you actually did was revert past Gadfium's edit to your preferred version, and only then did you remove reference to Clark. That still remains a reversion, and you have now made three reverts. I am again going to revert the article, and suggest you read <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">3RR</a> before you are tempted to revert again. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 01:30, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problem in seeing your good faith; I simply disagree with your edits. I respect that you admit you were wrong about Clark being in the car and I thought your edit summary of "rm Clark in the car" was adequate although ideally it should have said "<b>rv</b> + rm Clark in the car". I suggest that you try to produce a version of the paragraph that is a compromise, and <b>post it to the talk page</b>, not the article, for debate. As Moriori warned you, reverting the article to slight variations of your preferred version is not acceptable.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 01:49, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Armon, I have to comment on this addition you have put twice into the "Israel Lobby" paper with regards to cole: "Cole frequently attacks '<a href="../../../l/i/k/Likudniks.html" title="Likudniks">Likudniks</a>' in the Bush administration, and has accused them of <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dual_loyalty.html" title="Dual loyalty">dual loyalties</a>. <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004/09/dual-loyalties-many-readers-have.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.juancole.com/2004/09/dual-loyalties-many-readers-have.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>" The way you keep adding it to the article makes me think that to you this phrase is very damning. In essence it isn't probably as damning as you think. Charging all Jews outside of Israel with <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dual_loyalty.html" title="Dual loyalty">dual loyalty</a> is obviously racist, imflammator and unfair, but that does not prevent specific individuals of having dual loyalties and making a restricted charge of dual loyalty is not anti-Semitic in and of itself if it can be shown to have basis in fact and not motivated by racial prejudices. It may be because it involves Jews that it is so emotionally charged for you. Try this example: it is clearly racist to say that all Blacks are crack users but just because this gross generalization is inaccurate, inflamatory and racist doesn't mean that any specific claim that an individual, who is black, is using crack must be incorrect or motivated by racism -- Whitney Houston for one really does appear to be a crack user and it is not racist to say so. Just because the racist generalization is obviously false does not necessarily mean that applying a specific categorization to a specific individual(s) is false.</p>
<p>I am not saying that Cole is clearly right nor am I saying you can't disagree with Cole but rather that just repeating Cole's restricted claim without showing why it is false is fairly meaningless in terms of trying to make a case that Cole is disreputable, anti-Semitic, or otherwise -- at least if you approach things logically rather than emotionally. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLittleGrasshopper_7ba2.html" title="User:LuckyLittleGrasshopper">LuckyLittleGrasshopper</a> 15:28, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"One survivor said: <i><b>The army and the security forces were right there; they heard and saw everything and did nothing, and they let the terrorists leave....</b> They waited for the terrorists to finish their dirty task and then they let them leave. What does this mean to you?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Neighbours telephoned the security forces <b>who refused to intervene</b> saying the matter was under the mandate of the gendarmerie. They called the gendarmerie but received no reply, and the attackers left undisturbed.</dd>

<p>The HRW site says <a href="http://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/mideast/algeria.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/mideast/algeria.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/mideast/algeria.html</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The suspicions, however, were reinforced by interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch outside of Algeria and by others on the ground with survivors, witnesses from neighboring communities, rescue workers, journalists, and former security personnel. The attackers, numbering sometimes 200 or more, were found to have moved in and killed and departed freely through militarized areas, <b>without any effort on the spot by the security forces to protect civilians or make arrests</b>. At Rais, where the death toll on the night of August 29, 1997 reportedly reached 335, the killings began when men in military uniforms brazenly arrived in two open-backed trucks, firing on men playing dominoes at the entrance to the community, according to accounts that survivors gave to a rescue worker who arrived shortly after the attackers withdrew.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In Bentalha, as elsewhere, the attackers acted with apparent confidence that the security forces on the scene would not attack them. One of the survivors, who had fled to a rooftop with other residents, told Human Rights Watch <b>he saw two military armored-personnel carriers arrive: “They came up to about one hundred meters away from where we were being attacked. Then they turned on their floodlights—I don’t know why, since they didn’t rescue us.</b> The people started to shout that the military had come to their rescue, but the [leaders] responded by saying, ‘work calmly, the military will not come, don’t worry.’”</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>"...even preventing the villagers from fleeing their attackers".</b></p>
<p>The AI site says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>More than 200 men, women and children were massacred, right next to five different army and security forces outposts: Survivors say that as the massacre took place, armed forces units with armoured vehicles were stationed outside the village and <b>stopped some of those trying to flee from getting out of the village</b>.</dd>

<dd>SAIRA SHAH: When they reached the main road, the only lighted place, the villagers claim <b>the army was already there</b> but it didn’t help them. Instead, <b>soldiers shot at anyone who approached</b>, and they never tried to enter the village. The people were trapped in the dark back streets, along with the killers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But of course, the Algerian army would never stop known FIS voters (both Rais and Bentalha had overwhelmingly voted for FIS) from fleeing people who were trying to massacre them, or deny them assistance, would they?

<p>In view of a policy you seem to have forgotten - <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">WP:Assume good faith</a> - see my reply to your comment here:</p>
<p>"I've already made my point on the talk page that we shouldn't be giving undue weight to the conspiracy theories and that they are disputed."</p>
<p>The idea that they constitute "conspiracy theories", as I have already pointed out, is your POV, and as such is irrelevant to this article. The fact that some specialists, along with the governments' defenders, dismiss them as incorrect (though even those specialists do not dismiss them out of hand) is duly noted in my version (though not in yours), as is the fact that other specialists regard them as quite probable. (Hugh Roberts, for one, is the best-informed English-language researcher working on Algeria.)</p>
<p>"Please look at the edit history yourself and you'll see that the claim that I'm "intent on removing all reference to the army arriving at massacre scenes and refusing to help/turning people back" is farcical and an utter misrepresentation of my objections and cited edits."</p>
<p>Wrong. You were willing to admit (because even the army don't attempt to deny it) that villagers were "massacred in the vicinity of military barracks." You were <i>not</i> willing to adopt any wording that acknowledged the well-attested fact that the army <i>arrived at massacre scenes</i> (not merely was nearby), that it <i>refused to help</i>, and (incredible, but well-documented) that it actually <i>turned people back</i>.</p>
<p>You have also, I should point out, attempted to delete all reference to the crucial fact that this "conspiracy theory" was most widely popularised by a survivor of the Bentalha massacre, Nesroullah Yous. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 21:32, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My rationale for removing the link is this: It is highly POV'd against Michael Ignatieff and provides no new information. While official sites are to be included as per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, no such policy exists for so-called "Opponent Sites". In fact, they are generally not included, as can be seen on the Bush, Harper, or Blair articles. -- <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaius_Octavius_f536.html" title="User:Gaius Octavius">Gaius Octavius</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaius_Octavius_78fc.html" title="User talk:Gaius Octavius">Talk</a> 08:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Woah. 3 comments before I've replied. A little impatient? And in the future, please include 4 tildes, not 3. I've added a time and date as per your contributions log. As for the request to self-revert, I think I'll pass. It's a 3-revert rule, if you recall. In any case, I fail to see the logic of your arguments on why the page should stay - you're saying that the Stop Iggy link deserves to be included even if it's not reliable. I don't see how this makes any sense. If there are valid criticisms on the page, please include them in the article on Ignatieff. There are already several criticisms of Ignatieff on the page (Iraq, Lesser Evils, etc...) and they are all sourced (unlike on the Stop Iggy page). Even in the Criticisms of Tony Blair article you cite, there are no blatantly POV references - every link is to a newspaper article. Not one is a link to a "Stop Tony" site or similar. So the Stop Iggy link is not only biased, it's also without precedent. That's why I don't feel it belongs. -- <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaius_Octavius_f536.html" title="User:Gaius Octavius">Gaius Octavius</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaius_Octavius_78fc.html" title="User talk:Gaius Octavius">Talk</a> 15:50, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure I think the Religious Tolerance cite is very good. That site cites a discussion group, but nothing more — not even a date. (RT is not as rigorously edited as makes me comfortable with it as a reliable source.)</p>
<p>There's also very little, if anything, other than that. As prolific a blogger as Cole is, and as vitriolic as he was with Baha'i administration, you'd think he'd be eager to score points.</p>
<p>Also, his later work on Babi/Baha'i topics take a rather skeptical tone regarding these figures. I think Cole admires Baha'u'llah as a poet and thinker, but not as a divine messenger or prophet. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 15:46, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
