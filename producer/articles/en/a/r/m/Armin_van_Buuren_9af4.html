<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armin_van_Buuren_9af4.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>He started working as a DJ in a local club called Nexus, finished high school in 1995 and went on to university to study law. Meanwhile, he moved his studio equipment from his bedroom to a 'real' studio. The first tracks he produced in his new studio were, among others, hits like "Touch Me" and "Communication". Not liking to be confined to a particular style by labelling his music, the tracks that followed had varied feeling. Van Buuren has been quoted as saying, "Don't be a prisoner of your own style." He has described his musical style as euphoric, uplifting, melodic and energetic.</p>
<p>Van Buuren's ambition has driven him to have many undertakings at the same time: studying, producing, and working as a DJ. He says that the only way to be able to do so is by enjoying the work that you do. He claims that his ultimate dream is to do what he loves most and have as much fun as possible doing it.</p>
<p>He hosts the hugely popular trance show <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_State_of_Trance_c1ab.html" title="A State of Trance">A State of Trance</a></i>. The show has completed its 251st episode in 2006, running successfully for 5 years.</p>
<p>In October 2002, Van Buuren was voted Number 5 in the DJ Magazine 100 top DJs. The following year, he jumped up to the #3 spot, and held it strong for 3 years straight. His hard work has finally paid off, leaving him with the #2 spot, just below <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_van_Dyk_6031.html" title="Paul van Dyk">Paul van Dyk</a> in the 2006 polls. He is very active, and means to stay that way. If he does, he may be crowned with the #1 spot in 2007.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armin_van_Buuren_9af4.html" title="Edit section: As a producer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">As a producer</span></h2>
<p>Armin has always had his own studio and works alone the majority of the time. He has never employed an <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_engineering.html" title="Audio engineering">engineer</a>, claiming he does not want the music to be influenced in any way.</p>
<p>Since 1995, Armin has released many tracks on different labels with increasing success. His first big success was "Blue Fear" on Cyber Records. This 'Euro Trance blueprint' made it into the UK Chart. "Communication" was released on the same label, and had a huge impact on <a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibiza.html" title="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> in the summer of 1999. After being signed to <a href="../../../a/m/_/AM_PM_Records_a731.html" title="AM PM Records">AM PM Records</a>, this track entered the UK Chart at #18 in 2000.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1999, Armin started his label Armind together with United Recordings. The first release, Gig - "One," was well received. The second release "Touch Me", under the name <i>Rising Star</i> was signed to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_Of_Sound_e981.html" title="Ministry Of Sound">Ministry Of Sound</a> in the UK, before the record was released.</p>
<p>By the time of the third Armin release, Gimmick - "Free" was signed to R&amp;S Records, Armin had managed to make his label popular very quickly. Under the surname <i>Gaia</i> he released "4 Elements" on Captivating Sounds, a sub-label of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Brothers_0eef.html" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>. Teaming up with <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Ti%C3%ABsto_4757.html" title="DJ Tiësto">DJ Tiësto</a>, two new projects were born: <i>Major League</i> - "Wonder Where You Are?" was released on <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackhole.html" title="Blackhole">Blackhole</a> and <i>Alibi</i> - "Eternity" was released on <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armind.html" title="Armind">Armind</a>. "Eternity" received club and chart success and was signed to <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_van_Dyk_6031.html" title="Paul van Dyk">Paul van Dyk</a>'s imprint <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandit_Records_822d.html" title="Vandit Records">Vandit Records</a>. Another major collaboration followed this. Together with <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferry_Corsten_352c.html" title="Ferry Corsten">Ferry Corsten</a>, Armin recorded a riff-classic titled "Exhale" for the System F. album. Released as a single, this track reached gold status in less than a month.</p>
<p>In 2000 Armin started his own AVB compilation series. He managed to find the perfect balance between <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_electronica.html" title="Progressive electronica">progressive</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/c/Techno.html" title="Techno">techno</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trance_music.html" title="Trance music">trance music</a> styles. AVB001 - "A State of Trance" (not to be confused with his weekly <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_State_of_Trance_c1ab.html" title="A State of Trance">ASOT</a> radio shows) sold more than 10,000 copies and contains Armin's well known remix of Moogwai - "Viola." AVB002 "Basic Instinct" featured a new track: <i>Perpetuous Dreamer</i> - "The Sound Of Goodbye." This track entered the Dutch charts in June 2001 at number 26. Later in the year the track hit #1 on the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Dance_Music_Club_Play_f0ab.html" title="Hot Dance Music/Club Play">Hot Dance Music/Club Play</a> chart. AVB003 - "In Motion" was released August 6th 2001. This album contained the real trance sound and was very popular in the US. AVB004 - "Transparance" followed in 2002.</p>
<p>Armin remixed several long tracks, such as <a href="../../../w/a/m/Wamdue_Project_1e92.html" title="Wamdue Project">Wamdue Project</a> - "King Of My Castle", <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Avenue_%28band%29_5d58.html" title="Madison Avenue (band)">Madison Avenue</a> - "Don't Call Me Baby" and Gouryella - "Walhalla" (all in 1999 and 2000). His recent remixes are Solid Sessions - "Janeiro" and Shane - "Too Late To Turn." Due to the success of these mixes there is a high demand on his <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remix.html" title="Remix">remixes</a> but he has recently turned several requests down in order to focus on his own artist album.</p>
<p>In March 2001 Armin started his own radio show on <a href="../../../i/d/%26/ID%26T_c3fc.html" title="ID&amp;T">ID&amp;T</a> Radio. In this weekly two-hour show, entitled '<a href="../../../a/_/s/A_State_of_Trance_c1ab.html" title="A State of Trance">A State of Trance</a>', he plays the latest popular trance music tracks. His show and the artists he features are popularized by publishing the artists and track titles on <a href="http://stage.arminvanbuuren.com/?id=38" class="external text" title="http://stage.arminvanbuuren.com/?id=38" rel="nofollow">his website</a>. This radio-show/website combination has proven popular internationally. Many fans -- while listening to the radio-show -- will converse in the website chat-rooms and forums, such as <a href="http://www.di.fm" class="external text" title="http://www.di.fm" rel="nofollow">DI.FM</a>, over the playing tracks. When ID&amp;T Radio changed genres in 2004, Armin left and took <i>A State of Trance</i> with him. It is now a weekly feature on Fresh FM, a Dutch radio station, DI.FM, an online radio station, and on <a href="../../../x/m/_/XM_Satellite_Radio_9ff5.html" title="XM Satellite Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> channel 82 in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. A complete list of stations that broadcast ASOT can be found at <a href="http://stage.arminvanbuuren.com/index.php?id=37" class="external text" title="http://stage.arminvanbuuren.com/index.php?id=37" rel="nofollow">the ASOT section of Armins website</a>. In June 2005, the 200th episode was celebrated in <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and subsequently aired on radio. The 250th (8 hour!) anniversary episode was celebrated in Club Asta in The Hague, The Netherlands, featuring Armin, Jonas Steur, M.I.K.E., John Askew, Rank 1 and Menno De Jong.</p>
<p>He has also worked on remix projects involving tracks by Japanese superstar <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayumi_Hamasaki_2a42.html" title="Ayumi Hamasaki">Ayumi Hamasaki</a>.</p>

<p>Van Buuren began his DJ career at club Nexus in Leiden, where he learned to play long DJ sets, which were regularly six to seven hours per set. During school holidays he played more than four times a week. In 1999, he met Dave Lewis who introduced him as a DJ in England and the United States. His DJ career accelerated, entering the <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_magazine_d306.html" title="DJ magazine">DJ magazine</a> Top-100 in November of 2001 at Number 27. He has played in more than 25 different countries and can often be found on the main stage at big summer festivals. Recently, Van Buuren played a record-breaking nine-hour set for Dancetheater in The Hague (Holland). In the United Kingdom one can see him perform regularly at <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passion.html" title="Passion">Passion</a> (resident 2002), <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godskitchen.html" title="Godskitchen">Godskitchen</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatecrasher.html" title="Gatecrasher">Gatecrasher</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slinky.html" title="Slinky">Slinky</a>, Peach and Golden.</p>
<p>In the United States, he has a residency at Glow in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_D.C._708d.html" title="Washington D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> and has played in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver.html" title="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. He has also regularly appeared at Amnesia on the island of <a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibiza.html" title="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>.</p>
<p>Lately, Van Buuren has been working hard on his DJ career, performing an average of more than two performances per weekend. According to him, "The fans and the public are the most important thing for a DJ." Because he strongly believes in the importance of his fans, he can be seen signing his autograph on virtually anything: <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinyl_record.html" title="Vinyl record">vinyl records</a>, flyers, t-shirts, body parts, and <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_phones.html" title="Mobile phones">mobile phones</a>.</p>
<p>On April 12th of 2006, Van Buuren began a Canadian tour with a performance in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. This was his first appearance in the centrally located Canadian city. Despite a Wednesday booking, the venue was filled to capacity with fans eager to see Armin perform. Throughout his set Armin could be seen signing autographs for his eager fans.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2006 he had a live performance called Armin Only in <a href="../../../a/h/o/Ahoy%27_Rotterdam_8ac4.html" title="Ahoy' Rotterdam">Ahoy</a> <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> for the second time (after Nov 12, 2005) with a 9 hour solo set, where he performed to over 11 000 fans.</p>
<p><br />
