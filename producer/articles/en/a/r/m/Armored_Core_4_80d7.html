<p>The world experienced a period of rapid population growth, which put a strain on global food and energy supplies. As populations increased, so did the gap between the wealthy and the poor, and so did the unrest between the classes. Eventually, violence began to erupt and the governments quickly lost control of their populations as their cities were consumed by terrorism and anarchy. People began turning to corporations, complete with private armies, to keep them safe from the chaos.</p>
<p>In the midst of the meltdown, the world's six most powerful corporate conglomerates decided to do away with national governments and install their own brand of rule and law. They launched a full scale war on the nations of the world, which came to be known as the Nation Dismantlement War.</p>
<p>Using advanced Armored Core technology, the corporations decimated the forces of the nations and declared victory in less than a month. With the old nations of the world effectively toppled, the corporations set out to work on a new system of government.</p>
<p><a name="Pax_Economica" id="Pax_Economica"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_Core_4_80d7.html" title="Edit section: Pax Economica">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pax Economica</span></h3>
<p>The corporations dubbed their new order as the "Pax Economica", a system where loyalty and service to the corporations guaranteed food and survival. Under the Pax, however, people were forced into corporate-run colonies and essentially became slaves serving wealthy corporate masters.</p>
<p><a name="The_Ravens" id="The_Ravens"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_Core_4_80d7.html" title="Edit section: The Ravens">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Ravens</span></h3>
<p>Not everyone was powerless to the corporations though. Rebels and mercenaries calling themselves "Ravens" turned against the corporations and their new order and began to fight against them. Five years have since passed when the Pax was established, and the world's population has become passive and apathetic under the new system. However, one Raven was poised to change all that.</p>

<p>A explosion in population growth brought the world ever closer to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminal.html" title="Terminal">terminal</a> condition. Due to this, the world suffers from shortage of food, water, and energy. The democracies in the world lost control of their citizens due to their desperation and rage towards the gap between wealth and poverty. As cities were destroyed due to terrorism, the military force proved to be the only hope in preserving order throughout the world. In response, groups of mechanized arm manufacturers, complete with private armies, expanded and rose to power.</p>
<p>As the world's economic system approached its limits, an unprecedented change swept the globe. The top six corporate conglomerates, already the de facto leaders of the political world, decided to remove power from the nations of the world and began to mount a full-scale war against the establishment.</p>
<p>So began the National Dismantlement War.</p>
<p>The forces of the world's nations fell in quick succession, unable to withstand the <a href="../../../o/n/s/Onslaught.html" title="Onslaught">onslaught</a> of the Companies' <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance.html" title="Advance">advanced</a> weaponry - in particular a new breed of Armored Core (AC) mechs, despite numbering fewer than thirty. The war ended within a month of its start. The Companies had managed to accomplish history's first conclusive worldwide coup d'etat in a matter of days.</p>
<p>In the wake of their <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory.html" title="Victory">victory</a>, the Companies established a new system of order. People were gathered into Colonies where labor was rewarded with a guarantee of food and survival. All were powerless to protest except for a small group of rebels who called themselves the Ravens.</p>
<p>The global economy was destroyed and in its wake, a new economy dubbed the <i><b>Pax Economica</b></i>, emerged from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companies.html" title="Companies">Companies</a>. Though the Companies' spokespeople touted the new system as a reasoned redistribution of the world's limited resources, the resulting castes of this socialist system positioned the world's population as near-slaves to the wealthy Companies.</p>
<p>Five years into the Pax Economica, consolidated military power and the public's pervasive apathy still managed to hold chaos at bay, until one lone Raven decided to take matters into his own hands.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Raven</b> — The protagonist of <i>Armored Core 4</i>. As in previous <i>Armored Core</i> games, the Raven is an unnamed <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_protagonist.html" title="Silent protagonist">silent protagonist</a> controlled by the player. The game plays out entirely from his or her perspective.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Professor Jarnefeldt</b> — As the developer of Next control technology, he single-handedly supplied the core of Anatolia's livelihood with his many technical advancements . His death left Anatolia in a state of economic crisis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fiona Jarnefeldt</b> — Not only is she Professor Jarnefeldt's daughter but she also worked as the Raven's support partner (operator) in the field. Though she understands the necessity of Emil's plan, she is unable to relieve her feelings of guilt at using the Raven, she also seems to have feelings for him, at one point telling him they will leave after the war.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Emil Gustav</b> — Though a member of Professor Jarnefeldt's Next tech development staff, his true talents lie in the world of politics. Following the Professor's death, Emil assumes responsibility for the Colony's welfare and proposes that they sell the Nexts. With this in mind, he asks the Raven to act as the Next's pilot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Joshua O'Brien</b> — An old friend of Fiona's, this former AMS test subject now works as a mercenary for Aspina. He pilots a white Next, called White Glint, which is tuned for extreme mobility with a high degree of AMS compatibility. Despite his gentlemanly calm nature and somewhat apathetic aura, he continues to fight to protect his tiny homeland.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Amazigh</b> — He pilots the irregular Barbarol Next for the Maglib Liberation Front. Born and raised in Africa, he stands as an iconic hero to Maglib and the other anti-establishment forces in Africa. He's pushed Barbarol's performance to the limits despite extremely low natural AMS compatibility, enduring a tremendous amount of psychic shock.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mido Auriel</b> — Because she possesses special psychic traits, Mido became one of the elite Linx pilots. She trained with Omer after the National Dismantlement War and pilots her beloved Null Next.</li>

<p>The world of <i><b>Armored Core 4</b></i> is ruled by six companies, all of whom vie for control through hostile means (though some have managed to form alliances with one another).</p>
<p>The six companies are <i><b>Eqbal</b></i>, <i><b>Rosenthal</b></i>, <i><b>Rayleonard</b></i>, <i><b>Leonemeccanica</b></i>, <i><b>Bernard and Felix Foundation (BFF),</b></i> and <i><b>Global Armaments America (GA)</b></i>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Actuator Complexity System</b> (ACS) - The Next's new and improved system of control which far surpasses that of Normals in terms of precision. Originally researched and developed by Aldra, poor data management has cost them a great deal of advantage in the field. It is now looked at among Companies as a comparatively easily surpassed engineering hurdle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Allegorical Manipulation System</b> (AMS) - Piloting system allowing those with a certain in-born psychic trait to control Nexts. Though the strain it places on pilots is considerable, it allows for an extremely high degree of AC control.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Armored Core</b> (AC) - A new form of humanoid multi-purpose weapon, armed with unparalleled firepower and capable of deciding battles single-handedly. The ACs were originally developed to combat the terrorism and violence that rose with the world's sovereign nations inability to preserve order. Recent developments in Armored Core technology have yielded a new breed of ACs, called "Nexts," in addition to the previous "Normals."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Colonies</b> - Collective dwellings inhabited by all except for the privileged employees of the Companies, ranging from small city-states to tiny villages. Economic transactions take place exclusively between the Companies and a Colony representative, leaving the majority of the population to work in exchange for their food and security. The tight supply of food and energy, however, paired with the Companies' prohibition of direct inter-Colony trade, still leaves nearly all of the inhabitants in destitution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Companies</b> - The six corporate groups, and their holdings, which have assumed the responsibility of providing a new order in the place of the world's former nations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Firing Control System (FCS)</b> - The weapons control system that operates alongside the IRS when sighting targets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fractional Regulation System (FRS)</b> - An AC control system that relays commands to each of the individual parts of the mechfrom the IRS.The ability of the FRS to optimize and execute control over separate parts without losing overall control gives FRS the advantage over IRS performance.. Furthermore, FRS performance can be enhanced through the addition of specialized external memory chips.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Integrated Regulation System (IRS)</b> - The centralized AC control system stored within the craft's head. The IRS processes data output from the AMS fills in any gaps in the pilot's commands and relays them to the parts. The IRS system also handles data from the AC's camera eyes and sensors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Interior Group</b> - Heavyweight crafts streamlined for minimum impact, designed to rule the battlefield with lethal high-powered energy-based weaponry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kojima Technology</b> - A recent breakthrough in engineering that unravels the secrets between Nexts and Normals. Originally developed by Akvavit and Rayleonard, Omer Science Technology replicated their results through independent research shortly thereafter. Thanks to tight data control within the labs of these three companies, the inner workings of Kojima tech remains a black box to outside developers and corporate espionage among the Companies has escalated to a fevered pitch.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kojima Particles</b> - A new substance discovered approximately 7 seven years prior to the National Dismantlement War by a researcher of the same name. Ensuing research has shown that when Kojima technology is applied to a host of applications that the basis of the Nexts is formed. Kojima particles have also been found to be a powerful pollutant, causing dangerously widespread and persistent damage to all forms of life exposed to them. Created by Akvavit and Omer Science Technology, Kojima Particles hold great potential for military use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Linx</b> - Title applied to Next pilots who are AMS-compatible.While the Nexts' AMS control system directly translates the user's skill into AC performance in the field, it requires pilots to possess a special psychic trait in order to properly function. Only candidates born compatible are suited to act as pilots. Their psychic peculiarities could be called a form of genius, and many of them are used as the Companies' experimental test subjects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>National Dismantlement War</b> - The armed conflict that erupted after the Companies decided to form a new world order. After explosive population growth, the sovereign nations of the world lost their ability to maintain control in the face of food and energy shortages. Beginning with the Companies' sudden and unilateral blitzkrieg, the largest scale coup de etat in world history was concluded within weeks, with the Companies standing victorious.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Nexts</b> - A new breed of weapon developed in secret, initially used as the Companies' ace in the hole during the National Dismantlement War. Though based on Normal AC technology, the combination of Akvavit's Kojima technology, Aspina's Allegorical Manipulation System, and other new breakthroughs yield a product with far greater potential. The exclusive Nexts also represent the Companies' power, as most Colonies and independent armed groups do not have access to them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Normals</b> - High-powered, multi-purpose humanoid weapons developed to counter the terrorism and violence which rose to fill the vacuum left by the sovereign nations' waning power. The strongest weapons in play prior to the National Dismantlement War, Normals are now - with the exception of some of the latest or most highly specialized models - all but powerless in the face of the world's few Nexts. That said, Normals still compose the bulk of the Companies' forces, and represent the strongest units available to both Colonies and independent armed groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Originals</b> - Title given to Linx who piloted Nexts from the time of the National Dismantlement War, which is to say from the very outset of Next technology. Over half of the Linx in existence are Originals, with the number of post-war additions still extremely few. A strong sense of being one of a chosen few pervades the ranks of the Originals, who were numbered from one through 26 following the war, in the order of their battlefield accomplishments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Overboost (OB)</b> - Propulsion device developed through the application of Kojima technology to boosters. The conversion of a craft's Kojima particles into the OB allows for instantaneous, explosive acceleration, though it gradually weakens the craft's PA.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pax Economica</b> - The new social order, established after the Companies' victory in the National Dismantlement War. Under it, a majority of the world's population dwells in collectives known as Colonies. There, people are guaranteed food in return for labor, but they are completely cut off from the market economy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Primal Armor (PA)</b> - A defensive shield created by molding Kojima particles into a sustained, stable flow around the AC's exterior which is capable of greatly diminishing or entirely nullifying a wide variety of attacks. After an attack Kojima particle dispersion can lead to temporary weakening, but unlike conventional armor, PAs restore themselves with time. There are few drawbacks to using PA though it can be weak comparatively against highly penetrative weapons, and the necessity of expelling a large quantity of Kojima particles into the atmosphere risks serious environmental contamination.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Quick Boost (QB)</b> - Though Boost technology is hardly new in Normals and other weaponry, this breakthrough technology allows for immediate acceleration in any direction over a short distance. With the Nexts' revolutionary energy provision system and the AMS's high degree of control, the Quick Boost has become one of the new ACs' characteristic features.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Raven</b> - Common name for a mercenary AC pilot after the widespread use of Normals in battle began. Their high degree of specialization and the impressive power of their crafts represented the chaotic era in which they fought. Now, after the close of the National Dismantlement War, however, most Ravens have been forced to become lackeys of the Companies and patrol the Colonies for next to nothing, or give their all to independent armed groups. Their current struggle to survive is a far cry from the glory they once held as the unchallenged masters of the battlefield in the days before the advent of Next technology.</li>

<p><i><b>Armored Core 4</b></i> has more new features than previous AC games although some of them are removed which is found on the past previous AC games.</p>
<p><a name="Mission_Gameplay" id="Mission_Gameplay"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_Core_4_80d7.html" title="Edit section: Mission Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mission Gameplay</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The lockbox normally found from the first AC game up to Last Raven was removed from the <a href="../../../h/u/d/HUD_d2d8.html" title="HUD">HUD</a>. AC's will now automatically lock on enemies when in range.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The controls have been reworked from the ground up to provide easier and more efficient play.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The energy bar, normally found on the left is now above the AP in the center of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With some of the higher powered generators you can pretty much fly forever, unlike other AC games where you had to land around every 20-45 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another energy bar which is used by the Primal Armor and Overboost functions of your AC is found in the right of the AP.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The environment is now affected by AC battles. For example, an AC moving on sand or on the ground will leave footprints. Buildings and landmarks can be destroyed. Weapons possess terraforming effects, most notably in an unlockable Arctic battle stage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A status window found on the left of the screen continually updates the physical condition of the AC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ECM of the area is measured and shown just below the map.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The battlefield is much larger;however, like most AC games the levels are rather barren.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can now fight on water unlike past AC games where you would die if contact was made. If you stop using boost, you sink; you can get back to the surface quickly if you start using it again. The only penalty you can suffer is a mission failure should you exit the mission's boundaries by sinking too far.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All weapons now do more damage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The heat and overheating game mechanics have now been removed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Boosting along the ground no longer consumes energy, it merely causes your energy bar to regenerate more slowly.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_Core_4_80d7.html" title="Edit section: AC Parts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">AC Parts</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the rest of the player's AC unit, weapons may now be painted (a feature that was either limited or wholly non-existent in past installments).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Decals can also be grafted to any part of the AC's base frame. Also, emblems from From Software's other mech game, Chromehounds, are carried over into Armored Core 4.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Primal Armor, which are protective energy barriers equipped to the core, have been added.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The AC's Overboost function (OB) from past PS2 incarnations now come in the form of actual booster parts separate from the core.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inside parts have been removed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>EO (Exceed Orbit) functions have been removed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hover leg parts have been removed, mostly due to the fact that AC units in Armored Core 4 no longer consume energy when boosting along the ground.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Side booster and back booster component types have been added.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Extensions have been removed, but are retained concept-wise by shoulder parts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arm weapons are no longer grouped by left or right hand, but as one total group.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The tuning system is now more elaborate, and as such has replaced the Optional parts class from previous installments of the series.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stabilizers have been added, which are add-on parts that shift the balance of an AC, and also serve to add aesthetic details to the base frame as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>AC units now have substantially more AP when compared to those of previous installments. In Armored Core 4, an AC unit may have upwards of over 45,000 AP, whereas in earlier incarnations of the series, the maximum amount of AP was set at 9,999.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Assemble</b> - In this section, you build your AC from the current pool of available parts. This works differently than in previous installments of Armored Core, in that there is no longer a Shop area of any kind. Instead, all the parts that are currently available to you are listed in the garage, whether you own them or not. Parts you do not own are marked "DATA ONLY". By pressing X with a part selected, you can view a screen that shows the cost of the part and the amount of money you currently have. You can them Buy the part if you don't own it, Sell it if you do, or hide it, so that it is not displayed in the normal parts list when building your AC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weapons</b> - This is just a shortcut to the Weapons section of <b>Assemble</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Paint</b> - As the name implies, this section is for changing the color of your AC. You can change the color of any and all elements, except for boosters, generator, and FCS.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Simulation</b> - To use <b>Simulation</b> you must first obtain one or more Data Packs. These are given as rewards for clearing chapters. <b>Simulation</b> is essentially Armored Core 4's version of the Arena found in many previous Armored Core games. A single data pack contains simulation data for one or more enemy Nexts. When you defeat a Next in a Data Pack, you are given a monetary reward, with an additional monetary award for defeating all the Nexts in a given Data Pack. Other rewards are also available, and include items such as parts for your AC, Memory for tuning, and even new Data Packs. One thing to note about <b>Simulation</b> mode is that you don't need to buy the parts in your schematic to use it. A schematic made entirely out of unpurchased, "DATA ONLY" parts can be used in <b>Simulation</b> without penalty. You will still have to buy the parts to use them in a normal mission. There is no penalty for losing in <b>Simulation</b> mode, and no cost for repairs or ammunition if you win.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Test</b> - Launches an AC test simulation. As with the <b>Simulation</b> mode, you do not need to actually purchase the parts in a schematic to use it in a test simulation. By default, there are no enemies in the simulation. You can add enemies from the pause menu by choosing Select Targets and then choosing the targets you'd like. Targets available include a squad of MTs, a small group of Normals, or a single Next. Only one type of target can be active at a time, and changing target types restarts the test.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Tutorial</b> - Selecting this option launches the tutorial from the start of the game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Design</b> - This category has options for aesthetic additions to your AC. You can apply decals and small optional parts that don't actually impact the performance of the AC, just the looks.</li>
