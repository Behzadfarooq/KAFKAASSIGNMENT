<p>The forces of an imaginary country (Red) had crossed the the frontier dividing Red from Britain (Blue) between <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wells-next-the-Sea_7bd7.html" title="Wells-next-the-Sea">Wells-next-the-Sea</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunstanton.html" title="Hunstanton">Hunstanton</a>. Red forces were pushing south as quickly as possible. Blue had ordered a general mobilisation and its prime goal was to stop Red forces entering <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>: Blue forces were based around <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. Time was of the essence for both sides.</p>
<p>The Chief Umpire was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_French%2C_1st_Earl_of_Ypres_c913.html" title="John French, 1st Earl of Ypres">Sir John French</a>, who was based in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>.</p>

<p>The forces were nearly equal in size. Each consisted of a cavalry division, two infantry divisions, army troops, two aeroplane flights, and an airship. (The airships were Gamma and Delta.)<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>However, despite the near equality of the forces on paper, the odds were in Haig's favour, as his forces were cohesive, with superior organisation and training, whilst Grierson's were more of a scratch team.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Staff of the Red Army were the Aldershot command, who were accustomed to working together. In contrast, the Blue Staff were drawn from all commands except Aldershot.</li>
<li>The Red cavalry was a division of regular cavalry, while the Blue cavalry was a disparate group of two brigades drawing on the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Household_Cavalry_15f4.html" title="Household Cavalry">Household Cavalry</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_Greys_2f5d.html" title="Scots Greys">Scots Greys</a>, Yeomanry, and Cyclists.</li>
<li>The Red infantry was the Aldershot divisions. The Blue infantry came from the Southern Command (3rd Division) and Eastern Command (4th Division and Territorials).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also as the 'invader' Haig had the initiative.</p>

<p>The Blue cavalry was pushed forward to the line <a href="../../../g/o/g/Gog_Magog_Downs_ead6.html" title="Gog Magog Downs">Gog Magog</a>—<a href="../../../r/i/v/Rivey_Hill_317b.html" title="Rivey Hill">Rivey Hill</a>. According to his diary, Grierson "stayed in camp all day receiving reports and very soon locating all the lines of march and halting places of the Red forces".</p>

<p>Blue cavalry advanced to locate the enemy and fought with the 2nd Division near Hundon. The 3rd Division ended the day in position from Reid's Farm to <a href="../../../r/i/v/Rivey_Hill_317b.html" title="Rivey Hill">Rivey Hill</a>. The 4th Division concealed itself from aircraft and, after dark, moved through <a href="../../../s/a/f/Saffron_Walden_0389.html" title="Saffron Walden">Saffron Walden</a> and camped to the east of it.</p>

<p>The Blue infantry was ordered to advance to the line <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horseheath.html" title="Horseheath">Horseheath</a>—<a href="../../../h/e/l/Helions_Bumpstead_8651.html" title="Helions Bumpstead">Helions Bumpstead</a>. The hitherto concealed 4th Division closed up on the right of the 3rd, which had been strung out to represent the main force. The Blue cavalry was ordered to co-operate on the right of the 4th Division and the Territorials to advance from <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linton%2C_Cambridgeshire_f379.html" title="Linton, Cambridgeshire">Linton</a>. In the ensuing 'battle', Blue forces won a clear victory, bringing the manoeuvres to a close a day early. Grierson had the 10th Brigade in hand. Although the Red cavalry were somewhere to the rear of the Blue forces, they were not deployed in the battle. Haig was thus defeated in front of his own staff, the King, and the foreign observers.</p>
<p>The Blue forces bivouacked at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linton%2C_Cambridgeshire_f379.html" title="Linton, Cambridgeshire">Linton</a> and Grierson celebrated his victory with champagne.</p>

<p>At the final conference in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Hall%2C_Cambridge_78c6.html" title="Trinity Hall, Cambridge">Trinity Hall</a> with the King presiding, the opponents were asked to explain their tactics and moves. Grierson was well-received. "He looked like victory", said one observer. His speech was confident, lucid, and vigorous.</p>
<p>In contrast, Haig's speech was disastrous. According to John Charteris, he did not read out his written statement, which gave a "clear and convincing account of his views, he did not not even refer to it when he spoke but to the dismay of his staff attempted to extemporise. In the effort he became totally unintelligible and unbearably dull. The university dignitaries soon fell asleep, Haig's friends became more and more uncomfortable, only he seemed totally unconscious of his failure."</p>
<p>Warner suggests that any notes Haig might have made in advance might have prepared on the assumption that the battle was evenly balanced and would have sounded absurd if used after the result was declared.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Manoeuvres_of_1912_8f17.html" title="Edit section: Analysis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Analysis</span></h2>
<p>"Haig was completely out-generalled by Grierson, in spite of the efforts of the umpires and judges to make the contest appear more even." (Warner, p108). A major factor was that Haig had not realised the importance of the spotter aircraft. Grierson had hidden his forces from observation and Haig never knew where the Blue forces were. In his speech at Trinity Hall, Grierson recounted "I told them to look as like toadstools as they could and to make noises like oysters." In contrast, Grierson had almost perfect knowledge of the movements of Haig's troops.</p>
<p>Haig learnt the lessons of the manoeuvres and thenceforth encouraged the development of observer aircraft.</p>
<p>Grierson's style also encouraged his staff to take responsibility. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Radcliffe_%28soldier%29_9bd2.html" title="Percy Radcliffe (soldier)">Sir Percy Radcliffe</a> recalls that he was sent with an order to throw in the Territorials ay a certain point. Seeing there was not time, on his own initiative he threw them in at another with total success.</p>

<p>Things went wrong for Seely:</p>
<ul>
<li>His horse went lame and its replacement was delayed, so Seely kept the King waiting, for which he apologised. When the pair paused in their ride, the King cried out, "I wish you would stop your horse eating my foot." Seely jabbed the mount, but the King's foot was badly bruised. Seely apologised again but the King was displeased.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Seely galloped ahead to their destination to find the Canadian and South African Ministers for Defence in a fist fight. The South African had contended that one South African was better than twenty Britons in a battle whilst the Canadian had riposted that one Canadian was better than twenty South Africans. They decided to settle the matter with the fight. The King witnessed the brawl and Seely apologised yet again.</li>
