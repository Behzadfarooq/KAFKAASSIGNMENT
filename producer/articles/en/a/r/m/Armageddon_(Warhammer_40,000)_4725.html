<p>Located ten thousand light years to the galactic northeast of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_of_Warhammer_40%2C000_ff04.html#Holy_Terra" title="Planets of Warhammer 40,000">Holy Terra</a>, the world of Armageddon is the fourth in its system of ten planets, is classified as a Hive World of the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_7b95.html" title="Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)">Imperium</a>, and is the industrial hub of both the Armageddon sub-sector and the greater region. Many worlds within a several light-year radius of Armageddon rely on the world for its industrial output.</p>
<p>Hundreds of centuries of industry has reduced the world to barren wastelands and polluted oceans; humans can only survive within the artificial environment of the hive cities (massive <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcology.html" title="Arcology">arcology</a>-like structures that stand several kilometres tall) and Imperial facilities. Food must be imported from off-planet, and clean air and water are precious commodities.</p>
<p>Because of the inhospitable conditions outside of the hive cities, almost all regiments of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Imperial_Guard_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_6b51.html#Armageddon_Steel_Legion" title="History of the Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000)">Armageddon Steel Legion</a> are trained as mechanised infantry.</p>

<p>There are three main landmasses on Armageddon. Most human life is located on the main continent, which is split into two parts, Armageddon Prime and Armageddon Secondus, by the thick band of jungle known simply as the Equatorial Jungle. The bulk of Armageddon Prime and Secondus is covered in ash wastes, aftereffects of millennia of industrialisation. Several hive cities house the population and industry of Armageddon; Tempestora, Death Mire and Volcanus on Prime, Infernus, Hades, Acheron, Helsreach and Tartarus on Secondus.</p>
<p>To the north of Armageddon Prime and Secondus are The Fire Wastes, which is home to the mining and resource gathering industries that support the industrial factories. This is an extremely arid region, which has been strip-mined far beyond the point of any sustainable ecosystem.</p>
<p>To the south is the ice-covered Deadlands. The polluted ice is melted and heavily purified to provide a source of drinking water to the inhabitants of the hive cities.</p>

<p>The first war fought for the planet is perhaps the least known, and probably for good reason. In the 499th year of the 41st millennium, a force assembled by <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Eaters_3268.html#Angron" title="World Eaters">Angron</a>, daemon-<a href="../../../p/r/i/Primarch.html" title="Primarch">Primarch</a> of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Eaters_3268.html" title="World Eaters">World Eaters</a>, used the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Hulk_020a.html#In_Warhammer_40.2C000" title="Space Hulk">space hulk</a> Devourer of Stars to launch an invasion of Armageddon.</p>
<p>The hulk emerged from the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaterium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_f4d3.html" title="Immaterium (Warhammer 40,000)">Immaterium</a> on the outer edge of the Armageddon system, and began to drift towards the Hive World. Actions by the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Navy_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_421d.html" title="Imperial Navy (Warhammer 40,000)">Imperial Navy</a> were able to stall the advance of the space hulk, but a month after emerging from the Warp, Angron was in a position to begin his attack.</p>

<p>As the space hulk manouevred itself into orbit around the Hive World, cultists worshipping the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_%28Warhammer%29_1d1d.html" title="Chaos (Warhammer)">Chaos</a> god <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khorne.html" title="Khorne">Khorne</a> broke out in rebellion. At least half of the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Guard_%28Warhammer_40%2C000_army%29_0e35.html" title="Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army)">Imperial Guard</a> stationed on the planet turned against their fellows. Anarchy and mayhem swept through the hives of Armageddon Prime, which made a perfect target for Angron's first landings. The planetfall was effectively uncontested, and the forces of Angron were able to establish control of Armageddon Prime within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Imperial forces were forced to withdraw through the Equatorial Jungle towards Armageddon Secondus, leaving behind them a land ruled by the daemonic and the insane. The land was said to have been littered with bones, while the polluted rivers were choked with blood spilled in the name of Khorne.</p>
<p>The Warp storms that had sprung up around the Armageddon sector in response to Angron's invasion began to abate at this point in time, and Angron was forced to stop the advance in order to consolidate and reinforce his Warp-spawned power. The Daemon Prince ordered a gigantic monolith be constructed that would draw the power needed to sustain daemonic existence on Armageddon, a construction that took many weeks, and killed thousands of slaves. Thousands more were executed in consecration ceremonies.</p>

<p>The time taken by Angron's forces to construct their daemonic-supporting construction was put to good use by the retreating Imperial forces. The Imperial forces had dug in at the River Chaeron, and support from the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Marines_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_a931.html" title="Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)">Space Marines</a> of both the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Wolves_1772.html" title="Space Wolves">Space Wolves</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Knights_a1b4.html" title="Grey Knights">Grey Knights</a> Chapters had made its way to Armageddon.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/o/g/Logan_Grimnar_a2bd.html" title="Logan Grimnar">Logan Grimnar</a> had been elected to lead the defence, and against the Imperial defences, the forces of Chaos could find little sanctuary. Ill-prepared for the level of resistance offered, the Chaos hordes sent failed wave after failed wave at the Imperium over the course of three days of hard, near-constant combat. However, Angron, accompanied by a bodyguard of a dozen of <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khorne.html" title="Khorne">Khorne</a>'s Bloodthirsters, was almost able to break the line at one point, and advance on Infernus and Helsreach Hives.</p>
<p>This had been planned for by Grimnar. As Angron's force broke through the line, an entire company of Terminator armour-equipped Grey Knights teleported into his path. Despite heavy losses, the Grey Knights fought without regard for their own safetly, and one by one, the daemons were banished back to the warp. After the sacrifice of Grand Master Aurelian, they surviving Grey Knights triumphed, banishing Angron's spirit to the warp, from where it could not return for a hundred years and a day. Leaderless, the Chaos horde was crushed in due order.</p>

<p>Bereft of the leadership of Angron and his daemonic allies, the hordes of Chaos were quickly routed and destroyed. The bodies of the enemy were piled into great funeral pyres and burned; the sites of these still showing the signs of Chaotic corruption.</p>
<p>The Imperium had prevailed, but at the cost of all industrial infrastructure on Armageddon Prime, along with a death toll that was beyond measure.</p>
<p>One final tragedy was to strike the world of Armageddon, as it was decided that all knowledge of the daemonic invasion had to be suppressed, to prevent mass panic from spreading to the rest of the Imperium. The destruction of records was simple enough, but the survivors of the war posed a greater problem. The Administratum, along with the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_ce3d.html" title="Inquisition (Warhammer 40,000)">Inquisition</a>, began a grand relocation scheme. Every single man, woman and child who had survived the war was rounded up and relocated to enormous forced-labour camps on isolated worlds, where they were forced to live out the rest of their lives in slavery. The planet's infrastructure was sterilised, purified and repaired, and a new population was brought to re-settle the planet. <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logan_Grimnar_a2bd.html" title="Logan Grimnar">Logan Grimnar</a> of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Wolves_1772.html" title="Space Wolves">Space Wolves</a> was the only one who dared protest these actions, and has never forgiven the Administratum for the betrayal of the brave men and women who fought for their world.</p>

<p>The second invasion of Armageddon occurred in 941.M41, led by the <a href="../../../o/r/k/Ork_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_0360.html" title="Ork (Warhammer 40,000)">Ork</a> Warlord <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghazghkull_Mag_Uruk_Thraka_d43d.html" title="Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka">Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka</a>. The ruler of Armageddon, Overlord <b>Herman von Strab</b>, was completely unprepared for the attack, and his own pride and incompetence only made matters worse. Ignoring the presence of a large Ork fleet in the outer system, and sending his regiments piecemeal to fight the Ork Waaagh after it made planetfall, von Strab may well have lost the vital planet, if not for the actions of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissar_Yarrick_0de0.html" title="Commissar Yarrick">Commissar Yarrick</a>.</p>
<p>Yarrick was the one to send a distress signal to the rest of the Imperium, an action that led to his exile by von Strab to the megacity <b>Hades Hive</b>. Elsewhere, von Strab's command led to defeat after defeat, causing the destruction of numerous planetary defence armies, the capture of two other megacities across Armageddon Prime and Secondus, and killing hundreds of thousands of refugees through the use of ancient and malfunctioning <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_weapons.html" title="Biological weapons">biological weapons</a>.</p>
<p>As the Imperium was defeated across the planet, the conflict at Hades Hive reached a level of intensity previously unseen in the invasion. Led by Yarrick himself, the Imperial resistance was so fierce that Ghazghkull himself joined the fray; every ploy and stratagem the Ork Warlord employed was countered by the wily <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_commissar.html" title="Political commissar">Commissar</a>. The heroism and leadership of Yarrick turned the course of the war, for as Ghazghkull became more frustrated, he became fixated on taking the hive, stalling his army's advance. After six months of siege, Imperial reinforcements arrived, spearheaded by the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Angels_bab0.html" title="Blood Angels">Blood Angels</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Marines_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_a931.html" title="Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)">Space Marines</a>. Von Strab was removed from command and imprisoned, as the defenders of Armageddon chose to follow the legendary Chapter Master <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_Dante_a0e1.html" title="Commander Dante">Dante</a>. The Blood Angels were quickly reinforced by the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultramarines.html" title="Ultramarines">Ultramarines</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamanders_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_6472.html" title="Salamanders (Warhammer 40,000)">Salamanders</a> chapters, quickly turning the tide of the war back in the Imperium's favour.</p>
<p>Moving north, the Space Marines failed to arrive in time to save Hades Hive, which had become much more than a military objective to Ghazghkull. The combined forces of Armageddon fell on the Orks as the latter broke into Hades Hive, slaughtering or routing every Ork that could be found. Yarrick was almost killed in the action, but stubbornly refused to die.</p>
<p>The Second War for Armaggedon had continued well into the year 942.M41 and so devastated the planet that the vital Hades, Tartarus, and Infernus Hives were still unrepaired by the time Ghazghkull returned, fifty-seven years later.</p>

<p>Ghazghkull also survived the final assault on Hades Hive. Retreating to his stronghold in a neighbouring sector, he continued on with the master plan revealed to him by the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gork_and_Mork_843e.html" title="Gork and Mork">Ork Godz</a>. The Second War for Armageddon was simply a way for the Ork military genius to test the reactions of the Imperium to mass invasion.</p>
<p>In the decades following the war, Ghazghkull began practicing the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">tactics</a> he believed would lead to the demise of the Imperium, carrying out a series of smaller experiments in the form of raids and ambushes on small Imperial outposts, slowly moving his influence closer to the Armageddon system.</p>

<p>The first signs of the impending war were a series of attacks on the systems surrounding Armageddon. Over a period of months, two worlds were laid waste by pirate raids, while one in every two Imperial merchant vessels vanished without a trace. Suddenly, the pirate raids became full-on Ork assaults on outposts and colonies, taking advantage of the fact that the Armageddon Sector Navy's top priority was to guard the Armageddon system.</p>
<p>In the early half of the year 999.M41, as the attacks on Imperial worlds increased in frequency and ferocity, General Kurov, now supreme commander of the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Guard_%28Warhammer_40%2C000_army%29_0e35.html" title="Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army)">Imperial Guard</a> forces on Armageddon, called for all nearby Imperial Guard Regiments and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Marines_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_a931.html" title="Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)">Space Marine</a> Chapters to gather in the defence of Armageddon.</p>

<p>On the fifty-seventh anniversary of end of the first Ork invasion of Armageddon, a sensor station located on the outer reaches of the system registered a titanic Ork fleet emerging from the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaterium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_f4d3.html" title="Immaterium (Warhammer 40,000)">Immaterium</a>. The station, shortly before its destruction, recorded almost four hundred separate vessels, including four <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Hulk_020a.html#In_Warhammer_40.2C000" title="Space Hulk">space hulks</a>. The <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Navy_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_421d.html" title="Imperial Navy (Warhammer 40,000)">Imperial Navy</a> was mobilized within twenty-four hours, and engaged the lead elements of the Ork fleet five days later.</p>
<p>Despite the skill of the Imperial Navy, and the command of Admiral Parol, the defenders were outnumbered six-to-one, and as they were being slowly forced back, word came from the other sensor stations within the Armageddon system that three more fleets of equal size were entering the system on other vectors. Parol was forced to disengage in an effort to save the surviving vessels of the Imperial fleet. The Ork fleets did not stop on their drive towards Armageddon, slowly but inexorably descending towards the world.</p>

<p>The final preparations before the Ork fleet arrived in orbit were made with a fateful frenzy. Imperial Guard and Space Marines dispersed into the ash wastes in order for the Imperium to quickly respond to any landings made. Imperial merchant vessels continued to run the ever-closing gauntlet, one of the final ships to make it to Armageddon carrying Commissar Yarrick himself. As the Imperium's greatest expert on Orks in general and on Ghazghkull in particular, Yarrick was made the supreme commander of all Imperial forces on the planet.</p>
<p>After six weeks, the Ork fleet, now numbering over two thousand vessels, reached their target. The orbital battle was brief, lasting only three days before the defences were destroyed and Ork landing craft began their descent to the surface. During this time, Hades Hive was bombarded by asteroids dropped from orbit; Ghazghkull did not want to have to fight at the scene of his defeat fifty years prior.</p>
<p>As the Ork forces established themselves on the surface, it became clear to many the skill of Ghazghkull and his strategies. The conflict was scattered and chaotic, the conditions in which Orks thrived and Imperial armies floundered. The only group that continued to make any headway were the forces from the twenty-four Space Marine Chapters scattered across the world.</p>
<p>The Ork forces on the surface of Armageddon were quickly reinforced as modified Ork Rok spaceships made their landings in strategic locations around the planet. The various hive cities became besieged, and armour engagements dotted the landscape.</p>
<p>The conflicts on Armageddon ebbed and flowed, neither side able to gain an advantage for more than a few days. The size of the forces involved and the number of casualties on each side was immense; Imperial Guard Command on Armageddon lost track of the number of soldiers involved, and the Celestial Lions Space Marines were almost completely annihilated. The war itself stalled when the world of Armageddon entered the 'Season of Fire' (the time of year when Armageddon's elliptical orbit brings it close to its sun), when conditions in the ash wastes grew so unbearable that both sides were forced to stop fighting, instead spending the season consolidating their gains for when the conflict began again.</p>

<p>The period known as the Third Armageddon war lasted for less than a year, with Ghazghkull leaving the planet, pursued by Yarrick and a full <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Templars_48d9.html" title="Black Templars">Black Templars</a> crusade. It could be said that the Imperium narrowly won the war, their victory became <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrrhic_victory.html" title="Pyrrhic victory">pyrrhic</a> when it became clear that fighting would continue for a long time.</p>
<p>The Orks have come to regard Armageddon as a kind of <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valhalla.html" title="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>, where they can always come to find a good fight, and warbands from across the galaxy have travelled to the world to take part in the 'ultimate test'. The Imperium was forced to bring in more troops to keep the planet in Imperial hands, calling in regiments from as far away as <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necromunda.html" title="Necromunda">Necromunda</a> and Vapia. Armageddon is too vital a world to have fall to the Orks, and any measures will be taken to keep the world under Imperial control.</p>
<p>As an interesting footnote, at almost the same time that the Orks made planetfall on Armageddon, a small 'splinter faction' of orks also made planet fall on the important agricultural backwater world Nou Fionaus. Only after a timely intervetion by Vapian troops of the Princess Marinis blessed 51st (PDF) and marines of the Salamanders chapter saved this 'foodstore for the system' (attributed from Commissiar Yarrick after a vital food run via rogue traders from Nou Fionaus saved the starving citizens of Hades Hive, C.M41)</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Games Workshop held a worldwide campaign for <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_40%2C000.html" title="Warhammer 40,000">Warhammer 40,000</a>, <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_40%2C000.html#3rd_Edition" title="Epic 40,000">Epic 40,000</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefleet_Gothic_2099.html" title="Battlefleet Gothic">Battlefleet Gothic</a>, where the results of battles could be sent in from all over the world. Each country or region corresponded to a location on the planet (for example, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> represented Hive Infernus, while the area around Helsreach Hive was fought over in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>).</p>
<p>A Codex was also released for the campaign, which included army lists for the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Guard_%28Warhammer_40%2C000_army%29_0e35.html#Armageddon_Steel_Legion" title="Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army)">Armageddon Steel Legion</a>, Ork Speed Freeks, and the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Templars_48d9.html" title="Black Templars">Black Templars</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamanders_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_6472.html" title="Salamanders (Warhammer 40,000)">Salamanders</a> Space Marine Chapters.</p>
