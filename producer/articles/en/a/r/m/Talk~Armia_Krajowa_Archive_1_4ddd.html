<p>Is this public domain text?</p>

<p>original text seem to be almost the same as MOTLC. While right now article seems to be enlarged, in section about relation of Jews one still can spot many similarities with <a href="http://motlc.learningcenter.wiesenthal.org/pages/t061/t06169.html" class="external free" title="http://motlc.learningcenter.wiesenthal.org/pages/t061/t06169.html" rel="nofollow">http://motlc.learningcenter.wiesenthal.org/pages/t061/t06169.html</a> <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 16:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AK's Jewish relations</span></h2>
<p>Just a small comment about AK's Jewish realtions...</p>
<p>............................................................................</p>
<p>"The AK accepted only a few Jews (about one thousand) into its own ranks: it generally turned down Jewish applicants. " ............................................................................</p>
<p><br />
I think the main point is that AK was generally anti-communist organization and most of Jews were associated with communist movements. So there you go. It's not that AK wasn't accepting Jews - Jews would not join AK. And the once that did were not communists. Everyone who watched "Pianist" must remember that Jewish guy that initiated the Ghetto Uprising. There was a comment about him in the movie ... "he is a good man, he was in the army, the only thing I can have against him is that he is not a communist ..." --- Actually there was also fear, that Jew being member of AK was in double danger and could be potential danger to fellow conspirators - so I read, at least. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a></p>
<p><a name="More_on_AK_and_Jews" id="More_on_AK_and_Jews"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">More on AK and Jews</span></h2>
<p>The AK was anti-Communist but their refusal to deal with Jews had more to do with innate Polish anti-Semitism and the weakness of Jewish resistance than it did with the fact that a number (though not all) of Jewish resistance members were left wing. A a prime example of this is seen in the document <a href="http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/about_holocaust/documents/part2/doc140.html" class="external text" title="http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/about_holocaust/documents/part2/doc140.html" rel="nofollow">Response of the Commander of the AK to the Jewish Request for Arms</a>.</p>
<p><br />
<b>innate anti-Semitism</b>&#160;??? What a stupidity. Millions of Jews living in Poland for centuries, developing their culture, being protected by polish kings - while in whole Europe exiled, murdered, persecuted and... flying to Poland to living save life... For sure, Poles are <b>innate anti-Semits</b>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, is lack of arms equal to anti-Semitism? I don't have a gun at home either - am I an anti-Semite? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 12:37, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There were conflicts between desperated hiding Jews and local population and partizan troops (also AK). There were also several Jewish "partizans" committing crimes. Why to pretend nothing happened?</dd>

<p><i>As well AK killed lots of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanians.html" title="Lithuanians">Lithuanian</a> civilians in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a>, because the planned Polish state would have included the mentioned region, therefore Lithuanian minority (or majority at some places of it) was unneeded to Poles.</i></p>
<p><i>There was a large Lithuanian minority in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilno_Voivodship_82d6.html" title="Wilno Voivodship">Wilno Voivodship</a> (see <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> for details) and at some places they constitued majority. Relations between Poles and Lithuanians were strained during almost all <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interwar_period.html" title="Interwar period">interwar period</a> due to the conflict over <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/v/Suvalkai_region.html" title="Suvalkai region">Suvalkai region</a>. Armia Karajowa wanted to recreat Polish state including the Vilnius region, and therefore killing Lithuanians there was according to it's agenda; as well these killings happened because of general hatred towards Lithuanians cause of decades-long conflict, which was as well fueled by some actions certain Lithuanian nazi collaborators did. Therefore AK used to murder Lithuanian civilians in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a>; Lithuanian people remembers them in a very bad light and claims that they used to come to Lithuanian farmsteads and kill whole families of Lithuanians including children and elder people. Polish historians however tends to tone down the involvement of Armia Kraiowa in these massacres.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it is true, I tried to write it as neutral as possible, by citing Polish historians point of view as well, and also the allegetions of Lithuanian collaboration with nazis. There was a documentary movie on this recently; appearently it was covered in some Polish newspaper called "Gazeta Wyborcza" too in case you want the info in native language - however, mentioned newspaper presented Polish point of view which downplayed the events, but still recognised that they happened. Everyone agrees that Armia Krajowa killed Lithuanian civilians, however it is the ammount which is disputed, some recognises just a few massacres (usually that is Polish point of view), while some Lithuanian historians tend to claim that AK supposedly did genocide of Lithuanians. You can also read more on this at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Lithuania_ee0e.html" title="History of Lithuania">History of Lithuania</a>, <a href="../../../w/w/2/WW2_6b83.html" title="WW2">WW2</a> section. Appearently, massacre at Dubingiai is recognised by Poles (I didn't added that line to that article), while other massacres are disputed.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 22:21, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This comment is much more reasoned than your original contribution to the article, which struck me as somewhat unbalanced. Indeed there is no denying that the war years in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Eastern Poland were especially brutal, almost approaching a state of a war of all against all in the forests where partisans and bandits of all stripes tried to survive. Innocent and not so innocent people were being killed for all kinds of reasons, with no national group being blameless. So it follows logically that some of these crimes were committed by Polish groups.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, accusing Armia Krajowa of conducting a conscious policy of genocide is taking things to a whole new level. I have not yet read any serious book which would support this accusation. If you have some specific sources which support this claim, please provide specific citations and we can continue a discussion. Citing "some article in Gazeta Wyborcza" is not specific enough. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 00:55, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not accused Armia Krajowa of genocide in my updates to the article; only mentioned those accusations in my entry to the talk page, as some Lithuanians claim there was genocide. To the article I posted a neutral view however. However, if we will not find sources on this we would agree on neutrality, we could post both Lithuanian and Polish opinions and on where they agree/is enough evidence. I don't speak Polish so I cannot search for Polish articles, but here are some Lithuanian sources: <a href="http://www.politika.lt/index.php?cid=693&amp;new_id=1456" class="external free" title="http://www.politika.lt/index.php?cid=693&amp;new_id=1456" rel="nofollow">http://www.politika.lt/index.php?cid=693&amp;new_id=1456</a> , <a href="http://www.studentuera.lt/?s0=pramogzin&amp;s1=tv&amp;item=1400" class="external free" title="http://www.studentuera.lt/?s0=pramogzin&amp;s1=tv&amp;item=1400" rel="nofollow">http://www.studentuera.lt/?s0=pramogzin&amp;s1=tv&amp;item=1400</a> - those are about mentioned documentary movie and about statements of interviewed Lithuanians from <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> who remembered actions of Armia Krajowa. The film itself was called "Armija Krajova Lietuvoje. Istorijos akligatvis" ("Armia Krajowa in Lithuania: History's Road Without Exit"). It was easy to find those and more by Google, so you could type Polish words for Armia Kraiowa and massacre and Lithuania, or Armia Krajowa and mentioned town names, and such, and you should be able to find information - probably Polish info will tell there were no major massacres, but still, the fact of this discution and such should be mentioned somewhere in polish too. And western sources might be very hard to find because this is more or less a local issue, and there were lots of various larger violence during WW2.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 12:42, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, I tried "armia krajowa masakra litwa" and got 13 hits, none of them having anything to do with what you are alleging. So the approach of "proving your case through a Google search" does not work that well in this case.</dd>
<dd>Given that you have given no sources that readers of English Wikipedia could understand or easily obtain, could you at least translate from Lithuanian the two articles the links to which you have given and post this translation here. Otherwise, I don't see what the point of further discussion is.</dd>

<dd>Finally, you did accuse Armia Krajowa of trying to exterminate the Lithuanian minority in the Wilno region, which does sound like genocide to me. But then your definition of genocide might be different. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 18:40, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Journalist Rimas Bružas says that with his movie "Armia Kraiowa (AK) in Lithuania: The History's Road without exit" he wanted to make more historian discutions, which would objectively decide on the actions of this controversial partisan army</p>
<p>"My goal was to raise historian discution, which, I hope, will start from this. If people made decitions, I am glad that they watched film instead of just watching into screen" - R. Bružas told ELTA in Monday, while commenting reactions towards the documentary film about AK actions in Vilnius region during World War 2, which was shown yesterday on TV3.</p>
<p>According to author of film, comments on internet and Polish media shows that supposedly people are getting into history without knowing real facts</p>
<p>"Without knoing history we cannot go forward. We do not question current Polish-Lithuanian relations. The biggest disappointment araises from the fact that historians of both nations uses same documents but makes different conclusions" - journalist told</p>
<p>He said that AK actions up till today is hard but still actual question, that's why the movie was taken with so much reaction. But discutions on this topic supposedly are needed now already, without waiting until "the witnesses will die and documents will rot". R. Bružas irronised "probably about Grunwald battle we should have started to speak only now also".</p>
<p>According to Polish daily "Gazeta Wyborcza" correspondent in Vilnius Jacekas Komaras (Jacek Komar) it was accentated in movie that AK was doing genocide of Lithuanians. One of interviewed expert was supposedly anti-Polish Kazimieras Garšva, chairman of "Vilnija" friendship. This organisation once did public court of AK, which decided that AK in Vilnius region did genocide of Lithuanians.</p>
<p>[Also it is objected that] In the film only the victims of these partisans were interviewed, but not AK veterans, Polish historians, or person of Povilas Plechavičius army, which was made by Germans against AK and Soviet Partisans.</p>
<p>At the end of almost hour-long movie the chairwoman of Lithuanian People Genocide and Resistance center said that there is not enough evidence to show that AK really did it all on purposes of genocide, however her personal opinion is that it was really done to purify Vilnius region. As R. Bružas himself informed, about 500 Lithuanians were killed by AK.</p>
<p>J. Komar for ELTA said that he disagrees with such history interpretation and thinks it should have been more objective about AK actions. Also, supposedly historians should make a stand and not journalists.</p>
<p>According to R. Bružas, AK veterans refused to talk to the creators of film. However, he said that he avoided subjectiveness and only supported the film on documments, witnesses' testimonies and historians' words.</p>
<p>Film was shown just after two days after official visit of Aleksandras Kvasnievskis (Aleksander Kwasniewski), President of Poland, to Lithuania. During the visit it was spoken much about friendly relations of two states. J. Komar did not rejected the possibility, that the film was supposedly ordered by some interested political power.</p>
<p>"It is strange, that there is so much paranoia in people about the influence of Moscow or Russia. It is absurd" - said R. Bružas - "A date for film was set randomly, it was postponed many times. Those who see a conspiracy theory here are wrong". ELTA</p>

<dd>Thank you for the translation. It is interesting, but it looks to me - so far - as a view of distanct minority (or an uncharted scientific territory, which however falls under the rule Wikipedia is not the place for orginal research). I am still looking for any printed sources, preferably from academic journals (online one can write anything...). From the sources I saw so far I would say that AK likely killed at best several dozens Lithuanians - hardly a genocide. A single (?) massacre, perpatrated by some local unit, without any orders from above - sure, an important tragedy, but it looks rather like an exception then the rule. As a sidenote, how many Lithuanians were killed by Nazis (Gestapo, etc.) and Soviets (NKVD, etc.)? --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a> 20:09, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the translation. I like this article, it seems reasonable and balanced. I am glad to see that even in Lithuania there is a reasonable debate about the role of Armia Krajowa, and the issue it not clearly settled yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is interesting to see that the article estimates the total number of Lithanians killed by Armia Krajowa at 500. This establishes the scale of the phenomenon. It also explains why it is so difficult to find information about it. The deaths of five hundred people during a war with millions of victims in Eastern Europe might not seem to be worth the attention of most historians. Just at <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paneriai.html" title="Paneriai">Paneriai</a> in the Vilnius region about 100,000 Jews, Poles and others were executed.</dd>

<p>Added the portion to article, tried to neutralise it even more. As for Piotrus's remarks, yes, there were more Lithuanians killed by nazis and Soviets of course, but I don't think that makes this information any less valuable. In comparement to other WW2 kills, 500 people is not much, but, however, wikipedia should provide info on general importance, not relative importance, therefore this info IMO qualifies as important, same as would be e.g. a mention of organisation which (allegedly) killed 500 Jews or Poles.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 08:02, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As it was said previously, probably this number of deaths is too small iin the context of WW2 to b emany info about it, especially as internet connections number in Lithuania neither general English knowledge is good enough to get many opinions. I cited the article, and yes, some called the film provocation, especially poles, but as it was also mentioned in the article I translated above, there were previous accusing son Armia Krajowa about this too. Of course, Poles named them all to be anti-Polish; however the fact is that these discutions exist. I did not said in artcile that it WAS so; appearently, only one massacre is with evidence, and Poles I talked to agreed with that. However, all other deaths are disputed, which is what I said in my edits of article. There are people and witnesses who claims that they happened however. And R. Bružas was collecting information for this movie for 4 years, he has done other historical documentary films too about various events of history, so it is not like he would be some simple provocator. As far as I understand, only the number of civilians was given there, as that was the topic of Bružas film; you can read the context in the article I translated above. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 18:01, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still find the mention of the word <b>genocide</b> in the article disturbing. Even if we take the most generous estimate of the numbers killed, which is 500, that is much less than 1% of the Lithuanian minority in the Wilno region at the time. If Armia Krajowa really wanted to exterminate that minority, as the article suggests, they sure were not very efficient in going about it. According to Wikipedia, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">Genocide</a> means deliberate mass murder of civilians. Does the killing of 500 people over the course of about 4 years, tragic and reprehensible though it obviously is, qualify as genocide? And this in the middle of occupation and war which killed millions in the region during the same years?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to see some clear argument for the use of the word genocide given the relatively small numbers of people killed. The argument that "some historians claim this" is not sufficient for me. Surely we can all think for ourselves here. If some Lithuanian historians want to insist on the word genocide, to me this is only an illustration of their biases, prejudices and professional incompetence, which does not need to be exhibited on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 18:59, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There might have been more than 500, this is just Bružas's estimation, and estimation son this matter differs by much. I am not sure, but maybe those who accuses AK of genocide "found out" bigger estimations. Also genocide i sprobably meant rather to describe deliberate killing of some group/nation/religion and is not so much related to numbers. But I agree that it might seem not neutral, so I removed word genocide now and changed it with explaination instead. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 19:07, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The problem is... that until now, you have not presented any serious sources only informations from one documentary film, which is considered as controversial in Poland and in Lithuania.</p>
<p>In the context of "Relations with Lithuanians" - You also forget to write more about the Lithuanian Police and Lithuanian military units (like that of Povilas Plechaviczius), Lithuanian Schutz-Staffel (SS) Legion etc. which murdered (together with Germans) AK-Soldiers and civilians.--<a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitkacy_80e6.html" title="User:Witkacy">Witkacy</a> 19:41, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't wrote names/leaders of all organisations as well, you never can write all the info and such; besides, there was no Lithuanian SS division, there were plans to create one but certain Lithuanian military leaders did not want this and avoided this by closing down certain then autonomous local units when the possibility of them to be integrated into SS and other German units arose. Your mention of Lithuanian SS kinda debunks your credibility however. But I did mentioned the organisations' actions in article: <b>which was supposedly further spurred by actions of certain Lithuanian military units which were fighting against AK and are also accused of killing civilians (therefore some of the AK actions might have been direct retalliations to actions of these groups, or to actions of Lithuanian collaborators; and vice-versa - some of actions of these groups were done as retalliation for AK actions).</b> . I cannot access Polish sources myself as I don't speak Polish, however you might ask user Lysy, he is Polish and he said he has such sources. I found info in Lithuanian that Polish historians says 20-27 and Lithuanian historians 200 however. Also it is mentioned i article <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubingiai.html" title="Dubingiai">Dubingiai</a>, which was not created by me (you can see in history that I haven't done any edit there), and some other places of wikipedia, also not by me.

<p>Unfortunately, it doesnt seems that IMDB would include new Lithuanian films, even such famous film as Vienui Vieni doesnt has it's article. But do you really doubt the existance of film itself? Polish links were also guven by Witkacy which confirms existance of the film. It is not an orginal resaearch my part of article, I just cited Bružas's investigation as source because if it wouldn't be cited, people would doubt where the 500 figure is from. If you'll know any other sources, e.g. would find some Polish historian's article who would claim that only for example 30 civilians were killed by AK, you would be welcome to add it also nearby as another source. My goal isn't to create any biased things, but rather to provide more info, and that AK is controversial in Lithuania is a fact, the articles, the fact that such movie was created and that there were controversial reactions towards it, etc. prooves it too. I try to write down reasons for this controversy and such. There also was a book by A. Bubnys about Armia Krajowa in Lithuania (info about it here <a href="http://news.mireba.lt/ml/191/rytu_L.htm" class="external free" title="http://news.mireba.lt/ml/191/rytu_L.htm" rel="nofollow">http://news.mireba.lt/ml/191/rytu_L.htm</a> ). This book is not controversial like film so if I'll have time I'll translate this too maybe, as it provides some info about Dubingiai massacre too. Unfortunately, due to lack of internetisation of Lithuania probably, ISBN number is hard to find online. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 21:49, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also although I try my best to confirm what I say, I think it is wrong to ask for too much English evidence here, because it is a very local issue, neither Lithuania nor Poland aren't English-speaking as native language (and due to history, in both countries levels of people knowing English are lower than in western Europe I guess), any films or books about this issue, or newspaper articles would most likely be either in Lithuanian or Polish, and available just in those countries, therefore, (almost) no international opinions. That is one of the major points why it is needed in wikipedia however: we are probably creating the first English information about the issue in the internet; I hope it will be as neutral as possible. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 21:56, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, despite of what is your opinion about Lithuanians, they are not brainwashed or such, so as many people as many opinions. I personally heard both positive and negative opinions about this movie too, including when I was searching for info. However, the fact is that Polish newspaper chose negative opinion to recite - and Veidas is conservative magazine which is quite russophobic and frequently sees Russian provocations/conspiracy at things. I didn't wrote that source myself, just gave a link to it. The point of talk pages is to decide what is truth, so everything's discussable. Name of historian who decided that AK did genocide is Kazimieras Garšva, name of historian who wrote book on AK is A. Bubnys, etc. and I am quite sure if I'd speak Polish I'd find you information on Polish sources too. And book(s) (I believe there were three as I get three release dates, 1991, 1995 and 1999 at different places) have an ISBN number of course, just that, for now, I don't know it, but I'll see if I'll be able to find out more info. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 22:16, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">View from the Polish side</span></h3>
<p>Here is a link to an article with some information from the Polish viewpoint (<a href="http://www.opoka.org.pl/biblioteka/P/PS/plechavicius_order.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.opoka.org.pl/biblioteka/P/PS/plechavicius_order.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> link). It is an overview of relations between Poles and Lithuanians during the war. It also discusses the role of Armia Krajowa.</p>
<p>A very informative article, but here I will (roughly) translate only the relevant passage:</p>
<p><i>There exists only one documented case where Armia Krajowa members responded with murder on Lithuanian civilians, in retaliation for the murder of Polish civilians. This happened in the Lithuanian village of Dubinki, whose inhabitants were killed in retaliation for the killing by Lithuanians of the Polish inhabitans of the village Glinciszki. These incidents have been acknowledged as criminal and condemned recently by representatives both of Poles and Lithuanians.</i></p>
<p><i>Except for this one case - which at any rate was not in accordance with the policies of Armia Krajowa High Command but was an initiative "from below" by the local unit commander - Armia Krajowa never acted against Lithuanian civilians or national independence organisation. However, it did fight against those who collaborated with Soviet and German occupiers. It sometimes happened that Lithuanians were victims of such actions. However, these cannot be considered anti-Lithuanian acts, as for example in the General Govenrment Armia Krajowa executed Poles guilty of such collaboration.</i> <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 00:38, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"This happened in the Lithuanian village of Dubinki, whose inhabitants were killed in retaliation for the killing by Lithuanians of the Polish inhabitans of the village Glinciszki."</p>
<hr />
<p>So..&#160;:)</p>
<ul>
<li>1) it was not a genocide on Lithuanians</li>
<li>2) it was a retaliation for murdered (about 40 people see: <a href="../../../i/p/n/IPN_bcc3.html" title="IPN">IPN</a> <a href="http://www.ipn.gov.pl/wp_przeglad_240204.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ipn.gov.pl/wp_przeglad_240204.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://www.cyberexpres.com/display.asp?id=1964&amp;thread=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cyberexpres.com/display.asp?id=1964&amp;thread=0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and PWN Encyclopedia <a href="http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/24687_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/24687_1.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/17965_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/17965_1.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) Poles in Glinciszki (killed by the Lithuanian Police - almost women and children <a href="http://pater.kul.lublin.pl/wystawy/vita_mutatur/2004/slawinska/irena_slawinska.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://pater.kul.lublin.pl/wystawy/vita_mutatur/2004/slawinska/irena_slawinska.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>)</li>
<li>3) it was an initiative by a local unit commander</li>
<li>4) The victims of Dubinki were Lithuanian policeman (Nazi-Collaborators) and their families (see above PWN Encyclopedia)</li>
<li>5) the action has nothing to do with the "conflict over Vilnius region" or "polonization"</li>
<li>6) is that of such importance? (1/6 of the AK-article is about the relations with Lithuanians..) but for example nothing about Ponary where 100 000 Poles and Jews were killed by Lithuanian police and German units.--<a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitkacy_80e6.html" title="User:Witkacy">Witkacy</a> 00:02, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article on Armia Krajowa is still in the "stub" stage so it is difficult to argue about lengths of various sections. Obviously relations with Lithuanians are a minor issue in the history of an organisation which counted hundreds of thousands of members all over Poland, and concerned itself primarily with fighting the Germans and resisting the Soviets. Still, there ought to be a section on the relatively uknown operations of Armia Krajowa in areas of Eastern Poland, where the Poles were not necessarily the overwhelming majority of the population, and hence to the conflict with the Nazi Germans was added the smaller but still significant conflict with other local nationalities. As part of that chapter, the Dubinki massacre should be mentioned, in a proper context. On the other hand, the way the article is now, this massacre and relations with Lithuanians in general are given too much prominence. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 00:38, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Witkacy - you just read Polish view and adopted that it is fully right, however, history is not like that and all views should be mentioned as Wikipedia is neutral; you cannot read just what you want to read. So, this massacre is the only one Poles admit, and that is mentioned in article, from Lithuanian side there are larger claims by historians I already mentioned. (K. Garšva, A. Bubnys), also, wherether it was intiated by local units or higher command is also doubted. I think the current way the part is written as neutral as possibkle, because both points of view are mentioned. The claims on numbers of deaths as well as who were killed is disputed too. What is disputed is mentioned in article as such and both views are given.</li>
<li>Balcer - I agree with you. Wikipedia articles cannot be written at once and yet that doesn't means they should be written starting from the most important parts; they are written from what the editors know. Full article about AK will include lots more info about other AK operations, while Relations to Lithuanians section probably won't be expanded much anymore, so the proportions will be different.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 05:41, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, there is quite much information about it in Lithuanian, I don't have time to translate everything however; but it is not discution here on who was right or such, or which facts are right. I think enough has been said to proove that both opinions exist (if you want more names, there is also Algimantas Liekis who claims about AKs attempts to disturb Lithuania's seeks for independence because then Lithuania would claim Vilnius region). In the article both sides are represented and both opinions. So I don't see much point in continuing this discution I guess. If you'll want to cite more sources, feel free to do so. If you have any suggestions on what exactly to correct on article, say them (e.g. as there was suggestion to remove word "genocide", which I did). Wikipedia however is not a place for one-sided articles, so it won't be so that only one side would be represented. If there are concerns that AK article is too negative, you might write more in it about some positive things and operations AK done. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 10:06, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, yet again, this opinion exists and is supported by quite much historians of Lithuania, and majority, even Polish historians, accepts that soemthing happened, tjust the scale and such is what is not agreed on. It is always easy to tell "that person is nazi", "that person is anti-something" and such, but these tellings are biased and does not makes information invalid, especially as many of it is based on documents, witnesses accounts and such. It'd be stupid if I'd just e.g. say that all Polish historians who says just one massacre happened are anti-Lithuanian; Wikipedia has NPOV policy, all views and possibilities should be mentioned. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 18:23, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, but it is not said as truth. I am not saying "AK collaborated with nazis" - this would be POV. I just said what historians and what investigations/books led to what decitions, this is normal as per Wikipedia rules. Nobody can say if the books are right or wrong, but what I said about those books is a fact. Instead of ranting or reverting, you could add similar Polish sources e.g. "But historian XY in his book "somename" claims that it was so and so") - this would be productive update. I written myself that Poles disagrees with this info and that there are other opinions, I gave examples of some, but I can't read in polish so it's up to other Wikipedia users to present more of those opinions with sources. Deleting of whole section you disagree with is not exactly Wikipedian way <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 18:39, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relations with Lithuanians 2</span></h2>
<p>There was a large <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanians.html" title="Lithuanians">Lithuanian</a> minority in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilno_Voivodship_82d6.html" title="Wilno Voivodship">Wilno Voivodship</a> (see <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> for details) and at some places they constitued majority. Relations between Lithuanians and Poles were strained during almost all <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interwar_period.html" title="Interwar period">interwar period</a> due to the conflict over <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/v/Suvalkai_region.html" title="Suvalkai region">Suvalkai region</a>. Armia Krajowa's ideas of Polish state included <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a>. Armia Krajowa committed at least one massacre of Lithuanian civilians, including women and children, at <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubingiai.html" title="Dubingiai">Dubingiai</a> (Polish historians claims 20-27 as number of kills, Juozas Lebionka claims 100, some other Lithuanian historians claims 200). The scale of other killings is not agreed on also. There is an estimation of investigator Rimas Bružas of about 500 killed Lithuanian civilians overally, estimation of Juozas Lebionka says 1000; some Polish historians claims there were no other masscares except one at Dubingiai. Many of the opinions are supported by AK documents found in Bernardinai monastery, which describes AK actions between 1943 and 1944; however, some very differing opinions are based on same documents. What is also not agreed on is the reason for these killings: some historians tends to accuse Armia Krajowa of seeking to lower the number of Lithuanians in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> for purposes of further polonization of region. Other historians tends to claim that the killings were not a planned thing, and were more related to general dislike of Lithuanians by some people in AK ranks, which was supposedly further spurred by actions of certain Lithuanian military units which were fighting against AK and are also accused of killing civilians (therefore some of the AK actions might have been direct retalliations to actions of these groups, or to actions of Lithuanian collaborators; and vice-versa - some of actions of these groups were done as retalliation for AK actions). Some historians claim, based on same documents, that the fight between Lithuanian militants and AK was purposefully spurred by nazis by giving weaponry to both sides (sources: book Armia Krajowa in Lithuania, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9986577292</a> ). Cause of these reasons AK, despite of it's actions in saving Poles of Vilnius, same as Soviet partisans, are considered to be controversial organisations in today's Lithuania. ---</p>
<p>Moved everything deleted from article by user Witkacy from the main article back there, as it was already agreed here by themajority as far as I understand that the relations are worth mentioning. Now I written it as neutraly as possible, by providing different opinions with different sources. If you <i>know</i> any other sources and other, yet unmentioned, opinions, please tell them, they will be added too. If you don't however, and just remove the portion because it doesn't fits with your point of view, then that shouldn't be done, it's a disruption. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 18:19, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The above text is written in a very poor English and I am afraid it needs to be rewritten to be understandable - thus it cannot be included in our present article. On the other hand, I would like to stress here that I agree with DearYassin and Balcer that *some* note of this must be included in the text. I dont think that the above text is accepable. Besides being poor English, it contains too many weasel words: 'many, some, other historians'. References collected above are a good start and should be used to source every accusation in the above text. We also need Polish references. There should also be an explanation of why this matter is controversial. I won't have time to do much on Wiki until 3rd May, so I will constribute to our discussion here afterwards. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a> 18:57, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I agree with you that it needs more Polish references and that my English is not good. I hope you will be able to find/provide those references and will correct some of the things. I say "some Polish historians" because I do not know who exactly, it should be easier for you to find as you know Polish. I would like to invite everybody to contribute positive changes to this article, I mean, providing more sources and such. And there is no factual inacurracies in the article now BTW: I did not written in the article something like "AK dealt with nazis" or "AK massacred many Lithuanians", but just say what some people said, and it is truth that they said that. If it would be written in article that e.g. some early US presidents made racistic remarks, it would be truth, but it wouldn't mean that blacks really are as these remarks would say or such. And you <b>can</b> and <b>if you know, should</b> add more information about Polish opinion. But both opinions can and should (as Wikipedia is neutral) coexist, there is no need to delete Lithuanian opinion either as that would be POV. I hope after May 3rd this article will get better, or that someone else will improve it and neutralise it even more before that <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 19:04, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quality of English is not that much of a problem, as it can be easily improved by other editors. I have a problem with the whole style: Professor X on the Lithuanian side said this, professor Y on the Polish side said that. This approach misses the point of Wikipedia and misuderstands the nature of the NPOV idea, in my opinion. The point is not to list opposing and sometimes extreme views in parallel, but rather to hammer out some kind of compromise.</dd>

<dd>DeirYassin, I notice than in your approach you often list a bunch of opinions, and then you cover yourself with the disclaimer that these are not necessarily your views. This makes arguing with you somewhat frustrating. Please, why don't you simply write what <b>YOU</b> think? You have read the sources, you understand the issues, trust yourself. Wikipedia is created by <b>users</b> themselves, not users assembling the opinions of others and listing them without any judgement as to their quality. If you do this, we can have an argument with <b>you</b>, and not some Lithuanian historians we unfortunately never heard of and cannot read. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 19:19, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually do write my opinion most of ime, same was here previously, and I think it was more neutral maybe. Now however I was asked for more sources and such at this article, so now I tried my best to write only somone else's opinion and thought this way it wouldn't be disputed that much as I didnt claimed that any opinion is truth. I think maybe references could be deleted, and e.g. it could just say something like "up to 1000 Lithuanians died" (or maybe average 500 figure) "20-200 Civilian Lithuanians killed in Dubingiai depending on various claims". But well, then, yet again, some people will say that this is without evidence or without source, that is why I included it into article. I hope eventually decition will be reached and they could be removed or written separately bellow article. Why I posted even articles I dont agree with is that I was asked for references from various historians and who thinks what by Piotrus; I provided what I was asked for. I have some doubts myself over some things however, e.g. AK and nazi relations, but well, if these views are used to support things in article, then they all should be fully mentioned. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 19:35, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The following is my opinion and I do not say that it should be icnluded in article, I say it just because I was asked to. In my opinion it is naive to think that during those years, which were violent in general, AK did not kill any or almost any civilians. As for numbers, I'd think myself that 500 might be most realistic maybe, given the existing documents, witnesses accounts and such. As for reasons I think myself basically what was written previously in article, that it was spurred by general dislike between Poles and Lithuanians especially in the Vilnius region at the time so therefore there (IMO) were violence towards Lithuanian civilians more than towards other civilians. Which was maybe attributed by knowing that some Lithuanians fight against AK, and therefore e.g. if Lithuanians kills some AK fighter their friends might have attacked Lithuanians at some village. Now there exists evidence also taht AK wanted to attach Vilnius to liberated Poland. I don't know however if that was orders from above or actions of some local units or orders from some local leaders - very hard to say here (I think however that later two are more likely. Maybe it was some generic order from high command like not to allow Lithuanians to take too much control in the area, which was interpreted this way by some local leaders or units - again, this is just my guess, Im not claiming it was so), I think different opinions should be given at some places where they differ much by both sides, because well, we are 4 or 5 people here discussing it, and some of opinions shared by considerable number of people might not be supported by any of us but that does not make them less viable. And, yet again, this was my personal opinion. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 07:25, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general the reason why I am reluctant to post my own opinion because that contradicts Wikipedia's rules as I understand, it is original research. We are not discussing here who is right, I am quite sure we wouldn't ever reach compromise on this because opinions and claims are simply too different; instead, we are discussing on what to put in the article. And article can represent several opinions too in cases where opinions are too different to *merge* them, in those cases it is more NPOV to leave a few opinions I'd guess. But that is my opinion lol.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 08:42, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comment. Now we can have a more reasonable discussion, hopefully. First, the numbers of victims. In situations like this, these are often very difficult to establish to the satisfaction of both sides. For now, I would have no problem with a compromise listing the claims of Polish and Lithuanian historians as to the number killed side by side. Of course this is subject to verification, if the Lithuanian historians you are quoting turn out to be unreliable or extreme in their views. This is the problem: we who don't speak Lithuanian and don't follow Lithuanian historiography have a great deal of difficulty in determining which of them are reliable and which are not. Just so that I don't seem to be picking on Lithuanians, I can only tell you that I consider some Polish "historians" to be highly unreliable or very heavily biased.</dd>

<dd>Still, I am puzzled. You write <i>I don't know however if that was orders from above or actions of some local units or orders from some local leaders</i>. To me and most likely the other editors involved here, the notion that the Armia Krajowa High Command ordered the extermination of the Lithuanian minority in the Vilno region is totally incredible and highly offensive. This is probably the main reason why the disputed tag has been attached. Given that nobody involved in this discussion strongly believes such an "ethnic cleansing" was ordered from above, we should not be including this view in the discussion. I have made the necessary change, which reflects what seems to be a concensus view here.</dd>

<dd>As I said afterwards, that IMO other two theories were more likely than the first one (other two being local ruler's decition or decition of particular soldiers/groups of soldiers), so maybe it is ok to remove that then. As for historians, I put the estimations which I could fin donline, being 500 and 1000 for whole killings, and 100 to 200 in Dubingiai. As for Kazimieras Garšva, from what I heard about him from other places, he is accused by Poles of being anti-Polish sometimes, but these estimations are not from him. Maybe I think Bružas would be the most reliable of those (just in my opinion), because it is most known and also did other such investigations of historical events and said he was going through documents and witnesses and such for 4 years, and he's quite known independent journalist. But that is just my opinion of course. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 19:16, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AK is NOT "the largest underground resistance army during WWII"</span></h2>
<p>This statement, "The Home Army, the largest underground resistance army during World War II, formed the armed wing of what subsequently became known as the "underground state", is not true. The most eminent, well-known underground resistance army, which operated during WWII is the Yugoslavian National Liberation Army or People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (see the article at in Wiki, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisans_%28Yugoslavia%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisans_%28Yugoslavia%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisans_%28Yugoslavia%29</a>, and at least the external reference herein). The estimate of real guerillas (not just the elusive "membership", used in that "article" ) is app. 300 thousands at the end of 1943 and app. 600 thousands at the end of 1944. Of course, the real deeds of the YNLA and its role are incomparable with that of the Armia Krajowa (with is, besides, not a monolith organization, as claimed in the sentence "resistance army"). If not take the definitions too strictly, the partisans of Belarus, could be thought a resistance army, however based not on national(istic) grounds. The number of real figters in Belarus (1944) was 143 thousands and 250 thousands of reserve (123 thousands of them were armed). Of course, their activity (estimated 500 000 nazi troops and collaborates were shot-up) again incomparable with that of the AK, especially if one compares the population of the countries (data from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Soviet_Encyclopedia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Soviet_Encyclopedia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Soviet_Encyclopedia</a>). The activity, relative number of real fighters and the role of the Greek guerillas are (personal opinion) also exceeds that parameters of AK. Please, authors of that article, check the data and correct the alleged sentence.</p>
<p>Yes, and a short subjective after-word: most poles I have met in my life (except few, but very notable exceptions) were not able to control their "national arrogance" towards all other nations, and couldn't be sober rating their history. I am sorrow, that the venerable Wiki suffers from "historians" of that kind (I meant most articles, considering Polish history). IB</p>
<dl>
<dd>Activity of partisans in Belarus is sometimes very exxagerated, especially when you are reading either soviet or basing on soviet sources (I've read many satyrical jokes bsaed on this: usually many of those "partisan" activities included robbing local populations and attacking AK units, which then they exxagerated as fighting with fascist - great example are things like great victory at Koniuchy, where, few dozens of nazi collaborators, such as children and woman, were shot - especially that number: half million of Axis soldiers! Wow! I wonder why I've never spot that figure in any other source!). I don't know enough about guerillas in Greece to comment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for our national arrogance, why, it is mainly because we Poles were have God-given right to be sober and arrogant. And seriously, I have met on usenet many English, French and others and I couldn't lose the feeling that they all are arrogant&#160;!@!$#@ who are treating me like white Europeans were treating blacks in Africa in XIX century. WOw! It talks! It's hard not to develop some thick-skin in such circumstances.</dd>
<dd>But you are probably right about YNLA so I will change the sentence to "one of biggest resistance movements". And BTW AK was the army. Hence the name. Armia Krajowa. Home Army. Legally considered armed forces of Polish-government-in-exile in Poland.</dd>

<dd>As a footnote to what Szopen wrote (well said, pal), probably YLA and the Home Army had similar numbers, I can't judge which had more members at which point. However, it is to be noted that the Ak was nowhere near that successful in liberating its own territory. Mostly because the Yugoslav resistance did not have to fight the Soviets as well, but still the fact remains that the Tito's partisans were far more successful in 1944 and 1945. Whether stronger in numbers - I don't know. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 14:01, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. MOVEMENT, but not army - it was became an army only in '44, but the article claims that it is functioned as army from '39. Explain, how AK as army was active before '44 (in other words except Operation Tempest) againist the nazi troops. This explanation is very important for the whole article and it is now missing. Without such explanations the number of 150 000 shot-up nazi troops is highly unreliable, because of very short actual time span - half year only)</p>
<dl>
<dd>AK was the army. Examples of activity: Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (fights of one unit inside ghetto, actions on bonifraterska (sp?) etc. Since 1943 it organised partisan units. Despite, AK would still be army EVEN if it had not made any military actions. Army does not cease being army just because it's not active in some period of time, isn't it? It was army because it was officially called army, because it's member had officers, subofficers, because officers and subofficers were trained, because all members were swearing military oath and had military commander responsible to Polish government-in-exile <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 11:56, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Perhaps calling it a 'partisan army' would clarify the matter? --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 13:54, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3. "undeground state" could be included only as a particular specification, tied to the more known concept. Again, for NPOV, you should do a reference to Armia Ludowa (associated with the liftish forces, the moral clients of the USSR), and create that article (including the communication between AK and AL). The lack of knowlege about the real deeds of the AK except Operation Tempest and about its evolution is the serious defects of the article. The wlole article is seriously "POV-ed" from national (in other words internal) point of view (sorry for calembour). I am not pole as the most people in the world and I am intersted in "external" point of view, which means the connection of AK to the overal political processes, its influence by the west etc. I recognize, that it is not so easy to change the POV globally, but it should be done. IB</p>
<dl>
<dd>AL activity was abysmal. AK did carried sabotage, had military intelligence, had propaganda unit (including sections dealing with sabotage and propaganda and intelligence INSIDE Germany - even in Berlin). AK usually did not enforce fighting since it was army, not bunch of armed bandits, hence it even ordered Hubal unit to disband because of repercursions it may cause to civilians. OTOH, AL didn't care about civialians. AK usually allowed actions which were direct reactions to Nazis activity (e.g. actions during deportations of Zamojszczyzna or fights with Ukrainians as reactions to Vohlyn massacres etc etc ). Operation Tempest is largest and best known AK action. Some of them, in Polish, are listed here&#160;: <a href="http://wilk.wpk.p.lodz.pl/~whatfor/." class="external autonumber" title="http://wilk.wpk.p.lodz.pl/~whatfor/." rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that htis list of 106 actions is just chosen: the same page informs us that KEDYW alone made at list 407 actions. Effects of those actions is close to 7.000 destroyed or damaged locomotives, 38 blowed up bridges, desoyted 28 aircrafts, more than 500 cars, more than 19.000 train cars _before_ the "Tempest". Some of AK duties were to fight armed bands, which were tolerated by Nazis, and which robbed and terrorised local population in some areas. Some of these bands were under nominal leadership of AL.<a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 11:56, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe all resistance movement besides AL were linked in main body, added link to AL article in See also. Also, noted in lead that AK was the dominant resistance movement in Poland. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 13:54, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As to the actual number of combat-ready partisan troops, it is extremely hard to judge. After 1939 there was a number of Polish Army units that were left behind the lines and simply found their reffuge in the forests. Other units were acting mostly as urban guerilla and were being prepared for an open conflict (see Operation Tempest). Yet other group of people (usually estimated at ca. 50.000 at the end of 1941), the co-called <i>leśni</i> (<i>forest people</i>) were mnostly composed of people who had to retreat to the forests because of Nazi and Soviet terror. They formed the core of the future army as they had to fight for their lives against German units (both Wehrmacht and SS). Among the best known examples of such activity was the Jodła inspectorate of the AK (<a href="../../../k/i/e/Kielce.html" title="Kielce">Kielce</a>-<a href="../../../r/a/d/Radom.html" title="Radom">Radom</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swietokrzyskie_Hills_71b5.html" title="Swietokrzyskie Hills">Swietokrzyskie Hills</a> area), where the countryside was effectively controlled by the AK back in 1943, while only the cities were held in German hands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, as pointed above, there were units of the Home Army that were conducting armed raids on German facilities and sabotage. These were not acting openly as the German retaliation would be too harsh for the civilians (collective responsibility...), but still had lots of successes in disrupting the German supply lines for the Eastern Front. Among such units was <a href="../../../k/e/d/Kedyw.html" title="Kedyw">Kedyw</a> and then <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wachlarz.html" title="Wachlarz">Wachlarz</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other thing is that there already is an article on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Secret_State_e351.html" title="Polish Secret State">Polish Secret State</a> and the very term does not seem POV at all to me. It's simply a historical name for quite a unique phenomenon in the scale of the world: a state without a territory, but with all institutions of a modern state, including press, courts, parliament, government, police, armed forces and so on. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 12:35, May 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think we should move it anywhere; maybe there could be a link to a "main article" like that, but that is only if somebody will write a more detailed information about AK in Lithuania, which would be too long to keep here. If we'd start creating new articles for every section, then nothing would remain in this article, e.g. AK relations with Jews, List of major operations and such would also go to new articles. But the usual practice is to write some info in main article, and if there is more info about that subject than create an additional article on that sub-subject with link from the subject article ("Main article: Armia Krajowa in Lithuania"). Now I think the disputed tag maybe could be removed and things left as is, because there weren't any discutions on this topic for a long time. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 13:53, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It is an account of a Lithuanian witness of how Vilnius was liberated by Armia Krajowa. First she describes of how they were hiding in the basement together with the Poles. Then a group of armed men with white-red bands appeared. They were looking for Lithuanian men. They found four. One of them was saved by the Polish women from the basement. The remaining 3 were shot on spot. Of course the witness could not be sure if the murders were from Armia Krajowa, but they were wearing Polish emblems and spoke Polish.

This was the single and sole case in AK history according to Roman Krab-Żebryk, a researcher of the subject quoted by Łossowski. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a>)</sup> 16:12, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

He also mentions that the Glinciszki massacre was an act of retaliation for the death of 4 Lithuanian policemen killed in action. He gives exactly the same numbers as Łossowski (39 and 27 respectively) and gives June 23rd as the date of Dubniki murder. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a>)</sup> 16:19, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>After such long discussion we have a very biased text, which even does not contain the word Glinciszki (Glitiškes).Lithuanians cooperated with Germans, I understand it partially, but it's not the reason to rewrite the history of WWII. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 10:56, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Lithuania collaborated with the Nazis and the Home Army acted for the Allies. What about Sauguma police and Ponary mass executions? The conflict cannot be reduced to national reasons. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 12:00, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A quote from the article: "This was supposedly further provoked by actions of some Lithuanian military units which were fighting against AK and who in turn were accused of murdering Polish civilians. Therefore some of the alleged AK actions might have been direct retaliation to the actions of Lithuanian groups, the police, or other Lithuanian Nazi collaborators". So it indeed mentions the influence of Lithuanian actions on AK actions and vice-versa (but not Ponary). Ponary, however, was commited primarilly by the Germans only with some aid of Lithuanian collaborators (see <a href="http://www.holocaustrevealed.org/_domain/holocaustrevealed.org/lithuania/lithuanian_history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.holocaustrevealed.org/_domain/holocaustrevealed.org/lithuania/lithuanian_history.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for example); it is not related to the events mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>Your source is about the Holocaust, it doesn't inform about non-Jewish victims. You even don't mention the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paneriai.html" title="Paneriai">Paneriai</a> article. If you have better data about the massacre, edit that article. The problems with Lithuanians deserve about 1% of the HA article. Either the section should be shortened or the whole article enlarged. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 07:32, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems the Paneriai article mentions it this way as well: "Between July 1941 and August 1944 Paneriai became the mass murder site of approximately 100,000 victims, the vast majority of them Jews, many from nearby Vilna. The executions were carried out by German units of SD and SS with help from local Lithuanian police unit Ypatingasis Būrys.". Indeed however, Armia Krajowa was more than organisation related to Jews or Lithuanians - but this does not means the sections should be shortened or deleted but, instead, it means that other sections should be expanded. I believe it is possible to write much more about the positive things the AK did. I am not in Poland nor Lithuania however and my ability to access various books on the topic is limited. The Polish members of Wikipedia, however, could indeed write more about AK history, AK operations, AK leadership and other related topics. <a href="../../../d/27/i/User%7ED%27Italia_0ba5.html" title="User:D'Italia">D'Italia</a> 07:47, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was not said that no Polish people were killed in Paneriai. It was said however that the majority (but not all) of those killed were Jews, that the main perpetrators of Paneriai were Germans rather than collaborators and that this is not related to the AK-perpetrated killings (unlike, for example, Glitiskes/Glinciszki, which is related it seems - though I know not much about that particular subject and I base my words only on what Lysy and Halibutt said above in this talk page) and therefore not related to this particular article.

<dd>We are talking about ethnicities here rather than citizenships; the Nazis repressed populations based on their ethnicity. Besides, talking about nationalities in this particular case is very difficult - fact is that in 1939 when Lithuania took control of Vilnius all the local population was given Lithuanian nationality (with the exception of those people who had come from the other parts of Poland during the interbellum, but this was a minority). <a href="../../../d/27/i/User%7ED%27Italia_0ba5.html" title="User:D'Italia">D'Italia</a> 19:37, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The author happends to be connected to KGB of course, despite being a respected scholar and the critical to Soviet accounts he gives in his book is just to help hide his connection.

<dd>In Eastern Poland/Western Ukraine/Belarus one had a strange situation where 4 forces were struggling against each other (Germans, Polish Home Army, Soviet Partisans and Belorusian/Ukrainian nationalists). In this unusual situation, it was to be expected that at various times two groups would enter into ad hoc, temporary local alliances to combat another group. This often happened even against explicit orders from higher command. The principle here was: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. It would be really surprising if such things did not happen. However, while this should be mentioned, it should be kept in the proper perspective. In Western Poland where the Poles were in the majority such local alliances with the Germans were almost unthinkable. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 22:02, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In western Poland annexed by the Reich there was not much of a choice. However, in central Poland such "alliances" did take place. In Holy Cross mountains cease fire agreements were quite common, not to mention Polish soldiers buying arms from the Wehrmacht. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a></dd>

<dd>Yes, of course there is an exception to every rule. But if I recall correctly, the really significant "alliance" was between the Germans and the <a href="../../../n/s/z/NSZ_4327.html" title="NSZ">NSZ</a>, not the Home Army, and it only developed in the final months of the war when things became very fluid and the Nazi state was collapsing. Of course it is quite likely that local partisan groups and local German forces reached various low-level "live and let live" understandings between themselves. Such often unspoken agreements naturally occur even between soldiers of professional armies, if they fight in static positions. As for buying arms from the Wehrmacht, that is in a different category altogether, of course. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 00:38, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As to what Halibutt wrote: Yes, and still I have no intention to write a separate project called "Collaboration between of the Home Army with the Nazis" and append it to the article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Poland_%281939%E2%80%931945%29&amp;diff=43754939&amp;oldid=43746213" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Poland_%281939%E2%80%931945%29&amp;diff=43754939&amp;oldid=43746213" rel="nofollow">sounds familiar, anyone?</a>). Similarly, at least for now, I have no intention to write a separate article on that, while it is certainly encyclopedic. I thought the passing mention of the issue with a ref is just exactly as much as is needed and chose to add a short sentence to the existing section which seemed to me the most appropriate one (Lithuania). I hope my addition, even if modified, would survive as well as the controversy about the relationship with Jews. Yes, the AK was not anti-Semitic, but some of its members were. Where all them just former NZS members who switched to AK? Possibly so. Do we need a paragraph or even a section on the murders of the Jews here? No! Not until someone wants to write an article on the issue out of the section.</p>
<p>I hope we are starting to build a tradition of <i>not</i> flooding the broad articles with a narrow details for a POV reasons and will all learn to choose the articles for the information appropriately (or, perhaps, that would stimulate us to start the narrow articles when there is none).</p>

<dd>It is problematic to find English articles on AK in Lithuania. This topic is too specific and not very interesting for the world. <i>Mokslo Lietuva</i> is an academic journal. Other ones cited are not academical. <i><a href="../../../v/o/r/Voruta.html" title="Voruta">Voruta</a></i> is a paper for Lithuanian history, <i>Atgimimas</i> is one of the most serious papers in Lithuania, <i>XXI amzius</i> has weakest journalists and I will avoid using its publications when possible. 1989 was last year of USSR, and Lithuania already had free press. <i>Atgimimas</i>, paper where it was published was the most popular proindependence paper, it was not under control of government. Besides , this particular article of 1989 is based on undergraund Antigerman Lithuanian paper <i>"Karinės ir politinės žinios"</i> (Military and Political News) of 1944, i.e. it republishes news of 1944. I cannot wait to lay my hands on book <i>AK in Lithuania</i>, where primary sources on AK activity in Lithuania are published. AK crimes in Lithuania is not controversial topic - there is consensus in Lithuanian historiography about that- terror and genocide is fact. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 22:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I find it really, really dubious that Germans would want to work with Polish extrimosts as early as 1941. In all of this we are also forgetting an important issue. In most cases the elements of AK that collaborated with Germans where in fact not mainstream AK but <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narodowe_Si%C5%82y_Zbrojne_a442.html" title="Narodowe Siły Zbrojne">Narodowe Siły Zbrojne</a>. NSZ, loyal to <i>endecja</i>, would certainly not be averse to fighting Lithuanians, and some of its units apparently operated with AK and/or were even intergrated into AK structures, thus when commiting attrocities this led to the generalization that it was AK doing them. Sigitas, could you check your sources if the make the distinction between AK and NSZ? While I am sure there were cases of AK commiting violent acts against the Lithuanians, I think the article should clearly state whether this was an exception or the rule.

<dd>1) <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazeta_Wyborcza_c249.html" title="Gazeta Wyborcza">Gazeta Wyborcza</a> (a fairly respected Polish newspaper - but not academic source), Feb'01, <i>Litewska prokuratura przesłuchuje weteranów AK</i> (Lithuanian prosecutor questioning AK veterans): Some Lithuanian <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonia.html" title="Polonia">Polonia</a> cites this as an example of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipolonism.html" title="Antipolonism">antipolonism</a>. A representant of the veterans (who were questioned as witnesses, not as accused) said that they were civil but he resents the accusations (they were questioned about whether they fought with and killed L.). It seemed to be one of many investigations related to the IIWW. Polish ambassador and Lithuanian prosecutor seemed to have reached common ground quickly when L.p. annouced they will investigate a matter of <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glinciszki_massacre.html" title="Glinciszki massacre">Glinciszki massacre</a>, where Lithuanian partistants killed 38 Polish civilians for the 'crime' of collaboration with AK. Their talks were condemned by <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnija.html" title="Vilnija">Vilnija</a> organization who demands that AK be prosecuted for their crimes. Polish historian <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaros%C5%82aw_Wo%C5%82konowski_7629.html" title="Jarosław Wołkonowski">Jarosław Wołkonowski</a> replied that Vilnija wants to divert attention from Lithuanian police (<a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauguma.html" title="Sauguma">Sauguma</a>) which collaborated with Germans during the IIWW. Vilnija presented a list of 238 cases where AK supposedly murdered Lithuanians. Wołkonowski replies that less then 100 were indeed killed by AK, rest were murdered by Soviet partisants or other groups. Other issues are mentioned, including the comment of a Vilnija spokesman that Polish assasins loyal to AK still operate in Lithuania and their threats are one of the reasons he cannot divulge the identities of many of the people who provided him with his information. Wołkonowski stresses there was no organized action by AK against L.'s and any acts were exceptions to the rule. Volnija spokesman replies that all Polish historians are biased and they will obviously deny AK crimes. The article also mentions that Lithuanian view of AK has been twisted by the propaganda of organizations like Vilnija. A Lithuanian historian Arunas Bubnys admits that there were no mass murders by AK (the only exception being <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubinki.html" title="Dubinki">Dubinki</a>), but that AK was guilty of some war crimes against individuals or selected families; however any accusations of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> or widespread actions are false and have an underlying political motive, admiting that one of the motives can be a countereaction to the accusations of widespread German-Lithuanian collaboration. Another Lithuanian historian, Dalia Kuodyte, notes that some new documents indeed give a basis to said that some elements in AK had planned to 'delithuanize Vilnius', however as far as AK actions are concerned in reality we have seen only sporadic excesses not sanctioned by AK main command. That's the end of my summary of article 1): long, but it was an interesting reading.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:42, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am getting tired, so I'll note just a few points: the article is a critique of the decoration by above mentioned general PP by L. president Pakas. It notes that some of the Lithuanians murdered by AK were German collaborators, thus their murder was not directed against L. but against G.

<p>Continuing our discussion of the text, I am not happy with the following part: "In 1995 in Vilnius was found archive of Armia Krajowa for Vilnius Region, and copy of archive was donated to Poland.

This is rather weaselish, as it does not answer the questions: 1) found by whom? 2) was it published in Lt? 3) donated to who, exactly? Government? University? Person? Finally, this seems to create an impression that the info was supressed in Poland.

<dd>While I have become aware of the PP existance only yesterday, a brief examination of the available sources indicates to me that he was indeed a collaborator. He worked under the command of Nazi Germany, his forces were engaged in the battles against the enemies of Nazis (Soviets, Polish resistance). How else can we refer to him? Considering he was a military man perhaps an 'ally' would be a better term, just as the forces of Vichy, Mussolini, many Balkan countries and such. Certainly his later break up with the Nazis and turning against them is significant and I would not oppose to amending it in the text to reflect the fact that he fought against them later.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 19:11, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LLD most apparently didn't disobey the German orders for the first months of their operation. The organization was initially created with German official approval. It is also very likely that the organziation received suport (money, arms) from the Germans as an official part of the German military structure. Therefore in its early history it was obviously allied and/or collaborated with Germans, nonwithstanding the fact that it turned against them later. AK was not created with German approval/support, never received orders from Germany or official suport (with the exception of some few extremly rare cases, and those seem to involve NSZ, not AK, as described above), and finally unlike LLD which was initially created to help Germans, AK was created from the start to fight the Germans. The differences are glaringly clear, I believe.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 19:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I certainly agree that there are many reasons we should not view Lithuanian alliance with Nazis as something simple; as many other nations they were in it more to escape the Soviet opression then because they approved of Hitler's schemes. On the other side of the coin would be of course the unfriendly attitude of L. nationalists to Poles (and vice-versa - although I am sure there were notable examples of cooperation, and perhaps it would do us all good if we would try to write a little about those 'better' aspects from time to time). <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-belligerence.html" title="Co-belligerence">Co-belligerence</a> is a nice link and a good one to use to expand/replace on the instances where collaboration is used. Legionas, I'd recommend you look through Google Print and provide some evidence to back such statements. I will repeat that PP was obviously a German enemy later, but in the begining he was either their ally or collaborator (although of course his primary motivation was not to help Germans, but Lithuanians).--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 19:59, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Plechavičius initially was a colaborator of the Nazis, the problem is that the word has some pejorative connotations. It seems that we may be lacking a correct NPOV word here. It might also be that cooperation with the Nazis was seen somehow different from the Polish and Lithuanian perspective. I think the best we can do is to search some possibly neutral sources. I'd like to point out here, that in some cases AK also was receiving weapons from the Nazis. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 20:47, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the pointers. They certainly give some background of the situation. They however seem to confirm that Plechavičius initially collaborated with the Nazis, although his goals were apparently different.

<dd>I initially brought up the term co-belligerence on this page with reference to Sigitas' comment "Armia Krajowa also waged battles against enemies of Nazis", but given the information I have (an army under Lithuanian command, to remain in and defend Lithuanian territory), I am increasingly coming under the impression that PP was a co-belligerent, not a collaborator. <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 08:10, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the key question is whether the Nazis did occupy Lithuania or not. If we consider them to be occupants, then military cooperation with them would be a treason and can be called "collaboration". If the Nazis were not occupants but a friendly army that liberated Lithuania, then "co-belligerence" would be adequate instead. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 11:01, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course Nazis occupied Lithuania and no one is disputing that. However, preparing local army for defence against Soviet aggressors was a patriotic thing and not a treason. Even if German weapons were used. We should not apply name "collaborator" in this article regarding Plechavicius, because people can also call him "resistant". "Collaborator-resistant Povilas Plechavicius" sounds just too cumbersome. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 13:35, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't it possible that he was both&#160;? His intentions might have been noble, but some facts remain. I'm sure you know the story of <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konrad_Wallenrod_8caf.html" title="Konrad Wallenrod">Konrad Wallenrod</a> by Mickiewicz. Plechavičius perfectly matches the definition of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaborationism.html" title="Collaborationism">collaborationism</a>. The problem is that this is a pejorative term, while his collaborationism is more difficult to be judged. But then, history of may famous people is far from being black or white only. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 16:26, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree that it perfectly matches the definition. Consider the subtleties of the situation in Lithuania in Feb.-May 1944, and that the entire resistance had swung from boycotting the German mobilization attempt of 43 to fully supporting the PP recruitment. It was apparent that the front would soon arrive, and the nature of the Nazis as an occupying power shifted and weakened somewhat. A quasi-autonomous army that was liquidated for failing to subordinate, hardly seems like it was a textbook case of collaboration with an occupier. <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 17:34, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's what I meant exactly: he was collaborative initially, but rebelious later, not the other way round. I understand that the situation was not that simple and that's what I just referred to above when I wrote it was probably neither entirely "black" nor "white". --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 18:23, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauguma.html" title="Sauguma">Sauguma</a> is the name mentioned in the GW article linked above. It has a stub on Polish wiki (<a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauguma" class="external autonumber" title="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauguma" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). Legionas removed the link to <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauguma.html" title="Sauguma">Sauguma</a> from the text with the edit summary: "I'm not familiar with the structure of Lithuanian police during the war but organisation with the name "Sauguma" never existed. " It is misspelled word for security". According to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> it is not reason for the removal: we have a verifiable source for its existance, and especially as Legionas admits he is unfamiliar with the organization of L. police perhaps they used such a mispelled title? In any case, I am sure that Lithuanian police and/or <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauguma.html" title="Sauguma">Sauguma</a> are notable and deserve article, especially considering that the articles I summarized above note that much of the information about AK-L relations is very related to the aspects of L. collaboration with the Nazis, which certainly should be described somewhere at least as well as our current AK controversy section is.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 19:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you could possibly write a general entry, we can later add a history section and then write something about the controversies of the IIWW.

It would appear that Sauguma was not Lithuanian police but rather a <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_secret_police.html" title="Lithuanian secret police">Lithuanian secret police</a> agency, something like <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestapo.html" title="Gestapo">gestapo</a>, <a href="../../../n/k/v/NKVD_9ef5.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a> or <a href="../../../u/r/z/Urz%C4%85d_Bezpiecze%C5%84stwa_f52f.html" title="Urząd Bezpieczeństwa">Urząd Bezpieczeństwa</a>.

<p>"Lithuanians were for the most part formed into auxiliary support units for security operations. The first formal unit to be formed was known as the Lituanische Hunterschaften which was later used as a foundation for a series of self defense units known as Selbschutz-Bataillonen. The Selbschutz-Bataillonen units were later brought under the control of the German organization of uniformed frontline police, the Ordungspolizie, and renamed as Schutzmannschaft-Bataillonen or Schumas. The Schuma units were universally renamed and reformed into Polizie-Bataillonen in May of 1943. Nearly all units were formed in battalion-sized units consisting of between 500 and 600 men each. They were primarily assigned to rear-area security duties, but as the Soviets drew nearer to Lithuania, they also saw service fighting the Soviets directly. These Lithuanian units numbered a total of 35 Battalions during WWII, consisting of units numbered 1-15, 251-257, 263-265, and 301-310. 13 of these units, numbers 263-265 and 301-310, were never fully trained and were disbanded before they could be employed in combat. These units were posted variously to Poland, Belorussia, the other Baltic countries, and even as far away as the southern Ukraine. As the Soviets approached, the Germans took to grouping 3 or 4 Lithuanian Polizie-Bataillonen into regimental-sized units know as Lituanische Freiwilligen-Infanterie-Regimenter. Three such units were formed as the Soviets reached the border and they were sent directly to the front in the attempt at holding back the Soviet onslaught in late late 1944 and early 1945. The duties of the Lithuanian units was mainly rear-area security and anti-partisan operations, with occasional frontline service. As they served as auxilliaries to the Ordnungspolizei in the occupied areas of the Soviet Union, they often supported of the SD Einsatzkommando's nefarious cleansing operations. The Lithuanian units were often put under control of the RSHA - the Reich Main Security Office, and the HSSPF - the Höhere SS-Polizei Fuhrer of the Ostland regions, and were at times participants in operations against civilians and those deemed bandits in the rear areas of the Eastern Front." <a href="http://www.feldgrau.com/lith.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.feldgrau.com/lith.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 11:03, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Kisielaitis, now 80, volunteered for the Lithuanian 2nd Auxiliary Police Service Battalion (later known as the 12th Lithuanian Schutzmannschaft Battalion) in 1941. During 1941-42, this battalion assisted in the execution of at least 130,000 people, primarily Jews.". So, Kisielaitis was policeman (ordinary police - not Security Police). Klimaitis was antisoviet insurgent during the outbreak of war. He formed his antisoviet unit, fought retreating soviets and was involved in killings of Jews. I cannot say how well these accusations are founded. There is none articles in Lithuanian on Klimaitis.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Most Polish and Lithuanians historians claim..."</span></h2>
<p>Article currently says: "Most Polish and Lithuanians historians claim that the massacre at Dubingiai was unique [4]". There are two problems with that: 1) it is not clear what "unique" means in this context. Does it mean that it was the only killing or that it was different killing from others? 2) Can anyone translate part of this article which says that most of Lithuanian historians regard this as an unique incident? To most Lithuanian historians this incident is only unique by larger number of victims than usually. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 17:34, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genocide?!</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">Genocide</a> is a very strong word. The recently added fragment contains it, making it very controversial: "Lithuanian General Prosecutor Office in 1999 established that "partisan units of AK, not recognising return of Vilnius region in 1939, were performing genocide of population of Lithuania, i.e. terrorised, robbed, murdered civilians of Lithuanian, Jewish and Russian ethnicities, hoping that these actions will help reoccupy area after the war"<a href="http://www.voruta.lt/article.php?article=747" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.voruta.lt/article.php?article=747" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> First, can we have a source other then the 'XXI amžius' newspaper? Second, what was the Polish government reaction, and did Lithuanian gov. ever commented on this?

<dd>I will try to elaborate this. I know that investigation of General Prosecutor in killings by AK did not end yet, and that in an AK case there are over 200 murdered victim names. I saw it recently somwhere , cannot find it right now. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 21:29, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Besides, the fragment mentions that the AK "did not recognize return of Vilnius region in 1939", which seems a complete nonsense. Firstly, the AK was not formed in 1939. It was created in 1943, so it could not support anything four years before. Secondly, the <i>Vilniaus kraštas</i> (<a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a>) was never a formal entity, so I doubt the AK commented on it anywhere. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 22:52, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Putting metaphores aside, Halibutt means that the sentece as translated by Legionas is somewhat confusing: either the translation is incorrect or the article makes a mistake claiming AK existed in 1939. Anyway, can we have an academic (or at least, official Lt. governmental) source stating AK commited genocide?

<dd>1) I don't see where it claims that AK existed in 1939. It just says AK didn't recognize the return of Vilnius to Lithuania in 1939. You and I could form an organization in 2006, and we could choose to not recognize the same thing... it could be our sole purpose in forming the organization. 2) Some people use the term <i>genocide</i> a little more freely than others. Lately on wikipedia I've found that some people are applying a very literal interpretation of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide_2f25.html" title="Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a> definition. If some unit(s) of AK "intended" "in whole or <b>in part</b>" ... to "destroy" Lithuanians as a group, they may have been guilty of genocide.

<dd>Ah, the "return" part must've mislead me. The author meant the return of Vilnius to the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania_4695.html" title="Grand Duchy of Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> then, right? Otherwise it's a weasel term for "the Home Army did not support the Lithuanian claims to the Polish city of Wilno"... As to the genocide - I'm not going to comment on that one. Sorry, but naming one, quite controversial situation in history with the G term is a tad over the top for me and resembles more of an attempt to prove some point than to present mere facts. But maybe it's just me. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 14:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yup, I try hard. And I know why the Lithuanians wanted that city so badly. However, this does not mean that we should twist facts to support a strange vision of history - or to suggest it to our readers. If we call Lithuanian claims on a Polish city (and regarded as such by the League of Nations and all countries not allied to Nazi Germany) with such words (<i>return</i>), then it suggests a certain level of sympathy towards that view - and certain legitimacy of such claims. At the same time, we're not even mentioning the status quo at that time nor are we mentioning the point of view of the majority of the world at that time. It's not NPOV that way. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 20:14, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHome_Army_%28disambiguation%29_7e9d.html" title="Talk:Home Army (disambiguation)">Talk:Home Army (disambiguation)</a> for some good arguments why this should be moved to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Army_d5ca.html" title="Home Army">Home Army</a>. Feel free to start a WP:RM and let's see what others would want to say. My personal stance is that Home Army is English (WP:UE) but Armia Krajowa is more 'distinct'. I feel this article can exists as well under Home Army and Armia Krajowa, and would likely abstain in the vote (unless arguments or one or the other party convince me to join their side).--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 15:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Halibutt's searches on that talk page are far from the whole story. It's as if I only searched for "Polish Home Army" on Google here. Please look again at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22home+army%22+-poland+-polish+-AK+-armia+-krajowa&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22home+army%22+-poland+-polish+-AK+-armia+-krajowa&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">this search</a> - roughly half, if not less, are about AK. Many are about the plans of the Hitler assassination plotters, historical reserve forces of UK and US, "home army" as a general term like "home guard", and a handful about other countries' resistance movements or reserves. The disambiguation page needs to be cleaned up/improved a bit, but as for AK, the proper English title is "Polish Home Army" per my initial evidence. "Home army" is far too general a term to be claimed by one country; having <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Army_d5ca.html" title="Home Army">Home Army</a> be about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Home_Army_3afe.html" title="Polish Home Army">Polish Home Army</a> is not that much different from having <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> be about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Army_5893.html" title="Polish Army">Polish Army</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 20:12, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1.When you translate Home Army back into Polish you get Armia Domowa (House Army) which seems like a bad joke. It would be a much better idea to translate Armia Krajowa into Domestic Army (as in loty krajowe-&gt;domestic flights translation) if you want this article to be moved to an English title.<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it wouldn't, because that term has never been used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. I and probably many other people prefer original names like <a href="../../../u/c/k/UCK_0a1d.html" title="UCK">UCK</a> to invented/translated names like <a href="../../../k/l/a/KLA_81bd.html" title="KLA">KLA</a>.<br /></p>

<p>3. Like <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrika_Korps_44b2.html" title="Afrika Korps">Afrika Korps</a> the Armia Krajowa name is 50% English compatible as IMHO in the context of World War II most people will correctly guess that "Armia" stands for "Army".<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference is that Afrika Korps is more common (than Africa Corps) by a factor of 10.</dd>

<p><i><b>Działań AK na Wileńszczyźnie nie można nazywać ludobójstwem</b>. Jednak mordowanie niewinnych cywilów, czym ma splamione ręce ta organizacja, można nazwać przestępstwami wojennymi. Zresztą nie były to masowe mordy, gdyż z reguły zabijano wybrane, pojedyncze rodziny. Jest nam znany tylko jeden fakt masowego mordu. Jest to akcja AK w Dubinkach - twierdzi Arunas Bubnys, młody litewski historyk, gorący krytyk AK na Wileńszczyźnie.</i></p>
<p><i>- Nikt nigdy nie wydał rozkazu, aby zabijać Litwinów czy przedstawicieli innych narodowości tylko dlatego, że są Litwinami, Żydami czy też Rosjanami. Litwini, mówiąc o ludobójstwie polskich partyzantów, mają jasny cel. Obrzucając ich absurdalnymi oskarżeniami, chcą wybielić swoich policjantów, którzy uczestniczyli w mordowaniu Żydów - twierdzi Jarosław Wołkonowski.</i></p>
<p><i>Czy rzeczywiście termin ludobójstwo używany jest po to, aby litewska kolaboracja wyglądała bardziej niewinnie na tle AK splamionej ludobójstwem i współpracą z Niemcami?</i></p>
<p><i>- Trudno mi odpowiedzieć na to pytanie. <b>Mówienie o ludobójstwie AK ma niewątpliwie podtekst polityczny</b>. Należy zrozumieć tych Litwinów, którzy tak twierdzą. Może to być swoista samoobrona. Najpierw 50 lat Sowieci nazywali nas nacjonalistami i faszystami. Potem nadszedł rok 1990 i Izrael zaczął nas nazywać mordercami i kolaborantami. Swoje dodała i Polska, która w tamtym okresie mówiła o niemiecko-litewskiej okupacji Wileńszczyzny. Być może dlatego pojawiają się próby udowodnienia, że Litwini nie są demonami, które w Europie wyróżniają się okrucieństwem - twierdzi Arunas Bubnys.</i></p>
<p>A brief translation:</p>
<div style="float: left; margin: 1em 1em 0 0; padding: 0.5em; background: #f0f0ff; border: 1px solid #ddddbb; width: 75%;">
<p>The activities of the Home Army in the area of Wilno should not be called a genocide. On the other hand the organization has its hands stained with murdering innocent civilians, which could be called war crimes. Besides, these were not mass murders, as in most cases among the killed were selected families or persons. We know of only one example of a mass murder, which was the action in Dubinki - stresses Arunas Bubnys, a young Lithuanian historian and an ardent critic of the Home Army in the area of Wilno.</p>
<p>"Nobody has ever issued an order to kill Lithuanians or members of other nationalities solely because they were Lithuanians, Jews or Russians. Lithuanians, when speaking of genocide done by Polish partisans, have a clear aim. Throwing absurd accusations at them, they are trying to whitewash their own policemen, who took part in murdering the Jews" - claims Jarosław Wołkonowski</p>
<p>Is really the term <i>genocide</i> used exclusively to make the Lithuanian collaboration look more innocent when compared to the Home Army stained with collaboration with the Germans and with genocide?</p>
<p>"It's difficult to respond to that question. Speaking of AK's genocide has a clear political context. We should understand the Lithuanians to claim so. It could be considered some sort of a self-defence. At first for 50 years the Soviets called us nationalists and fascists. Then the year 1990 came and Israel started calling us murderers and collaborators. Poland did also add to that, underlining the German-Lithuanian occupation of the Wilno area. Perhaps that is why there are attempts to prove that Lithuanians are not daemons of cruelty unusual in Europe - claims Arunas Bubnys"</p>

<dd>Ok, You were right, i was looking at other reference. Altough - you should also correct a place in the article about document found in Bernardins monastery, because in the same article there is such a statement:</dd>
<dd>"Inne zdanie na ten temat ma Dalia Kuodyte, dyrektor Litewskiego Centrum Badania Ruchu Oporu i Ludobójstwa. Uważa ona, że do powstania takiej opinii przyczyniła się sama AK. - Dobitnie świadczą o tym dokumenty AK znalezione w 1995 r. w klasztorze benedyktyńskim w Wilnie. <b>Są tam raporty o potrzebie oczyszczenia Wileńszczyzny z Litwinów. A to można nazwać ludobójstwem</b> - twierdzi Kuodyte."</dd>
<dd>Doesn't it seem strange, to cite a favorable statements for AK, and not to mention unfavorable. Also in nthe list of references there is another article of Arūnas bubnys, where is a list of AK heroic acts, all of them documented and referenced.--<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokyz_fe40.html" title="User:Lokyz">Lokyz</a>09:25, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't <i>reports</i> not enough to commit a crime? Suggesting that there is a need to expel Lithuanian settlers from Wilno area and indeed expelling or exterminating them are two different things. Besides, Home Army was a huge organization and I wouldn't be surprized if there were reports on the life on Mars preserved in its archives somewhere. Which does not yet mean that they indeed were on Mars back in 1943 or 1944. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 10:31, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>to answer your question I should've read thise documents. Neither I, neither you didn't, and Kuodyte did. So who does have right to decide whether there is any data about war crimes? BTW, reports may mean reports about done actions. I've cited this paragraph only to show, that a phrase in an article "in those documents there are no evidences" might be wrong--<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokyz_fe40.html" title="User:Lokyz">Lokyz</a> 11:03, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took the liberty of stressing <b>the need</b> in your post: it clearly indicates that this was all (idiotic and dangerous) talk about some future 'need', not about some 'done' actions. As we well known, there indeed where (fringe) elements within AK that were anti-Lithuanian; this further serves to confirm that they were <b>talking</b> about such actions (which as Halibutt notes is not that suprising, extreme conditions and large size of AK meant that is certainly had its share of nuts and extremists, thankfully they were few and didn't get that much opportunity to carry out their crazy plans). And Lokyz, please note that according to the sources we have none such actions ever took place (massacre of one village is not genocide, as Bubnys notes). I would much rather see an article about <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnija.html" title="Vilnija">Vilnija</a>, as this appears to be just such an organization of extremists with little academic support, and citing their numbers, without any disclaimer, seems as good as citing statements by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin_Society_cb41.html" title="Stalin Society">Stalin Society</a>.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 12:12, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for I Vilnija I do not have any proper source of information, so let me not judge it. I'd rather wait for more information, than misjudge someone. And the article presents them as some ultrafascits, that are hunting for AK members heads untill now. Doesn't sounds very conwincing.</dd>
<dd>Personally I didn't say nothing about war crimes, I just said that phrase: "Most Polish and Lithuanians historians claim that the massacre at Dubingiai was unique [7]. This view is supported by AK documents [citation needed] that were recently found in Bernardines monastery in Vilnius." MIGHT not be right, and unreferenced statement about "nothing found in the documents" is contradictionary, unless there's citation. Bubnys (looks like in the cited article he alone represets "most lithuanian historians") does not speak about documents, Kuodyte - on other hand does. And she does not seem to support "nothing in documents" version.</dd>
<dd>In this case I've found strange that you cite one article as fully negating genocide, and one paragraph later there is a very contradictory statement, by someone who has (unlike we do all) seen those documents. Again, you try to interprete Kuodyte's words, without knowing what document's she's referring to. This leads me to an conclusion about selective choice of citations, a "phrase hunting", but it seems just another case of it, so I'm not surprised.</dd>
<dd>Reports, that I did mention earlier, are not from Vilnija. They're in another Bubnys article, and they're based on Lithuanian antinazi underground (not Local Detachment or Security police) press and German officers report: list of AK actions against Lithuanians is really impressive. It's not a source I've found out, it's already there as a reference. I mean this one: Arūnas Bubnys. Armija Krajova Rytų Lietuvoje (Armia Krajowa in Eastern Lithuania). "Atgimimas", 9 June 1989, No. 22 (35)]. I mention i here, because it seems kind of strange to me, that after using such articles as a reference someone states - nothing happened.--<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokyz_fe40.html" title="User:Lokyz">Lokyz</a> 12:48, 7 August 2006 (UTC) P.S. why <i>need</i>, why not <b>urge</b>? And of ocurse, killng few people there, few there is not massacre. It's simple murder.

<dd>A simple question - whether and unreferenced statement "nationalist organization of Vilnija" could be reworded into at least contrawersial reputation organization - to balance this article further.

<dd>I am not saying they are nazis, but nationalists, there is a difference. From what I have read they seem to be encouraging anti-Polish sentiments, and are actively involved in maintaining the Polish-Lithuanian rift. Controversy can take many forms (<a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Expellees_b65a.html" title="Federation of Expellees">Federation of Expellees</a> is another example to consider). PS. I looked up a few sources, again, this time I had a slightly better catch. First, I found <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415355931&amp;id=YB-ZwiBf5HgC&amp;pg=RA9-PA151&amp;lpg=RA9-PA151&amp;dq=vilnija&amp;sig=sLsTZZC_fXMHVQkXjW2hws3mFYc" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415355931&amp;id=YB-ZwiBf5HgC&amp;pg=RA9-PA151&amp;lpg=RA9-PA151&amp;dq=vilnija&amp;sig=sLsTZZC_fXMHVQkXjW2hws3mFYc" rel="nofollow">a book</a> which calls Vilnija 'extremists'. Unfortunately two other books which mention this keyword have restricted pages, but their titles are rather telling (<i>Taming Nationalism?: Political Community Building in the Post-Soviet Baltic States</i> and <i>Understanding Ethnic Violence: Fear, Hatred, and Resentment in Twentieth-Century Eastern Europe</i>). Next I found an article in English (offline, check <a href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:Q_aAwKzLZqoJ:www.zakorzenienie.most.org.pl/english/04.htm+wyborcza%2Bvilnija&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:Q_aAwKzLZqoJ:www.zakorzenienie.most.org.pl/english/04.htm+wyborcza%2Bvilnija&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">Google cache</a>) calling Vilnija a "Nationalist Lithuanian group". At the official site of Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs I found documents calling Vilnija "an association known for nationalistic and antipolish stance" (znanego z nacjonalistycznego i antypolskiego nastawienia stowarzyszenia) (<a href="http://www.mfa.gov.pl/index.php?page=4382&amp;lang_id=pl&amp;bulletin_id=8&amp;portlet=biuletyn%2Fpokaz" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mfa.gov.pl/index.php?page=4382&amp;lang_id=pl&amp;bulletin_id=8&amp;portlet=biuletyn%2Fpokaz" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>). I can quote more Polish sources, but as mentioned, they are certainly not NPOV, so I limited myself to the governmental page only - yet again it is telling I have not found a single one that seems supportive of it, and note that the first ref I quote (the book) is not Polish. Therefore I would like to move we remove the Vilnija statements from this article, they seem not reliable. PS. It is likely there are other names this organization uses, perhaps you can offer a few other terms to google?--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 19:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is quite POVed addition, although salvagable. I am rather disappointed by the removal of sourced information like rogue AK troops acting against specific orders of Krzyżanowski which forbade reprisals against civilians&lt;ref name="Piotrowski-L"/&gt;, which IMHO clearly shows the bias and POV of the recent additions. I NPOVed and improved the English of the recent edits, plus I added some citation requests, in few cases I expect they can be easily answered because the entire para is referenced from a single source. I also removed some glarring errors, like that AK started operations against in 1943 - it was of course fighting them since its very creation before 1943, and did not start operations against the Soviets, it was Soviets who started operations against AK. I also removed the strange accusation that AK killed many Jews in Lithuania, the Jewish sections documents that AK had no anti-semitic policy rather well. Last but not least, I think that the entire section is still higly biased into portraying AK as villains and Lithuanians as victims, we need to remember that Lithuanians were at that time allied to Nazi Germany, and that Poles suffered as well (<i><a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadeusz_Piotrowski_e788.html" title="Tadeusz Piotrowski">Tadeusz Piotrowski</a> notes that thousands of Poles died at the hand of Lithuanian collaborators, and tens of thousands were deported.</i>), this desperatly needs to be balanced.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 15:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>You are free to write (in an encyclopedic way providing sources) that the AK command was sometimes unable to control some of the autonomous units in far away regions. And if those <b>individals</b> shared the views of pre war polish far right wing political organisations then they <b>sometimes</b> commited actions that today might be viewd as criminal (even if they thought they were justified e.g as reprisal actions against the lithuanian police members and their families). These actions were neither tolerated, nor encouraged by tha AK high command, but keeping the integrity of the AK forces, strategiacal situation meant that "criminal actions" were sometimes not immidietly punished by the AK command (probably the same could be said about french resistance in the dispiuted french-german boarder regions). <a href="../../../m/i/e/User%7EMieciu_K_31a4.html" title="User:Mieciu K">Mieciu K</a> 20:14, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you trying to say that AK was simply better, because "there were some Jews killed by the AK". Some means this one does not count? Or does it mean AK did not intend to do, it was just an accident? Like with Lithuanians killed - "this one was just revenge, not planned action". Ok, ok AK are heroes, they just didn't know how to use guns. This one is getting annoying - Lithuanian collborators are the worst (accenting only Lithuanians, nevermind army tey served), germans are a liitle bit better, and AK - killed just some. Don't you find that murdering any one is a crime&#160;? BTW did you know, that all the Lithuanian policemens who did kill civils in Glintiškės were executed by Lithuanian firing squad. Someow I didn't hear that murderers of Dubingiai civils or at any other place in Lithuania were punished in any way.--<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokyz_fe40.html" title="User:Lokyz">Lokyz</a> 21:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Somehow I didn't hear that murderers of Dubingiai civils or at any other place in Lithuania were still alive after the II world war or were under the authority of the Polish goverment after the II world war. I am just saying don't judge the entire organisation because of the criminal actions of a small percentage of it's members, that would be a generalisation and a simplification unacceptable in an encyclopedia. Every large organasation has problems with it's mebers eg the catholic church, but that doesn,t make the entire organisation a criminal organisation. <a href="../../../m/i/e/User%7EMieciu_K_31a4.html" title="User:Mieciu K">Mieciu K</a> 21:38, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

As for the Jewish issue, 'many' is a weasel word, and it creates a mistaken impression that AK was perfoming some significant anti-Jewish actions, which is obviously not true. Further, this section describes the Polish-Lithuanian relations, so if we want to talk about their impact on Jewish population, as Mieciu pointed out we should start with the much higher casualties inflicted on the Jews by LLS and other Lithuanian collaborators first. PS. There is no 'white' and 'black', but as shades of grey go, AK was much 'lighter' then LSP.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 22:20, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Few months ago I suggested (IIRC to Sigitas) that he should create an article on Lithuanian resistance, and I am still waiting. AK was engaged in the fight against Lithuanian collaborators, and not, to any of my knowledge, against Lithuanians themselves; a good example of this is the citation from Piotrowski's book about order of Krzyżanowski, AK commander of Vilnius region, which forbade reprisals against Lithuanian civilians. There were indeed some highly theoretical debates between underground and emigree Polish politicians about the shape of future Polish borders; they were obviously not practical, and the fact that they did not envision great future for Lithuania is not suprising, considering Lithuanian stance (pro-German, anti-Polish). And yes, there were rogue groups, usually connected to former <i><a href="../../../e/n/d/Endecja.html" title="Endecja">endecja</a></i> and then <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narodowe_Si%C5%82y_Zbrojne_a442.html" title="Narodowe Siły Zbrojne">Narodowe Siły Zbrojne</a> who were very supportive of such slogans and unfriendly to Lithuanians, in extreme and exceptional situations engaging in violence, criminal acts, murders and once, an entire massacre.

In case of statement that the main activity of AK was persecution of Lithuanians and Jews, or that German support was directed not for Lithuanians but to AK, I'd very much appreciate something more then one Lithuanian publication, as per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> it's obviously presenting a POVed side and thus is not a very reliable source, especially as it is going against virtually all of the other references we have and seems to be a very minority interpretation.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Starting Mediation</span></h3>
<p>Firstly, could we agree to break out of this edit war. I appreciate that from the perspective of Legionas, the current version is the 'wrong' version, however, if we are going to resolve this dispute, we have to start from somewhere.</p>
<p>In this context , could we start by discussing the contested introduction to the "Relations with Lithuanians" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The issue of Polish and Lithuanian relations during the Second World War is a controversial issue, and most modern Lithuanian and Polish historians still differ in their interpretations of the related events, many of which are related to the operations of Armia Krajowa on territories inhabited by Lithuanians and Poles.

<dd><i>Sidenote:</i> Hopefully I'll not make the mediation more difficult by suggesting to change the "<b>most</b> modern Lithuanian and Polish historians" into "<b>many</b> modern Lithuanian and Polish historians". However I do expect that this is not the point of contention and do not want to drift the mediation at the very start so I don't expect any answer (rather just a reminder for myself as I don't want to touch the para that's going to be discussed now). Other than that the section seems reasonable to me. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 13:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To me the intro seems like a decent description of the problem, as the matter is indeed considered controversial (apparently). What Lysy wrote above is a decent suggestion as well, as we don't know if most or just one historian differs. We know for sure that there is a guy somewhere who differs, but he might pretty well be alone in that. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 13:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</li>

<dl>
<dd>1. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources.</dd>
<dd>2. Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor.</dd>
<dd>3. The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although WP:NPOV policy is written around the concept of majority and minority, there is acceptance within the editing community that in some cases there is a virtually even division, in which case equal weight should be given. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 15:00, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To better understand the controversy, would you (anyone) be able to show, specifically which parts of the section in question need support in sources&#160;? what is actually questioned here&#160;? So far I understand that one could wonder whether the "most", "many" or "some" wording would be more appropriate. I think "most" (or "many" as well) would need a reputable citation support. The problem might be that most of the sources on the subject are in Polish or Lithuanian (or their derivatives), therefore difficult to verify within the limited community. Would the "some" wording be contentious as well&#160;? --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 16:00, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There certainly is disagreement between wikipedians, but I didn't really see disagreement of Lithuanian and Polish historians. Probably disagreements exist, but they are not manifested in this article. I provided position of Lithuanian historians, now its up to Poles to provide alternative version if there is one. So, how many Lithuanians were killed by revenging AK troops around Dubingiai in the end of June of 1944 according to the Polish historians? Which Polish historians don't agree that AK killed 20 Jews in Eisiskes on 12 November 1943, and killed 12 Jews in Barunai in the end of March, 1944? Which Polish historian doesn't agree that AK punished father and son Sadowski for hiding the Jews? If it is argued that different views exist I'd like to request to share the details of disagreement. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 19:06, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

Further, if you'd have read the Wikipedia article about Armia Krajowa you'd see that we have an estimate of a Polish historian for less then 100 Lithuanians killed, and Lithuanian historians for up to 1000 (Vilnija is not reliable, so I am ommitting it).

<dd>LOL, that's one of the most obvious cases of twisting one's words that I have seen. Nobody has disagreed because nobody thought to argue about such a minor and exceptional cases. Anyway, Legionas, I will quote our mediator Addhoc, quoting WP:NPOV: "If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority it doesn't belong in Wikipedia". As thse events you mention are not quoted by anybody except those few Lithuanian historians you mention in this single publication (or to be specific, likely only one of those historians in what looks like an edited volume), those few isolated incidents cannot be used to accuse AK of such actions, when we cannot verify such accusations with other sources, and we have plethora of others to the contrary. PS. The fact that this Lithuanian book is very hard to verify by others does not add to your argument.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 20:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After the two countries signed the Friendship Treaty in 1994, Lithuanian and Polish Historians began to meet in joint scholarly conferences. In 1999, they discussed one of the most divisive and painful issues in Lithuanian-Polish relations. The theme of the conference was 'The Resistance Movement in 1939-1945: A lesson from Lithuanian and Polish Histories'. The actions of <i>Armia Krajowa</i> in Lithuania were discussed during this conference for the first time by a group of Polish and Lithuanian historians. Although the participants of the conference did not change their opinions, they agreed to respect differences in historical interpretations." This clearly implies there is some disagreement between historians, unless I'm missing something. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 18:38, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>After some thinking I have reservations regarding the "thousands of deaths". AK probably killed 4000 locals in "ethnic Lithuanian lands" but many of victims were Belarussians, Jews and Poles. Thousands of Poles would be killed by Germans with or without Lithuanian administration in place. Sonderkommando Ypatingasis burys in Paneriai were killing people not because they "took the opportunities offered by the war to commit crimes" but because they were forced to. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 09:47, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>You should evaluate these data carefully. I know for sure that at least some of the villages burned by Territorial Defence Force were simply invented by Polish propagandists, for example killings in Grauziskes, when Territorial Defence Force didn't even reach this place before being destroyed by AK. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 15:46, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've never heard about killings in Graużyszki, as indeed, Plechaviczius men were defeated earlier; however, In Sienkowszczyna (quite near Grauzyszki) Plechaviczius men were burning houses and killing people - probably that's why they were so easily defeated, since AK attacked while the butchers were busy with shooting the civilians. As for Burys being forced to kill Poles, well, they were all volunteers; <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 07:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC) EDIT: plus Pawłów, Adamowszczyzna, Tołminów
<dl>
<dd>Witnesses say they there ambushed marching by AK, which probably was tipped by Germans. I don't know much about these events though. Burys' members volunteered to assist germans initially, but not to kill people in paneriai. Most of them only were aknowledged of their role in killings after arrival to Paneriai and had no option to say "no" (Arūnas Bubnys (2004).

<dd>This is sad, but the same could be probably said of many Germans who did not go to army to murder civilians but then had no choice. I think the times were difficult and we're really often too easily assigning blame. On the other hand thousands of people were murdered in Paneriai and this also requires some justice and we cannot pretend that nobody killed them. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 11:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it can indeed be said about many people involved in war. We cannot say "used the opportunities offered by the war to commit violent acts against those they perceived as enemies" as this wording would mean voluntary and enthuasiastic participation in killings, when in fact Burys' people volunteered for escorting Jews to Ghettos, not for killings in Paneriai. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 12:49, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the other paragraph that you mention already characterizes the situation and does it in a more comprehensive way. There's been animosity between Polish and Lithuanians since Poles took Vilnius in 1920s and it's obvious that the mutual attitude was rather negative. It only starts to change now, after almost a century.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Numbers</span></h2>
<p>I tried to find some references for AK numbers. Membership are rather easy - from 250,000 to 380,000 for 1943/1944. However the numbers of those killed by AK and its casualties are more difficult. There are some unsourced numbers of wiki, but so far sources information I managed to find come from <a href="http://www.polishembassy.ca/files/Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20WWII%20eng.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.polishembassy.ca/files/Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20WWII%20eng.pdf" rel="nofollow">this pdf</a> also accessible in <a href="http://www.ww2.pl/The,underground,home,army,25.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ww2.pl/The,underground,home,army,25.html" rel="nofollow">this html form</a>, official and referenced (but not inline) leaflet from Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. AK casualties are 34,000 up to mid-1944, plus 20,000-30,000 deported afterwards (no data on casualties after mid-1944). Polish wiki has an unsourced number for 100,000 casualties till 1944 and 50,000 deported or killed post-1944. But the number of those killed by AK is even a bigger mystery. The pdf states that 'partisant troops' (meaning AK) active from 1943 killed <b>1,000</b> Germans. Now, that seems rather low, especially considering the same document gives for example a number of 5,700 assassination attempts (it would seem that most of them were unsuccesfull and there were few unexpected casualties on the German side?). It seem to refer to German casualties from minor combat, and does not count their casualties from the Warsaw Uprising (10,000) mentioned later in the article, nor (I'd assume) casualties from the rest of the Operation Tempest actions. Even so, consider two other numbers we have on Wiki: <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_resistance_movement_in_World_War_II_6133.html" title="Polish resistance movement in World War II">Polish resistance movement in World War II</a> states that Polish underground resistance killed 150,000 Germans. Granted, AK numbers would not count those from before 1943, but considering that non-affiliated units like AL were less then 1/5 of AK size totalled, we have a big discrepancy. Further, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_contribution_to_World_War_II_30be.html" title="Polish contribution to World War II">Polish contribution to World War II</a> has another unsourced number, arguing for a significant increase in German casualties in Poland after creation of AK in 1943: <i>German losses to the Polish partisans ranged at 850-1700 per month in early 1944 compared to about 250-320 per months in 1942.</i> With some rough averages that gives us ~1,500 for 1939, ~3,000 for years 1940-1942 (~12,000 total) and ~16,000 for 1944. Let's throw ~10,000 for 1943 and 1945 and we get ~50,000 casualties, 1/3 of the 150,000, but more then 11,000 that canbe safely estimted from that pdf. Anyway, if you can dig up any more hard data, it would be much appreciated.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 21:24, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is rather consistent with AK activities in Lithuania. Engagements of AK and Germans were rare. AK generaly avoided conflicts with Germans. R. Zizas concludes, that military losses of germans inflicted by AK in eastern Lithuania did not correspond military potential of AK available. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 14:38, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am sure that since Germans used Lithuanian collaborators to relieve their troops for other duties, AK directed part of their actions againt Lithuanians. Whether 'most' of AK actions were against Germans or Lithuanian collaborators it is hard to say (do you have any data on that), and of course there is the issue of are losses among Axis powers (which would include collaborators) aren't sometimes abbreviated by some authors as Germans. Statistics can get pretty difficult in such cases. Btw, IIRC our discussions correcty historian estimates of Lithuanian casualties inflicted by AK range from 100 (Polish estimates) to 1000 (Lithuanian e.), right (not counting Vilnija claims, obviously)?--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 14:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on Boradyn's "Niemen - rzeka niezgody":</p>
<p>"White Polish bands" burned villages of Turejsk and Zaborze. According to the (soviet) report, AK burned 350 houses, killing many civilians. From Polish statistical data it seems, that those villages had no more than 30 houses each. It's hard to believe they grown tenfold during 20 years. And from March the 15th order of "Krasnogwardiejski" unit it seems that 100 "White Poles" hide on roofs of houses of village of Turejsk - the same, which was burned 3 weeks earlier, according to report of Szupienia - shooting to Soviet partisans returning from economical operations. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 13:58, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason I quoted it is quite simple. The AK in Belarus is also accused about killings of thousands of innocent Belarussian peasants. The main sources for that are soviet reports. The question is, what's the source for accusation of AK of killing of thousands of innocent Lithuanians? Also some reports, which are usually exxagerated at least threefolds, or some real, critical research? And if the numbers of killed in Belarus is inflated so highly, why shouldn't we suspect that the same thing is going with the data for AK victims in Lithuania? I am not saying the reports ARE exxagerated and the number of victims IS inflated - by please understand that I am naturally sceptic about any such accusations after reading about similar "AK crimes" in Belarus. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 17:14, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record: If you read Dundulienė's account you surely have noticed that she did not know if the murderers were from AK. What she saw is that they had white-red band on their arms and one of them was Lithuanian, Dzuk Sauliukas. I don't know about Lithuania, but in Ukraine it was a frequent practice of Soviet partisans to pretend that they were either AK or UPA. I'm not saying this happened here. It is likely, but not sure that the people she describes were indeed some unit of AK, but they could also be some Polish criminals that pretended to belong to the army. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 18:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In fact she also noted that the murderers robbed one of the apartments, taking folk costumes, shoes etc. Anyway, there were many more organisation and individuals wearing white and red bands than AK alone. I have no reason to assume that these were or were not members of AK. Sadly, it seems they were Polish, and they hated Lithuanians.

<dd>Here is one example of Polish propaganda: in Svencioniai area retaliating Germans killed around 100 people, Polish underground soon announced in the West that "thousands" Poles were killed (while people of different ethnicities were killed), and Lithuanians were blamed as the main executioners (from Rimantas Zizas.

<p>My opinion, based on what I've seen so far is that they should be mentioned but since the authors seem to be controversial, their views should be attributed and the controversy should be explicitly stated when they are mentioned. As far as I know the point of view of Garšva and his findings are not confirmed by any independent research, which is a shame (but not surprise to me). Anyway, this should not be presented as an "ultimate truth". I would be also interested to see the opinion of other Lithuanian editors on this. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 10:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Garsva</span></h2>
<p>Sigitas, I am reading the articles about Kazimieras Garsva. Well, the more I read about him, the less credible he seems. "Poland sent a desant of 300 priests" to Belarus, which are "ethnic Lithuanian territories", "Poland should apologise for occupation for Lithuania", "there were Red regime, Brown regime, and Polish regime", that planned meeting of Plechaviczius and AK men means that "Lithuanian soldiers sold themselves to Poles". POles living on Lithuania also reported that he consider all Poles in Lithuania in fact "polonised Lithuanians". One Pole reported that Garsva said to him in person "we will smoke you all out of Lithuania, like a rats". Hardly a man who I would consider an authority <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 07:21, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe it does not matter much if you, me or Sigitas consider Garšva to be an authority or not. Apparently some people do, as he's been member of an official Lithuanian investigation commission, as Sigitas explained. I think it's not appropriate to ignore his views if they seem to be shared by at least a group of Lithuanian historians. Their opinions should be mentioned and appropriately attributed. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 10:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
