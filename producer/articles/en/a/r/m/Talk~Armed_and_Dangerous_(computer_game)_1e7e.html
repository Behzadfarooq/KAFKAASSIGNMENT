<p>It would be nice to have organised additions of Cutscene characters such as Stig, the king, Cpt Vindaloo, The Shrub Patrol, (with a BIG mention of <i>Death to the salad Eaters!</i>) the girl that goes around with the Lionhearts and the fictional town of Zitwalla, and in my opinion a screenshot of gameplay, and movies. And also a Wikiquote page for quotes such as:</p>
<p>Roman: 'Q, toss me.'</p>
<p>Q: 'What?!'</p>
<p>I'd also be willing to 'reword' those bits as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Hey there! I'm the mysterious phantom editor whos decided to clean this page up a little, I've added more picture, concept art and aim to add screenshots and changed a bit of the text around to sound less <i>instruction book'y</i> as people said. Hope people like what I've done&#160;:)</p>

<dd>Not bad, but I'm going to make a change to the heading style to see how it looks. So many subheadings like that adds a pile of edit buttons to the right. Tiny sections like that don't usually require independent sections.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Looks much better. The table of contents was way too long, and I tagged the criticism. Any claims/statements made in it will need to be supported with a reference. Also in regards to the trivia. That last one, did it somehow relate to the one before it? If so, perhaps with a rewording it might make more sense. The first two contained speculation and guesswork. A violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> wikipedia is not a crystal ball.

<p>I thankyou for your comments on the page!</p>
<p>The aim of this page as I said earlier was to not make it appear like the instruction book. As I think this is worse then the original research, for example how the weapon links are. I was going to sort the weapons out, or delete the list except the guns, but I didn't have the heart to do that to whoever spent so long (with the instruction book open on their keyboard) typing it all up.</p>
<p>I don't know if it is right, in my character descriptions; to have the wit and suggestions of the characters later actions. The idea was, was to get a touch of wit and the feeling of the game in it, while at the same time reciting facts about the characters in a entertaining way and communicating the games humour.</p>
<p>What I also plan to write in this is more about the history of the 'AND' world before the game starts, the onion war, Lime dixon etc. As they are very eccentric ideas and stories, and deserve to be documented. I'm trying not to make this a fansite, but of course, I have to cater for the fans too.</p>
<p>Hoping to put thumbnails by the descriptions of the characters of the games.</p>
<p>Also glad you like the images. Everyone said it needed some, perhaps we should give it some time about shortening the weapon tree format, or just have the gun and a paragraph about the rest.</p>
<p>Any edits are welcome, removed that critism bit as soon as I spotted it. Half thinking of deleting the review section completely. As I don't like these on wiki sites, (as they have no real relevance to the game itself)</p>
<p>Sorry for the typos...--<a href="../../../f/r/3/User%7EFr3k3r_06fc.html" title="User:Fr3k3r">Fr3k3r</a> 00:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only problem is you only removed the header. The problem wasn't the header, it was the content. Whether its called criticism or not there aren't any sources for who formed those opinions. Opinions about the game have to be provided by reliable sources. As for presenting facts thats great. in regards to your comment about <i>but of course, I have to cater for the fans too.</i> you really don't. The article is to be a factual recount of the subject with any notable details touched upon that can be reliably sourced. This was a fairly average game that had a notable sense of humour in the cutscenes and poked fun at both Star Wars and made some references to the developer's earlier games. It might be worth cutting back the gun/bombs/equipment section to only include notable and interesting examples like the land shark gun (which I can remember PC gamer being really excited about) and the guy fawkes bomb for its cultural reference. Shrinking those sections would allow you to put in some stuff about the cutscenes without making the article too long.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 01:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apologies for that header removing act. That WAS certainly stupid. The piece of review was not mine, had been there for ages since summer, and nobody said anything about it, so I thought it wasn't breaking any laws of wikipedia. I'd rather ask about removing the weapons bit as, someone looked as if they spent a long time typing all that out, and discuss what should go, what should stay.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the game was fantastic, I'm just saying, some of the ideas were pretty funny material, and created a whole world upon the game, and yes, for some sections, I have been reading this instruction book and typing up and altering stuff here to there and the character descriptions are more or less what the game is about. Its just a bit of a shame as all those ideas and plain stupid, pointless fairytale/LoR style plot devices get forgotten. I also thought that Wikipedia was for recording fiction, which I had been under the impression it was. There are many games, such as Halo, Final Fantasy, Zelda, Mario and Halflife, that document the its world and universes. I would like to do that here. For those that haven't played the game. Just because a game wasn't well recieved, theres no reason for its world has to be fogotten about. There a lot of these one off game articles, that just end up having information you can find out on Gamespot or Mobygames therefore just being pointless articles. I'm more about typing about the world. The BEST gadgets (as you said), the most desirable and eccentric parts of the game. What made people interested in it at the first place.</p>
<p>I'm a pretty new Wikipedia user (registered) and I just thought that the header on the 'critism' was being referred to because it was gave it its own headline and made it stick out like a sore thumb. So yeah, I removed it, I didn't actually think I would remove the header, I thought I would've removed the <i>actual title for the section</i> titled 'Criticism' which that bit of text was about. Not the header. I thought that was still going to be there later, just with the 'Criticism' title gone. Bad mistake I know. Anyway; thanks for the comments and advice. --<a href="../../../f/r/3/User%7EFr3k3r_06fc.html" title="User:Fr3k3r">Fr3k3r</a> 01:55, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some people like to use it to record fiction but that isn't what its for. Games like Halo, FF, Zelda, Mario and Halflife do have major articles and sub-articles here. They're also much more popular and notable than a game like Armed and Dangerous (even though I enjoyed it). Wikipedia is based on the concept of notability. Subjects which aren't notable either get little if any coverage. The more notable a subject is the more coverage it warrants and people will tolerate (for example if someone started a new pokemon-like game and on the day of its release attempted to create 200 articles for various characters/species in the game, it would be deleted immediately until such a time that the game reached a popularity level that that kind of detail was appropriate). You have to be mindful of those types of things when creating articles. Delving into minutia on subjects which really aren't that notable or special will almost always tend to have the material deleted or shrunk considerably. So with a subject that doesn't have the notability of say Zelda, you have to try and balance the article touching on the more notable aspects of the game. Try to think "What made this game special?" Write about this first. Once the main things like that are covered the article can be looked at again for size and quality and you can evaluate what, if any, the next step will be.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:52, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Planet Moon is a company mainly full of British staff, or at least, for what I know, they have a British sense of humour. QT is a powdered make of tea by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoo" rel="nofollow">Tyhpoo</a> in Britain.</p>
<p>The robot is called Q, he drinks Tea. QT, Its a joke.</p>

<p>Its just as relevant to the one about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiglets" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiglets" rel="nofollow">Twiglets</a>.</p>
<p>Planet Moon have a habit of infringing consumers product tradmark names...since one of the lifeforms on Giants: Citizen Kabuto were called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarties_%28Nestl%C3%A9%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarties_%28Nestl%C3%A9%29" rel="nofollow">Smarties</a>.</p>
<p>And the Giants trivia, since its made with the same engine, most of that can go because I typed it. Just keep the 'smartie' one and the Majorcan Prophecy, please. As those two link the game, (almost spiritual sequels, to say) the other ones more or less are just technical capabilities of the Amityville based engine. --<a href="../../../f/r/3/User%7EFr3k3r_06fc.html" title="User:Fr3k3r">Fr3k3r</a> 01:25, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah okay, I must have misread the way it was written in the trivia. I thought his name was QT and the tea was called Q so I didn't see the direct connection. If you'd like to re-add it, make sure its written in a more authoritative manner. It sounded rather speculative before.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:54, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Armed &amp; Dangerous is a video game created by Planet Moon Studios in collaboration with LucasArts." As far as I know LucasArts is nothing more than the publisher. Sounds to me like someone has just misinterpreted the LucasArts intro logo. Until someone can give a good reason to believe they had a hand in the development, I've deleted this. --203.206.183.160 01:45, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
