<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armor_%28novel%29.html" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Synopsis</span></h2>
<p><i>Armor</i> is the story of humanity's war against an alien race whose foot soldiers are roughly man-sized insects. It is also the story of a research colony on the fringes of human territory who are threatened by pirates. The two sub-plots intersect at the end, with each providing answers and insight into events of the other.</p>
<p>The title seems to refer to the nuclear-powered exoskeletons worn by the soldiers. However it has been said that the 'Armor' referred to in the title really doesn't refer the physical Armor that the protagonist uses to stay alive. Instead, it's more about the metaphor of the emotional armor people have. What makes it a well-written book is simply that it weaves seamlessly between the two interpretations. It's a book about finding strength from within, because the alternative isn't an option.</p>
<p><a name="The_Plot_on_Banshee:" id="The_Plot_on_Banshee:"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armor_%28novel%29.html" title="Edit section: The Plot on Banshee:">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Plot on Banshee:</span></h3>
<p>The protagonist is Felix, the former Guardian Archon of Golden, fighting anonymously as a Scout on the alien planet A9, normally referred to as Banshee. Banshee represents a place in his mind, a supremely hostile environment where death and failure lurk at every corner. Felix suffers from psychological burnout. He joined the military in a suicidal gesture after the death of his wife. The reader discovers that he was the monarch of humanity's richest planet before joining up.</p>
<p>Like <i>Starship Troopers</i>, the infantry is deployed to alien planets in a war of extermination; a large portion of the narrative covers the multiple 'drops' the protagonist makes and ensuing battles. Armored infantry are positioned above the planet surface in starships, and dropped individually to the planet surface as a swarm of independent fighting units. They fight against an alien race which are huge bipedal insects and are simply referred to as the Ants they resemble. The war is fought by inexperienced and uninformed troops on the ground, while the higher ranks sit in orbit and make decisions.</p>
<p>Felix soon becomes the sole survivor from his first drop group who are dropped right on top of a mass of the enemy, and finds, to his horror, that he's very good at fighting. Each battle is a haze of insects, who swarm from the ground in an apparently unending stream.</p>
<p>During his first drop a macabre dialogue occurs on the mortality rates of soldiers depending upon how many drops they've had, with the protagonist being told that first-droppers have the highest rate, which decreases as each soldier survives successful attacks; however, he's informed, the mortality rate increases around the fifth drop as the soldier becomes over-confident. No one has survived more than ten drops.</p>
<p>Later in that same drop, Felix takes a soldier who's gone into 'traction mode'--his armor has taken too much damage, and has extended his arms and legs to maximum extension in the medically safest position--and wires the nuclear reactor to go critical. Over the cursing of the immobilized soldier, Felix tosses the human nuke down an ant-hole, incinerating an insect colony.</p>
<p>Due to an error in the computer because of being the sole survivor of his unit, Felix continues to be called up to fight in every drop, an inhuman pace that seems destined to kill him. Due to a bumbling bureaucracy, this fact is not discovered. Felix's self-contempt grows as he realizes that he is driven to survive, and after each battle he is the sole survivor, at whatever the cost.</p>

<p>A fellow trooper that commands Felix before eventually dying next to Felix. She came in second in the Armored Olympics, losing to Kent, and is an excellent soldier, always doing her duty despite the personal sacrifice. She is arguably a better fighter than Felix, but lacks the same combination of luck and internal strength that he possesses. Right before dying in Felix's arms, she tells him that she was in love with Kent, and confesses that she selfishly ordered Felix to fight at one point in the Battle of the Knuckle.</p>

<p>A master athlete and three-time winner of the Armored Olympics. A hopelessly shy fellow who tries his best to cope with his duties as a celebrity. He is described glowingly by the other soldiers on Banshee, and is frequently referred to as "Everyone's' Hero". Despite this he is no soldier, and his initial reaction to combat is to freeze up then flee. During the Bunker expedition, Felix confides in Kent that Forest had been in love with Kent, provoking Kent into beating up Felix, before apologizing profusely later. After the death of Allie, he intervenes in Felix's life by physically dragging Felix into a small spaceship and sending him away, from Banshee and the war. As Felix's small vessel is being launched, Felix sees the guards onboard the Terra kill Kent.</p>

<p>A commanding officer and one of the brains behind the construction of a fort on Banshee. She has never seen combat, and doesn't really understand it. She flirts slightly with Felix, and tries to get to know him, but can't quite get past his emotional barriers. She survived the attack on the bunker, and nothing more is said as to her fate. Shoen is arguably one of the more "normal" people caught up in the Antwar, and as such has a hard time adapting to it.</p>

<p>The 'protagonist' anti-hero is Jack Crow, a notorious celebrity, famous for the stealing of a prototype of an early FTL Drive. A morally questionable character with views and opinions that are just as questionable, he has been branded a pirate for that action, but has somehow gotten off the hook. This does not mean that he is not still wanted. He is one tough hombre who while not hesitating to kill, is constantly at odds with his own innate morality. He also understands and uses the difference between his roguish, glamourous reputation, and the real deal. At times his reputation is more of a burden than a blessing.</p>
<p>Jack Crow starts out in a prison on an alien planet, and after breaking out of said prison finds himself on the ship of, and at the mercy of, a mutineer on the run named Borglyn. Jack and Borglyn strike a deal, and Jack is allowed to live. Jack will infiltrate a fleet research project and allow Borglyn to reach its power source, in order to refuel his ship. In return, Borglyn will provide Jack with money and a smaller ship, with which Jack can use to go his own way.</p>
<p>Jack is then transported to the planet of Sanction. He takes with him an old suit of battle armor which he found when inspecting the ship that he'll be awarded with. There Jack ingratiates himself with the fleet research project, and disables the shields as promised. While doing so Jack is asked by Holly, the head of the research project, to help with an experiment devised to retrieve the contents of the armored suit's battle recorder.</p>
<p>Jack does so, and Jack, Holly and Lya (a psychologist and Holly's girl) are sharing the experience that Felix went through on Banshee, by tapping into his suit's recorder. Much of the plot on Banshee and important commentary on it are revealed through this device. Also, the characters spend a lot of time dealing with the issues involved with reliving combat through Felix's eyes.</p>
<p>Jack comes to regret his betrayal of Holly due to a comradery that develops because of witnessing the playback, and eventually helps Holly mount an almost certainly suicidal defense against Borglyn's troops.</p>

<p>The former wife of Felix; Angel was an Earthwoman who was not popular with the people of Golden, and as a result tried to run away. During the process, there was a freighter accident and she was killed. Felix was the first to find her in the ensuing search. The emotional trauma of the event was what caused him to abscond from the throne and enlist in the Fleet.</p>

<p>Felix's best and closest friend since infancy, and holder of the title of Masao. Alejandro is the sovereign ruler of a wealthy planet of fifteen million people. When Felix disappeared from Golden, Allie spent two years tracking him down -- eventually finding him on Banshee. In order to gauge Felix's condition, the Masao used his extreme political influence to have the captain of the <i>Terra</i> give him his own drop on Banshee. His royal guard consisted of eighteen samurai in red armored suits, commanded by the head guard Suki. After making landfall, Allie confronted Felix and forced Felix to accept Angel's death. The ensuing emotional stress caused Felix's psychological desire to annihilate himself through battle to evaporate, and brought him back to a healthy emotional state. Shortly thereafter, while attempting to return to the ship, the Ants launched an artillery strike on the mission Allie's suit was critically damaged. As Felix tried to drag him to the pickup beacon, Allie died in his arms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armor_%28novel%29.html" title="Edit section: Themes:">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Themes:</span></h2>
<p>The central theme of the novel is violence and its psychological effect on people. Though, unlike some pieces that pursue this theme, <i>Armor</i> is not overtly anti-war. Felix and his development of "the Engine" is the most obvious example of this, but most of the other major characters are or were deeply affected by violent occurrences, including Jack Crow, Hollis Ware, and Lya.</p>
<p>One of the more common criticisms of Armor has been about its portrayal of the military bureaucracy, namely that no command structure could be so overwhelmingly incompetent and yet continue to function without revolt. However, real-world historical examples do exist of poorly planned or overly-protracted military campaigns (whether out of arrogance or desperation). It is important to note that since the primary theme of Armor is the nature of emotional strength, the organizational failures shown by Fleet exist primarily to accentuate the primary theme. Likewise, during the Felix portions of the novel, we never are given a clear picture of the background of the war or even of human society, save for a handful of references strewn about the book. All of this serves to eliminate unnecessary distractions from the central theme.</p>

<p>A mindset of Felix, referred to as a separate entity. It is quite like the possession effect of a Norwegian <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserker.html" title="Berserker">Berserker</a>, only much more mild. While Felix is frightened and anxious on the inside, the Engine takes complete control and handles the situation.
