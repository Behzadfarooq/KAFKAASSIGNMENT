	    <p>The term <b>Army</b>, besides its generalized meaning (see "<a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">army</a>") specifically denotes a major <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_organization.html#Units.2C_Formations_.26_Commands" title="Military organization">military formation</a> in militaries of various countries, including the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. During World War II ordinary Soviet armies initially consisted of a number of Rifle Corps. In the emergency of 1941 it was found that inexperienced commanders were finding difficulty in controlling armies with subordinate corps, and they were abolished, to be recreated later in the war.</p>
<p>Following the Second World War, an Army was reorganised with four to five divisions, often equivalent to a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corps.html" title="Corps">corps</a> in most militaries. There were large variations in structure and size.</p>
<p>During a war, an Army of Soviet military was typically subordinated to a <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_%28Soviet_Army%29_5c4c.html" title="Front (Soviet Army)">Front</a>. In peace times an Army is usually subordinated to a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_district.html" title="Military district">Military district</a>.</p>
<p>Special titles given to Soviet armies included 'Red Banner', following the award of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Red_Banner_ac51.html" title="Order of the Red Banner">Order of the Red Banner</a> and 'Shock'. The famous image of the flag over the Reichstag was of forces from 3rd Shock Army. The 1st Shock Army was formed, in accordance with pre-war planning that saw Shock Armies as special penetration formations, in November-December 1941 to spearhead the counteroffensive north of Moscow in December. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> A total of five shock armies were formed, the 2nd (former 26th Army), 3rd, and 4th (the former 27th Army) by the winter campaigns of 1942-3. During the Stalingrad counteroffensive the 5th Shock Army was the last such formation formed. 2nd Shock Army was reformed three times, most famously after being encircled in the Liuban' operation south of Leningrad, after which its commander, General <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrey_Vlasov_f499.html" title="Andrey Vlasov">Andrey Vlasov</a>, went over to the German side.</p>
<p>Armies which distinguished themselves in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat.html" title="Combat">combat</a> during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Patriotic_War_5e77.html" title="Great Patriotic War">Great Patriotic War</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> often became Guards Armies (see <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Guards_7520.html" title="Russian Guards">Russian Guards</a>).

<p>From the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Air_Force_8557.html" title="Soviet Air Force">Soviet Air Force</a>, Air Armies were attached to Fronts. They were made up of two to three Aviation Corps. One of the longest serving, still active today in the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow_Military_District_3ed8.html" title="Moscow Military District">Moscow Military District</a>, is the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_Air_Army_f388.html" title="16th Air Army">16th Air Army</a>.</p>
