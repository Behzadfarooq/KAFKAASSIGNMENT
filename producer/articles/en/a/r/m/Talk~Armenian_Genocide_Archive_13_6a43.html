<p>But Armenians don't accept this suggestion. Because, It is not clear to be a genocide. If it was not a genoside, Armenians had lied all of the World for years. And they will under impressions of World. Also Turkey will want an atonement from Armenian for their aspersion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 85.108.133.131 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.108.133.131_7ea3.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.108.133.131">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>This is just a silly turkish attempt to ignore 80 years of analysis, as if history is about joint endeavors.

<dd>That would be amusing (if it were on a less serious subject).

<dd>Lutherian, it seems as though its hard for <i>you</i> to grasp the fact that there was was indeed a genocide against Armenians perpetrated by Ottoman Turkish forces. I also like how you accuse the Armenians of having a "devious agenda" when clearly the government of Turkey has been attempting to suppress and silence mention of the event not only in Turkey but beyond their borders too. I once read that when Israeli politicians moved to have Israel recognize the event as a genocide, Turkey contacted the government and threatened the status of Jews within Turkey if the action was approved. Such an aggressive attitude will only contribute to the inevitable downfall of Turkey. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 14:36, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it is pretty obvious the only reason that it hasnt been officialy recognized as a genocidal act is because certain Nations like the United States and others wish to maintain good relations with Turkey. Furthermore, just admit that Armenians have had it rough throughout history and even had to bear the brunt of Islamic Imperialism at the hands of the ruthless Turkic barbarians.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, please keep it civilized. Whether, you're right or not. This topic is highly controversial so a NPOV is almost impossible. Just recide to facts and not to popular beliefs. I won't agree or deny there has been an Armenian Genocide: all I know is that a lot of Armenians died in those last moments of the War and if, as mentioned to me by Turks, this was a reprisal for atrocities committed by Armenians, the please proof this. It has been suggested that the proof supplied by the "Western World" is one-sided and always favours their "Christian allies". I do not see the world as divided between east and west and between Christians and muslims. If there was a Turkish genocide by Aremnians than proof this and if the proof given by so-called Armenian Supporters is wrong them please mention why. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorgenpfhartogs_f692.html" title="User:Jorgenpfhartogs">Jorgenpfhartogs</a> 15:33, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, this has been suggested quite often. Stanford Shaw a proffesor at UCLA depicted the Armenians as the victimizers rather than victims in their book <i>The Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey</i>. Bernard Lewis, a well known Western scholar of Islam has expressed similiar sentiments. This has been discussed in the epilogue of <i>The Burning Tigress</i> if you would care to research these claims more.<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_The_Dog_8950.html" title="User:Max The Dog">Max The Dog</a> 14:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I should add that these claims are not treated kindly in Balakian's book. Nor, do I personally believe the Armenians committed any acts near the scale as what was perpetrated upon them. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_The_Dog_8950.html" title="User:Max The Dog">Max The Dog</a> 14:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think, my dear fellow, that you are confusing massacre with genocide, two words with very different meanings. I dont think that professor Shaw ever said that the massacres perpetrated by Armenians on Turks amounted to an act of genocide! Balakian is not a reference as he is extremely one sided (which is to be expected from a hardcore armenian). What is being contested here is whether the massacres perpetrated by the Turks on their armenian subjects amounts to genocide. There is a world of evidence that rejects this claim and this is the main reason why this topic has been shrouded in controversy since the accusations first came to light <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 17:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Balakian is one of the finest writers that I know of (regardless of his ethnicity). I have read both <i>The Burning Tigris</i> and <i>Black Dog of Fate</i>. The former, I believe is a very solid source of information (not to mention very well-written). Balakian has certainly done painstaking research on the subject. I also enjoy his creative writing (though I enjoy the works of William Saroyan more). -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 23:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article spends far too much time explaining away why Turkey rejects the accusations of the Genocide yet little has been cited to how the Genocide was carried out. The best thing to do is move them into another article called <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial_of_the_Armenian_Genocide_58d2.html" title="Denial of the Armenian Genocide">Denial of the Armenian Genocide</a> (the current redirect is insufficent). While Turkey and to a lesser degree Azerbaijan deny the Genocide from ever occuring (other countries that do overtly deny it do it for obvious political reasons; i.e. US Congress vote in 2000), the overall consensus is that it did happen. We can spend our time editing the article on the facts we have and what was being reported back then and then devote the Denial page to what Turkey's position is to the matter and opposing views thereafter. Nearly 15 kilobytes of this article just spends time refuting Armenian charges.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 00:52, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>yes, thats perfect, why dont we rewrite histroy, remove all the opposition to the genocide thesis and make this topic a pure propaganda piece. And to add insult to injury call the opposing view denial to put them in the same category as those that deny the Jewish holocaust, like that the credibility of the opposing view can be shattered further. Wow, your modus operandi seems to be identical whoever you are as long as you are of armenian ancestory or a sympathizer because you have a serious gripe with the existance of Turkey.

<dd>The mere fact is that the "opposition" to the Genocide thesis is held by an extremely small minority: Turkey and only a handful of relatively unknown scholars. So far, the "opposing view" does not present any citations nor does not refute of what eyewitnesses were claiming back then. Its going to take much more than screaming "they were Christian, they were biased which meant they <b>lied</b>" than that. You've done little to show us what irks you so much. The Genocide has been recognized by many nations and so the opposition position does not deserve so much room on this article especially when its a minority and oft-criticized view. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 05:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You Mr. Bagramyan can argue all you want, it is a matter of FACT that your opinion of events of that period are nothing short of bigotry. When you add a gay racist satanist heavy metal bands to support your claims, propaganda ads or assume that because some fundamentalist american physician talked about massacres that his POV should be taken seriously or that convicted criminals like Akcam speak the truth whilst the words of highly respected scholars such as Lewis or Shaw should be dismissed because you and others claim that they are on the payroll of the Turkish government, its difficult to take you seriously. And maybe the most insidious and despicable addition to this topic is the attempt to make comparisons with the Jewish Holocaust to gain the sympathy of Jews. It is frankly in very bad taste! What you people fail to understand is that bullying, denigrating your opponents and making wild claims and attempting to distort the truth will get you nowhere. No wonder this argument has been dragging on for more than 90 yrs. <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 08:39, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lutherian, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Taner_Ak%C3%A7am_fee4.html" title="Taner Akçam">Taner Akçam</a> is a very credible scholar and free thinker. He is also very brave for speaking against what the government of his country is doing - attempting to suppress the facts and violating human rights. Lewis, Shaw, and McCarthy on the other hand have both been payed and sponsered by the Turkish government to support their denial of the actual events.</dd>
<dd>I would also say that the Armenian Genocide was in many ways similar to the Holocaust. Take for example the death marches, extermination centers, cutting off the "head of Armenian society" (the intellectuals, writers, etc.), throwing Armenians into a cave and then placing a torch in front of the entrance as a sort of crude "gas chamber," the cattle cars, the Armenian resistance at Musa Dagh and Van (like the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto), and of course there are even more events that I can use to compare both. Your statement that comparing it to the Jewish Holocaust is "insidious and despicable" is, in my opinion bigotry. In fact, I would say that the Genocide itself and its subsequent denial should properly be dubbed insidious and despicable. Also, you mention "bullying." All I have to say is look at Armenian and Turkey today. Who has closed off their border to Armenia? Who has forced Armenians in their own country into not accepting the Genocide? Who is trying to assimlate their Armenian population? Who dubs all Armenians as terrorists? The answer is consistently Turkey. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 10:27, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>yeah thats right Celvelander, the evil, despicable, inferior, barbarian Turks, they are the ones to blame for all the death and destruction, heck why not even the Jewish holocaust? (im surprised none of you came up with some way of blaming the Turks for the Jewish holocaust). Poooor Armenians, such an honorable and peaceful and loyal race, would not hurt a fly and how dare we call them terrorists??? For what happened in the 70's and 80's? Come on, after all it was just a bunch of inferior Turks that were murdered, its so easy to read your thoughts! Im just curious, do you believe that you are going to get Turkey to recognize a complete fallacy? And maybe follow it up by opening its borders to allow free trade? And whilst you're at it maybe throw some land as a goodwill gesture? Do you really believe that or are just insane? Have the armenians ever showed any goodwill gesture since this dispute arose?

<dd>Sorry for interfering, but i could not help myself on commenting in this: <i>Im just curious, do you believe that you are going to get Turkey to recognize a complete fallacy? And maybe follow it up by opening its borders to allow free trade?</i> (by lutherian)... I am astonished! Do u really believe that Turkey will be accepted in the EU, and we will open our borders to allow free trade and citizens' movements as long as Turkey does not fulfill the criteria? Recently the European Parliament said that the recognition of the Armenian Genocide may be a criterio for Turkey's accession... If Turkey's deep state (i never blame the people, u know:)...) wants "special treatment" (as they want in the Cyprus issue), all they'll get will be a "special relation with the EU"...

<dd>you dont get it do you? Its the desire to align itself with European norms that matters because thats where it has most to gain. Turkey has no business joining the EU and they wont, thank God for that! And you know where the EU can shove its offer for a "special relationship", right? By the middle of the century, your old fart EU will be begging for a strong enough labor force to support its rapidly ageing population. Look around you (maybe not in the case of insignificant members like greece I may add), the social institutions are crumbling under their own weight, its pathetic.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hijacked Topic</span></h2>
<p>Once again this controversial topic is hijacked by a band of hard core armenians and their sympathizers. The usual suspects: Eupator, Hectorian, Clevelander, marshalbargmayan and angus amongst others. Their complete lack of scruples and their highly biased and propagandistic approach to this topic is resulting in a very misleading view of events, way below wiki standards. Any information that contradicts the genocide thesis, irrespective of its validity is rapidly eliminated and kept out of the topic through edit warring maintained by a 24 hour monitoring by the core group and their stooges. So congratulations to you for making this arguably one of the poorest (in terms of quality of content) topics in wikiland. <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 16:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&gt; my dear friend. I am telling you I digged to find the source myself for some time. there is no source. And even Fadix had to admit that these are Russian army clothes. The only army in the world that time that uses these two types of hats were the russian Army. the only two armies that use that long hat is Russian and Ottoman army. If it is not Turkish army (my sources clearly show that) than it is the russian army. And yes none army clothes match perfectly except for the hat combination that is why I say these are armenian Volunteers accompanied by Russian Officers. Minor differences are due to weather conditions, supply problems or they are the Armenian Volunteers. And I am telling you the dead guys are circumcised. What are you after still? I addet the german clothes because the german officers were in command of the ottoman army at that time. The last one is the revolutionary army clothes (1917) I added it to show that the rifle and bayonet is Russian style since it is perfectly visible there. What written proof is needed for a Forged picture?????? Do the Turkish side has to find the source of all made up pictures. it is the responsibilty of genocide Zealots. Take a close look at that famous otoman officers posing in front of choppet heads it also has no source and looks damm like photomontage. Now who is supposed to show it is real? the Turks?

<dd>that is the tragic part.

Ottoman archives are open today Your new draft Hilmar Kaiser(or something like that)and an another armenian researcher from an armenian institute worked there for months. they copied some 3000 documents illegally and found nothing. but SECRET orders to protect armenians to supply water and food to secure their belongings are plenty. Document showing the armeinan uprising and atrocities are plenty. Orders leting armenians to come back are plenty If you had a single document from ottoman archive Diaspora could have gone to an international court and end this for all. You could get good money and recognition from Turkey. Your case is not not valid and unproveble in terms of law. actually quite disproved by Ottoman documents. That is why you cant go to a court and end this. but instead diaspora continues propaganda all around so that this will be common knowledge someday.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 00:46, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

yes Going to army and figting in all fronts while Armenians are doing bussiness and getting rich for centuries is priviladge. Anyway I understand you if this Genocide fails your whole life and Character will fall into pieces.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Armenians, Greeks, Jews and other minorities got rich only because the Muslim Turks thought to highly of themselves to be involved in "trivial" things such as accounting and being bankers. The good graces of the Ottoman Empire had nothing to do with the fact that minorities got wealthy - it was the other way around. The Sivas province during the 19th century once had 34 bankers: 31 of them Armenian, two of them Greek, and 1 of them Jewish. Islam itself was the reason why Turks did not advance in those professions until the late 19th century.

<dd>They were treated as second-class citizens (testimony inadmissable in Muslim courts, not allowed to ride on horses, carry weapons, serve in the military, pay double taxes to support the deliapidated Ottoman economy, etc.) not overtly exploited slaves (unless you readd Devshiermeh).

<p>I will not argue about Muslims not wanting to be crafts man or banker it is totally wrong and is another dogma which is simmilar to saying "there is no democracy and no science in eastern countries because of islam" totaly unable to define social mechanics. You stick to a prototype islam definition that you have learned from Christian sources but Islam is not a single entitiy.</p>
<p>Untill when the Armenians had these somewhat lesser rights? didnt they have their own courts? How many Churches and Schools did they have? And What were the rights of european Jews (the plague bearers) at that time? what may be their class in Europe 6th 7ht...? Judging 1900 with todays norms is misleading. How were black peole and indians treated in US at that time? and above all what were christians of the world were thinking of Muslims at that time? Non believer Mohammedan devils of course. I would advice you to read some missionary diaries to see that The ottoman treatment to its minorities was much more humane than all other empires of that time.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 23:17, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are hundrest of documents ordering killings in German archives despite organised clensing. There is not a single order saying "kill", "destroy" or what ever...</p>
<p>Second: Half of french armenian legion is ottoman Armenians this is clear. Musa dag armenians are ottoman Armenians right? Van armenians are Ottoman armenians right? Sasoon Armenians Are ottoman Armenians right? Karekin Pastirmaciyan is Ottoman armenian (even a member of parliement)right? Andranik(your hero general) is Ottoman armenian right? Bogos says clearly "without mentioning the 150,000 Armenians in the Imperial Russian Army, more than 40,000 of their volunteers contributed to the liberation of a portion of the Armenian vilayets, and where, under the command of their leaders, Antranik and Nazerbekoff" these are apart from Armenians who are conscribed from Russia.

<dd>None of my sources have anything to do with Christianity. The millets were headed by religous leaders so if a Christian Armenian got into a dispute with another Christian Armenian, the <i>Christian church</i> in the village would hold the trial, <i>not</i>, the Ottoman Muslim court. The Muslims did not care on what went on in internal Christian or Jewish affairs but if it was a dispute between a Christian and a Muslim, the inferiority status kicked in.</dd>

<dd><i>Musa dag armenians are ottoman Armenians right? Van armenians are Ottoman armenians right?

So you claim 10.000 people were drawned in one afternoon and it is true. make a calculation please at least use the common sense that you have for sure. All true yes... Why so many fabrications? pictures, documents, tales...?</p>
<p>About orders: in terms of law No document = no proof.</p>
<p>yes Jews were witches and bearers of plague, Black people were slaves, Indians were swept clean, 1.5 Algerians were put to death after 1950 (why no Rightfull, truth seeking, humanitarian Armenian talk about it? wasnt that a genocide too?) And poor armenians were not in the army and they were not in the court equal, they did dity jobs like banking and investment, they were in the parliment, they were in embassies so they rebelled for their land. For gods sake the woman did not have so many rights in Europe at that time.</p>
<p>Just a reminder British offically declared the events are not genocide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately some FACTS IN HISTORY (AS DESCRIBED BY FAMOUS ARMENIAN scolar "Verjiné Svazlian")can not be so easly reverted. The ottoman armenians fought ottoman army and aided Russian army with hopes for independence. VAN was monts before deportation orders. They took the city and gave it ro Russians as simple as that. These are in Armenian "genocide" victims testimonies. one of them says “Find your brothers, bring them home, let the members of the family come together again." But how would they reunite as most of them were in Andranik's army?” the other says "my uncle was with Andranik" the other says "andranik made short work of these Turks" endless examples by armenians. Mass desertations by armenians is also there described by armenians them selves. This Genocide is void in terms of LAW as simple as that. No other debate needed. Yet I undrestand you... this article is yours. I began researching this saying "ok lets see what happened" I was ready to accept anything. It doesnt create my personaliy no problem. But unfortunately you have let all your race to be embedded with the history. You have to see that we also heard stories from our elders. You may think we are lying (as usual). But what if what Nietzche said holds true for you "they thought they were living on an island yet what they landed was a sea monsters back" or as Gandi said "hate harms the hater more than the hated."

<dd>Cut the crap. No one who comes here to debate is going to change their mind, least of all Turks. However, its much more simpler for you guys to declare everything as wartime propaganda and constantly vandalize the article by writing "F____ Armenian Liars" than to face reality and facts. Recognition by other countries around the world occurs nearly every year. Blaming a phantom enemy (the Diaspora) and continuously threatening to cut diplomatic and economic ties with them reeks of desparity on the part of your country's government. I would have easily dismissed the claims of Genocide had not the entire Armenian population of the region be reduced to 60,000. According to Turkish denialists, the entire world conspired in 1915 to fabricate countless documents, photos, films, and testimonies just to blame the Turks.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 00:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My favorite one-liner is found on nearly every anti-Genocide page, "I killed Muslims by every means possible. Yet it is sometimes a pity to waste bullets for this. The best way is to gather all of these dogs and throw them into wells and then fill the wells with big and heavy stones. as I did. I gathered all of the women, men and children, threw big stones down on top of them. They must never live on this earth."

<p>One thing I want to add here, some or maybe most of the people here claim that it was genocide. I dont think so just because of the reason that it does not fit into the definition. In order for genocide of any kind to occur, the majority group should intend to destroy a national, racial, ethnic etc. group. However, during those times, armenians under the rule of the ottoman empire, helped the russian army (even joined forces). And they themselves have also massacred villages, killed muslims (even baby sksletons are discovered from ruins of muslim villages). Now, every action has a reaction (for the time being, lez assume ottomans killed the armenians). The reaction was harsh, but it was after all a reaction. I mean what do you expect to see in wars? People are killed even at this moment in iraq. ProudTurk</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">addition to # 8 The position of the international community</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to suggest the following change: On 12th April 2006, some members of the French parliament submitted a bill to create a law that would punish any person denying the existence of the Armenian genocide with up to 5 years of imprisonment and a fine of 45,000 Euros. The proposition was set to be debated on 18th May 2006, but was shelved indefinitely. French Foreign Minister Filippe Douste-Blazy said that adoption of the draft bill 'would be considered as an unfriendly gesture by a vast majority of the Turkish people', leading to 'serious political consequences' weakening France's position in Turkey and the entire region.

<dd>I second that, Neuro has a very valid point here, but, for the sake of preserving this blunder, its being ignored! FYI, the president of the Swiss confederation, after returning from a recent trip to Turkey has suggested that the anti racist laws need to be revised because they stifle honest debate (he was referring to the so called armenian genocide). The same arguement was recently put forward by prominent French historians who were arguing that politicians have no competence to decide on matters regarding history. They argued that by "legally" silencing the opposition to the genocide thesis, no proper research on the matter can be conducted. Ofcourse, non of this is mentioned in this highly biased propaganda site. <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 17:30, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genocide controversy to possibly swing dutch election</span></h2>
<p>The latest poll shows that Pvda leads CDA by 1 percentage point. But Netherlands' Turkish minority is 365,000 people (total population of netherlands is 16.3 million), out of which 235,000 is eligible to vote. A large section of that has said they will boycott the election. This is bad thing for Pvda because Turks traditionally vote heavily for them and they need the votes in such a tight election. Turks are maybe pvda's most loyal votebase. This will swing the election in favor of CDA and could mean a different government than without the genocide thing.</p>
<p>Albayrak says that she didnt say anything that admitted that the events were genocide. She told a paper today that "I'm not a politician that will trample my identity. I've always defended the same views everywhere with regard to the 'genocide' (allegations) ". It remains to be seen what happens now with Albayrak, who is just 38 years old, a 'rising star' politician who will almost certainly get a ministerial post in a Pvda government. Will such a prominent member who is number 2 on the party hierachy be dropped because of this?</p>
<p>There are also people who say that this genocide thing was brought up by the parties with intent to exclude Turks out of political process but without explicitly saying so. A proxy dressed up to be used to marginalise and humiliate a minority.</p>

<p>Elmaci gaf te kennen dat er momenteel totaal GEEN bewijs aanwezig is waardoor het een genocide betreft. Turkije heeft hun archief opengesteld voor de Armeense regering ivm onafhankelijke onderzoek, maar tot op heden is er geen reactie teruggekomen. Tijdens de 1ste wereldoorlog in 1915 zijn er van verschillende kanten slachtoffers gevallen, dus niet alleen aan de Armeense kant maar ook Turkische.</p>
<p>Wat is de clue van deze hele ophef rond de "Armeense genocide"&#160;? Niets wat op enigszins de waarheid berust. Sinds wanneer bepaalt het Nederlandse politiek wanneer iets een "genocide" betreft? Nederland en de Europese Unie zijn wel iets slimmer ingeschat om EERST met 100% proof bewijzen te komen voordat er vanuit de politiek een standpunt wordt ingenomen die NIET strookt met de werkelijkheid.

<dd>Actually, there is no reason to include the name of a scholar who isen't even remotely notable in his field or hasn't ever produced anything (record-wise personal research that is) considerable of value in the field. It would also be interesting to note that beside his apparent family name, there is nothing excluding him from Ankara's circle as a faculty member of Bilken University political science departement pretended middle eastern specialist (how else could he get published in the so credible Middle Eastern studies (ironic of course)), who Walker in the critic of his book expose his total ignorance of the Armenians, their culture, their language and what we've got here? Ankara sateliting in Australia, quoting Turkish diplomats, not even reaching 10 footnotes and shooting 'Armenian claims', 'Armenian propaganda.' Amazing the quality of the scholars neurobio could come up with. And lets quote an example from one of Walkers review of one of his books: <i>Salt claims that the real number was 265. But Salt's source reference for this figure (no. 32, on p.168) is a disconcertingly vague 'passim', from a printed volume several hundred pages long. This seems to indicate that Salt has not himself seen the actual reference, but only heard about it, maybe through his university, situated in Turkey, where truthful facts about Armenian history are still virtually state secrets. The correct page-reference is '182'. On inspection, the source turns out to relate not to a trustworthy estimate for those killed in the region in 1894, but to the number of slain individuals whose names appeared in the course of the 1895 enquiry into the events.</i> The tchekudge and kelpeten holder on the street crossing mine has written a work on subparticules that got published in some new age pseudophysic 'journal', he supposedly got a PhD when he was in the Philipines, I shall maybe include him on the opponments in articles relating to subatomic particules tsk, tsk... <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:46, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I don't think your edit acuratly depict the situation. See bolded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fadix/germanresolution" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fadix/germanresolution" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. The resolution claims the annihilation of the Armenians, the massacres were all organized by the government. It deptict the event from the official majority view, this depiction(organized destruction) can not be just limited as saying that it does not endorse it, it also compare the dark memory of the Turks with the one of Germany in regards to the Holocaust. Since this entry is not limited to the term genocide, but has more to do with the actual killings and massacres, I don't see how the German position could be limited to one word, when that resolution use the 'annihilation of the Armenian people in Anatolia which was organized by the government.' It even includes the murders from the special organization, how can you not endore genocide when you believe that a people was annihilated from the order of a government? That's the restrictive uses of the term genocide, much more restrictive than the one from the UN convention. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:26, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Probably the question is the definition of "governments who acknowledge the Armenian Genocide". I agree that the convention says that Germany acknowledges the Armenian Genocide, but if we want to split hairs we can't prove that Germany officially calls the Armenian Genocide a "genocide". Please try to reformulate as you see fit. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 16:39, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Decimated</span></h2>
<p>"Nearly 90% of the Turkish IIIrd Army was decimated by Russian forces" the article says. Seeing as "decimated" means killing every tenth perrson, that makes 9% of the Army died, not a great loss.</p>
<p>What's the real figure? Or is it supposed to mean that was 90% of the army destroyed?</p>

<p>"The single event that started the chain is most likely the Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Turkish_War%2C_1877%E2%80%9378_88fe.html" title="Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a>. At the end of the war the Russians took control over a large swath of territory inhabited by Armenia but ceded much of it after the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Berlin%2C_1878_3b6e.html" title="Treaty of Berlin, 1878">Treaty of Berlin</a> was signed. The Russians claimed they were the supporters of Christians within the Ottoman Empire and were militarily superior to the Ottomans. The weakening control of the Ottoman government over its empire in the following 15 years led many Armenians to believe that they could gain independence from it.</p>
<p>Armenian bands of raiders started a campaign of ethnic cleansing of Turkish villages. Their aim was to drive the Turkish villagers out of Armenian areas and establish Armenian strongholds throughout the region. This led to an ethnic conflict that left thousands dead on both sides."</p>
<p>I know of no true scholars of this period in history who ascribe that the origins of the Armenian Genocide have come about soley or primarily due to any Armenian aspirations for independence. The second paragraph runs particularly contrary to accepted historical analysis and is entirely unsupportable. I do agree - and have stated before - that this article is in need of a more clear presentation of the rational for the Armenian Genocide and its interconnectivity to events relating to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of Turkick identity and nationalism where non-Muslim/non-Turks came to be regarded as less then citizens - as potential competitors - who certain elements within the new "Young Turk" movement determined must be eliminated to ensure their hold on the remains of the Empire and to ensure Turkish dominance of (first the Empire as a whole - but upon loss of WWI only in regards to Anatolia proper). The two paragraphs which I removed from the article are not sufficiently accurate or factual - and in fact are misleading - particularly the second paragraph which has been recently added. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 18:27, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I welcome any sourced and scholarly coverage of relevant "Armenian Resistance Movements" (whatever they might be) as they directly pertain to the facts concerning the Armenian Genocide. However I think that we will find the truth in this case to not be to your liking. No one disputes that certain groups of Armenians developed political conciousness and awareness of their (Armenian) discriminated against and powerless and often abused status within the Ottoman Millet system and the lack of much chance for spontatnious unasked for reform by the Ottoman Sultans. Thus the rise of Armenian political movements that pushed for reform and did so by both internal (to the Sultan) and external apeal for REFORMS. The backlash (initialy from the Sultan Abdul Hamid and the Ottoman [Turkihs/Muslim] elite against Armenian calls for reforms and releif and the resentment of the foreign intervention to impose such on the Empire is what led to the series of massacres throughout the Empire in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Thes in turn led to the radicalization of certain Armenian elements and led to (limited) acts of terrorism by some of these elements. However the vast majority of Armenians - even those who had become politized and to some degree organized still only worked toward political and social reform. And in fact - with the ascendency of the CUP/Young Turk movement and the re-establishment of the constitution (suspended by Sultan Hamid) came cooperation by the major Armenian political parties - particularly the Dashnaks - and cessation of any significant violent activities on the part of Armenian groups. Scholars clearly have proven that it was not any acts commited by Armenians that led to radicallization of the Turkihs elite against Armenians - but a mirad of factors having to do with the break up/disolution of Empire where the Turkish elites came to blame minorities and outside interferrence in Ottoman affairs for the problems of the Empire and began to formulate a plan to rid the remaining territories of said Empire of such minorities where the Armenians (and Greeks of Anatolia) were seen as the most direct (potential future) threats to maintinaing Turkish soveregnty over Anatolia and the Empire proper. These are the themes that must be better addressed. Not grade school level unsubstantiated accusations that blame the actions of evil men and a dominant society twisted by collapse and defeats etc on the primary victims of such actions. Get real. Your accusations against the Armenians are exactly the accusations that Holocaust deniers make against the Jews. (spurious) Claims of sedition and efforts to undermine the dominant society are used by both sets of deniers. Each set of claims are equally unsupportable and would be entirely laughable if not for the seriousness of the subject and that fact for the hatefulness of such views. The only difference is that the Turkish state has evaded comming to terms with the truth as they were never fully defeated as Germany was in WWII and they have used a series of circumstances to ensure that any pressure to admit to past crimes can be sucessfully evaded. Thus Turkish idiots like all of you here are sheltered from the scorn that you properly deserve and you have been able to disrupt and divert the truth and include your ugliness here where it absolutely does not belong. This condition is most shameful and reflects poorly and Wikipedia and on Western society in general that you and your kind are allowed to continue to post your filthf and press your ignorance and ugliness upon us all. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 14:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
