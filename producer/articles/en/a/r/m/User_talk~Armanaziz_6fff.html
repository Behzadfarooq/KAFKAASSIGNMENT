<p>You state "Hi, I don't want to get into a lengthy debate with you on notability. Wikipedia is full of users who are adding hundreds of "trivial" items in it while important topics are being left out. My mission is not to go after all of them. But I couldn't agree that Konnie Huq passes the Notability requirement of wikipedia. Wikipedia's notability requirement is -</p>
<p>"a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</p>
<p>What constitutes "published works" is broad and encompasses published works in all forms, including but not limited to newspapers, books and e-books, magazines, television and radio documentaries, reports by government agencies, scientific journals, etc." —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Armanaziz (talk • contribs) 02:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)."</p>
<p>I am at a loss to see how Huq fails your notability requirement. Have you read the article? Have you Googled her name?

<p>You put a Bangladesh template on the sari article. Well, the sari is also worn in India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. Putting all those templates up on top of the page is pointless.

<dd>If you put the Bangladeshi template, then all the other countries where the sari is worn will add their templates, and one or two screens will be devoted to huge flaunting nationalistic templates.

<p>Aziz, that's a very bad article. It is full of dubious unsourced statements and it is badly written. I wouldn't send anyone there.</p>
<p>I am sure that there are good articles in Banglapedia, but this is not one of them. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't be driven by nationalistic issues because I'm not South Asian. The Hindu nationalists hate me. They've accused me of being Pakistani. As a matter of fact, the Iranian nationalists hate me too -- one of them accused me of being a Bangladeshi. All I can say is, if I'm Bangladeshi, I want the appropriate jewelry and saris for my new role in life.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't about nationalism. This is about adding quality links. The article isn't very good. If you wrote it, well, I'm sorry to be blunt, but it could use some improvement. References would help greatly. You possibly have access to histories of costume in languages that I can't speak or read. Good *academic* works. Quotations in the original, then translations, would be helpful. Sober, skeptical historical method would help too. Bring the article up to snuff and I don't think anyone would oppose the link. In fact, we might steal some of your work. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here are my answers, inline:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>i) I don't have Bengali typing skills.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Have you tried using Avro or other phonetic Bangla typing tools? I don't have any Bangla typing skills either. But in phonetic typing tools, the tool converts your keystrokes into Bangla as you type. So, to type আরমান, you'd have to type only a-r-m-a-n. So, no memorizing needed. We are also integrating the phonetic typing keyboards with the bn-wiki edit boxes, so in future, you won't have to type anything.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>ii) is it adding much academic/ educational value? Whoever can log into wikipedia to read bangla articles should also be able to read the english ones and understand their meaning. The opposite is not true for non-Bengalis.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>You are quite mistaken in this!! As part of my personal research, I wrote a paper about the readability of Wikipedia articles. It turns out that, even for native speakers, the average English wikipedia article requires 12 to 15 years of education. For featured articles, the average is 19 to 13 years of education. So, how do you expect someone from Bangladesh opening up an English wikipedia article and understand everything?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a general purpose encyclopedia in Bangla? Banglapedia is there, but it is ONLY about the south asian history/culture related topics, and quite limited. In 50 years, if you don't have anything online, it will virtually disappear from the world. If we don't start building the Bangla wikipedia right away, our language will go down the drain. Sure, when information is needed, it will be available in English. But if people require English knowledge to gain information, Bangla as a language gets seriously undermined. You surely can't expect school students to be able to understand US High school/college level English, do you? If we don't start providing this base for the next generation, Bangla will cease to exist online. (You might ask how many people have Internet access. Well, not too many now, but we are planning a CD release for rural schools.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you understand my point. Everything has a starting point, and 6 years ago, the same questions could have been asked about English Wikipedia. Bangla wikipedia is just now getting out of its shell ... but we expect it to proliferate in a few years. Already, unicode based Bangla is taking its root in the Internet. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 05:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, convincing. I'll try to explore more abut Avro - it sounds very interesting. And I accept your argument on need of Bnagla Wikipedia. May be once I figure out a way of typing in Bangla, I'll contribute there as well. However, right now English wkipedia remains my priority.-<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmanaziz_a582.html" title="User:Armanaziz">Arman Aziz</a> 05:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have started working on the article <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Bangladesh_a45b.html" title="Education in Bangladesh">Education in Bangladesh</a>. It was in an extremely bad shape. The last few edits were turning it into a motley hotchpotch of text, link and image for private university/English medium agenda-pushers. Even without that the article had little content. I have began by putting in an enormous amount of fresh text, and even more massive amount of resource links (Banglapedia, government sites and downloadable pdf links). Now the real work should begin. Would you lend a hand in this? I can't do it alone. Do you have anyone else in mind who might help? That person doesn't need to be Bangladeshi. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 17:54, 17 March 2007 (UTC) - please, answer to <a href="../../../a/d/i/User_talk%7EAditya_Kabir_1620.html" title="User talk:Aditya Kabir">my talk page</a></p>

<dd>I guess, a shortening of the sections <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Bangladesh_a45b.html#Education_system" title="Education in Bangladesh">Education in Bangladesh#Education system</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Bangladesh_a45b.html#Education_management" title="Education in Bangladesh">Education in Bangladesh#Education management</a> would be a good place to begin. Both has way too much copy. And, while doing it, please, lend a hand in removing the POV out of these two sections as well. Much of it reads like government press handouts. In-line citation can happen later, I think. I hope you dont mind this request.
