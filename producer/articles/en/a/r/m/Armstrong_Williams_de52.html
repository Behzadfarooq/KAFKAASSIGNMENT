<p>In January 2005, <i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> reported that documents obtained under the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_Information_Act_920f.html" title="Freedom of Information Act">Freedom of Information Act</a> revealed that Williams had been paid $240,000 to promote the controversial <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act_51fb.html" title="No Child Left Behind Act">No Child Left Behind Act</a> ("NCLB") of the Bush administration. According to <i>USA Today</i>, Williams was hired to "to promote the law on his nationally syndicated television show and to urge other black journalists to do the same." <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Williams was required "to regularly comment on NCLB during the course of his broadcasts," and to interview Education Secretary <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Paige_64e3.html" title="Rod Paige">Rod Paige</a> for TV and radio spots that aired during the show in 2004." <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The contract with Williams was part of a $1 million contract between the U.S. Department of Education and the public relations company, <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketchum.html" title="Ketchum">Ketchum</a>.</p>
<p>Melanie Sloan from <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington_ee28.html" title="Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> told <i>USA Today</i> that the contract may be illegal "because Congress has prohibited <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>," or any sort of lobbying for programs funded by the government. "And it's propaganda," she said. <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Miller_3394.html" title="George Miller">George Miller</a>, a member of the House Education Committee, called the contract "a very questionable use of taxpayers' money" that is "probably illegal." <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington_ee28.html" title="Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> was founded in 2001 by Melanie Sloan, a former aide to Representative John Conyers (D-MI) and Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY).</p>
<p>After the <i>USA Today</i> revelations, Tribune Media Services terminated its syndication agreement with Williams. In a statement to <i>Editor and Publisher</i> (not available on its website), TMS stated: "[A]ccepting compensation in any form from an entity that serves as a subject of his weekly newspaper columns creates, at the very least, the appearance of a conflict of interest. Under these circumstances, readers may well ask themselves if the views expressed in his columns are his own, or whether they have been purchased by a third party." <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000749251" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000749251" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Williams told Associated Press "even though I'm not a journalist — I'm a commentator — I feel I should be held to the media ethics standard. My judgment was not the best. I wouldn't do it again, and I learned from it." <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/politics/2982711" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/politics/2982711" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Rather than criticize the arrangement, White House press secretary <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_McClellan_2ed5.html" title="Scott McClellan">Scott McClellan</a> said it was a matter for the Education Department. According to Associated Press the Education Department said the deal was a "permissible use of taxpayer funds under legal government contracting procedures." <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/politics/2982711" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/politics/2982711" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Ketchum discussed the controversy with trade publications such as <i>PRWeek</i> and <i>O'Dwyer's PR Daily</i>, but did not respond to national media outlets at the request of the Department of Education.</p>
<p>As the controversy raged on, Scott McClellan remained noncommittal on whether White House staff knew of the deal with Williams. "I'm not sure that senior staff was consulted before this decision was made. I haven't heard anything to that effect," he said. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/01/20050110-8.html#4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/01/20050110-8.html#4" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Three days after the story broke, McClellan claimed he was unaware of the details of the contract and that specific questions should be directed to the Education Department. As to whether Williams should have disclosed the details of the contract in his columns and on-air appearances, McClellan would only concede that "those are all legitimate questions." Asked whether he would investigate whether other journalists were on the payroll of the administration, McClellan replied, "I'm not aware of any others that are under contract other than the one that's been reported on in the media."</p>
<p>Following the revelations of the Williams contract with Ketchum, the watchdog group <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington_ee28.html" title="Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> announced that it had filed Freedom of Information requests with 22 agencies requesting copies of all contracts with public relation firms. <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=41504" class="external autonumber" title="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=41504" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>The <i>USA Today</i> revelations caused controversy within the PR industry as well. As soon as the story broke, Edelman Public Relations CEO Richard Edelman posted a note on his personal blog criticizing Ketchum's deal with Williams. "This kind of pay for play public relations takes us back in time to the days of the press agent who would drop off the new record album and $10 to the deejay. It makes our industry's efforts to 'clean up' behavior in newly created PR markets such as China and Russia look decidedly ridiculous," he wrote. <a href="http://www.edelman.com/speak_up/blog/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.edelman.com/speak_up/blog/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>"I know Ray Kotcher and Dave Drobis of Ketchum. I am sure that they would never tolerate this kind of contractual arrangement. I am also confident that they will take steps to assure that it never happens again," he wrote. While Edelman was confident Ketchum's management would take a stand against the practice, <i>O'Dwyers PR Daily</i> noted that "Kotcher has not returned this website's phone and e-mail requests for comment." <a href="http://www.odwyerspr.com/members/0112edel_kotch.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.odwyerspr.com/members/0112edel_kotch.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>"Some things are black and white. We need to set a very high standard of disclosure for our business, with total transparency on funding sources and mission. We should also eschew any practice that calls into question the integrity of the information being disseminated. Let's try to turn this negative for our industry into a positive, by making a long term commitment to the best ethical behavior," Edelman wrote.</p>
<p>While the White House equivocated, the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Relations_Society_of_America_b4a9.html" title="Public Relations Society of America">Public Relations Society of America</a> issued a statement saying "the relationship should have been disclosed up front, no question." <a href="http://www.prsa.org/_News/leaders/disclosure0111.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prsa.org/_News/leaders/disclosure0111.asp" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
