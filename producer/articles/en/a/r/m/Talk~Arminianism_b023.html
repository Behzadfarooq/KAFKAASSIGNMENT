<p>Arminianism is actually a lie from the pit of hell that elevates man's "will" over the very Sovereign nature of God Himself. We are all clay for God to do with as he pleases.</p>
<p>Any Arminian who believes that he chose God is "choosing" to believe only the parts of the Bible that he/she deems appropriate. Please read John 1:12,13 and Roman 9:16. Also John 3:27.</p>

<dd>I could not disagree more. Arminianism is, in my view, a faithfully Biblical interpretation of the Christian life and theology. That said, perhaps this is not the best forum for your own personal evangelization ministry.

He has never read the book, "How to Win Friends and Infuence people",but does have a point, you can go to the beach and love "all" the sand. Does it mater to you where you build your castle, or spread out your blanket? You don't have to touch all the sand, if you did why would God leave it up to us to do his work.

<p>Well, it seems to me that this dude is a fundamentalist Calvinist. I personally am not a Calvinist, I don't accepts its teachings and believe that Calvinism contradicts John 3:16 - For God so loved the WORLD that he gave his one and only Son, that WHOEVER believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. I don't believe the Bible teaches limited atonement it is open for all. The biggest misconception Calvinist have about Arminians is that they believe that we believe that we are the ones who look for God first, we don't believe that. We believe God looks for men through Prevenient Grace. God seeks men but men responds to that invitation but we can resist the salvation grace we don't belive in iresistable grace becuase that contradicts John 3:16. I'm a Arminian-Wesleyan and I'm not a Methodist. I belive salvation is open for all if we respond to the Sweet Holy Spirit's invitation but we most certainly can say No. Logically we believe like in Marriage what gives you the sense of your relationship? Was it because you wacked your wife on top of the head? Or did you court her, invited her out on dates, talked to her sweet and asked her to be your girlfriend and continued and asked to be your wife? And she said out of her will Yes; oh and I hope you are still doing all of that to your wife. So what gives you the sense of your relationship was that your wife chose to respond to you out of her own will. Is not marriage a partial representation of the relationship we have with God? Who invented marriage? Now is it possible in the future one can say to his spouse I don't want anything to do with you any more, and what can the other person do? Nothing, in a way that is what gives our sense of relationship that even if you have been married 25, 20, 10, 15, 5 or recently married you love each other out of you own will not because it's forced, that is why Praying it won't ever happen a individual can say to his spouse I don't want nothing with you any more or leave them and what can the other person do? Nothing. Our relationship with God is similar to marriage we are the bride of Christ. Let's remember Paul told Timothy to be careful with money or with philosophies because some people looking for those things wander off the faith or left the faith or abandend the faith. Saying that I would never say Calvinism is from the "pit of hell" I have numerous friends that are Calvinist, in fact one of my best friends is a Calvinist and his wife, who is a good friend from h.s., is Arminian. I witness to her 10 years ago in h.s. and she chose to respond to God's calling. She does not believe she was pre-elected for salvtion because she is the only beliver in her family. She presented the gospel to all her siblings and they all said No. She told me she believes that they have their choices to make and to say she was the only one her family to be pre-elected seems to be a unjust God. She met her husban a few years later and they married and live well. I finish saying in essentials unity, in non-essentials diversity, and in all the rest charity. 167.88.178.70 21:09, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I eliminated a sentence in the lead paragraph which read, <i>"It is not inconsistent with the general understanding of the Roman Catholic church in the areas of concern."</i> The sentence itself is a bit vague (what areas of concern does it refer to?), and I'm just not sure what it means. Mind you, there are plenty of similarities between Arminian belief and RC doctrine, but without context, I just felt uncomfortable with the sentence and its location in the lead paragraph (is similarity to RC doctrine so notable as to be in the lead? I don't think so.). <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 14:16, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not wish to be dogmatic here, but the basic theology seems to be consistent (though perhaps not identical) with RC understanding -- the areas of concern would be the five Remonstrance points. It would be noteworthy that the general Arminian understanding on those issues extends beyond Protestantism. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Ellis_8ea9.html" title="User:Jim Ellis">Jim Ellis</a> 14:25, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What "basic theology", <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Ellis_8ea9.html" title="User:Jim Ellis">Jim</a>? Please be specific. Arminianism is a solidly Protestant school of thought...both historically and theologically. Now, is it more similar to RC thought than, say, Calvinism? Sure. But please be more specific. What "issues" are you referring to? in which Arminianism extends "beyond Protestantism"? <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">Keith</a> 14:54, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I'm not mistaken, RC doctrine = Universal atonement, resistible grace, no eternal security prior to death, free will, and conditional election. Granted that beyond these points Arminianism is Protestant (especially contra the sacramentalism and sacerdotalism of the RC) but in these doctrines they agree. If so, it is noteworthy. If not in the lead paragraph, then in dicussion below. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Ellis_8ea9.html" title="User:Jim Ellis">Jim Ellis</a> 15:09, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it could be fair to mention that regarding four of the five points of Calvinism, Arminians are closer to RC belief than Calvinist belief, but let's not overplay the matter. It certainly isn't so noteworthy as to be in the lead paragraph (probably better in the "theology" section). But there's a whole lot more to being Protestant than agreeing with TULIP! Your recent edit read to me as implying that Protestantism is equal to Calvinism, which is, of course, entirely incorrect. Forgive me if I misunderstood. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">Keith</a> 15:21, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Put it another way: it's a historically interesting question as to how much the Synod of Dort in 1617 was influenced by the perceived similarities between Arminianism and RC theology. It appears to me that at the back of the minds of the Dort coveners was a suspicion that the Remonstrants were trying to drag Holland back into an RC way of thinking. Resisting the RC church was on their minds both theologically and politically. I think the article *might* benefit from a discussion of the Arminian-RC connections, as they were perceived at the time.</dd>

<p>I frankly have some trouble following the finer points of Christian theology. It's not especially clear to me whether the points listed in the entry here are supposed to be the Calvinist points which Arminianism refutes, or the anti-Calvinist, Arminian, refutations themselves. I don't think I'm particularly stupid and I am fairly well-read on theology and philosophy, so perhaps others might have trouble following this as well. Can anything be done to make this clearer? -- 14 October 2005</p>

<dd>Technically the 5 Points of the Remonstrants was a rejection of unchangeable confessions and catechisms. That should be edited out to say "The Remonstrants (who refuted being called “followers of Arminus” or “Arminians”) offered five articles which showed their understanding of divine grace, which are:" ---r- 00:01, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with the anonymous questioner above: The "contra the Calvinist doctrine of ..." lead-outs on each point make it seem that Arminianism was a reaction to Dort's TULIP. Historically, Calvin's <i>Institutes</i> came first; then Arminianism; and finally the Synod of Dort (1619). Until Dort, the Reformed churches had not declared a doctrinal stance on predestination et. al. Note: I'm not denying that Calvin taught all of the things attributed to him; he did. I'm simply pointing out that someone not familiar with the history of these ideas might get a chicken-and-egg confusion from the article. I'm going to attempt to clean up the wording. --<a href="../../../j/r/c/User%7EJrcagle_8a9a.html" title="User:Jrcagle">jrcagle</a> 04:39, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The five summarized points here are actually resorting more to folk belief than actual fact. Here's the actual 5 points <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc09.remonstrants.html#remonstrants-p9.1" class="external text" title="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc09.remonstrants.html#remonstrants-p9.1" rel="nofollow">| here</a> and can be summarized as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditional Election: God elects those who believe</li>
<li>Unlimited Atonement Applied only by Believers: Christ died for all but it is only made applicable by those who believe</li>
<li>Deprivation: Man has no free will and must be born again (this one is being completeley misrepresented)</li>
<li>Resistable Grace: Man needs God's prevenient grace to do good but even so can resist God's overarching grace of salvation.</li>
<li>Assurance and Security with Questions: No one can pluck anyone out of God's hands and is given power to remain there yet the fact that there are those who say they believe, walk away, deny Christ...well, let's just say we have to study before prescribing to those people actually persevering.</li>

<p>I read an article about Independent Fund. Baptists which suggests they lean more in the direction of Arminianism than Calvinism. The only point where they're clearly Calvinist is in the security of the believer. They're OSAS (once saved, always saved). Other than that, they seem to believe that we have the ability to choose to repent with HS help, we can resist the grace of God, that Christ died for the world, and that pre-destination is based upon God's foreknowledge of who would choose His Son. Funnily enough, the author went on to opine that just because they agree mostly with Arminianism doesn't make them Arminians. The doctrine of Independent Baptists pretty much mirrors that of SBC and other conservative Baptists.</p>

<p>I must question the statement that Anglicans lean toward Calvinism. This may be true of some of those within the evangelical stream, but it certainly cannot be said to be true of Anglicanism as a whole. Anglo-Catholics, for example, are definitely not Calvinists. I have never heard anything even mildly Calvinist preached in the middle-of-the-road Anglican churches I have attended.</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand anglicanism doesn't lean towards armininism either. (Just look at the 39 articles!) For example the large body of evangelical churches in the CoE are definitely more calvinist than arminian. Someone had evidently changed "anglicans lean towards calvinism" to "anglicans lean towards arminianism" and neither being right, I have removed mention of anglicans altogether!

<p>David, overall, I appreciate your thoroughness in attempting to document the article, but I think the quotes are too long and too many. I deleted the quotes in the Calvinist section because I don't think they added much to the article. We just need a summary of the differences there, and the reader can read the full-up doctrine articles for more details. Similar comments apply to some other sections.</p>
<p>Next, I would suggest redoing your footnote scheme. You shouldn't number them explicitly (either with the parenthesized number or with "10-Wesley") because it's likely that some reference will be added or deleted at some point (as you'll note that I did), which will require renumbering all of them. You can use a pound sign to automatically number a list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some reference</li>
<li>Some other reference</li>
</ol>
<p>The reference names could contain a number indicating which author reference you're citing (e.g., "Wesley-1", "Calvin-1"), but they shouldn't correspond to the overall order of the notes.</p>
<p>Finally, I left the bit on Christian Perfection intact, but I think it needs to be shortened and clearly specified how Wesley departs from the rest of Arminianism on that point. What would/did Arminius and other non-Wesleyans think of his doctrine of perfection?</p>
<p>Just some thoughts. Overall, I think it's good work. Kudos! --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 14:50, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I copied the above comment from Flex from my <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Schroder_Arminianism_ae75.html" title="User talk:David Schroder/Arminianism">user sandbox</a> (where I was working on this page prior to uploading it to the main page) for reference. The edits he is referring to were made on the sandbox page, so I made most of those changes here for him. They mostly included minor rephrasing and formatting. The one major change was the removal of the quotations in the comparison to Calvinism. I am currently re-working those quotes into their respective articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There were a few I did not make, per my request to discuss major changes here in Talk before applying them:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Removal of the Harper quote in the "Wesleyan Arminianism" section "Possibility of Apostasy"</li>
<li>Removal of the corresponding footnote</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My comment: The Harper quote re: Wesley &amp; apostasy, to my eyes, clarifies a common misconception about Methodism - namely that salvation is lost with the commital of one sin. The Harper quote adds some very relevant information about Wesley's view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The whole format of the article is built around the "state it then source it" paradigm. The intended orginizational style was very encyclopedic, but I also desired the referencing style to be very journalistic. Most privately-written, published encyclopedias do not source anything, but rather put a generic list of "references" at the bottom of the article. Wikipedia's policies seem to disagree this - quotations and citations in-body are thoroughly encouraged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The comment about citations is well-made. I had trouble finding any good examples of footnotes on Wikipedia while writing this page, but after it was written I found some better information. Changes to footnote format to make it more user-friendly will come shortly.</dd>

<dd>I should also note that the section on Corporate election will be reduced when I finish the article on Conditional election. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 17:47, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>David, I didn't mean to suggest that you shouldn't source the article. I think you've done a great job with stating and sourcing appropriately. What my previous comment failed to communicate is that I think we should quote less and summarize more, even though we keep the footnotes in place. In other words, I'd like to see more summaries of what such-and-such author says rather than a long-ish quote from him. In some circumstances, I certainly think the quotes can be warranted, but many of them don't say anything so succinctly or profoundly that they couldn't be merely recapped, IMHO.</p>
<p>BTW, I suggested corrections that you'll notice are lacking in some of the articles I've done a lot of work on (e.g. <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_depravity.html" title="Total depravity">total depravity</a>). I, too, have learned how to footnote and use templates better than I have done previously. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 14:30, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Flex, makes sense. I guess part of my reason for using quotations is that they cannot be edited to say something different - they can only be removed, which seems to be a larger obstacle. Statements such as the very one at the top of this talk page show that many people have a vested interest in seeing Arminianism proclaimed as heresy - even in a format that is supposed to be neutral. I have a vested interest in seeing Arminianism represented <i>historically</i> and <i>accurately</i>, even I view it hurts my personal arguments for or against (e.g. I believe that open theism severely harms Arminianism's credibility, but I still tried to portray it accurately).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore...because Arminianism is a controversial issue, I thought it would be a helpful means to <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> to let the authors speak for themselves. That way, it's not my words, your words, or Joe Schmo's words. In a similar way, I thought the article on <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconditional_election.html" title="Unconditional election">unconditional election</a> was good because it portrayed this very easily misunderstood and oft-debated topic in the words of the secondary sources (Bible being the primary source).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess in the end, I gave more weight to letting the article about Arminianism be "what the primary historical proponents said" and less about phraseology. Indeed, I've read many articles where readability is completely destroyed by "Group A says this...but Group B believes this...though Group A would counter with this...which in turn denies what Group B says about this..."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there's any particular passages you'd like to see clarified, let's work through them. Just because I originally wrote it one way does not mean it might be better another way. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 16:16, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Oh, I forgot to add...you changed the Calvinist view on irresistible grace to the following: "Calvinists hold that when God exercises his prevenient grace, he regenerates an individual's heart and that person necessarily exercises faith. That is, Calvinists believe God exercises irresistible grace when bringing the elect to salvation." This seems a bit unwieldy to me, I'd probably recommend something more akin to "Calvinists consider grace and <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regeneration.html" title="Regeneration">regeneration</a> inseperably linked as part of an <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irresistible_grace.html" title="Irresistible grace">irresistible</a> process in which God changes the will of the elect to exercise faith."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also made a minor change to the grammer of your edit on atonement, but thought the additional clarification was nice. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 16:29, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That change about irresistible grace is fine by me. Go ahead and put it in. Funny that you cite unconditional election as a supporting example. Personally, I think it is the weakest of the "five points" articles for the same reason that you like it! I think <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_depravity.html" title="Total depravity">total depravity</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perseverance_of_the_saints.html" title="Perseverance of the saints">perseverance of the saints</a> are the best of the five.</p>
<p>Also, the change you made about both Arminians and Calvinists believing the call is universal -- that's not quite true. Some Calvinists deny it (see the cited article). --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 16:47, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I realized that after I made the change, so I substituted the word "call" for the word "message". Because the message encompasses both mercy and justice, I figured this would be accurate. If it's not, then it's probably worth changing back to something like "Most Calvinists believe" instead of "Both groups agree", etc. though the emphasis on unity is lost. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 17:08, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On second thought, I altered the wording of the "Nature of grace" a little bit. I think that it is important to note that Calvinists (e.g. Hodge) also teach prevenient grace, which just means grace that comes before faith. The difference seems to be in what it accomplishes. Arminian P.G. seems to enable people whereas Calvinist P.G. enables and coerces them, as it were, since God has unconditionally elected them. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 19:39, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For reference, here is Flex's change:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Calvinists hold that this prevenient grace is irresistible such that when God's regenerates an individual's heart that person is not just enabled to but necessarily does exercise faith.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm, this is an interesting point, I'd never heard a Calvinist claim prevenient grace (albeit under a different understanding). I guess it's parallel to how Arminians embrace predestination - again, albeit a different understanding. It does seem from the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevenient_grace.html" title="Prevenient grace">Prevenient grace</a> article that some (most?) Calvinists reject the title, choosing to differentiate between <i>common</i> and <i>saving</i> grace. <i>Prevenient</i> grace, as used originally by Arminius and later adopted by Wesley, seems to include aspects of both. Indeed I've never heard a Calvinist use that term - it's always "saving grace" or "irresistible grace". I don't have any opinion about Calvinists claiming that term, especially because it's not a Biblical term, but I'm not sure how that effects the linking to the very Arminian-focused article of the same name (which contrasts the <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irresistible_grace.html" title="Irresistible grace">Irresistible grace</a> article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your change also seems to blur the line between grace and regeneration in an article about Arminianism, which distinctly differentiates between them. I understand your desire to link grace, regeneration, and faith (which is very accurate to the Calvinist confessions) but I'm not quite happy with your change as it stands. I'd suggest the following change:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Arminians believe that through God's <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevenient_grace.html" title="Prevenient grace">grace</a>, he restores free will concerning salvation to all humanity, and each individual, therefore, is able either to accept the Gospel call through faith or resist it through unbelief. Calvinists hold that God's grace to enable salvation is given only to the elect and <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irresistible_grace.html" title="Irresistible grace">irresistibly</a> leads to salvation.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Stating it this way, to me, highlights the key difference: whether grace is resistible or not. Arminian PG, if not resisted, always leads to salvation. A Calvinist would agree, but say that there is no possibility of resistance. To an Arminian, grace is still strongly causal - at least in the sense that is <i>influential</i>. The difference is whether God calls a few who <i>must</i> come to Christ or whether God calls all, but allows the option of man backing out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While stating it this way doesn't allow for what a Calvinist would consider a full understanding of the doctrine of irresistible grace (by whatever name), this <i>is</i> an article about Arminianism and the section is specifically the <i>differences</i> between the two, not complete doctrines summed up in one sentance. And I'd also say that the Arminian sentance doesn't do anything near justice to the full doctrine, but is similarly sufficient for highlighting the differences. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 20:43, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On closer reading, I don't think Hodge uses "prevenient grace" to describe the Calvinist view, though I think he would be justified in doing so. He does <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.xiv.vi.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.xiv.vi.html" rel="nofollow">note</a>, however, that the Scholastics (particularly, Aquinas) used that term (<i>gratia preveniens</i>) well before Arminius and Wesley and probably in a sense neither of us would not approve of.</p>
<p>Also, the firm distinction between common and saving grace is not entirely clear within Reformed Theology. Calvin himself uses "common grace" to speak of what we would call "saving grace" in two of the four passages in which he uses the term (see L. Berkhof, <i>Systematic Theology</i>, part 4, III.B.1, and H. Kuiper <i>Calvin on Common Grace</i>). In later Reformed thought, the term came to mean what is commonly expressed today (i.e., grace given to all men or even all creation), though it can also mean grace common to the believers and non-believers who are part of the covenant community, and the term "particular grace" (or "special grace") referred to the grace that was given only to the elect.</p>
<p>All this is rather irrelevant as far as the intro goes. I like it better as it stands now, and I think the section on the differences with Calvinism is also in good shape. Kudos! --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 03:35, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "in Christ" idea is a subset of Arminianism (see corporate election) but wouldn't be held mainstream. Most Arminians would say that election preceeds salvation temporally and is based on forknowledge. But I agree, it wasn't as clear as it could be. Because the doctrine is defined with more clarity and depth both in the above section and in the respective daugher article (coming soon!), I just left it saying "Arminians hold that election to eternal salvation has the condition of faith attached." Just that statement is enough to clarify the difference between it and Calvinism, and it's less ambiguous. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 20:43, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't trying to distinguish between two views within Arminianism with the phrase "in Christ." Rather, I was just quoting the scriptural language (e.g. 1 Cor 1:2; Col. 1:2). I didn't quite understand what the two different prepositions in the previous version meant and just wanted to clarify. Your change above does that. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 13:09, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Flex, why'd you change the intro? I'm reverting it to the phraseology it had originally, as I believe it is a clearer summary of the main article (the purpose of the lead). The main idea is <i>not</i> that salvation can be lost (at least by itself), but that salvation <i>remains</i> conditional on faith. Saying that "God's prevenient grace enables but does not compel faith" doesn't even come close to being an accurate summation of the Arminian doctrine - it honestly sounds like a Calvinist rendition. I strongly prefer my use of the word "deterministic" because it implies the two very principles that set this doctrine apart - (1) that God does not choose a small number to show grace to, and (2) that his grace is not a foregone conclusion - it can be resisted.</p>
<p>I also am frustrated that you removed the headings to the notes section - because there are so many footnotes, I thought it was very helpful to leave those headings. If a user wanted to see what general books he should look at for Wesleyan theology, for example, it's clearly discernable.</p>
<p>These are the types of changes that, in my opinion, should talked about here in discussion before being effected. Notice that when I dislike or disagree with something you've written, I make a note of it here in talk first.</p>
<p>I'm going to revert these changes. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 20:56, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>David, first let me apologize. I didn't think those were major changes worthy of discussion here, and I am happy to delay their inclusion until more agreeable language can be hammered out here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, my rationale for the change about perseverance was that the section was highlighting the differences between Calvinist and Arminian soteriology, but the phrase "continued salvation is conditional upon continued faith" applies equally to traditional Calvinism and Arminianism. It only shows a difference with non-traditional Calvinism, which we generally do not refer to as Calvinism without a qualifier. Dropping that phrase to make it "Salvation can be lost" clearly and succinctly identifies the difference in the two systems and includes both traditional and non-traditional Calvinism. The details about the Arminian doctrine that don't highlight the differences should be left to the non-intro sections.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "deterministic": I strongly object to that word, not because it is altogether inaccurate, but because the connotation of the word makes it a loaded term and inherently non-neutral. I would prefer a different phrasing, even if it's not the one that I inserted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the headings in the notes: I, too, thought the headings were helpful, but you no doubt noticed that I also changed the notes to use a numbered list. Unfortunately, the presence of the headings resets the numbering scheme, e.g.:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Heading 1</i>
<ol>
<li>Note 1</li>
<li>Note 2</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd><i>Heading 2</i>
<ol>
<li>Note 3</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps there is a way around this problem, and if so, I would gladly have the headings reapplied. If a solution can't be found, however, I think using a non-hard coded footnote scheme should take priority over the use of headings because the note/ref templates have links that help in the navigation and make it not so difficult to find the references for a particular section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'm sorry I didn't realize that these changes would evoke strong feelings, and had I done so, I certainly would have discussed them here. Mea culpa. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 13:30, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Flex, I probably got a bit too worked up about it. No hard feelings, I knew it wasn't your intention.</p>
<p>Re: the lead...what I had originally written was phrased more similar to the structure of the article - it highlighted the main tenets (but did not compare/contrast with Calvinism). I honestly think my original format was better - this article is not titled <i>Arminianism, as it compares to Calvinism</i> although from a Calvinist perspective that's what is helpful. Instead, this article is about Arminianism, with <i>reference</i> to Calvinism because of the relevance.</p>
<p>Since the lead is supposed to be a summary of the main article, I think going back to that concept would be the simplest resolution for the "salvation can be lost" issue. That way Arminianism's tenets become the main focus - not just as they contrast with Calvinism. In other words - have the lead summarize the theology with reference to differences - instead of having the lead summarize differences with reference to theology.</p>
<p>Re: <i>deterministic</i> - I'm not sure how this word doesn't apply to Calvinism...the whole system rests on God's determination, not man's. Therefore his grace becomes <i>deterministic</i> - our reactions (with regards to salvation) are not random, but purely cause-and-effect. I can see how this narrow adjectival use of the term (where it directly modifies "grace") can be confused with <a href="../../../d/e/t/Determinism.html" title="Determinism">determinism</a> as a philosophy system (which Calvinism does indeed reject - at least at that detail level. I can also see how this use can conjure up connotations of lack of free will (whereas the Calvinist distinction is that free will exists, but God <i>changes</i> our will to effect faith). So, because of those reasons, in combination with the respect I still hold for many Calvinists, and a desire to be NPOV, I'll rephrase that.</p>
<p>My change will instead read "God allows his grace to be resisted by those unwilling to believe"</p>
<p>Re: notes, see <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a> for how I've been planning on updating them. There's a new footnote format that's an update to the footnote3 method (the ref and note commands) That way, the footnotes are tied directly to the note itself. I haven't figured out a good way to keep the headings using this method though; still a work in progress.</p>

<p>I've made changes to the notes system; I still couldn't find a way to include formatting, so you'll notice I added a small section that details which footnotes belong where. I think that's the best solution, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>I also wonder why it's relevant to include some of the resources you added to the "Opposing" section; the three that I put in there all have sections specific to Arminianism, including critiques. I'm not familiar with all the ones you added - if part of their purpose is to address Armininianism directly, than they're probably very beneficial. If they're just standard defenses of Calvinism, they probably belong on the main Calvinism page - in the same way, most of the "supporting" books referenced here don't address Calvinism directly and shouldn't be included as "Further resources" on the Calvinism page. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 16:13, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>David, I tend to think the headings should be deleted simply because they won't be kept up to date automatically, and it will become tedious/error-prone to keep them up to date manually. Anons and various other people <i>will</i> add text and notes and move things around. That's just the nature of the Wikipedia. So I suggest we make things more maintainable by deleting the headings -- unless an automatic way to maintain them can be found. One way might be to use HTML instead of Wikipedia tags:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li style="list-style: none"><br />
<b>Heading 1</b></li>
<li>Note 1</li>
<li>Note 2<br />
<b>Heading 2</b></li>
<li>Note 3</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As you can see, this aligns the headings with the note text, not the numbers, so it may not be the most aesthetically appealing, though perhaps that can be configured also.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the books, I'll shorten the list some, but I felt comfortable adding all those books because Wayne Grudem's <i>Systematic Theology</i> was already there and doesn't deal only with Calvinism vis-a-vis Arminianism. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 04:03, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No you're right - they don't have to <i>only</i> be about Calv/Arm; the reason I added Grudem is because he talks specifically about all the different Arminian doctrines and gives his scriptural reasons why he disagrees. That's why, and because Grudem is such a good author, I didn't really mind advertising his systematic theology even if he comes out Calvinst&#160;;-) It was actually his writings, in combination with Piper and a general Calvinistic understanding of Arminianism, that originally put me firmly on the Calvinist side of the debate. Of course, that evil has now been undone&#160;;-) Just kidding. But my original request was more a query and less of a challenge - I'm not familiar with all of those, so if they spend some of their time specifically challenging Arminianism, they're valuable to the page.</p>

<dd>As for the books, nearly all Calvinist discussions of the doctrines of grace spend considerable time discussing the alternate views, particularly Arminianism since it's the "archrival." Hodge also discusses pre-Reformation views, Lutheranism's view (pre and post Melancthalon), Modernism, etc. Berkhof adds Neo-orthodoxy, which came after Hodge. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 17:46, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah that makes sense. I'm not really sure where a good line is. A lot of Arminianism books spend a lot of time talking about Calvinism too...I guess it's like - all books about the republican party spend a lot of time talking about the democratic party, but some of them still wouldn't deserve to be "further resources" on the democrat part Wikipedia page. Bottom line: I don't know! Since you're more familiar, add whatever you feel would be a good further resource on Arminianism. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 21:28, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> article is correct in stating that the TULIP model was a list of the doctrines in which Calvinists and Arminians differed.

<dd>"The doctrine of total depravity was affirmed by the Five articles of Remonstrance and by Jacobus Arminius himself, and John Wesley, who strongly identified with Arminius through publication of his periodical <i>The Arminian</i>, also advocated a strong doctrine of inability. The term Arminianism has also come to include some who hold the Semipelagian doctrine of limited depravity, which allows for an "island of righteousness" in human hearts that is uncorrupted by sin and able to accept God's offer of salvation without a special dispensation of grace. Although Arminius and Wesley both vehemently rejected this view, it has sometimes inaccurately been lumped together with theirs (particularly by Calvinists) because of other similarities in their respective systems such as conditional election, unlimited atonement, and Prevenient grace."</dd>

<p>If I may interject some thoughts, compare the first bullet under classical Arminianism (Total depravity) to the fifth bullet (Free will). Supposing these to be accurate, under the first, it is claimed that in his fallen state man has no free will; under the latter, it is claimed that man <i>does</i> have free will. How can this be? Because, the Arminian has defined a "<a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevenient_grace.html" title="Prevenient grace">prevenient grace</a>" which has offset the effects of the Fall on the will of every son &amp; daughter of Adam. Hence, for the Arminian (Wesleyan), <b>all</b> have been enabled and therefore there are <b>none</b> who remain in his "fallen state" -- the unregenerate now have free will -- true total depravity has become a non-existent condition. This is what was clearly evident to the counter-Remonstrants who maintained (with the Belgic Confession) that the <i>unregenerate</i> are <i>incapable</i> of turning to God (i.e. they remain totally depraved). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Ellis_8ea9.html" title="User:Jim Ellis">Jim Ellis</a> 12:12, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The Federal Vision of the <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn_Avenue_Theology_bcd7.html" title="Auburn Avenue Theology">Auburn Avenue Theology</a> (which is not the same as the NPP) was an issue which first arose in 2002 in the PCA.

<dl>
<dd>I'm not quite sure I follow - are you guys saying that NPP didn't influence Arminianism at all - or just didn't influence it strongly enough to warrant mention in Wikipedia? Here's what my thought was when I included:</dd>
<dd>The concept of corporate election was not introduced by NPP, but it was popularized by them. As I understand it, NPP wasn't ever about a defined theological system, but rather understanding historical context and interpreting Paul in that light (i.e. Second Temple Judaism); still, as the big guys spend a lot of time on Corporate election (roughly 1/4 of NT Wright's book "Paul" (which I own) and, from what I've been told, the subject recieves similar time in his other works) I'm not sure what the objection is.</dd>
<dd>There is a recent doctoral thesis by Dr. Brian Abasciano (MDiv Gordon, PhD Aberdeen) that is in the citations list which discusses the influence of NPP upon mainstream Arminianism which can be cited again in that section if need be. I listed several other notable Arminian theologians who touched upon NPP (whether by name or allusion) in their writings.</dd>
<dd>NPP has influenced the entire theological world, even stretching beyond Protestantism. I don't see an issue with saying that it had a strong influence on Arminianism. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 01:30, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am not familiar with Abasciano's work. If you want to quote him, I see no problem. However, I disagree with the statement "strongly influenced," which uncited appears as a claim of scholarly concensus. NPP may have given additional considerations to the idea of corporate election for the Arminian community, but to say "strongly influenced" still seems like an overstatement -- all of which begs the question of how it has influenced Arminianism. What resulting change in Arminian theology has come about due to NPP? Citations would be required. If there is a noteworthy relationship between NPP and Arminianism, it would be good to include it in the NPP article as well. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Ellis_8ea9.html" title="User:Jim Ellis">Jim Ellis</a> 12:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify, I understand NPP to be much more than "additional considerations" to Arminianism vis-a-vis Corporate election. Classically (Arminius/Wesley), election was always percieved as individual in nature and based on foreknowledge. With the influence of NPP, many theologians (the list is in the article) have shifted away from that idea. (The line of thinking is that 2nd temple Jews - Paul included - would probably have viewed election as a national/racial - not individual - concept.) Election is one of the absolute biggest issues that Arminianism as a system seeks to explain; thus the import of NPP on Arminian thinking.</dd>
<dd>I made some changes to the NPP paragraph, hopefully adding some clarity. I phrased it as such: "the recent influence of NPP has also reached Arminianism..." I think the comments &amp; link to NPP is helpful for the scholar researching Arminianism as a system or doctrine, and therefore relevant. If you'd like, I can add a citation from NT Wright &amp; Abasciano at a later time (not home now). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 21:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, Thank you for your latest revision. I think it is a better statement of the situation related to Arminianism and corporate election. I will let the issue rest now. However, I would suggest that NPP was not new in pointing to the 1st century Jews understanding of corporate (racial) election. Traditionalists would say that is precisley what drew Paul's correctives. NPP is new in suggesting Paul retained the same idea of corporate election (or covenant identification), but merely challenged the Jew's "boundary markers."

<dd>Jim, that's a good point. As a wise man once said (some say the wisest) "there is nothing new under the sun." <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 15:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guys, thanks for being willing to take a look at this section. The way it read before appeared to be some kind of guilt by association. I'm not 100% convinced it's cogent, but I think the direction you are taking it is more instructive. I think it needs to be developed further before it's clear. Has the NPP affected Arminianism per se, or just some theologians who happen to be Arminian&#160;? See what I mean? What is it about the NPP that is being incorporated to contemporary formulations of Arminian doctrine? If we can't show that, then this probably belongs as a note on the NPP article not the Arminian article Theriddles 04:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is becoming far too long and unweildly. It needs significant clean-up and condensing. I also think that the question of free-will, which was the crucial point of contention re Arminianism, needs to be mentioned front-and-center in this entry, so that a person unaquainted with this notion will grasp right away what most of the fuss was about. Remember that this article is not for experts only. ThaddeusFrye 08:05, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thaddeus, welcome to Wikipedia and thanks for your thoughts!</dd>
<dd>I think you will find that if you look at other similar articles on theology (<a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> for example) you'll find similar levels of detail and technicalities in an article of similar length. There were a few of us that worked really hard on this article Jan/Feb 2006, from several different beliefs/backgrounds, and we were all able to agree upon the content that you see today.</dd>
<dd>I think if you read the full article closely, you'll find the concept of free will (at least the 'standard' church definition) throughout. The question of how much to discuss "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_will.html" title="Free will">free will</a>" (using those words) is complicated by the myriad of definitions ascribed to the term; just see the Wikipedia article for an example. Therefore, in the writing process, a conscious decision was made to discuss the concept of free will in less ambiguous terms. (Specifically that God's prevenient grace can be resisted - implying human choice).</dd>
<dd>There was also a conscious effort made in the writing process to present Arminianism as a stand-alone system - not primarily as "Here's how it differs from Calvinism" (in such an article, free will <i>would</i> be the 'crucial point', as it's the primary difference). This is important because Arminianism (both historic and modern) is often defined incorrectly and one of Wikipedia's core values is accuracy. Knowing that a large percentage of readers will be familiar with Calvinism, we chose to include a "Similarities/Differences" discussion at the end of the article.</dd>
<dd>All that said, Wikipedia is a living/growing organism and (most) change is good. If you have specific suggestions, please share them! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 15:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
