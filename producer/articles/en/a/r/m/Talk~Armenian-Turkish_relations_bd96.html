<p>Hey Baristarim, thanks for the help and nice editing. About Mimar Sinan, it is arguable but the fact that he came from an armenian populated village and was a christian really narrows it down. It is said he used to go by the name Minan Armen Sinanian (Armen being an armenian name). Other people say that there is a possibility he was greek too. That's why we should just leave it a disputed claim. <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 11:26, 2 September 2006 (Montreal Time) (UTC)</p>

<dd>In Turkish, Mimar means architect.. Mimar Sinan means Architect Sinan. Because Sinan is architect. You say me that "Minan Armen" comes together and turns into "Mimar" which means architech. I congurulate you. you made up it youself? good imagination. I am tired of discussing with armenians, really!!.. They only know how to make propoganda and insult us.. In Turkey, I know some armenian People and they are perfect. but here in wikipedia, they make me crayz..</dd>

<p>Ok, no problems.. I am cool with that.. Even in Turkey there have been such claims I believe. As long as it is cited it's alright.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 16:42, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, I know that this might be a bit of a stretch&#160;:), but does anyone have any info or sources on the Armenian-Turkish relations other than politics, such as cultural activities, concerts etc. in Turkey, Armenia or somewhere else? If you do let's put them in the text.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:09, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have read again and again over the past 24 hours that "the countries have no diplomatic relations". I am tired of reading something that, while true, does not explain at all why and I have fixed it in this article at least. There are no diplomatic relations because Turkey refuses to have them. Period. At the time of independence, poor little Armenia was starving to death and never made any land claims on Turkey. Turkey insisted that Armenia revoke their land claims before establishing relations. Sounds like paranoia to me. Then they changed the demand to withdrawing from Karabakh (yes, the same country that has invaded and remained in Cyprus for 30 years!). They also have warned Armenia not to push the genocide recognition internationally. Armenia has again and again and again replied to Turkey that they want diplomatic relations and an open border, without preconditions. That they should have relations with their neighbor and work out issues simultaneously. This is what happened, this is how it was, and this is the whole story. This is what the article needs to reflect because there is a black and white in this case and this is it. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 16:08, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Raffi thanks for clearing that up. Can you just confirm that Armenia has made no claims for land in Turkey since independence, it does not have it in it's constitution and give us a link please?</p>
<p>What is the economic state of Armenia? I thought they were getting a lot of economic support from Russia and the Armenian diaspora? If you could give us a few links that would be great.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is correct, Armenia has never made a claim of land on Turkey since independence. How can I give a reference to that when it never happened? You can certainly read the constitution which was adopted in 1995 and is available on a few sites<a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Armenian_Constitution" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Armenian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and see it is not there for example. Armenia gets economic investment and military support from Russia, and a great deal of remittances and aid from the Armenian Diaspora - though the significance of that to this article is not too clear to me. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 15:07, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Listen, is there any logical rationale for excluding the Asala link from the see also of the main article about the TR-AM relations? If the title of the link was the problem, pls remove that - not the see also. It is really not cool you know: ASALA is an integral part of the TR-AM relations in the 70s and 80s, right? So, why remove it? Does anyone have a valid explanation? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 04:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that ASALA has a place in an article about TR-AM relations. Perhaps a better method of including it would be a paragraph about the ASALA assassinations, strictly NPOV. If this does not have a place in this article, then this article should clearly state that it is about Republic of Turkey and Republic of Armenia and should also then refrain from "Turkish-Armenian" issues that don't fit into that rather narrow category - IMO, that would be rather silly. BTW, I don't think ASALA should be mentioned without mentioning <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artin_Penik_6270.html" title="Artin Penik">Artin Penik</a>. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> 06:02, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, the link was kind of dodgy... However, good point by Smyrnan about if we should keep the article at "Armenian-Turkish" or at "Armenia-Turkey". It is an interesting look at the issue. Doesn't mean any content will be changed though, but for stylistic purposes it might be better. That way, we can organize some of the stuff under a history section and try to develop other facets of information.

<dd>Come on, why not? The whole article needs to be expanded in any case. I honestly don't get it. ASALA was (and in some cases psychologically still) a very important factor in defining TR-AM relations in the 70s and 80s. It is just a see also you know, people can make up their own minds. In cases such as these it is always better to develop the main articles anyways, that's what really matters. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:36, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I missed this whole conversation, but would like to add my 2 cents at this time. ASALA is crucial to this article, so I am glad to see it is in the article. I do think though that the ASALA section, and discussions have been a bit misguided. The attacks began in a perhaps unprecedented way, and were done at a time when, it could even be said that certain terrorist movements had somewhat widespread sympathy, if not support. It was a very different time. It was - for the Armenian Diaspora - the only time they ever heard Armenia(ns) mentioned in the news for 15 years. A strange circumstance. It was also somewhat different than most terrorist groups of the time, and especially today, in that targets were almost always Turkish officials, not civilians. There were notable exceptions, which were causes/results of splinter groups of ASALA. For Turkey, it was, along with Cyprus and Midnight Express, less than a positive association for the country. I do not however think that external links need to be added in this section, unless they are solid references, and I think Artin Penik needs to remain in the ASALA article, not here. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 15:20, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What about the title? Should we move it to Armenia-Turkey? The content will stay the same, so that's not a problem.

<dd>? Er, no. It is because "X-Y" relations articles are always titled as such.

<dd>This article seems to be mostly about Armenian-Turkish relations rather than RoA-RoT relations. Let's keep the title and see where the article expands to. If there is a move towards limiting the scope of the article to RoA-RoT, then it should be renamed. Current edits are not towards that limitation of scope. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> 02:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As you wish. But know that per other precedents such a name change wouldn't modify or limit the scope of this article. I am just saying that per the templates present in the article of country foreign relations, it looks like that anyways. Such articles always include history, diaspora, trade, culture etc information in any case. That's why I said that such a name change wouldn't modify any content. I still don't see any valid arguments, all other relations articles are titled as such, and it looks much more encyclopedic like that. Narek, if people are going to act up it is not going to be dependent on the title, right?</dd>
<dd>I try to organize many articles, so that's why I thought that a title change would be good - it is not for a particular reason frankly... But it's ok, let's move on to something else. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 02:31, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Welcome back Baristarim. I also agree with Narek I think we should leave the title alone.

<dd>Actually Armenia <i>does</i> recognize the Treaty of Kars. This was reaffirmed by Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian on December 13, 2006. As a legal successor to the Armenian SSR, Armenia has not made an issue of the treaty. According to Oskanian, Turkey puts the Kars treaty into doubt by blockading Armenia and severing diplomatic ties with Armenia. The treaty called for Turkey to open a consulate in each of the three Transcaucasian republics. <a href="http://www.mediaforum.am/armtoday.php?year=2006&amp;month=12&amp;day=13&amp;LangID=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediaforum.am/armtoday.php?year=2006&amp;month=12&amp;day=13&amp;LangID=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 03:58, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no Turkish military troops in the Turkish side of the border with Armenia but gendermarie. Turkey does not see Armenia as a threat and there is not a single Turkish political / military threat briefing against Armenia, not a single sentence, even a word.</p>
<p>Mr. Koçaryan's ideas are his own thoughts and can not be in a Turkish-Armenian relationship topic in Wikipedia. It is an political and one-sided issue. As Turks do not write here their own ideas about Armenia (invading Azerbaijan, genocide in Hojali against Muslims, wanting Ararat from Turkey etc.) Koçaryan's ideas are also must be removed.</p>
<p>You may write them down into the topic about Koçaryan and his life, but not here.</p>
<p>I'll remove them from the article in 3 days if I dont get an answer. Thank you.--hnnvansier 12:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What kind of country is Armenia, if its president can not be trusted??? If Koçaryan does not reflect the policies of this country, who reflects the "Armenian governments" view? Should we check for the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Diaspora_ed0f.html" title="Armenian Diaspora">Armenian Diaspora</a> instead? Is the source cited? (YES) Is the source recent? (YES). User:Lardayn if you claim Armenians and Turks are in good position, brought your citations. However I personally know Armenians HATE Turks and see them as a threat. I have seen an Armenian getting in fight with a Turkish student at a restaurant about nationalistic issues. No surprise that boarder between these two nation is closed. --<a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 13:25, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That does not make Turkey as a "threat" But that is Armenian hate against Turkey. If Turkey officially does not have any intend neither on invading nor attacking Armenia, and there is no evidence of a possible operation against Armenia and in addition to those you can see clearly that the border is clear from Turkish troops, that means, Turkey is not a threat to Armenia. Turkey does not care about Armenia in a military way. So, Koçaryan must be too blind to see that, or that is just an Armenian internal propaganda to keep 2,5 millions of Armenians in the state under his aggressive rule. You know, threat brings obedience. If you say "we are under attack" people would feel nervous and stay at your side because of their nationalist blood.</dd>

<dd>IT is your POV (Point of View) against the Armenian president POV. Right at this moment, if you are not Turkish president, the Armenian President dominates. Do you have any source claim no hostility between these two states? A country perceives a threat to close its boarders. May be you are not on to things as Turkish Government is. Is it also possible that you are not aware of the seriousness as much as a President of the Armenia? Could this be possible?

<dd>First before I bring my sources, the one who "claims" need sources. Koçaryan's words are not sources, there is no evidence, no source of threat. This is the very basic rule of the law. Koçaryan's POV is Koçaryan's POV and POVs are not "sources".--hnnvansier 20:25, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
