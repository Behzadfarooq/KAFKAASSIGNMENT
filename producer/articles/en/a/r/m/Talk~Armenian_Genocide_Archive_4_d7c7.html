<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gvorl proposition for conflict resolution.</span></h2>
<p>I may have few problems in some points,(because of the possible wrong interpretation of them) but all in all I think it might be a good start. I do believe though, that the points regarding neutrality I have selected and included in my user page User:Fadix is an essencial add-in to Gvorl proposition, more particularly those in bold.</p>
<p>To Thoth and the other user that answered, I think reading few pages on how Wikipedia works, and trying to really understand the concept, will make you guys realise that what Gvorl proposes will NOT LEAD to a reletivzation or neither the denial of the genocide. Just to compare, the actual article, which is near NPOV, adhere more or less to Gvorl "rules," can you call it a revisionist entry?</p>
<p>Thoth, I told you, work and make propositions, the only thing I ask you, is to merge the informations of the present article in the new work, because those are essential points which should not be ignored. Yce, you are open for propositions too. Fadix 23:18, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I specially haven't entered things about viewpoints presentation because it is thing which can not be formalised directly. But I hope that balanced presentation of views can be assesed by some audit of sources which would classify them as direct and indirect ones. Also, I already see that few points I had entered (e.g. politcorrectness) were bit misunderstood, so I will bit clarify them. --<a href="../../../g/v/o/User%7EGvorl_8bd7.html" title="User:Gvorl">Gvorl</a> 05:36, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current article - while it certainly has good information that can and I supose will be kept - is inadequate in a number of was. The English usage is somewhat marginal and their is no overarching presentation - it is a bit of a grab bag. It emphasizes some things and entirely neglects to present a great amount of material that is equally compelling. Overall it fails to convey the genocide as a serioes of historical events in a manner that conveys to the casual reader a proper understanding of what really went on to whom by whom and for what reasons - nor does it adequatly cover the factors for why such a thing occured or the reasons why recognition (knowledge) of such events is generally lacking among most people today. I do strongly believe that an entire seperate section concerning (Armenian) Genocide denial is warrented considering the fact that it is a current ongoing unresolved international issue in the world today. I propose to cover the intital failures of the post-war peace process and competition among the allies for territory and commercial concesions, the sucess in the Nationalist revolution and the elimination of Armenians and the Armenian State, Cold War issues, Armenian campaigns for Genocide recognition, Turkish evolving denials, Heath Lowery affair, Benard Lewis Affair, various Genocide resolution attempts - sucessful and otherwise, associated lobbying and so on and so forth - up to the current cancellation of the genocide conference in Istanbul and the current Turkish media campaign for denial. Even perhaps the change wars and such on Wikipedia may warrent a byline...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 02:22, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should also add to the above list the shameless Turkish attempts to wipe out Armenian cultural monuments and recognition of Armenian cultural contributions and presence in Turkey. There is a ctually a great deal of similar and related and other material that warrents presentation IMO. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 02:27, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It depends on you, what will be written, but as many extra things you add as more complex article will become and discussions will grow by progression, keep in mind that. Simply sometimes less is more: maybe without minor things we will avoid major discussions? Also, I suggest you to get some response from your opponents: it is necessary to aggre that _both_ sides will keep the same rules. --<a href="../../../g/v/o/User%7EGvorl_8bd7.html" title="User:Gvorl">Gvorl</a> 05:21, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed Armenian Genocide Article Outline (partial and incomplete)</span></h2>
<p>I wanted to get something out here before I went on vacation. I have a great deal more detail and such though not all tpewritten and not in this final format that I settled on and I feel that much more is required to really have a complete presentation. However I wanted to offer this up for something to chew on and I will be tweaking and adding to it while on my vacation and hopefully will be ready to post up something more complete in a few weeks. In the mean time think over this a bit - and I know it is really only complete through the Hamidiye massacres (which I see as being mentioned here but really needing to be a seperate section and the one that is there requires serious upgrading). I apologize for my lack of being able to format things in Wiki at this time. I really just haven't looked into how it is doen yet - and will likely require some assistance....</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion to THOTH and those concerned</span></h2>
<p>I think you have to be careful with the terminology you use. When you use "the genocide" in a sentence, you portray it as a undisputed fact, which it is not. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official Turkish denial of the Genocide</li>
<li>Relevant History of Armenians in Anatolia and the Ottoman Empire prior to the Genocide</li>
<li>The Decision to commit Genocide and the Rational and Pretexts used to cover it</li>
<li>Implementation of the Armenian Genocide – methods, key actors, events</li>
<li>Key Architects and perpetrators of Genocide - Genocide Timeline</li>
<li>The Witness and Documentation of the Armenian Genocide</li>
<li>The aftermath of Genocide – acknowledgement and denial</li>
<li>The perpetuation of Genocide by the Republic of Turkey</li>
</ul>
<p>With these titles you have already forfeited any chance of a neutral article, because you are forcing one point of view. A neutral article should follow wording like that of BBC articles seen here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4497519.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4497519.stm" rel="nofollow">Turkey edges towards Armenia ties</a> - You will note from this article the deaths are quoted as massacres and any mention of genocide is shown as "genocide"</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4478919.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4478919.stm" rel="nofollow">Armenians remember mass killings</a> - The title of this article refers to mass killings, not genocide. You will again note that the articles does not portray the genocide as undisputed fact.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4477877.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4477877.stm" rel="nofollow">Armenia remembers 1915 killings</a> - Again look at the title, it refers to the events as '1915 killings', not genocide. The article also explains how Armenia wants Turkey to recognise genocide and Turkeys reason for not recognising it as such, it doesnt use inflammatory words such as 'denial'.</li>
</ul>
<p>An encylopedia article should portray the events like in these BBC articles. When you say 'the genocide', you make it irrefutable to the point no other views are valid. This has to be addressed to give this article credibility. --<a href="../../../e/2E/a/User%7EE.A_0364.html" title="User:E.A">E.A</a> 16:04, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, with one exception, there are encyclopedias that do use the term genocide directly as if it was an established fact, one example is the very huge French language encyclopedia, Universalis. The article can use the term genocide when using the UN convention and other such instances by still being non-POV, but I believe that since there is a very vocal Turkish opposition there, it would be better to stick as you said to not cause a revert war or spammings of the talk page. I proposed to edit Thoth texts, so don't take his propositions as final. Fadix 19:39, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm guessing thats because France recognises the deaths officially as genocide, amongst 14 other countries, but their view does not represent everyone. I think it is important to remember that this articles job isn't to prove or disprove genocide occuring, i believe many people are becoming passionately involved in this article to prove what they deem to be the truth (whether for or against genocide occuring). The only real fact of the argument is that there is conflict of opinion, the article should explain this conflict and why it exists. --<a href="../../../e/2E/a/User%7EE.A_0364.html" title="User:E.A">E.A</a> 22:14, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All encyclopedias I have read present it as fact, except for Britanica, so I don't think it is a question of countries recognising it as genocide. But regardless, this conversation is worthless, because I don't disagree with you here. But when we refer to sections title, they can in some cases be words that in the articles presenting them as fact would make them POV. A section called Armenian genocide could be permitted, the explaination on the other hand, should say something such: "What is often called" etc. This is only because those are word "conventions."

<p>I completly disagree that there is any real controversy - in any real academic sense - concerning the use of the word Genocide to describe what occured to the Armenians during the period coinciding with WWI (and perhaps including events prior and after). After all the title of this article is the Armenian Genocide - and that is what it is and what we are talking about. In academic circles there is no real dispute of the use of this term and in fact the term itself was largely based on the Armenian experience and this has been well documented and discused here in these talk pages already. Likewise it is pretty much accepted that there is an ongoing campaign of Tukish denial of the truth of this matter and these facts require very explicit exposure and documentation IMO. Of course there is also a great deal of surrounding issues and events (including the "controversy" aspect) that need very clear and thorough explanation. I contend that acuratly presenting the facts and supporting such in all of these cases will in fact not be all so difficult whatsoever. And when presented it will be clear what is truth and what is distortion and IMO there will be little basis for much real dispute - not that I don't expect any from the less rational and more politically motivated commentators among us...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 20:15, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To every one, for me as a oversea chinese,whether Turkish government denial on the genocide or not, to be honest, doesnt make weight that it never happened; likewise, if German government denial the Holocaust nor japanese government on Nanjing Massacre, implies they never happened? b.t.w, i am not in pos to comment armenian genocide, but ppl do normally believe in facts.

I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOBODY HERE APPRECIATES THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF "GENOCIDE' IS IN LEGAL TERMS WHICH IS THE ACTUAL DEBATE. THE HISTORICAL EVENT SHOULD BE LEFT FOR SERIOUS HISTORIANS WHO'VE BEEN TRAINED TO SPOT BIAS AND ANALYSE DOCUMENTS TO DECIDE WHETHERE THE EVENTS WERE GENOCIDE AS ARMEINANS CLAIM OR WHETHERE THEY CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS A GENOCIDE AS THE TURKS CLAIM. THE FACT THAT THE HITLER QUOTE IS ACTAULY A FAKE IS ACTUALLY KNOWN IF YOU INTERESTED PLEASE PICK UP THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT IT IS SAID TO BE CITED FROM AND ACTUALLY READ IT...IT DOES NOT EXIST IN THE ORIGINAL...I DONT KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD HAVE MADE THIS UP MAYBE IT WAS A MISTAKE BUT IT SHOWS HOW PEOPLE ARE JUTS BRAINWASHED BY THEIR PARENTS AND COMMUNITY TO BELIEVE WITHOUT QUESTION. EITHERWAY HISORY MUST BE STUDIED IN CONTEXT OF TIME AND EVENTS. ITS NEVER BLACK AND WHITE AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN AN EXTREME POINT OF VIEW THEN YOU ARE PROBABLY WRONG! THESE THINGS ARE NOT A MATTER OF BELIEF ITS A MATTER OF FACTS PUT TOGETHER TO UNRAVEL THE TRUTH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE EVENTS WERE NOT A GENOCIDE, INFACT IT WAS NOTHIG TOO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAPPENED TO MANY OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS INCLUDING THE TURKS IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE DURING THAT ERA...AND ITS IMPORTANT TO REMEBR THAT MANY PEOPLE STARVED TO DEATH AND HAD THEIR CHILDREN KILLED BY TERRORISTS FROM THE NEXT VILLAGE OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION,OR GROUP. WHEN GREEKS AND BULGARIANS GAINED THERI INDEPENDANCE THE TURKS SUFFERED JUST AS MUCH AS ARMENIANS BUT NO ONE CARES BECAUSE THEY ARE MUSLIM.... LIKEWISE NOONE SEEMS TO APPRECIATE THAT THE RESON FOR ARMENIAN DEATHS ARE ARMEINAN REVOLTS WHCIH WERE CONDUCTED BADLY IN AREAS WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE A STRATEGICALY HIGH ENOUGH POPULATION TO CARRY ON A REVOLT SUCCESFULL ENOUGH TO OBTAIN THE INDEPENDANCE THEY FOUGHT FOR AS THE OTHER CHRISTIONS IN THE BALKANS HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY. UNFORTUNALTLY CONFLICT COMES WITH CASULTIES... AND THIS IS WHY IT CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE HOLOCAUST SUCH A CONFLICT DID NOT EXIST IN GERMANY. WHEN A CONFLICT IS INITIATED BY 2 ENTITIES DESIRING THE SAME THING THERE IS ALWAYS DESTRUCTION AND WHEN INITIATING A CONFLICT THESES THINGS HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT!</p>

<dd>Actual suggestion seems important and very clear: one of the main subjects here is a definition of the genocide term. Legal definition is not necessary (because the Wikipedia is not legal site, also this case is really old, so can be classified retrospectivelly, etc.) but anyway, without the clear definition of this term here will be lots of problems. So, I suggest few things:</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>On April 24, 1915, the Young Turk government arrested several hundred - or, according to Turkish records, over two thousand - Armenian intellectuals.</i>
<ul>
<li>Records are referred to here, and two conflicting figures are given. What are the sources for the several hundred arrests? What Turkish records are referred to that support the arrest of over 2,000 Armenian intellectuals?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>It is believed that most of these were soon executed.</i>
<ul>
<li>Who believes this?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Most historians believe that the government did not provide any facilities to care for the Armenians during their evacuation, nor when they arrived.</i>
<ul>
<li>If many historians believe this, then we must provide their names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Rather, records suggest that the Ottoman troops escorting the Armenians as a matter of course not only allowed others to rob, kill, and rape the Armenians, but often participated in this activity themselves.</i>
<ul>
<li>This is a bold claim. Evidence (in the form of sources) <i>must</i> be provided to show where this information is coming from. Note that I am not denying it happened (my knowledge of this event is almost non-existent), I am merely asking for sources. Records are mentioned here, therefore there must be a source that can be cited.</li>

<li>Who believes this? If the figure has not been conclusively established, why is this not speculation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Some historians believe that the deportations were, in practice, a method of mass execution which led to the deaths of many of the Armenian population by forcing them to march endlessly through desert, without food or water or enough protection from local Kurdish or Turkish bandits, and members of the special organization were charged to escort the convoys (which meant their destruction).</i>

<dt>The camps</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>The Ottoman Empire set up a recorded twenty-five to twenty-six of what are often called major "concentration camps" (Deir-Zor, Ras Ul-Ain, Bonzanti, Mamoura, Intili, Islahiye, Radjo, Katma, Karlik, Azaz, Akhterim, Mounboudji, Bab, Tefridje, Lale, Meskene, Sebil, Dipsi, Abouharar, Hamam, Sebka, Marat, Souvar, Hama, Homs and Kahdem).</i>
<ul>
<li>Though this seems to be an obvious fact, could I ask where these are recorded?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>After reports of deaths, the camps Lale, Tefridje, Dipsi, Del-El, and Ras Ul-Ain were built specifically for those who had a life expectancy of a few days. The majority of the guards inside the camps were Armenians.</i>
<ul>
<li>Where did the reports come from? If there are reports then there must be a source of the report. The fact that the majority of the guards in the camps were Amerinians comes from somewhere: what is its source?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Even though nearly all the camps, including all the major ones, were open air, according to records, some were not.</i>
<ul>
<li>Which records are being sourced here?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Other camps existed, according to the military court, that were irregular Red Crescent camps used to kill by morphine injection (two Saib (health inspector) colleagues, Dr. Ragib and Dr. Vehib, testified during the court) and from which bodies were thrown into the Black Sea. In other instances, according to records, there were some small-scale killing and burning camps where the Armenian population was told to present itself in a given area, and was subsequently burned en masse. Other records from the military tribunal suggest that gassing installations existed as well.</i>
<ul>
<li>Which military court? Which case is being references here? What records from which military tribunal?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Both Saib and Nail were allegedly in charge of providing the list of children who were to be distributed among the Muslim populace; the rest of the children were to be sent to the mezzanine floor to be killed by a mass gassing installation.</i>
<ul>
<li>This states that they were allegedly in charge of providing the list of children: who made these allegations?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>While the total number of victims that perished in all such camps is hard to establish, it is estimated by some sources at close to a million.</i>

</ul>
</li>

<li><i>The accused succeeded in destroying the majority of the documents, that could be used as evidence against them, before they escaped.</i>
<ul>
<li>Is this speculation, or was it determined by the authorities? Does the sentence "The martial court established the will of the Ittheadists to eliminate the Armenians physically, via its special organization." provide this source?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Though soon after the Armenian massacres, the world was well aware of the "extermination of the Armenians", which was openly discussed by Turkish government officials, and trials of Ottoman officials were held in regard to the events, after a period of quiet, a new policy of silencing and what is called as denial began.</i>
<ul>
<li>We have what looks like a quote here. What is it quoting? Also, what is the source of this? How do I know this is not just the POV of the author? Please note that I am not actually saying that it <i>is</i>, I am merely pointing out that this could be construed as POV pushing. Which leads me to...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Eventually, a policy that is considered by many historians as official state denial emerged.</i>
<ul>
<li>Which historians believe this? We <i>must</i> have sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Mention of Armenian Genocide almost anywhere in the world was met with rebukes from Turkish Ambassadors, while mention of it in Turkey itself led to jail terms or worse on many occasions — often prosecuted under a law against inciting ethnic hatred.</i>
<ul>
<li>Which court cases and which convictions? Where are the rebukes from Turkish Ambassadors documented?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Turkey began to spend large amounts of money on lobbying firms in Washington D.C. to counter genocide allegations, and improve its image. It also began to spend large amounts of money on endowed chairs of Turkish or Ottoman history in different U.S. universities which had conditions that the professors who were hired must be on "friendly" terms with Turkey.</i>
<ul>
<li>I find this passage to be deliberate speculation. There is clearly a motive being provided for Turkey's money spending on U.S. universities. What evidence is there that large amounts of Turkish money was spent on lobbying firms in Washington D.C. to counter genocide allegations and to improve Turkey's image? What evidence is there that "professors who were hired must be on "friendly" terms with Turkey"?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Some of their efforts to establish such chairs were met with student and public resistance and not all were eventually successful in being beforehand armenian counterpart establishments.</i>
<ul>
<li>Source and evidence for this please.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The campaign of what is called as denial was met with mixed success.</i>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, this is the POV of the author. This appears to me to be commentary and is unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Some governments, notably Turkish allies the U.S. and Israel will not officially use the word genocide to describe these events, though some government officials have used it personally. Many newspapers for a long time would not use the word genocide without disclaimers such as "alleged".</i>
<ul>
<li>If this is an official policy of the U.S. and Turkey then a source should be easily found. If many newspapers would not use the word genocide without the word alleged, then those newspapers must be named. I notice that the NYTs has been named, however...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>A number of those policies have now been reversed so that even casting doubt on the term is against editorial policy, such as the case is with the New York Times.</i>
<ul>
<li>Which policy? Source please.</li>

<li>Only one politician is given: <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. The term used here is "many", in which case more than one politician must be provided. Also, what is meant by "prominent"? Prominent to whom?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The Armenian side speculates that fear of retribution from Turkey, a US ally and NATO partner, is behind the lack of formal recognition, whereas the Turkish side speculates that the only reason for the possibility of such a recognition would be the strength of Armenian lobby efforts within the US rather than the genuineness of the claims.</i>
<ul>
<li>Sources for <i>both</i> sides needs to be given. Can we back up these claims of speculation with evidence of the speculation of both sides?</li>

But I hope that before footnoting starts people that debate about how they want the article to be, of course, NPOV policy should be respected, the only thing I ask, is to respect what I quoted at my user pages, and do not divert out of the subject of the entry.

<li><i>On April 24, 1915, the Young Turk government arrested several hundred - or, according to Turkish records, over two thousand - Armenian intellectuals.</i>
<ul>
<li>Records are referred to here, and two conflicting figures are given. What are the sources for the several hundred arrests? What Turkish records are referred to that support the arrest of over 2,000 Armenian intellectuals?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Armenian genocide works covers what happened in April 24. As for the over 2000 from Turkish records. The actual number is 2345, you can find those numbers by reading Turkish governments work, Kamuran Guruns “Armenian Files” is a start. This is only what happened in April 24, the next days, other Armenian intellectuals.(Writers, poets, journalists, professors, teachers etc.) All accused to be members of some revolutionary groups. Fadix 1 July 2005 17:43 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>It is believed that most of these were soon executed.</i>
<ul>
<li>Who believes this?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, what happened to Armenian intellectuals is sourced in any Armenian genocide books. Pick any of them. You can as well run a search regarding Armenian artists, intellectuals of those times, and you'll see that most date of death is 1915.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Most historians believe that the government did not provide any facilities to care for the Armenians during their evacuation, nor when they arrived.</i>
<ul>
<li>If many historians believe this, then we must provide their names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of them, a Turkish researcher is quoted there, it is one of the major three reasons, why some Turkish intellectuals believe it was a planned murder. I do plan to footnote as I did on the two articles I have created once there is a good final working version. Fadix 1 July 2005 17:43 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree here, I was not the one having added this entry, but there are reports, Ussher(an American physician of Van) do report this in his memoirs, or Vehib the then commander of the Ottoman Third army.

<ul>
<li>Who said this? Again, a source should be cited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nogales reports in his memoirs, how the governor has planned to kill any single Armenian man. German records(few included in the German archive site) show how in that region irregulars were disturbing peaces, in the records it is said that the authorities would correct the situation, but more irregulars were placed there, when at the end, Armenians have decided to resist. Ussher as well depict this situation pretty well. Fadix 1 July 2005 17:43 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My mistake, that was not what I wanted to mean, I wanted to say that the actual figure is still not well established. Alexander report that that Djemal(a minister in the Ottoman government), has estimated it to be 1.5 million, Talaat recently released notes suggest that for a dozens of cities, it was close to a million. Toynbee in his incomplete 1915 estimates, it was 1.2 million. Piratically all Austrian and German figures were of over a million. Fadix 1 July 2005 17:43 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reports of deaths? German reports ... if you mean the reports of deaths that caused the closure of the camps. They are presented in the public Turkish Martial Court, and published in the Official Ottoman [Law] gazette, Takvim-i Vekayi. Here quoting from it one section regarding the corps: “it is noted that there was such a great number of corpses strewn around the roads that unless dealt with they would create dangerous consequences. And advice is given to alert the Ministry of Internal Affairs, so that drastic measures be taken to punish the officials who were acting so irresponsibly in this matter. It is also noted that it was essential to assign an appropriate number of gendarmes under the leadership of key officials, so that all the corpses within the border are buried. In a September 15, 1331 (1915) cipher-telegram, sent by Resid to the Interior Ministry, it is mentioned that the number of Armenians being deported from Diyarbakir had reached 120,000 -- which demonstrates the scope and meaning of the operation that had taken place (see series 12, document #1).” Oh and, the closure of those three camps is presented in the above mentioned book as well.

<p>This is documented. And I can document this part more clearly than others for now, because I just have the references on my table, and won't need to consult my archives.</p>
<p>On 10 February 1919, British High Commissioner, Admiral Calthorpe sent to London reports from the British intelligence agency, from where the Turkish Public security official Mr. Aziz in charge of Interior Ministry's wartime archives declares:</p>
<p>“Just before the Armistice, officials had been going to the archives department at night and making clean sweep of most of the documents.”</p>
<p>Source: British Foreign Office Archives. FO371/4172/31307, folio 385.</p>
<p>“The documents of Ittihad party were crammed into a suitcase by Dr. Behaeddin Sakir after they had been removed from the party headquarters by Dr. Nazim. The suicase was taken to home of attorney Ramiz, Sakir's brother-in-law.”</p>
<p>Source: Tunaya, T.Z. "Türkiyede siyasal partiler, Vol. 2, 2nd ed. Istanbul: Hürriyet Vakfi publications. p. 96, n.16.</p>
<p>The Turkish press reported in December 1918 ("Aksam," 12 Dec. 1918; "Tasviri Efkâr," 13 Dec. 1918) that when the police raided Ramiz’ homes, they found documents that were still intact and handed these documents to the Martial-court??? Following the dissolution of the martial-court the documents left were never handed to the British like promised. Mr. Aziz, contrary to the promises he had made, never handed those documents to them.</p>
<p>It must be noted here that Djemal's bureau's Deputy Director stated that, before Djemal, flight from Istanbul:</p>
<p>“...some of his files [containing] official documents were left in the custody of Syfi, one of his men, who out of fear burned them. “</p>
<p>Source: Atay, F.R. "Çankaya." Istanbul: Sena. pp. 127-128</p>
<p>The then minister of education Midhat Shukru…</p>
<p>“…made most of the CUP documents relative to Armenians disapper.”</p>
<p>(Source: FO 371/6500 p.480)</p>
<p>The documents incriminating some of the prisoners in Malta that the British were able to locate in Istanbul were reported disappearing. And the Nationalist government was suspected of being the responsible.</p>
<p>“…disappearance of documents incriminating certain persons …saying that the matter has been arranged by local Nationalist leaders.”</p>
<p>(Source: Weekly Summary, March 4, 1920, British Embassy publication)</p>
<p>Other references to the destruction of those documents could be found in Aydemir’s work, where he writes:</p>
<p>“Before the flight of the top Ittihadist leaders, Talat Pasa stopped by at the waterfront residence of one of his friends on the shore of Arnavudköy, depositing there suitcase of documents. It is said that the documents were burned in the basement's furnace. Indeed ... the documents and other papers of Ittihad's Central Committee are nowhere to be found. “</p>
<p>Source: Aydemir, S.S. "Makedonyadan Ortaasyaya Enver Pasa." Vol. 3, 1914-1922. Istanbul: Remzi. p. 493</p>
<p>It is evident when referring to those pieces of references that the allies had no access to the documents contrary to what is claimed by denialists. A telegram ordering the destruction of telegrams, from the Turkish Interior Minister to the provincial governor at Ayintab, was intercepted by the General Headquarters of the British Army's Egyptian Expeditionary force on 24 January 1919.</p>
<p>“Burn originals of official telegrams since mobilisation on files of district.”</p>
<p>(Source: FO371/4174/15450)</p>
<p>On 17 June 1919 the Turkish foreign Minister Safa protested to the British High Commissioner regarding British intrusions by trying to examine documents, and finally answered that such an intrusion will be unsuccessful, because the Diyarbekir-based Director of Telegraphic Service sent a circular telegram ordering to destroy these documents. Admiral Calthrope reported to London after this message:</p>
<p>“…attention to the tenor of this note which treats as a mere matter of office routine such an important matter as the proposed destruction of documents relating to the period of deportations, massacres, and the activities of the Turkish authorities during the war. “</p>
<p>(source; FO371/4174/102551)</p>
<p>The British, facing the destruction of the documents, in a weekly summary of intelligence report, dated 4 March 1920, declared from the British Military Intelligence Bureau:</p>
<p>“…the disappearance of documents incriminating ... Ittihadist. Talking of Rauf: he urged the destruction of incriminating documents. It is understood that Rauf had already arranged the disappearance of documentary material implicating himself and Enver Pasa.” [source: FO371/5166/E1782, Reports 575, 592]</p>
<p>Karay, who in 1919 was the General Director of Telegraphic Service in Turkey, wrote that Mehmet Emin, his predecessor, had sent orders to all principal telegraph centres in the country, directing them to:</p>
<p>“…destroy all official papers, the originals and copies of all telegrams. “</p>
<p>(Karay, R.H. Minelbab lelmihrab, Istanbul: Inkilâp and Aka, p. 221)</p>
<p>Post minister Hüseyin Hasim admitted ordering the destruction of telegrams in 3 June 1919:</p>
<p>“…all military telegrams burned on orders from the War Office.” [source: "Takvimi Vekayi." No. 3573, 12 June 1919] Fadix 1 July 2005 17:43 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I find this passage to be deliberate speculation. There is clearly a motive being provided for Turkey's money spending on U.S. universities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Motivation</span></h2>
<p>I've just come upon this article for the first time, and especially given the complete lack of attention this event was given in American school, hearing of the Armenian Genocide for the first time is shocking and haunting to me.</p>
<p>I've noticed there's a lot of controversy as to whether this event even took place (to put it mildly), but I'm not going to get into all that. I simply noticed that while I was reading the article, there wasn't really any discussion of the motivation of the Ottoman government to commit such atrocities. When discussing the Holocaust, there are any number of theories as to why the Nazi government felt motivated to kill so many Jews (from the "Hitler believed evidence that Jews were conspiring to take over the government" theory to the "Hitler got dumped by a Jewish girl in elementary school" theory, and many, many more ideas).</p>
<p>But in this article, I didn't see a discussion of a fundamental reason why the Turks suddenly began slaughtering the Armenians <i>en masse</i>. It simply talks about how Ottoman law was changed to force all able-bodied males under 40 to serve in WW1, and then goes straight into talking about how Armenian recruits were later forced to work as laborers and many were executed.</p>
<p>Obviously, the question "why" can't even begin to justify such a momentous outrage, but... what event caused the Ottoman Empire to suddenly see the Armenians as, apparently, a scourge that must be destroyed? And why is Turkey's official position on the Armenian Genocide (denial of its existence) so fundamentally different from Germany's official position on the Holocaust (prosecution of those who <i>do</i> deny its existence)? <a href="../../../e/k/e/User%7EEkedolphin_6de2.html" title="User:Ekedolphin">ekedolphin</a> July 6, 2005 05:13 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree - the current article is entirely deficient in terms of context and explanation. I can fully understand where someone who is not familiar with this history would be thoroughly confused and have no real understanding of the specific and surrounding events that consititute the Armenian Genocide from reading this article. It needs to be vastly improved. I have attempted to conceptualize a replacement article where causative events (and forces/ideologies etc) are clearly explained but there seems to be no interest in pursueing this line. The current article is pretty much beyond redemtion IMO. My proposed outline - (a draft of the background sections is provided above)- would clearly answer all of your questions. Their is incredible amounts of first hand documentation of these events as well as a large body of subsequant analysis. All of your questions are easily answered but unfortunatly few people (laymen) really know and understand the history. I also dispute the claim made by one commentator above that there is any real dispute or controversy sorrounding the factuality of the Armenian Genocide (as a Genocide and by serious historians) - the "dispute" is purely political and is entirely of Turkish making to deflect an accurate and truthful examination and presentation of history.

<dd>Yes, we've agreed on this over and over again but I think we're seeing a status quo effect. Nobody has the will or time to change the article into a more consistent one. Maybe everything should be removed first to make a clear start and we should put a banner on top to advertise that we need people in the know to participate.

<p>Well Muz - I would be happy to - but your the very first person who has even commented on the outline at all (I posted a piece of it a month ago - above). I fundementally don't think it is all that difficult to lay our the facts and history in an accurate manner - the tough part is that everyone has far more preconception then actual knowledge and as we have discussed most are caught up in a particular viewpoint that interferes with taking a more comprehensive approach to the issue. As it stands the article is amaturish and unuseful/incomplete. I will complete my outline if there is any prospect on it actully being implemented. As you and I seem to agree on at least this much perhaps it is a start - I mean when have a Turk or an Armenian agreed an anything regarding this article before? - lol --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 04:07, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Belge[ler] records which have been used for the said 523,000 killed by Armenians are authored. And Aozan before posting new material here, I suggest you to read the forum archive, as I have clearly demonstrated the nature of this forgery by using the documents themselves and have shown how the figure "8" was used to add "sifers" (Ottoman zeros). They are the same sort of authored as were Shemshis publications. On the other hand, I do agree with you regarding secondary sources, Ultramarine figures were secondary and third(Is the Holocaust Unique uses for instance McCarthy statistics to draw the figure of losses" so it makes of it a third source) sources. But the entry I have created regarding Armenian casulties, besides McCarthy, the rest are all original first sources, from which, one is the original Ottoman statistics of Armenian casulties as well as Germanys secret reports of Armenian casulties during the war, and others etc. Ehmed Emin, in his book published in 1930, provideas figure of Muslim killed by Armenians to about 150 thousand, for the entire period. Emin was a known anti-Armenian who participated in the construction of anti-Armenian propaganda material to justify their evacuation. For this reason "he finds" Muslim killed during the 1917 period, by Armenians, fold lower than those of 1914-15, which of course is ridiculous, but when understanding that most of the propaganda materials were build early during the war, one can understand why so the differences between the two dates is that much disproportionate, when the ratio should be quite the opposit, which will bring his figure to drop to bellow 50,000. Oh and if you were to pay closer look at Rummels calculations, you'll see that he himself uses Emin. Fadix 8 July 2005 14:15 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The so-called "armenian genocide" is nothing more than an attempt to mobilize minorities against Turks. It was not a politically taken decision of genocide.

Also the word "techir" choosen by Ottoman government comes from the word "hicr" originally.please check the meanings of these words..</p>
<dl>
<dd>The word "techir" (at the time, "tenkil") is a derivation of an arabic term, its true Ottoman meaning is to "kick out," force someone to exile(as forcing an intellectual to exile in another country), and it can even mean to annihilate an enemy through way of evacuation, check any Ottoman dictionary, or ask an Arab languist. The first one that manipulated the Ottoman term "tenkil" is professor Halacoglu there again. Never heard of "tenkil ve tehcir'den?" You may know Turkish a lot better than I, but I know Arabic, which even though I place "basic" in my user page, is between basic and intermedary, as well as Ottoman Turkish, which is not modern Turkish. My parents and grandparents still speak Ottoman Turkish and can write as well, when the Turkish population adhered to the modern Turkish language introduced by who you consider your father Ataturk. Besides, this adds to the fact that I do have Turkish friends whom live in Turkey and who master Turkish perfectly and would translate for me any modern complex texts. If you don't trust me, just give it a try. Fadix 21:18, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>oh i bet you know little about Ottoman language because it seems so.Its just limited to a few words that you heard from your parents, may be only the word "hatret" because it seems they only teach you this.What you call about the deaths during the "techir" does not suit with the definition of genocide at first place.I repeat again that it was not a politically decided genocide attempt.Many Turks passed away as well.Have you ever heard about how many people were dead during the war in Dardanels in World War 1.Also, what will you say about the genocide commited by armenians during the Turkish independence war i,e,. when armenians invaded Turkish lands in 1920s or do you have courage to confess the genocide still going on in azerbaican??</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it doesn't seem so, pay a visit to Lebanon or Syria and you'll witness yourself what language elderly people still speak, and even with their son and daughters. The Turkish those people knew/know is Ottoman Turkish, and there still are people of my generation that have learned from their parents and grandparents still speaking the language as a cipher code so that the younger ones don't understand. My knowledge doesn't limit to few words, and more so when Arabic words are concerned. The fact of the matter is that Tehcir, or more precisely Tenkil implyed a forced evacuation and not just simple immigration, and this is even recorded in widely available foreign ministry publications. Halacoglu claims that it was wrongly translated to deportation, when it actually meant immigration, this claim was again included in other sites as a result. This is completly wrong, and I suggested you to verify in an Ottoman dictionary yourself. It does not simply mean immigration, it means a forced transfer, evacuation, deportation, and even destruction(to do away).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Comming to what you call "Turkish genocide;" it takes a brain not functioning like it should, to think that in 1920, when over half of the Ottoman Armenian population already perished, it was possible for the Armenians to commit genocide. To the contrary, during the so-called Turkish war of independence, the Kemalist troops have reached Alexandripole, without any resistance, as if they were cutting into butter, the result was the entire destruction of Russian Armenia, and the death of hundreds of thousands of people. The Germans reported from past 1918, the condition of Russian Armenia as a result. The Ottoman managed to take away three pieces of lands they sliced from there, and they even planed to go through Alexandripole to Baku. Karabkir in his own memoirs during his plans to Nachikevan and Karabagh, wrote: "Armenia destroy for eternity." As for the Turkish casulties of war, more German than Jews died in World War II, doesn't in anyway excuse the Germans for what they did to the Jews.</dd>

<dd>Armenians invaded Turkish lands? The last time I have checked, it was the other way around, take a historic map, and compare the Armenia to the current republic of Armenia? Whom invaded whom? Where are the Armenians in Western Armenia? They vanished. As for Azerbaijan, don't drag me there for your own sake. Fadix 16:51, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why did Turks suddenly decided to kill Armenians&#160;?</span></h2>
<p>As it is at August 2005, "Armenian Genocide" article is a pure propaganda, not an encyclopaedia item. Turks and Armenians have lived in peace for more then 900 years in Anatolia until 1915. Half of the Ottoman "sadrazam" ( primeminister ) were ethnic Armenians. <b>Why did Turks suddenly decided to kill Armenians&#160;?</b> Reading this article , one gets the impression that, one day, "Young Turks" decided to eliminate Armenian population in Ottoman Empire for the fun of it.</p>
<p>To understand what really happened , you should get a good look at "<a href="../../../t/a/s/Tashnak.html" title="Tashnak">Tashnak</a>" article. Founded at 1890, financed by Imperial Russia, England, French and also by U.S. , never mind also by rubbing other Armenians in Ottoman Empire, Tashnak started as a terrorist gang and organised a bloody revolt. At spring of 1915, nearly a quarter million Turkish civilians were killed during the Armenian uprising in East Anatolia. With all young man at fronts, Turks were cached defenceless against their neighbours, who were well trained and armed and has been preparing for their day since 25 years. Fighting in Galliipoli for the very life of the empire, it took Ottoman army months to gather troops to suppress the revolt. Suppressing a bloody revolt was also bloody. Ottoman troops killed every Armenian holding a gun.</p>
<p>After the revolt, Ottoman government decided to exile Armenians at east Anatolia to Lebanon. The exile was poorly planned and executed. My estimate is that nearly half a million Armenian civilians died during the exile because of neglect and mistreatment of Ottoman authorities. Main dead causes were epidemics, lack of supplies and attacks of Kurdish tribes on convoys, which had no proper military escort. It is a common fact that the exile turned to a big fiasco for Ottoman government and a big disaster for the exiled Armenians. Yet this is not a holocaust , but a tragedy of war.</p>
<p><b>The following are all lies:</b> Armenians at west of empire and Armenian villages which declared their loyalty during the uprising (like Armenians in Malatya, in Amasya...) were not effected. This clearly shows that this is not an ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>After 1915, the blood did not stop there. Armenian troops under Imperial Russian control invaded most of the eastern Turkey in 1917. Turkish civilians had to run or die. Then the cards turned again at 1918, when Soviets withdraw their support from Armenians. Then, when French troops invaded most of east Turkey at 1919, including Adana, Maras, Antep and Urfa, they armed Armenians as gendarme troops. Their misbehaviours against Turkish civilians ended up with this cities revolting against superior French forces and forcing them out of the region at 1920-1921, not without help of the revolution government in Ankara, formed by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustafa_Kemal_bd92.html" title="Mustafa Kemal">Mustafa Kemal</a>. It is no small wonder that the Armenian population in the French occupation zone either has leaved with the French troops to Syria or forced to live. The same fate was waiting the Armenians who cooperated and joined the Greek invasion army in the Aegean region at 1919, when Turkish cavalier reached Smyrna at 1922.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I also personally know an Armenian who fighted AGAINST the Greek invasion in Turkish Liberation War ( <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a> ) and carried the Liberation Medal with honour and pride until his dead at 1976 at age of 75. At every Victory Day ( 30 August ) , I visited him and kissed his hand.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the Latin alphabet to Turkish and forming of the Turkish grammar has been done by another Armenian, who was the General Secretary of Turkish Linguistic Institution until his dead at 1960's.</p>
<p>Every 3 th man in Anatolia has some Armenian genes beside Turkish ones after living together for 900 years. Indeed a big majority of Anatolian Armenians are not true Armenians but grand sons and daughters of <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hittites.html" title="Hittites">Hittites</a> , who adopted Armenian language and culture in the 2.th century, Armenia being the only Christian state, supporting Anatolian Christians.</p>
<p>I can trace 6 different ethnic origins in 4 generations in my family, like many other Turks.</p>

<p>The above is comprised entirely of untrue and unsupported propoganda - If there is even a sliver of truth to anything you have said above its only by chance. I won't even waste my time with this - but one point I will make - all Armenain s of Amasya were deported and most killed and this has been extremely well documented - unlike your entirely made up baseless monologue above.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 03:04, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, you forgot that there was a genocide in 1896 as well and the fact that the Armenians were viewed by the Turks as the Jews were by Nazi Germany. Thus leading to the first genocide and the revolt in 1915.</p>
<p><br />
---Actually, both my parents were born in Amasya, and moved to Istanbul in 1962. My Armenian Grandfathers died in Amasya in 1977 and there were Armenian's living there up to the early to mid 1980's. With that being said, MANY armenians were both Killed and deported from Amasya during WWI including 7 out of 8 of my Great Grandparents. My Grandfather was forced at Knife point to change his name when he was 9 years old. All of this took place in Amasya. Though other places had it much worse, do not under estimate the carnage that took place. EVD -- 20:23, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you come to Istanbul, or travel to Amasya, or Malatya, (which you can do freely also as an Armenian Republic citizen ) you can still talk to the "dead" or "fictional" Armenians from this towns. I have talked with many people from both sides , who PERSONALLY lived this events. Unfornunatly, almost all are dead now due age.</p>
<p>If your hate does not blind you, you should listen and look at both sides. Armenian Diaspora and Armenians in Armenia grow up with a constant conditioning and hate against Turks. If you object this, have a good look at your primary school books.</p>
<p>We live together with people from many ethnic origins and we learn to understand and respect them, where as in modern Armenia, hate against Turks is state policy.</p>
<p>What Armenians did at Azerbaijan <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> at 1992-1994 is another proof of how they rise their children since 3 generations...</p>

As he was returning to US, he was arrested at the airport and accused with "smugling valuable books out of Armenia" , which he purchesed from a <b>second hand shop</b> in Erivan for a few US$. His work and all other documentation is taken from him and he is still in prison at 10 August 2005, without any trial.</p>

<dd>My primary school books? My primary schools books didn't even mentioned Armenia or Turkey, I was even not aware where Armenia or Turkey were on a map. I don't see how I was conditioned this way here in Quebec, I wasn't even studying in an Armenian school. Could we say the same about you and Turkish schools? State policy you say? Are you trying to kid me? Just read Turkish newspapers and how Armenians are viewed, only 20 years ago, Armenians were considered as lower than animals in those same newspapers. Perhaps should I quote one article that ask to not call Armenians dogs anymore because it will bring in the population hate against the animals? And what to say about "professors" such as Halacoglu and how they treat the Armenians in their pseudo-works? What I have done in Azerbaijan, Sir? What do you have to say about Azerbaijani autorities statments regarding not leaving a single Armenian in Azerbaijan, which was one of the things that sparked a conflict there? Oh yeh! I forgot, since Armenians are always those to be blamed, it must have been their faults.</dd>

<dd>What do you know about Yektan Turkyilmaz? Did you know that he recognizes the Armenian genocide? The guy told how he was free to get any documents he wanted in the archives, there aren't many researchers that will claim the samein Turkey. Oh and, the guy is a student of Duke, not a professor, he was undergoing researches for his PhD degree, and I, like many Armenians were sympathic to his work. He was not arrested because of restriction in the archives, but rather because of an Armenian law meant for the protection of national treasures, restricting people to get more than 6 old books out of the country without a permission. He took over 80 books. He probably ignored the law, like many do, and it is stupid to still keep him there, but this law is not selective, even if I strongly disagree with his detention. But talking of hypocrasy, shall I cite various names of people in Turkey jailed for similar offenses? Do you have anything to say about those? Fadix 16:35, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been too Amasya twice BTW - it isone of my favorite places in all of Anatolia - a wonderful town in an incredible setting. I stayed in an Armenian house there in fact (now owned by Turks)...this does not change the fact that the Armenians of Anasya were brutally killed - and for no reason - this is fact. They were "deported" into the widerness, slughtered en-route - and very few survived. I have read accounts of these incident (though am unsure if what I read is available online). Anyway I fail at all to see any poit you are trying to make. The Armenian Genocide is incredibly well documented. The lack of any Armenian uprising or revolt is also documented. The CUP central commitee decision to commit/undertake Genocide and the methodologies employed - the party aparatus emplaced in the provinces, the Special Organization drafted of trained killers and violent convicts, the disarming and masacre of Ottoman Armenian soldiers was all witnessed and documented. Do you deny any of this? If you do then you are pityfly unifomed - willfuly or otherwise - if you do acknowledge and understand - then why the lame excuses - why are you changing the subject and making up things that are untrue? Can you truly be so ignorant and stupid? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 20:39, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Thoth,</p>
<p>You seem to lose it. I am considered nor ignorant , neither stupid . But, you are getting easily rude. For the non existent Armenian revolt at 1915, I can tell you MANY things with great confidence, because one of the victims of the "fictional" revolt happened to be my grandfather, Recep Ayhan ( Muftuoglu) ( 1905 Van-1998 Mersin ). His family was a well established Turkish family from Van. Indeed, his father was "Muftu" of Van at 1915. When the Armenians revolted and it was obvious that the local military had no change to stop the slaughter ( Armenians slaughtering Turks and Kurds ) , the family and their peasants (around 100) , also taking their herd, headed for west trough the mountains. They had no time to stop and cook, because they were pursued. When they needed food, they just killed a cow and eaten the raw meal. Because of this memory, he became a vegetarian for the rest of his life. After one week, in the dark, they were ambushed by a Tashnak band. Most of the peasants, his mother and father , one brother and two sisters were killed in the brief first exchange. The Tashnak were using modern ( of the time) rifles, where as the convoy had only 6 one shot guns. My grandfather (10) and his two brothers (4, 8), each carried by a loyal servant found salvage in the darkness of the night, each heading at another direction. One week later, the servant who saved my grandfather meets a Turkish cavalry group from the cavalry army under General Kazim Karabekir (RIP), and was delivered first to Malatya, then in time to Istanbul. At 1925, he finalized his government financed education as a teacher. He found his remaining brothers at 1975 and learned that they adaptop the surname "Muftuoglu", meaning the son of the "muftu". I have heard this story for many times and in every detail he could recall.</p>
<p>I have heard confirming memories from many other old Turks, who personally witnessed and involved and also two old Armenians in Istanbul, who know details of the revolt.</p>
<p>By the way, Aram Quirik, the gentleman with the Turkish Libaration Madal, is from the town Amasya. Most of the Amasya Armenians moved to Istanbul after the republic on their own will. None were killed, but a few Tashnak militans, who were trying to make them revolt and turned to Ottoman authorities by loyal Armenians.</p>
<p>You may easly say that I am lying and producing fictional excuses for the genocide. You are free to do so. Even if the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tashnak.html" title="Tashnak">Tashnak</a> leaders, who leaded the revolt would rise from their graves, find you in person and tell you their true story, you wouldn't belive them...</p>
<p>By the way, I had a live-in girl friend for 3 years , with an Armenian father and Turkish mother. My wife is still jealous of her and she is still a good friend.</p>

<dd>Would it be too much asking, for you to post the dates, when those things happened? It happens that part of my family were from Van, from all of them, only 2 remained alive, they didn't had the chance to kill a cow to eat its meat, but rather the send, for a little boy not having still reached 10 year old, must have been not so easy. The same story from Marash from the other side of my family. Those from Van were there, when Jevet has ordered to eliminate any single Armenian male through Van(even Nogales the psychopath report this in his memories, when him and his cavalry fighting under the Ottoman flag were cannonading Armenian buildings.)
<dl>
<dd>Dear Fedix,</dd>
<dd>My Grandfather told me that it was end of winter, early spring. Probably end of March or early April 1915. But I can not be sure, because the spring is late at Van region.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The first week of April, from over 20 people in one side of my family, only about 2 remained alive, and this in Van. Ussher, had a mission there, the same zone where a Red-Cross mission was attacked, because it was trying to rescue Armenians. I have gathered from the collections of said memoirs from Turks there, published by, I believe ATAA, an admission that before any upraising, in few days, Armenian shops were entirely destroyed. I gather from memoirs of my family, that irregulars under the order of Jevet, the governor, were rounding males from teenage year, to 65 years old, and killing them. Boys were hidden in baskets, and here is how the male survivor from the other side of my family made it through. This order, is even confirmed by Nogales, when he learns in April, that the upraising has started when the fool, Jevet, has ordered that every Armenian male in the city had to be killed. While Armenian shops were destroyed, and males butchered. Jevet was placed there by the Ittihadists to replace the other governor, because that governor was refusing to follow orders.

<dd>So, you have heard those memories from many elderly Turks? You know what? Either some were hiding things, not being sincere, or lying. And before you claim that I am disrespecting your ancestors, start asking Armenians about their “stories.” Every Diasporan Armenian has his/her story, all similar one from the other. Must have been weird that from those that you have asked, it was always one sided. Have you gone to Nalyhan, have you asked the Turkish natives there why the soil is red? They believe the soil was colored reddish because the the Armenian blood that has covered the entire area after the Armenians were killed. Or what about those native Turks and Kurds along the Hazar lake? Have you interviewed them about the Armenians? Here, you can read what those you have interviewed haven't told you: <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/armnm.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/armnm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/armnm.htm</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can easly guess the rest of story and I also have heard partial confessions. After the Armenian revolt was suppressed and most of the able bodied Armenians died fighting, Turkish and Kurdish villains returned to their villages ( to run for their lives again one year later ) and started <b>revenging</b> on the Armenian villages. Once the army leaved a village, Armenians were killed by their neighbours, because their cousin killed someones cousin during the revolt. At that interval, Turks and Kurd had the upper hand. The governments official reason ( which you doubt ) for the exile is&#160;:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i><b>::1-To stop the fighting between the subjects of the empire.</b></i> <i><b>::2-To secure the region from any new revolt, which is near the war zone,</b></i> <i><b>::by moving Armenians to a neutral and secure region of the empire( at that time), Lebanon.</b></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will not fight you now on <b>the real intend</b> but on the results of the exile , we both agree, disagreeing with the numbers and intension.</dd>
<dd>We had the "Chain Revenge Crimes Law" effectiv until 1970's. If one man gets killed, a relative of his goes and kills the killer, if the killer is not available (prisoned), his brother or cousin and now it is the other families turn... It is called "Kan Davasi" or "Blood Case". It can sometimes go on for generations. To stop this hostality, the classical Ottoman solution to the problem was hanging the killers and exiling the whole family ( most of the time some 100), which started the fight to another region of the empire.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is a weakness in your equation, at that time, most Armenian able bodied male, were conscripted in the Army, even those whom pied the military taxes were conscripted by force, to later be disarmed, sent in labor battalions or either being liquidated. So, those male could not have been killed in fightings. You can, to convince yourself, watch pictures taken by Germans, of Armenian convoys, you will see that there are no men aging from 14 to 65 years old, if there are some, they managed to hide. In fact, the official Tashnak press organs letter to the Ittihadist, indicate, how they were taken in surprise, this later is even in Uras collections. And later, many people were thrown to complete the Baghdad railroad. So, I can't conceive, how Armenians could have done what you report, when they were alienated, first from their intellectuals(whom were taken in shut), and their male population. There are even in Austrian and German records, crimes perpetrated soon in the war, in late 1914 against Armenians. I have already provided a reference here. Fadix 20:04, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And sorry, but as I confess, you should also confess that the Armenians also has the same notion of REVENGE as Turks and Kurds. At 1916-1919 , when Armenian troops with Rusian officers took control of the region, it happened all over again. At 1919-22 interval, when Turks won control again, all Armenian were forced to leave the region again. There were not many civilians left from any side in region at the end of this bloody war--<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarioglu_2329.html" title="User:Isarioglu">Isarioglu</a> 18:44, 12 August 2005 (UTC).--85.96.187.191 18:33, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Confessing what? I will only confess for things I did, and never for things I did not. The official Ottoman statistics were of 800,000 killed, during the Military tribunal, the figure of 1.2 million having perished was presented. On the other hand, Ahmed Emin, whom was known to be anti-Armenian, has presented in his work, the figures of Muslim having perished because of Armenians, and the total figure for the entire period, hardly exceeded 150,000. The guy was an Ittihadist, and later introduced in the Kemalist administration. He was as well a Malta prisoner, and was closely implicated in the destruction of telegraphic orders to liquidate Armenians. The guy to come up with his figures has used war time propaganda, which is exposed, for the simple fact that he use for the second period of 1916 and over a more accurate and certified number, that is lower than those he brings for 1914-15. Not only a little lower, while those of 1914-15, reach over 100,000, the second set is more like 30,000. The only reason for this, is that there are no set of figures available, other than those produced by the Ittihadist party press organ, which also suggest that the total number of Muslim killed by Armenians could hardly reach 50,000, when using the confirmed figures for the second period of the war, and extrapolating from it, those of 1914-15. Because most Muslim died, mid late 1916 to later, while most Armenians died from 1914 to beginning of 1916, which also mean, those two events were unrelated.</dd>

<dd>Now, when one considers, the extend and nature of the crimes perpetrated against the Armenians, any crimes that Armenians would have committed in WWI, would be considered as insignificant, and could never justify, the total destruction of the Armenian community from the hearthland of Anatolia, where they lived for 3 millennium. And just in a matter of 2 years, the community just vanished. It is rather ironic, that everywhere, where Turks claims Armenians have committed massacres, there is no traces of Armenian presence, as if, those that massacred were those that vanished.

<dd>As for Amasya, sorry, you are completely wrong. Have you read, Ernst von Kwaiatkowski's(Austrian Consul-General) reports and dispatches regarding how Armenians in Amasya were brutally butchered like animals(and by pretext the Ittihadist press organ were dispatching advertisement of authored pictures of cache of arms to justify the decision)? Do you think that Armenians left Amasya to Istanbul from their own? Not only the Armenians there that managed to survive have lost their resources, but they had to face the attacks under the pretext of Ataturks “Amasya Declaration,” that made later those Armenians being dumped in the so-called Greeko-Armenian population exchange quit to Istanbul, that for most of those that survived and made it through, was even not the final destination. Fadix 23:27, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There was a Tashnak cell in Amasya, but they did not success to organise a revolt , because the local Armenians did not cooperate. In the end they were turned to Ottoman by Armenians and killed. I do not deny that most of the Turkish population was no more friendly with the Armenians in Anatolia. But nobady killed them or hurt them. Kemalist regime did not allow any such a crime after 1923, when law and order was restored under the new republic. At 1923- 1938, the economy in Anatolia was in bad shape, trying to recover from a deep trauma. After 1939 eartquake, thinks turned worse. It was the logical move to move for Istanbul for any craftsman.

<dd>Are you claiming that Ernst von Kwaiatkowski reports and survivors accounts of Amasya, were lies?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Armenian Archives Can Not Be Used Freely</span></h2>
<p>Trial Of Arrested Turkish Scholar Opens In Yerevan Baku Today Radio Free Europe 10/08/2005 10:40 [...] The opening session of the trial adjourned less than an hour after its beginning at the request of one of Turkyilmaz’s newly hired lawyers who said he needs more time to familiarize himself with the case. [...] the next hearing {is} for Friday. Among those attending the first hearing were local human rights activists and officials from the U.S. embassy in Armenia. [...] Individuals convicted of smuggling have rarely ended up in jail in Armenia. Hence, growing questions about reasons for the severity of the charges leveled against the Turkish national of Kurdish extraction. The chief prosecutor at the trial, Koryun Piloyan, refused to explain them on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“You don’t look at the issue correctly,” Piloyan told RFE/RL. “[Turkyilmaz’s] deed corresponds to that article of the Criminal Code.” [...] “Yektan is a good man, there is nothing bad I can say about him,” said Sevan Deirmenjian, an ethnic Armenian citizen of Turkey who is pursuing a doctoral degree at Yerevan State University and befriended Turkyilmaz after meeting the latter in Armenia.</p>
<p>Avetik Ishkhanian of the Armenian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, was also at the trial and urged the authorities not to give the defendant a prison sentence.[...].</p>
<p>Ishkhanian was among those who were allowed to visit the arrested scholar at a maximum security prison in Yerevan. “He wasn’t particularly unhappy with conditions there,” he told RFE/RL. “His main grievance was his detention. I also remember him saying that he could imagine being arrested in Turkey but never thought that could happen in Armenia.”</p>
<p>Note: Above are excerpts from the article. The full article appears here. Clarifications and comments by me are contained in {}. Deletions are marked by [...]. The bold emphasis is mine.</p>

<dd>So as you see, no body can use Armenian Governmental Archives freely as commonly known, but Turkish Governmental Archives are open to everyone, also there are people in Turkey, who accepts the Armenian genocide, but there is no arrestment to anybody, everybody can discuss the Armenian Genocide by opposite decisions. And there is no primary document about any order that was given to ethnically annihilate the Armenians by Ottoman Government. If there is show it.-- <a href="../../../a/o/z/User%7EAozan_ddc2.html" title="User:Aozan">aozan</a>
<dl>
<dd>Turkyilmaz do recognize the Armenian genocide, he was arrested not for his works in the archives, according to his own words he had access to everything he asked, there are hardly any scholars that would claim having had access to any files they wanted in Turkish archives(and I can name many if you want). This thing makes me wonder if he wasn't arrested for some reason that has more to do with the fact that he tried to get over 80 books out of the country, and not few books, which led Armenian autorities to believe he was some Turkish agent, which of course is ridiculous. I am all for his liberation, from what I gathered from the guy, he seemed to be a serious and professional researcher whom had no ill intend, I may be wrong though. Oh and another thing, there are two trials pending these days in Turkey close to the issue, and those that are accused were accused for less than that, while there are similar laws in other countries as those existing in Armenia, for the protection of national heritage materials, and this including for Turkey, those two cases pending in Turkey are based on ridiculous laws. Fadix 17:28, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If he did not accept it beforehand , he would never have any access to Armenian archives. By the way, please name the 2 pending similar cases in Turkey, so that we Turks also know it please.</dd>

<dd>As for his aknowledgement, you are assuming here. The guy was ethnicly Kurd, and very friendly with the Armenian community, and very critical of the official Turkish government history, and this before he has undergone to research in the Armenian archive. So claiming that he has done this to be accepted is pure speculation. As for the names, do you want that I refresh your memory about the cases of Hrant Dink, and post why he is accused so that one might compare the ridiculous nature of the accusation? What about the Kurdish lawyer accused? Oh and, I might ignore your answer, if it has nothing to do with the current article and a way to improve it. It is not that i don't like the discussion, but we should continue in our talk pages if it is uninvolved with the article. Fadix 22:46, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
