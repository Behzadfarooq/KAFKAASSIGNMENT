<p>The historic meaning of the 'A' in ARM seems to be up for debate. Certainly the current owners of the ARM IP are Advanced RISC Macchines, Ltd. And I have no doubt but that they have chosen to use the 'A' in the ARM acronym to stand for "Advanced".</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the article now states that the 'A' _originally_ stood for "Advanced". But to my knowledge that isn't true. I've always been under the impression that the 'A' _originally_ stood for "Acorn". Should the paragraph be reverted back to the original "Acorn" form? Or would it be better to reword it entirely to omit the "originally" part?</p>
<p>The same person seems to have modified a hyperlink in the History section. The first sentence phrase "research project" used to point to "Acorn Computers Ltd#New RISC architecture". This is a valid entry in the Acorn Computers article. Now it points to "Advanced Computers Ltd#New RISC architecture". That's a dead link.24.222.2.222</p>

<p>No, not if you include 8/16-bit microcontroller applications (PIC, 8051, MC6800, etc.) In terms of volume (not revenue, of course), 8/16-bit microcontroller still hold the lead in 'dumb' consumer appliances (alarm clocks, radios, microwaves, etc.) This will not change anytime soon. 32-bit architectures (like the ARM) are overkill for these devices.</p>

<p>Article states that ARM core with NEON can execute MP3 decoder in 10 CPU MHz. This is silly. What is 10 CPU MHz? Does that mean it runs in 10 CPU clocks? Or it runs in less than 10ms? This needs clarification.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's uncommon to reference that "such-and-such a process runs in X MHz on processor Y", particularly in the embedded world where clock frequencies are more scalable. It gives a general indication of how much of the CPU's bandwidth the task takes. Ptoboley 15:27, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it the case that Acorn Computers were <i>refused access</i> to the Intel 80286? According to a near contemporary commentary by Dick Pountain that I recall reading, the company's technicians were unhappy to adopt the 80286 because its interrupt performance was markedly inferior to that of the 6502 and they regarded high interrupt performance as essential to support the direction they were taking in their system software. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Peakall_9751.html" title="User:Alan Peakall">Alan Peakall</a> 17:32 Nov 15, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They were refused access. I believe they wanted to hack the design to suit their purposes, and Intel didn't want to licence those rights unto them.</dd>

<p>It is said that Acorn wanted to have access to the 286 core and use it on their own silicon. Intel were not impressed. A <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/GUARDIAN-Acorn.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/GUARDIAN-Acorn.html" rel="nofollow">story in the Grauniad</a> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hauser believed that to design a really efficient computer, you also needed to design the chip inside it. Originally, Acorn planned to use Intel's 286 chip in its Archi-medes computer. But because Intel would not let it license the 286 core and adapt it, Acorn decided to design its own.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>An <a href="http://atterer.net/acorn/arm.html" class="external text" title="http://atterer.net/acorn/arm.html" rel="nofollow">Electronics Weekly article</a> quoted Hauser as saying</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I asked Intel for the 286 core and they said we're not interested in selling cores - only microprocessors."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, I suspect that that particular story was fabricated by Hauser as a post-hoc validation of his "IT Guruship" &amp; therefore a justifcation for his venture Capital "prowess".</p>
<p>The Wikipedia articles on Acorn and the ARM make the decision to design a processor sound as though it was made for mundane reasons. The reality is much more intersting. It very much seems like Acorn was a playground for some very talented people (Wilson &amp; Furber being the most easily identified) and the Acorn RISC Machine seems actually to have been developed for the simple reason that the engineers wanted to play and, more importantly, were able to play. For example, in <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/AU-AcornHistory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/AU-AcornHistory.html" rel="nofollow">an Acorn User</a> article on the history of acorn, it is said that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The most advanced division of the Advanced Research and Development section was, during 1984, working on a new processor chip incorporating the idea of a reduced instruction set - an idea that was at that time quite revolutionary.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even within Acorn few people knew about the project - it took Roger Wilson some time to tell his boss, Hauser, what he was doing, let alone anyone else.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This ability to "play" was in a large part permitted by the (chaotic?) management structure at Acorn in the early-80s. In designing the replacement for the BBC (inc Master), the Acorn engineers had access to the TUBE. This allowed them to test processors in a fairly unique way. It does seem to be true that they were unhappy with the interrupt responses of the 68000 in particular. In the <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/AU-AcornHistory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/AU-AcornHistory.html" rel="nofollow">Acorn User Acorn history</a>, Roger Wilson is quoted as saying that</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The jump to 32-bit was a result of all the work on second processors for the BBC micro. By using the Tube, we were the only people in the world who could use the same operating system with all the different processors. We could rate their performance. We ran through every single processor - and the 8086 and 68000 chips that we tried were really slow. They couldn't even keep up with the Tube protocols that the 6502 managed.'</dd>

<dd>Acorn briefly considered the Motorola 68000 but rejected on the ground that its inclusion of long running uninterruptible instructions, like divide DIVS, would have more than doubled its interrupt latency compared to the 6502. This meant that expensive direct memory access (DMA) hardware would have been needed to support fast input/output operations.</dd>

<p>I don't believe the story that said that Acorn wanted to license the 286 core for the simple reason that the business model of licensing cores had not been established at that time. I suspect that Herman may been mixing up the story of Active Book. It is true that poor interrupt latency was one of the main reasons that Acorn could not adopt cores such as the NS32016 or 68K. The BBC micros used pseudo-DMA (ie interrupts) for handling the disk, and the long interrupt latency of the micro-programmed cores would have necessitated a DMA controller, which would have increased costs unacceptably. Going back to Active Book, the ARM2as, the first fully static (and therefore low-power) ARM was created for the Active Book, Herman's start-up. But when AT&amp;T acquired it they were forced to switch to the Hobbit processor. About the same time, Apple switched from Hobbit to ARM.</p>

<p>ARM created a DSP coprocessor to ARM called Piccolo. The architecture was fairly innovative, for instance by using the ARM as data(address) generator and instruction feeder. While information is svailable on the net it is sparse. Stranger still it is nearly absent on ARM's own web pages. My own attempts to get more information and a license when it was announced was met with a silence. An addition on Piccolo would complement the other coprocessors listed and would hopefully explain what happened.</p>

<p>The "design notes" section states&#160;:</p>
<p><i>The ARM instruction set follows the 6502 in concept, but includes a number of features designed to allow the CPU to better pipeline them for execution.</i></p>
<p>If this statement could be somehow traced back to the original design team, then it seems to clearly reflect the british heritage of the arm design - I would consider this somewhat of an understatement&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Other than the mnemonic "add", I can think of no similarities between the 6502 and ARM instruction set.</p>
<p>The only similarities that come to mind would not be part of the instruction set, but of the implementation&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the 6502 and the ARM (AFAIK) did not use microcode, but were hardwired.</li>
<li>Both had a simple two-level interrupt priority structure</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried to clarify this in the design-notes section.</p>
<p>However, if anybody does know more about the 6502's influence on the ARM design, please add it back.</p>
<p>Also, I am sorry if the list of features I added are not "encyclopedia-like" enough, but I thought it would not help the readability of a "list of features" if they are incorporated in a block of text.</p>

<p>"ADD", "ADC", "SUB", "SBC". Also, the carry flag is the "wrong way round" after subtraction, the same as the 6502. That is, after subtraction, Carry=0 if a carry occured, and SBC does result=operand1-operand2-(1-carry). Other CPUs (eg, Z80) use Carry=1 and result=operand1-operand2-carry. JGHarston 18:36, 04 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The influence of the 6502 is over-stated in the article. As you rightly say, it was limited to the assembler syntax, the fact that the processor was pipelined and not microcoded, and the design-goal of good interrupt latency (as I mentioned earlier).</p>

<dd>They are talking about the same thing. The 4-bit field has 15 legal values, 1 for "always" and 14 pairs of complementary condition codes (EQ/NE, etc.). The 16th value (1111) historically meany "never" (complement of "always"), but now indicates a different instruction which cannot itself be conditional, because there's no condition field.</dd>

<p>What is Three Address Architecture? This needs clarification.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Three address architectures are ones where arithmetic instructions have three "addresses", being two addresses (usually register names) for the operands and one for the result. This is distinct from architectures which use a specific accumulator register to which most arithmetic operations refer to implicitly. - Donal Fellows 10:12, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>Some early ARM processors (prior to ARM7TDMI), for example, have no instruction to load a two-byte quantity, so that, strictly speaking, for them it's not possible to generate code that would behave the way one would expect for C objects of type "volatile short".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could this not be implemented with the following code? (My ARM code is a little rusty.)</p>
<pre>
r0 = address of variable

// for word-aligned address:
// shift left and right to clear top 16 bits
ldr r1,[r0]
mov r1,r1,lsl#16
mov r1,r1,lsr#16

// for half-word-aligned address:
// shift right to clear bottom 16 bits
ldr r1,[r0,#2]  // adding 2 will make address word-aligned
mov r1,r1,lsr#16
</pre>
<p>That would make it atomic, as opposed to a two-byte access:</p>
<pre>
ldrb r1,[r0]
ldrb r2,[r0,#1]
orr r1,r1,r2,lsl#8
</pre>

<dd>One problem is that you may not be allowed to access the other 16 bits at the same time in a 32-bit read. One common use for a volatile short is a 16-bit register on external hardware, where you generally don't want to read registers without a good reason: for example, some chips I've worked with would clear a register to zero after it's read, or update an internal address after each read (e.g. you set the internal address to some value, then each time you read the register it returns the contents of that internal memory address and increments it ready for the next read). I also seem to remember one chip's documentation saying it may lock up if you read undocumented addresses! So unexpectedly reading any of those registers in order to get the value of a neighbouring register could be bad news. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 16:31, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the comment about not being able to support volatile short is spurious (though perhaps true) in that I can't think of any situation where you would need it on an ARM processor. Normally on-chip registers are all 32 bit (AMBA APB doesn't support anything other than 32-bit accesses). All volatile registers whatever their actual size should be 32-bit aligned. --Ashleystevens 12:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to ARM figures <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, in Q2 2006, 36% of royalties were accounted to ARM9-family, of which 11 percentage points were ARM926EJ-S. No comment is made on how the other 25 points of this 36% are split (e.g. between v4T ARM9TDMI-based cores and v5TE ARM9E-based cores), or how the 64% splits between the other core families (i.e. ARM7, ARM9, ARM10, ARM11, SecurCore, and Cortex).

<p>I think the article sounds too much like advertising. "one of the most prolific 32-bit architectures in the world." "are found in all corners of consumer electronics" "To keep the design clean, simple and fast" The <i>ARM licensees</i> section is also pretty bad. I'm a bit biased toward 8051 archs personally, so I leave it more up to discussion on how to cut down on the adverty speak in the article. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 05:18, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The ARM licensees section is very poor and contains many errors and statements of opinion, and over-generalisations, plus a number of things that are irrelevent to ARM. However, since the title of the Wikipedia page is "ARM Architecture" I think that this whole section is probably in the wrong place anyway. Either the page title should be changed (can you do that?) or this should perhaps moved to either <a href="../../../a/r/m/ARM_Holdings_8e6d.html" title="ARM Holdings">ARM_Holdings</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiconductor_IP_cca4.html" title="Semiconductor IP">Semiconductor_IP</a> --Ashleystevens 13:06, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would suggest that "the cores" section is becoming unweildy. A few other points would warrant a re-organization of the page here:</p>
<ul>
<li>the cores (ARM7TDMI, ARM9, etc.) are <i>implementations</i> of the architecture. Although this information is interesting to some, perhaps, it is not directly relevant to the <i>ARM Architecture</i>, which is the subject of the page.</li>
<li>only those cores designed by ARM Limited (ARM*) and Intel (XScale) are listed. There are other licensees of the architecture who have publically announced implementations.</li>
<li>the ARM implementations are <i>cores</i> in the sense that they may appear in a multitude of SoC designs. The Intel XScale <i>cores</i> are in fact complete SoCs, reflecting the different business models.</li>
<li>the list of cores (from ARM) and other ARM devices is likely to continue to grow as time goes by, making this problem worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>I propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of ARM designed processor cores becomes a new topic.</li>
<li>The list of XScale processors is moved to the <a href="../../../x/s/c/XScale_b73d.html" title="XScale">XScale</a> topic.</li>
<li>The existing <i>The cores</i> section is replaced with links to these topics, and other architectural licensees and publically announced ARM implementations are <b>mentioned</b> here (but not described in full).</li>
