<p>Hey everyone, I think we can still expand and improve the wording in this article. I've noticed there have been some revisions over the past few days. It'd be nice to post here what exactly that you changed just so we don't have to read the entire article to find changes.

<p>Thanks for the reference. I still believe (in fact i'm confidant) that this is a fabrication. I will get back to this article after I thouroughly research the matter and present my references.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 18:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Auron's source comes from an American historian named Alexander Dallin from his book <i>German Rule in Russia, 1941-1945: A Study in Occupation Policies</i> (London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1981, second edition) pp. 229, 251.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 04:47, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I felt justification of the Armenian Legion throughout the whole article. An attempt to prove them innocent while throwing a stone at Muslims and Turkics.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 13:05, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Justification for what? That is a grossly vague and ambiguous comment. Many Red Army soldiers volunteered to serve in the German Wehrmacht, they were called "Ostruppen" or "East troops" since many of them were from the Baltics, the Ukraine and the other parts of Eastern Europe. The fact that some of them were Armenians makes them no different than French legions defending Berlin in 1945. The Armenian legion was nothing but a logistical and an anti-aircraft battalion in Netherlands, nothing significant about them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I'm growing tired of policing you around while you constantly vandalize one Armenian related topic after another without giving any sufficent reasons for them. There are rules on Wikipedia, like <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. I'm trying to assume good faith here because I know articles are never perfect and need outside editing anf fixing but you come off as just another paranoid Turk who thinks there's an Armenian conspiracy against Turks and Turkic people. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 21:49, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No actually I am policing you and I am not being paranoid. I don't think you meant to offend Muslims or Turks with that quote, you just want everyone to think of Armenians as righteous people... even when they are cooperating with Nazis. I think the only person who has issues with Muslims here is Yair Auron.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 22:59, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's because throughout history Armenians have been a peaceful, benevolent people which have contributed heavily into works of art and beauty not destruction. That quote in no way should offend Muslims as Eupator and others were inquiring more into what units Hitler trusted and those were Muslims such as the Croats and other Balkan battalions he created. Its a simple truth Adolf Hitler professed to his aides and just because it sounds offending doesn't make it any less true. There's no use in denying that Turkey too, had signed several agreements with Nazi Germany for bilateral cooperation and trade and even copy-cat Nazi uniform designs at the time. But that's not the issue here, you're only advancing in what YOU think is a POV problem, not what it really.</p>
<p>And Yair Auron's quote comes from an American historian, read his book and understand that he is quite an amiable writer who researches the sociological aspects of the Genocide. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 23:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Armenians like you are doing great damage to Wikipedia NPoV, you are pushing Armenian PoV everywhere. I won't even get into Turkey's neutrality during WWII. Trade agreements? Pfftt, like they mean anything. What about USA-Nazi trade agreements until WWII broke? For example the Ford Motor Company did business in Germany until US entered the war. What about neutral Sweden supplying the Nazis with iron during the war, the most precious element for any war machine. What about the Swiss accepting all the blood stained Nazi money in their banks? USA even granted American citizenship to SS scientists after WWII. Current Pope even is a former SS member. And I am sure there were Armenians who were more than happy to cooperate with the Nazis despite your efforts here to portray all of them as <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Schindler_ca9b.html" title="Oscar Schindler">Oscar Schindler</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The truth is the word Nazi today is being used to associate events or people with evil. Nazis are no longer humans gone mad in history but biblical demons from the past. That's why today every group who had something to do with them tries to prove themselves innocent while accusing their enemies or opponents of being Nazi perpetrators in order to hurt their image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway back to what matters here, I would like to know American writer's sources for knowing such a quote from Hitler; I would like to know if it is sourced or attributed. If attributed then by who.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 08:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Trading between a car company (Ford) and trade with a neutral country (Sweden) is much less disparaging than the actually signing of a friendship treaty with Nazi Germany. Some Turkish university professors went so far as to even copy and make mock swastikas and preach anti-semitic ideals and glorification of the Nazi doctrine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Turkey was hardly a neutral member in World War II. In name perhaps, but in practice, it was just as ready to declare war on the Soviet Union if Stalingrad would fall and march into the heart of Armenia and connect with Azerbaijan. Perhaps this should be included also but one of the people like Dro formulated an Armenian volunteer division was to liberate Armenia from Stalin's grip and to quickly move in and defend any aggressive advances made by the Turkish army in the event Stalingrad would fall. The quote, I now believe to be suspect but I want it to remain until I can check up Dallin's source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm removing the POV tag also since you honestly have no comprehension of its purpose.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 21:54, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe you are deliberately diverting the discussion. Using shallow and simple accusations and speculations to blur the subject. Without citing sources, I can say Armenians were trying to convince Stalin to declare war on Turkey or Armenians were very happy with getting rid of Jews or Armenians are behind 9/11. See, it is easy. As we say in Turkish, "Throw a mud at someone, its stain will remain"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, you still haven't given me any sources for the quote or told me anything about any major disobedience within the legion that supports the quote. Look, I am sure there were some Armenians who helped or tried to help the Jews but there were 18,000 of them according to the information you gave and my sources tell me some of them were in Slovenia and Italy as a part of the Eastern Legions fighting the partisans. I would like to hear more about these rather than a fabricated quote. Make informative, fair, NPoV articles. If you find me pushing Turkish POV, tell me.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 09:21, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Deliberately diverting the discussion? Excuse me but it is not me who is visiting every article and crying "bias!" in Armenian-related issues. These are hardly "shallow" accusations. While the first premise is correct that several Armenians lobbied Stalin to fight and take back Kars and Ardahan from Turkey (the British eventually stopped them and so did the Americans when they formed close ties later on) the latter one with Jews and 9/11 and Armenians makes me question your intelligence and integrity to issues.</p>
<p>Turkey signed a Friendship Treaty with Nazi Germany on 18 June 1941. Turkey had earlier signed an agreement to entering war on the allied side with the French and British in 1939 but this new treaty just went to show that it was more closer fascist Germany than democratic Britain.</p>
<p>"The first was the revival of pan-Turkism....resurfaced in July 1941 under the leadership of professor Zeki Velidi Togan of Istanbul University. Unashamedly racist, <b>in imitation of the Nazis its leaders adopted the trappings of Fascism, down to an imitation-Hitler hairstyle and colourful uniform.</b>"</p>
<ul>
<li>Henderson, Alexander. January 1945. "The Pan-Turanian Myth in Turkey Today", Asiatic Review, vol. XLI, pp. 88–92</li>
</ul>
<p>On August 5 1941 German ambassador to Turkey Franz von Papen reported to Berlin that Turkish government "were showing increasing interest in the fate of their kinsmen, 'particularly the Azerbaijan Turks" showing proof Turkey was also determined to invade the Soviet Union in the case of a German victory. He continued:</p>
<p><i>These circles tend to recollect 1918 events: their wish is to annex the above area, especially the rich Baku oil fields. To these ends a committee of experts has been set up, embodying specialists who once officiated in this type of work during Abdul Hamid's time. This committee is to gather all pertinent material and is to enlist, in Turkey from the ranks of recent emigrants, and from immigrants – notably those in the Azerbaijan province of Iran – support for a union of the new Turkey with the Turk-inhabited regions bordering on it in the east, up to the Caspian sea.</i></p>
<p>Hostler C. W., "Turkism and the Soviets" New York, 1957, page 172</p>
<p>And of course after the Red Army defeated the Germans in Stalingrad these fasicistic notions were sent back to the filing cabinet.</p>
<p>Although Armenians may have been assimilated into battalions or sent into even smaller regiments I want to see what proof you have to show me. Obviously Hitler's quote sounds questionable but to call it a "fabrication" without citing any proof to the contrary is not bounds for "POV problems" (Auron's source came from a letter that he recieved by a Dutch historian who cited Dallin in his essay to Auron). You are claiming that what is listed in the article is false and hence, the burden of proof lies upon you to disprove it. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 20:49, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Same old, same old Bagramyan. These are all shallow methods to divert and blur subjects of discussions. You are trying to turn this into a discussion about Turkey. For every sentence I write on this subject, you'll write 5 times more, and at the end you hope my main question will be forgotten. I'll say one thing about this which I am sure you'll counter with 10, during WWII the world hardly knew anything about the fate of Jews; Nazi crimes were later documented and the horrors were revealed. So right now you have access to various sources of information about this subject but people of those times didn't. And don't underestimate the power of Nazi propaganda machine, still today they are considered masters of manipulation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, back to the <b>real topic</b>, you haven't given me anything to disprove. I need sources for the quote and if not, we should say it is attributed. Also if there is no record of major disobedience within the Armenian legion, excuse me but it highly increases the chances of that quote being fabricated.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 21:08, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Look Kagan, when you raise the issue of a discrepancy I don't shun you and say "Ahh Kagan you're just delusional, go away, you're just an ignoramus." No, I don't. When you casually pass off damning information that concludes <b>that Nazi-Turkish friendship was very close during World War II</b> then that tells me you don't like to hear factual, disparaging things about Turkey. As a Turk it may hurt to hear such a thing but Nazi propaganda has nothing to do with this, you only wish and believe it does. You are the one ignoring my evidence Kagan, don't complain to me if you dislike what you read and hear.</p>
<p>The burden of proof lies on you Kagan. I didn't raise the issue of POV problems with the article, <b>you</b> did. If there is something truly wrong with the article then show me impartial proof that disproves the facts in said article. Concerning Hitler's quote, it is found in Auron's book when he speaks about the Armenian Legion; wherein he cites his source: an essay sent by his Dutch historian friend where the Dutchman cites Dallin in the text. I cannot make it any more clearer for you as to where my source was found.Seeing as neither you nor Eupator has yet to offer me the evidence to the contrary, the quotation remains where it is. Until then, when you raise an objection, cite proof that shows clear evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>If you remain mute upon the topic and don't give me anything to work with you cannot possibly fault me for inactivity. Information on the topic is scarce, especially in Western studies where apparently the 812th is most significant and notable.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 21:47, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is nothing in Turkish-Nazi Germany relations that shame me because unlike you they didn't see Schindler's List. What I find amusing is while we have 18,000 Armenians on one hand, first person witnesses and cooperators in Nazi crimes, you defend them here yet on the other hand we have citizens of Turkey who knew nothing about what was going on in Europe at the time other than what they heard on the radio or what they were told and yet you are desperately trying to make them look like Nazi perpetrators here. Sorry pal, Turkey did a fine job keeping itself neutral during WWII, and thanks to that it became a refuge for many Jews in the Balkans and Greek islands; I am sure they are all very thankful Turkey did not enter WWII and did everything necessary to keep itself out, more than 100,000 Jews were saved in Turkey, never forget that. What about Armenia? Armenians ironically are not only cooperators in Nazi crimes but also Soviet. You think I'll pass Stalin as a saint? Definitely not, Stalin is unarguably Hitler with a more manly moustache.</dd>

<dd>Once again back to the real topic. A historians words can not be considered a source for a quote, it needs to show records, that how we know a quote is <b>sourced</b>. Do you want me to explain? Video footage, authentic papers, audio record; these are what we consider a source for words that came out of a wo/man's mouth or hand. Also you still haven't said anything about the Armenian troops who actively fought in Slovenia and Italy and it goes unmentioned in the article.</dd>

<p>You keep speaking about these crimes the Armenian soldiers committed but I'm dumbfounded as to why you have refrained from displaying them. Show me, reveal to me the source and I'll judge if its worthy in adding the additional information. How can I defend their "crimes" if I have no idea what crimes you are even talking about. The testimonies from the Jewish POWs come from interviews and so are more difficult to discredit.</p>
<p>Even your claim that "Turkey was a haven for Jews during the war" is misleading. Several times Turkey refused to accept Jews into their country and in times when it did, it was because the Jews had Turkish citizenship.</p>
<p>Your analogy in comparing Armenians' brutality to Stalin's rank is the most ridiculous thing I have heard. Everyone in the Soviet Union was persecuted by Stalin and Armenians were no exception. If you disagreed with Stalin or were suspected to, then you would be tortured and killed. <b>You are truly revealing that you too, have POV problems and are pushing it to villify Armenians</b> and equate to the rank of Nazis. 500,000 Armenians fought for the Soviet Union during the war, over half did not return. There were 4 Armenian Marshals including one Admiral and over 60 generals during the war. Armenian soldiers liberated Auschwitz, stormed the Reichstag and captured Berlin.</p>
<p>Can Turkey ever claim such honors?</p>
<p>Yair Auron is a scholar and its up the job of a scholar to cross reference his resources. I can go back and check his sources but you have yet to present me any evidence of the contrary which nullifies and deteriorates the integrity of your claims. <i><b>I am unbeknownest of the activity or even the existence of Armenian soldiers in Slovenia and elsewhere but since you brought them up, then show me something about them.

<p>Look, I'm tired of putting up with you because you have been all talk and allegations since I met you.

<dd>Did I write Armenians committed crimes? No, I wrote Armenians cooperated in Nazi crimes. Can you deny this? There were 18,000 serving in the Wehrmacht, that in English dictionary is cooperation. And I gave you links, especially the one written in Russian or Armenian seems to be a good source, read it -because I don't know either language- and please share with me the information. I personally would like to know more about the Armenians who fought in Slovenia and Italy. Some may saved some Jews, I praise them but hell, I am sure there were many officers in the Wehrmact who in some way helped the Jews or the Slavs or other people but that is not the case for entire German Army, is it?</dd>

<dd>Let's face it. If Germany declared war on Turkey, they would eventually invade at least a portion of Western Turkey, where nearly all Turkish Jewish population -more than 100,000- was located. And we both know their fate wouldn't be too different than that of Greek Jews. Now, of course Turkey wouldn't want to openly provoke the beast that is Nazi Germany, by officialy accepting non-Turkish citizen Jews fleeing from the SS during WWII. <b>But</b> we all know they turned a blind eye to illegal transport of Jews in to Turkey. I am not saying Turks are saints but this is what happened or would happen if Turkey entered the war so let's be honest about it.

<p>The German Wehrmacht could not be regarded as a perpetrator of Nazi crimes; that dubious honor was bestowed upon by SS units who took an oath to carry out the ideals of Nazism. Nearly all of the Wehrmacht generals and field marshals were devoted to the traditional Prussian tradition dating back to the 19th century and hence, were much more benevolent and committedto fighting a "clean" war. Most of the German soldiers in the Wehrmacht did not even belong to the Nazi party or subscribe to its ideals and were in a sense, doing their "patriotic" duty. Whereas the SS took the crux of the crimes and atrocities on behalf of Nazi Germany. Using your logic, I can now villify all soldiers who took up arms in the Wehrmacht: the Finns, the Ukranians, the Baltic countries, the French, the Austrians, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Poles, the Croats, etc. etc. But that doesn't make sense does it? <b>To have even mildly criticized the Nazis in the occupied territrories would have been suicide.</b></p>
<p>Soviet military commanders had <b>no</b> choice, that includes Armenians, Azeris, Ukranians, Russians and Georgians. What part don't you understand? "You don't want to command? Fine, we'll shoot you first and then we'll pick the next person in line for your job. He doesn't want to do it either? Fine, shoot him and pick the next person in line." Stalin was bad, but in a time where Nazism had vowed to destroy the Slavs at the same time, and was invading the USSR, people forgot about the grievances of communism and united to fight back and destroy the truer evil in Germany. Armenians were described as the most patriotic and devoted republic of the entire USSR by one BBC commentator in 1942.</p>
<p>Yes, I've heard of the Turkish feats in the Korean War but even then that can viewed as Turkey attempting to tout aide from the Western powers and to create an impression for the United Nations. I brought up Turkey's relations to Nazi Germany when you began mentioning so and so many Jews were rescued by a benevolent Turkey. I went onto show that Turkey's ambitions were far more nefarious and this included in siding with Nazi Germany for a possible invasion into the USSR, thus reviving Pan-Turanist ideals.</p>
<p>I've stated it before, I'll look into Auron's source on Hitler's quote and search out for the book itself but asides from that POV problems with this article are non-existant. Hitler's quote refers to the reluctance of accepting the creation of an Armenian battalion; perhaps he may have changed his views later on, perhaps not. And, I'm not going to take the word of some obscure forum and an Armenian created website.</p>
<p><i>How credible would it be to use that kind of information on Wikipedia?</i> I want citations from book, citations from a war journal or something reputable. Joris Versteeg, the historian from Auron's book furthermore cites the details of the 812th from the director of the West German military archives, J. Hoffman in the book <i>Kaukasien 1942/1943 Das Deustche Heer und die Orientvolker der Sovjetunion</i> (Freiburg 1991). Show me some better resources and we'll see how far we can go.

<dd>Still, it doesn't make them murderers but it does make them cooperators. I am not saying villify the Armenian legion here but don't try to picture all 18,000 of them as saints either. It is an insult to the intelligence of people reading it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Marshall Bagramyan, on your user page, doesn't look very uncomfortable of being a Soviet general to me. As much as I know, Armenian relations with the Soviet authority wasn't really that bad as you make it sound. Anyway, Soviets did save the Slavs from a greater evil but my point was, after all they weren't saints either. So in both occasions, Armenians cooperated -or had to cooperate- with Nazis and Soviets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Turkey sent troops to Korea for a reason like every other nation, this is how international politics work, what do you think this is? Stalin's Soviets were the enemy and it was right at Turkey's door, of course they had to make an impression in Korea. Still, soldiers on the battlefield care little about politics and what the Turkish brigade achieved is admirable.</dd>

<dd>Many Jews <b>were</b> saved in Turkey. And I am talking about Jews who already lived in Turkey for centuries. When I see Greeks and Armenians accuse Turkey of not joining WWII, I wonder if they really care about what its consequences would be.

<dd>Back to the article. I think we need a "neutrality and factual accuracy" tag for the page. Fac. acc. for the quote and neutrality for the rest of the article. And I don't consider books more reliable sources than webpages, even books need to cite sources.</dd>

<p>Throughout the war, Turkey walked a tightrope, balancing the needs and expectations of the Nazis against those of the Allies. While Istanbul was a center of spying and intrigue during the war, Turkey took no overt action against the Nazis, and in turn the Nazis never violated Turkey’s borders. In October 1941, Turkey signed an important trade agreement with Germany. In exchange for raw material, especially chromium, Germany would supply Turkey with war materials and other finished goods. Turkey’s chromium was critical for the Nazis as it was their sole source for the vital element in steel making. Albert Speer stated that Turkey’s chromium was so vital to the Nazis that war production would come to a complete stop 10 months after the supply was cut off.</p>

<b>"...Nevertheless there remains the incontestable fact that relations between the Nazis and Daschnaks living in occupied areas were close and active.</b> On 30 december 1941 an Armenian batallion was created by a decision of the Wehrmacht, known as the Armenian 812th Battalion. It was commanded by Dro, and was made up of committed recruits, and a number of Armenians from the prisoners of war taken by the Nazis in their sweep eastwards. Early on the total number was 8000; this number later grew to 20,000. The 812 th Batallion was operational in the Crimea and the North Caucasus. A year later, on 15 December 1942, an Armenian National Council was granted official recognition by Alfred Rosenberg, the German minister of the occupied areas. The Council president was Professor Ardasher Abeghian, its vice-president Abraham Guilkhandanian and it numbered among its members Nzhdeh and Vahan Papazian. From that date until thje end of 1944 it published a weekly journal, Armenian, edited by Viken Shantn (the son of Levon) who also broadcast on Radio Berlin...Hence it was important to prove to the Nazis that the Armenians were Aryans.

<p>General Dro was a Nazi General and had previously massacred innocent Turks in Eastern Anatolia where the Armenians claim a genocide occured, no wonder they want to keep this secret.</p>

<p>Checking page 172 of Joachim Hoffmann book, this is what we find is written:</p>
<p>Bergmann 3 weitere Feldbataillone, insgesamt also 90 Feldverbande geschaffen, die sich ihrer Nationalitat nach in 26 turkestanishe, 15 azerbajdzanische, 13 georgische, 12 armenische, 9 nordkaukasische, 8 krimtatarische und 7 wolgatatarische oder wolgafinnische Feldbataillone gliederten. Diesen 90 Feldbataillonen der fechtenden Truppe mit einem Mannsschaftsbestand von rund 90 000 Mann (davon etwa 3000 Deutschen) sind aber noch das eine Sonderrolle spielende Kalmykische Kavallerie-Korps (maximal 5000 Mann) sowie die Verbande und Einheiten der nichtfechtenden Truppe hinzuzurechnen, die sich im einzelnen kaum ubcrschen lassen. Es handelte sich hierbei um die Stammbataillone von 11 nationalen Legionen in Starke von rund 11 000 Mann, um 5 Arbeits- oder Arbeitsersatzbataillone der Brigade Boller in Starke von 20 000 Mann, um mindestens 10 weitere Ersatz-, Feldzeug-, Nachschub- oder Baubataillone in Starke von annahernd ebenfalls 10000 Mann und uberdies um nicht weniger als 202 Einheiten wie Feldzeug-, Nachschub-, Baupionier-, Eisenbahnbaupionier- und Strassenbaupionierkompanien sowie Tragtierkolonnen (111 turkestanische, 30 georgische, 22 armenise, 21 azerbajdzanische, 15 wolgatatarische und 3 nordkaukasische)[345] sowie um eine nicht identifizierte Anzahl weiterer kleinerer Einheiten oder einzelner Gruppen in deutschen Formationen. Es sei ausdrucklich bemerkt, dass die dieser Studie zugrundegelegte Gesamtzahl von 150 000 bis 170 000 Angehorigen der Volker Turkestans, des Kaukasus, des Wolga-Uralge- bietes und der Krim in militarischen Diensten auf deutscher Seite die unterste Grenze aller Schatzungen bildet, die sich nach denen sachverstandiger Mithandelnlder im allgemeinen auf mindestens 250 000 Mann belaufen[346]. Selbst aber wenn man nur die 90 aus Angehorigen der nichtrussischen Minderheitenvolker geschaffenen Feldverbande sowie das 345 Vgl. Anm. 92; Feldpostubersicht (II); Verzeichnis von Freiwilligen-Verbanden aus dem Osten in der deutschen Wehrmacht (II).</p>

<p>Which basically says that there was 26 Turkistani battalions, 15 Azerbaijani battalions, 13 Georgian battalions, 12 Armenian battalions, 9 Northern Caucasian battalions, 8 Crimerian Tartar battalions and 7 Volga Tartar battalions. This is basically what this source say. But of course for some it is satisfying to autor existing works to give some credence to their fertile imagination.</p>
<p>As for Walker's work, one might read the section regarding World War II and Armenian involvment from the online copy of the book, chapter 9 <a href="http://armenia-survival.50megs.com/Survival_Ch_9.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://armenia-survival.50megs.com/Survival_Ch_9.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> press Ctrl and F, and type The Second World War and you will land on the relevant section. So much of the Armeno-NAZI link.</p>
<p>Of course the rest doesn't worth much answering Serdar fabrications presented in the newsgroups that are here recycled.</p>
<p>The 18,000 Armenians in German army, were mostly prisoners of war, from whom 11,000 were field battalions and 7,000 in supply. The official Dashnak position was AGAINST Germany, and its headquarters in Cairo was clearly pro-British. Beside that, Hitler was not interested to have Armenians and Georgians in his army, because he was not convinced of their royalty. Those that haven't deserted were mostly sent to the Netherlands where most deserted. (See: “German Rule in Russia 1941-1945” by Alexander Dallin)</p>
<p>Those fanatic nationalist Turks who find nothing better than invating Armenian related articles injecting their hate against the Armenians should pay a closer look at what Turkey did in WWII and its sympathy for NAZI Germany. Here is what happened in Turkey during that period. In May 10, 1934, student associations were distributing Swastikas at university levels. Later, German officials in the guise of assistant professors, accompanied their colleagues in the Tukish army, with the purposes of making the promotion of Nazism( Dr. Ayhan Aktar, Varlik Vergisi ve 'Türklestirme' Politikalari. (The Capital Tax and and the politics of turquification), Iletisim Publishers, Istanbul, 2000)</p>
<p>Later an agreement between NAZI Germany and Turkey was made preventing Jewish immigration to Turkey. On December 15, 1941, the ship named “Struma” with 761 Jewish passengers escaping the NAZI invasion arrives in Istanbul and asks for the authorization to cross the Bosphorus. The ship had to wait until February 24, 1942, over a month of negotiations between the allies and Turkey, requesting Turkey to permit the passage, Turkey denied access. They haven't even fed the passengers, who were dying of famine, the Ship had to return, where it was torpedoed by a submarine. One survivor. One day after, people would have expected the prime minister to apologies, but no, the then prime minister Refik Saydam, happy to respect their agreement with Germany declared: “Turkey cannot be the destination of undesirable refugees” While in 1942 NAZI Germany takes the decision to destroy the Jews, on November 11 of the same year, Turkey come up with the Capital tax against the Jews, Armenians and Greeks, and even propositions are made of their deportation, the capital tax was justified with this remark: “Against those who profit from the hospitality offered by this country and become wealthy, while at the same time abrogate their responsibilities at this critical moment, the law will be applied with full force”. Turkey had even plans to join Germany to invade SSR Armenia, when Germany was to take Stalingrad. A report was make regarding the Jews, Armenians and Greeks. For the Greeks, it was written among many other things: “On the 500th anniversary of the conquest of Istanbul by the Ottoman forces, not one Greek should be left in the city.” About the Armenians: “Armenians are not assimilable and those who survive must be encouraged to depart (emigrate).” And for the Jews: “Stop all Jewish immigration, while provoking incidents within the country with the goal of creating a Jewish exodus, keep them away from all government activity, be it financial or economic” (source: Ridvan Akar, Askale Yolculari—Varlik Vergisi ve Çalisma Kamplari (Passengers to Askale—Capitial Tax and forced labour camps), Belge Uluslararasi Yayincilik, Istanbul, 1999) Is this enough? No not enough. In 1948, 40,000 Turkish Jews living in Istanbul have run away in Israel. Embarrassed and exposed, Turkey was the first Muslim state to recognize Israel.</p>
<p>Let now take a closer look at Turkey did more. At the outbreak of the war, Turkey mined 190,000 tons of chromite, 1/5 of the world total output. (See: Turkish Foreign Policy 1943-1945: Small State Diplomacy and Great Power Politics by Edward Weisband) Those were the result of agreements between Germany and Turkey, Turkey becoming the major German supplier, of this essential material for the military. Turkey later signed another contract with Germany to provide 135,000 tones, regardless of the allies pressures to stop. The German minister of armaments and munitions declared that chromium was the element with the shortest supply, and was indispensable to a highly developed armaments industry. Turkey permitted the German armament developments, ignoring the continuous allied requests. As the German Minister for Armaments and Munitions Albert Speer confirmed when he wrote in his memoirs: "Hence the element in shortest supply is chromium. This is especially grave since chromium is indispensable to a highly developed armaments industry. Should supplies from Turkey be cut off, the stockpile of chromium is sufficient only for 5.6 months. The manufacture of planes, tanks, motor vehicles, tank shells, U-boats, and almost the entire gamut of artillery would have to cease from one to three months after this deadline, since by then the reserves in the distributions channels would be used up." He then declared that if it wasn't of Turkish supply: "no more or less than that the war would be over approximately ten months after the loss of the Balkans." (Albert Speer, Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs, translated by Richard and Clara Winston (New York and Toronto, 1970)). In short without Turkeys help, the war would have not continued more than months. I could continue and discuss regarding the “Missing Jews” or the missing gold bars looted by NAZI Germany and transferred to Turkey. Do you want that I document this as well, or IS IT ENOUGH??? Now, spare us and leave good intentioned people contribute to Wikipedia without having to waste their times answering hateful characters that are only here to cause troubles. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:04, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Einstein, who welcomed the Jews that were being expelled and/or murdered wholesale during the Spanish inquisition more than 500 years ago? Who was it that welcomed German Jewish scholars together with their families and gave them residence in prime locations and paid them top salaries well above their Turkish colleagues? Whos diplomats saved the lives of scores of Jews all across Europe? which country was key to the creation of the state of Israel due to its strategic location as a gateway for European Jews and where in the world do you think the Mossad secret service came to being? Oh and before I forget, which country was the first in the world to recognize Israel (well before the US did)? Well it certainly was not Armenia or the Armenians as they were busy helping their christian brothers in the mass slaughter scheme against the Jews. Oh and why are you so quiet about the French Armenian legion?

<dd>You really disgust me, we are mentioning history and now you are again changing the subject and focusing on something else, ie the present. For your information, in Turkey there is freedom of the press far freer than in Europe of even the States. Because a few misguided journalists write antisemitic articles does not mean that the government sponsors them or that the public approve of it! You have uneducated religious freaks in Turkey just like anywhere else in the world although I must confess that its probably much less than in Armenia, and this is the market that these vile journalists target.

<dd>Me disgusting? You must be kidding, the things I wrote were about WWII, and the reports were true about the current situation but they were more than about the few journalists you are talking about. Disgusting is to talk about an Armeno-NAZI collaboration when Alfred Rosenberg supposed cranial research were placing Armenians as Christian Jews and to be sent in concentration camps, which they actually did in the occupied territories, before Dro started kissing NAZI a$ and getting Armenians out from the camps. Had you ever bothered searching about the French resistance and l'Afiche rouge, never heard of Manouchian? Or the Soviet Thank named 'Sassountsi David' bought by the Diaspora and being sent between heavily attacked German fronts? Shall I start quoting what the NAZI had to say about the Armenians? That's actually disgusting, it weren't the Turks who were classified as Aryan by the Germans that had to convince Rosenberg that they weren't Jews and threatned for execution. Armenian gave 300,000 to 500,000 of their males to the Soviet army while Turkey had imposed its special tax against the Jews, Greeks and Armenians and was selling chromium to the Germans which without it, the war would have been over. The only thing your contribution here shows is that you are pathologically troubled by your perverted hate against the Armenians. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:54, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I added that material about Turkey because of your blinded hate against the Armenians and I requested you to visit your own court before ejaculating your BS on this page too. Between 300,000-500,000 Armenians were under the Soviet flag fighting against the NAZI, and it was an Armenian contingent and the only ethnic contingent in the Soviet Union that penetrated Berlin. From the source our alias Steve has forged, there was also more Azeri battalions alongside Tartars who were active, but those weren't 'relocated' for distrust in the Netherland.

The Armenian agression against the Jewish populations in the region is being surfaced, Jewish groups are recieving alot of hard facts and evidence regarding this and its a matter of time before the grisly details of these Armenian secrets are exposed.</dd>

<dd>Yes, very unfortunate. What's also unfortunate is that you still haven't grasped the fact that you can't just copy and paste from websites, such as <a href="http://www.turkla.com/yazar.php?mid=783&amp;yid=4" class="external text" title="http://www.turkla.com/yazar.php?mid=783&amp;yid=4" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.
