<p>This is only a fringe hypothesis that Armenians descended in Balkans. In reality Armenians came to Caucasus from South-East, not from West. Anyway, it happened many thousands years ago, At this time scale, all Indo-European peoples originated in Europe, which does not make them European.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 00:51, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Support:</b>I have support, for this statement.--Hamparzoum 00:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support:</b>I think it's a fair compromise, although it may also be useful to include the fact that Armenia has a European-style of government and belongs to European political organizations. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 14:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support:</b>I agree to the proposed change as it is written, The 3rd paragraph of the Article mentions that Armenian is a member of the Con. of Europe. In the politics section it mentions the type of govt. So I think those areas are covered. Thanks.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaligvla_061d.html" title="User:Caligvla">Caligvla</a> 15:34, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support:</b>I will agree to this, but it should say between Europe and the Middle East, Armenia doesn't have many links with India, Mongolia or China, but a large part of Iran,(which is in the heart of the Middle East) use to be Armenian property and there are so many Armenian-Iranians so it seems unfair to leave out this deep cultural connection. I will agree to the proposal, there is already an article on Armenian-Iranians so if someone has a hunger for more info. it can be found.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Thomasian_b7f3.html" title="User:Craig Thomasian">Craig Thomasian</a> 20:47, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Oppose</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> The proposed change is very ambiguous while the current version is very clear and concise as well as neutral. The transcontinental portion already covers the "crossroads" issue in a much less ambiguous manner.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 15:44, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> While I do not believe that "Armenia is situated at a cultural, historical, and religious intersection and located at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, in the southern Caucasus" is at all incorrect, I still think it should be mentioned that Armenia is often considered part of Europe. I have no problem if the above sentence is added to the article, but I think "Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is considered part of Europe" should still stay. The two statements do not contradict each other, and so there is no need to replace one with the other.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 23:21, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> per above.

<p>Since this appears to be at a deadlock, would any of the "oppose" voters care to suggest an alternate text as a compromise? There seems to be clear feeling that it should be changed, so the quickest way to end this would be to find something that everyone could agree on. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 18:43, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I count 2 (the other two new user votes are debatable) vs 8, and if I were to inform various users of the ongoing vote as caligvla did (he didn't canvass just said there is a vote to selected users) we would have a few dozen extra votes in support. In addition, the existing version is already a compromise.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 18:51, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Debateable" or not, there does appear to be sentiment that there needs to be a changed.

<dd>It doesn't appear to be so at all. Where you got that notion, I couldn't begin to assume. The Oppose header clearly states:<b>Leave this sentence</b> Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is considered part of Europe <b>where it is.</b> When you vote for oppose, you are not voting against the other sentence you are voting against any changes.

<dd>I am aware of this, but the fact is that this poll shows that not everyone is happy with that sentence, thus some sort of change remains the best way to get everyone back on the same page. Since CLEARLY you're not happy with the current proposal, I thought one of the oppose voters might want to suggest something else that the 'support' voters might be able to get on board with. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:49, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have you ever seen a poll conducted here with a unanimous result? Of course the initiator of the problem is not going to vote for opposed nor would the two suspicious new users. So there is one actual user(Augustgrahl), and even he isn't exactly onboard with that suggestion. The only thing that will satisfy caligvla is the removal of this sentence. I can't see how that is ever going to happen therefore I don't see how I could offer a suggestion to satisfy caligula's demands.

<dd>Calm down, and don't make accusations. No, not every poll ends unanimously, but that doesn't mean you should just take an "I'm right, you're wrong" stance and ignore/belittle the opposition. The suggested new wording is what's called a 'compromise'; it's where each side steps down just a little to something that both can live with. I ask again, any 'oppose' voters want to suggest a better phrasing to help end this? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:14, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I know I'm a little late here, but it does seem to me that the whole point about this poll was to come to a compromise. The sentence to be added about the crossroads was carefully crafted in an attempt to be acceptable to both sides of this very polarized issue. It was soundly rejected, however, and it seems to me that there is no compromise that will be acceptable to both sides, since the argument is a black-or-white issue. If Armenia is noted as <i>part</i> of Europe, group A will never be happy. If Armenia is <i>not</i> noted as a part of Europe, group B will never be happy. You can reword sentences till the cows come home, but one of those impressions is going to be left at the end of the day. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 13:45, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the above source:</p>
<p>Only European states can belong to the EU. The question is if Armenia is a European state. Those who say no can say only that its geographical location is in what is often denominated in Europe as “Smaller Asia”.</p>
<p>However, there is a large front of pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>membership in the Council of Europe</li>
<li>clear orientation of its population towards Europe</li>
<li>large consensus with Western European values</li>
<li>Western European civilization elements prevail</li>
<li>membership in many European bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>A restriction to core-Europe is today considered, after all, as quasi-racist.</p>
<p><b>Armenia is also in the evaluations of most geographers a European state, but “at the</b> edge” towards the East, towards Asia. <b>Armenia should not deny this, but positively</b> display this fact towards the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>The head of the EU Delegation for Armenia and Georgia, Torben Holtze, said clearly that “as a matter of principle Armenia is a European country and like other European states it has the right to be a EU member provided it meets necessary standards and criteria”. Also, the European Parliament noted on 12 January 2002 that Armenia (and Georgia) may enter the EU in future; many official documents contain this wording10.</p>

<p>Well, here's how I look at it. Armenia wanted to join the EU, Council of Europe, etc. (who wouldn't? It's a better market than say former soviet republics like Uzbekistan). The U.S. and UK are members of <a href="../../../s/e/a/SEATO_6d57.html" title="SEATO">SEATO</a>, despite not being in South East Asia or considered Asian. The US is also an observer to the Council of Europe, but likewise is not considered European. Just because Armenia wants to be European doesn't make it European, just like the fable about the mouse that wanted to be a lion. Remember: Mother Russia was considered Barbaric and Asiatic, even in its own projected self-identity, until Peter the Great thought his country would be better off Westernizing and imitating France. Similarly, I joined the Royal Society of Geographers (RSG/IBG) in the UK for their pretty magazines, not because I'm a geographer or British...and neither will it make me British or a geographer. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 04:20, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Eupator and CO. have the POV pushing issue, if the Armenian Govt. is perfectly fine with defining Armenia as contained within Asia Minor. See <a href="http://www.gov.am/enversion/links.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gov.am/enversion/links.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gov.am/enversion/links.htm</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.armeniainfo.am/about/?section=people" class="external free" title="http://www.armeniainfo.am/about/?section=people" rel="nofollow">http://www.armeniainfo.am/about/?section=people</a> And yes the 2nd link may well be publically traded but content is still controled by the govt. Armenia is still a developing nation and still in the transition process from an controled economy. So, what is the big stink about?</p>
<ul>
<li>Could it be that Armenia is at conflict with ALL their neighbors.</li>
<li>Could it be that possible membership in the EU would have great economic benefits?</li>
<li>Could the desire to be European, be an intentional backhanded insult to other Asians?</li>
<li>Could it be that the Middle East is not that trendy of a vacation spot and sharing a border with Iran hurts tourism?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to pretend to be Europeans, great! It's a better way of life, and I am sure it will work to your benefit. But it still doesn't put Armenia geographicly in Europe and if you are geoographicaly in Asia Minor you are part of the Asian family of cultures. For generations, part of Nagasaki Japan has a Dutch speaking community with Dutch style homes, and people wear Dutch clothes and eat Dutch foods, They have windmills and if you saw a photo you would swear it was in the Neitherlands. But it's not is it? You are still in Asia!</p>

<dd>My God, where to begin. Armenia is not in conflict with all of its neighbors, cordial relations with Georgia and Iran are vital to the economy of the country. How does sharing a border with Iran hurt tourism? If anything, I'd think the fact that Armenia and Azerbaijan have yet to agree upon peace terms to be the biggest factor affecting tourism to Armenia. The sites you provide neither say that Armenia is entirely in Asia nor that Armenians are Asians. You keep talking about how the notion of Armenians being Europeans insults you, Europeans, and Asians. Could you not consider the idea that your attempts to disown the Armenians as Europeans can be seen as hurtful and racist by them? Saying that we are "pretending" to be Europeans is nothing less than a personal attack on the Armenian editors here, and saying that's it's better to be a European is also racist. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 22:50, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Asian culture?</span></h2>
<p>I keep seeing Nixer speaking of Asian culture; what the heck is "Asian culture"? Asia is not like Europe, Europe is far more smaller and homogenous than Asia. With a few exceptions, Christianity is the main religion in Europe and this has had significant influence in shaping the people and culture. As for <s>Nixer</s> equating "Asia" with "barbaric", LOL. I'd bet that the medieval Arabs and Chinese were more civilized (from our point of view) than e.g. the medieval Danes. In searching for a definition of this "Asian culture", I tried to find what cultural elements Arabs and Chinese have in common. Would Nixer care to enlighten me?--<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETekleni_17fc.html" title="User:Tekleni">Tekleni</a> 09:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. Armenia co-existed long with great kingdoms of Ancient East and interfered with them. Armenian language consists many Persian borrowings, especially related to government and politics. The Bible also consists some ancient legends related to Armenia. Christianity cannot be counted as European influence because when Armenia adopted it there were no country in Europe to confess Christianity. Just the opposite: at that time Christianity could be considered only as Asian influence in Europe.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 11:00, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So Persian loanwords are that which make Armenia Asian.

<dd>Most of these words related to Persian culture and unique Persian and Indian features. In Armenia these words became generic for the language and constitute the major layer of the language, playing the same role as Greek and Latin words in European languages.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 11:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's incorrect Nixer. You need do your research better. The loanwords first of all are not Persian, they are Iranic mostly Parthian and Scythian. Many Russians themselves today claim Scythian therefore Iranian descent! Again, the combined Greco-Roman loanwords wouldn't be much less (for example most religious words in Armenian are of Greek origin such as the word for Church which is yekeghetsi derived form the Greek ekklesin). Also 90% of those Iranic words are only available in Armenian and no other language on earth including any of the surviving Iranian languages. Now, that means absolutely nothing. Magyar is an Asian langauge entirely. So is Maltese. Russian alone has just as many Tatar and other Turkic loanwords. At least all those loanwords in Armenian are of IE origin.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 15:30, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, you correct, it's Iranian, not specifically Persian borrowings (although Parthia is an old name for Persia). Russian language being Slavic in no way related to the Iranian branch other than that both descending from PIE. There are very little Iranian borrowings in Russian. In fact that many Armenian borrowed words have unclear origin. They were borrowed from non-Indo-European languages. Magyar, Komi and Finnish belong to Finno-Ugric family, which cannot be said to be Asian because the majority of speakers live in Europe, but I agree the origin of the language says little about the contemporary culture of the country. What says much more is the borrowings which reflect the cultural impact in historic perspective.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 16:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Parthia and Persia are two very different things, but that's bdesides the point. Russian is closer to Iranian languages than say German or Italian. There aren't many iranic loanwords in Russian but there are many many Turkic loanwords in Russian and very few of those loanwords are a result of the Mongol-Tatar yoke but they are part of Russian ethnogenesis. We are not talking about Finnic, we are talking about Ugric, Ugric languages are completely native to East Asia while Finnic is both antive to Europe and Asia.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 18:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Guys, loan words are totally irrelevant to this discussion. Contact waxes and wanes, influence rises and falls, common identification grows and dies. The vocabulary of modern English is largely French, and while the Normans influenced and changed English culture a great deal, England is not French. English is still a Germanic language (loan words can't change that) but here's the kicker: England isn't German either. England is English. Armenia is Armenian. Is Armenia European? I dunno, but its loan words aren't going to give you the answer. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 14:02, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eupator, why don't you come up with a revised statement, as opposed to rejecting every suggestion that comes up. You wrote this line <i>"Culturally, historically, and politically, Armenia is considered to be part of Europe."</i> You wrote this line so I understand you are very attached to it. It's too bold of a statement and needs to be toned down.

<dd>Come on guys! Armenia is a European country. Geographic definitions are not applicable anymore. Geographically Turkey and Cyprus were once regarded as Asian countries. But now nobody denies their European cultural and political identities. Armenia is even more European (culturally) that Turkey. Forget these old geographic criteria. Nobody cares about them any more. For me Armenia is clearly a European country and there are many events proving that:
<ul>
<li>Armenia is a member of the Country of Europe. EU has defined as European countries and possible future members the members of the Coutry of Europe. So the membership in the Council is the only definition of the European country EU accepts.</li>
<li>Armenia is member of all the athletic European confederations and federations.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>What else can I say? Culturally, Armenia was always regarded as a vital element of the European civilization. Do you accept that Greece is a European country?

<p>I was in a university undergrad lib. today, I ran across the NG world Atlas. There is no mention of Armenia or Armenians having a European culture.</p>
<p>You can add this to the 1000s of other sources that place Armenia exclusively in Asia.</p>
<p>So I took photos of it for all to see!</p>

<dd>It's impossible to read what the atlas actually says about Armenia, so it's completely useless as far as determining what it says about Armenian culture. Somebody could take that picture and claim the text says Armenian culture is European, or South American, or anything. It also lists Cyprus as a country in Asia.

<dd>Hey Caligula. Thanks for the source. I think that reinforces the idea that Armenia <b>geographically</b> is a border nation between Asia and Europe. (For example, <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn" class="external text" title="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn" rel="nofollow">WordNet</a> also includes Armenia as part of "southwestern Asia" and others <a href="http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/am.htm" class="external text" title="http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/am.htm" rel="nofollow">WorldAtlas.com</a> consider it a part of Europe (albeit with a footnote:"In recent years some sources now consider them to be more closely aligned with Europe based on their modern economic and political trends.")) I won't comment anymore on geography, except recognizing the fact that it's on the border of both Europe and Asia, and this is bound to stir a debate.</dd>
<dd>On the issue of culture, however, I think that Armenia has historically been European. For example, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_alphabet.html" title="Armenian alphabet">Armenian alphabet</a> is considered a European script by the Unicode consortium (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch07.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch07.pdf" rel="nofollow">See the Unicode standard</a>). See <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Kingdom_of_Cilicia_ea36.html" title="Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia">Armenian_Kingdom_of_Cilicia</a> as well for Armenia's role during the Crusades). Nevertheless, Armenia has also been at a crossroads, with part of it belonging to "the West" and the other belonging to "the East," so it's natural to find cultural elements from both worlds. In the beginning of Armenian history, the divide was between the Greek Empire and the Persian Empire (Armenia was split in two); in this age, Armenia adopted both Hellenic gods and Zoroastrian gods, often blending the two together to form an Armenian version. Then the Byzantine Empire and Persian Empire. Then Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire (strangely, during this period, the geographically West was the culturally East, while the geographically East was the culturally West). During this time (the 1800s to 1920) there were two distinct Armenian cultural centers: Tblisi, Georgia (Eastern Armenian cultural hub) and Istanbul (the Wester Armenian cultural hub). Clearly, Armenia has been at a crossroads historically. Presently, its alignment is overwhelmingly "West" (European; democracy; Christian) and not "East" (whatever <i>that</i> is... Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism; dictatorship; theocracy). My take: is Armenian culture European? Yes. Does it have Eastern cultural elements? Certainly. Could it be <i>both</i>? Perhaps...

<dd>Armenia IS the lesser Caucasus mountain chain. The population is also Indo-European, speaks Indo-European, is Christian (yes, this DOES matter), looks towards Europe as its sister countries, and was certainly considered part of Europe on just about every map in Soviet times... Armenians consider themselves European for the most part, though they obviously see that Asian influences exist in Armenia. I vote that Armenia is considered a part of Europe for geographic, political and cultural reasons. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 17:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Obviously, there are a number of criteria. Religion is but one of many... Other criteria include language (Indo-European or native European), alphabetic writing system (must be European), bloodline (Armenians emigrated from Europe to Anatolia), culture (Western literature, philosophy, religion, architecture), political ties to Europe (e.g. Council of Europe, NATO, Crusades, kingdoms).</dd>
<dd>Ethiopia fails the language test: Ethiopian languages are Semitic (like Arabic and Hebrew).</dd>
<dd>Ethiopia fails the writing system test: the Ge'ez alphabet is a Semitic alphabet, and not a recognized European alphabet (see the Unicode standard).</dd>
<dd>Ethiopia fails the bloodline test: they are indigenous to Africa (they weren't Europeans who migrated south)</dd>
<dd>Though Ethiopia passes the religion test (they adopted Christianity in the 4th century), failing the language, writing, and bloodline tests eliminates them from being considered European.</dd>
<dd>Armenians pass each of these tests, and are therefore Europeans. Cheers.<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 06:47, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How Armenian alphabet could be European? It is used nowhere in Europe. Ancestors of any Indo-European people such as Tajiks and Indians emigrated from Europe as well. Armenian literature is not Western (or did you meant that Western literature is popular in Armenia?). Armenian architecture never uses Classicism or Barocco styles, native to Europe.

<dd>Nixer&gt; How Armenian alphabet could be European?</dd>
<dd>I think you need to do some basic reading on linguistics, specifically on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_alphabet.html" title="History of the alphabet">history of alphabetic writing systems</a>: "Greek is in turn the source for all the modern scripts of Europe." The Armenian script is derived from Greek, therefore, it is a European script. Also, have a look at the article on the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_alphabet.html" title="Armenian alphabet">Armenian alphabet</a>. If you're still not convinced, see what the Unicode consortium has to say: specifically, read Chapter 7 <i>European Alphabetic Scripts</i> in the Unicode Standard v. 4.0 available <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch07.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch07.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 09:11, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Nixer</b>&gt; "Armenian architecture never uses Classicism or Barocco styles, native to Europe."</dd>
<dd>Again, you need a crash course on Armenian architecture. The city of Ani had dozens of cathedrals (around the year 1000) when Europe proper didn't even have any cathedrals yet (see <a href="http://www.virtualani.org/cathedral/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualani.org/cathedral/index.htm" rel="nofollow">the cathedral of Ani</a> from the year 1000, which still stands in what is today Eastern Turkey)... In fact, an Armenian architect named Trdat <i>built</i> the dome of the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagia_Sophia_1968.html" title="Hagia Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>. <a href="http://www.lib.rpi.edu/ArmArch/index2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.rpi.edu/ArmArch/index2.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> are even more cathedrals (many before 700 AD) before the cathedrals of Europe proper.

They speak Arabic (Semitic language; not European). Their bloodline is mainly Phoenician with a mix of European blood from the Crusades. Lebanon is not in Europe.

<dd>Armenian alphabet is not European also. All the alphabets: Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Arabic, Hebrew and even Mongolian derived from one source: Phoenicean alphabet which is Semitic. Indo-European language group is not specific to Europe and Armenian language is unique in its own family which is nowhere spread in Europe.

<p>seriously guys this is getting ridiculous - <b>it's in the middle, let it go</b> --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanlibbo_dad2.html" title="User:Danlibbo">Danlibbo</a> 07:49, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Khojaly genocide</span></h2>
<p>The article is heavily biased and lacks NPOV. There is no mention of Khojaly genocide took place the night from February 25 to 26, 1992. It is very important for countries to acknowledge the facts and only the facts for historical events.Srhlg</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khojaly_Massacre_2d3e.html" title="Khojaly Massacre">Khojaly Massacre</a> has its own article. If you want to read about it you can go there. There's no reason to include an extremely specific event in a very broad overview of Armenia when the overall impact it had on Armenian history was limited. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 17:40, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Khojaly genocide might be a specific event but it is one point in the big picture of human rights abuses towards azerbaijanis and it is an ongoing process which is spread over many years of armenian history. There are many other "specific events" like Susha, Lachin, Kelbajar, Agdere, Agdam , Fizuli, Cjebrail, Kubatly, Zangelan and Goradiz which are quite important in a country's history and we need to talk about those to draw a neutral general picture of armenian history.Srhlg</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not an article about the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and the rivalry between Armenia and Azerbaijan constitutes about ten out of three thousand years of Armenian history. Saying that the article should focus on negative things that were done by Armenians is simply pushing a POV, however you look at it. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 18:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Srhlg, the war is mentioned. Anything more than that would be silly. I mean even the Azerbaijan article doesn't mention it and for Armenia it's a very insignificant event unlike Azerbaijan. Both main articles mention the war, not every single battle or massacre during the war. It's like saying why doesn't Azerbaijan article link to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maraghar_Massacre_0aed.html" title="Maraghar Massacre">Maraghar Massacre</a>--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 18:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You do not have to get defensive I did not mean to offend anyone, I am just saying negative or not this is a main evet after the independence of armenia, we do have to acknowledge that, thats all. You might not think this is a big part of armenian history and I understand you do not want to give a negative impression of the country but that certainly does not change the fact that in numbers (number of years this events took part or number of people it effected)this is a major event.Srhlg</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a minor event during war overshadowed my many other parts of the war, 90% of the population of Armenia or in the diaspora is unaware of its existence at all. The most famous event was the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Shushi_039b.html" title="Battle of Shushi">Battle of Shushi</a> and even that is not very well known. Bottom line is that other than the fact that a war occured no other information is necessary to be included.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 21:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If there are thousands of <b>defensless civilians</b> murdered anywhere in the world for any reason belonging to any nationality it is <b>not</b> minor. I am talking about human beings I dont care if they are armenian or azerbaijani...they are people. I think everyone should put their differences and egos aside and think about these events in humanitarian perspective Srhlg</p>
<dl>
<dd>There was nothing minor about the Khojaly massacre, it was a terrible war crime. However, the impact of the massacre was minor on Armenian history as a whole. There are only a few lines about the Nagorno-Karabakh war in both the articles for Armenia and Azerbaijan. Mentioning the massacre is giving undue weight to the event in the larger scope of things, and if we're going to mention the crimes committed by Armenians, why not also the terrible things done by Azeris? All of this can be saved for the article on the Nagorno-Karabakh war. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 21:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually you are right about the total impact part. I believe this is because they werent represented well enough in the international area thats why it is our job as objective people to be their voice... only for the sake of equality and everything else our religion teaches us.Srhlg</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think people in general are ignorant about the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and it's sad that such a tragic and devestating conflict which still threatens stability in the region goes relatively unknown. But, as I said, a more specific analysis of the war should be left to the article on the topic. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 22:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me put this into perspective Srhlg. The Armenian Genocide, which completely changed the history of Turkey AND Armenia, continues to cause a freeze in relations, and is a major taboo in Turkey, plus affected all of Anatolia and is not mentioned on the Turkey page, and you think that Khojali (one village) must go on the Armenia page? I mean, I haven't thought about it one way or the other, but I do think I'd like to see you focus your efforts on getting the Armenian Genocide mentioned on the Turkey page, then bring up this possibility. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 17:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
