<p>There's no mention of the pixie dialogue, the other exchange from the hearings that occasionally gets recounted. In connection with a discussion of a deceptive print of a photo that includes Schine, Welch says "...Did you think this came from a pixie?..."</p>
<p>Cohn apparently gets McC to respond: McC asks Welch</p>
<dl>
<dd>Will counsel for my benefit define — I think he might well be an expert on it — what a pixie is?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the public would at the time have not the faintest hint of the fact that Schine and the indispensable Cohn were rumored to be lovers. Cohn may have reasoned they'd just been threatened with exposure; he or McC may have wanted to demonstrate readiness to accuse the <i>other</i> side (in a time when fag-hunting went along with red-hunting) of harboring homosexuals.</p>
<p>Welch replies (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=HPIC%2CHPIC%3A2005-19%2CHPIC%3Aen&amp;q=%22pixie+is+a+close+relative+of+a+fairy%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=HPIC%2CHPIC%3A2005-19%2CHPIC%3Aen&amp;q=%22pixie+is+a+close+relative+of+a+fairy%22" rel="nofollow">G-srch</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I should say, Senator, that a pixie is a close relative of a fairy. Shall I proceed, sir? Have I enlightened you?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Welch may have been picking up the gauntlet, and perhaps making it yet clearer that he's willing to out them if that's what it takes to curb McC.</p>
<p>And (tho i may have the events in the wrong order), perhaps by irrelevantly going after the young lawyer <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Fisher_%28lawyer%29_3233.html" title="Fred Fisher (lawyer)">Fred Fisher (lawyer)</a>, McCarthy had deprived himself of the ability to complain convincingly of unfairness, if and when Welch did the outing.</p>
<p>I am of course not suggesting <i>my</i> impressions as the basis for a mention in the article, but i urge research (the search above is one starting point) on the significance that others put on this otherwise seemingly quizzical exchange.<br />

<dd>I think the whole exchange was a joke, in an otherwise dull hearing; and it's typical of the humor of that day, when it was impolite to speak openly of homosexuality, especially in a public hearing. And it is in keeping with McCarthy's sense of humor &amp; personality. And reading more into it than is there probably isn't worth the effort. While McCarthy has been trashed as making a gay joke, etc., the context <i>clearly</i> reads, that it was Welch that initiated the joke ("...Did you think this came from a pixie?...") that bares no context to what was being discussed at the time. Welch was simply losing patience in a dull hearing, and offered what today would be considered an inappropriate and politcally incorrect metaphor. McCarthy picked up on it and carried the joke a little farther. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 19:23, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Boredom on the part of a thoroly professional star-level atty is not very plausible to me. But my point is not about what was really intended, which i doubt can be established to a degree that would justify our treating it as fact. Rather, we might report what has been made of it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For example, one page i found has made of it a story that
<ol>
<li>there was a private understanding reached before the hearings opened, that the committee wouldn't go after the little pinko and Welch wouldn't out the little fag,</li>
<li>Welch broke the agreement when he said "pixie", and</li>
<li>that was why McCarthy made the commie-in-your-own-office statement.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>To the extent that it's regarded as accurate, IMO it says a lot about McCarthy's temper and/or poor judgement, and suggests Welch was a master of psychological manipulation. I can't rule out that theory having originated with the site i saw that states it as fact, but if it has currency, that currency should be be described.<br />

<dd>Yah but remember Welch made the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic.html" title="Homophobic">homophobic</a> statement first. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 21:40, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>_ _ Precisely (tho contrary to the timing in my first speculation on this talk page). I'm not sure what unstated theory the external page that posits the prior understanding was espousing. The idea <i>i</i> am suggesting (and only research beyond the scope of my interests can determine whether it is an influential idea and thus whether it belongs in the article) is that Welch intentionally used the word "pixie" to violate the "understanding", bcz Welch hoped to goad Cohen and/or McCarthy into something that would convince the public that McCarthy had not a scrap of decency left. In fact, if there was a prior understanding, Welch may have proposed it <i>with the intention</i> of later having the option to break it and goad them into some such ill-considered step. (I find it easy to imagine this of a patrician fixer like Welch, a guy who is demonstrably in the position to for instance give a kid the start that turns you into a <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_D._St._Clair_7ac1.html" title="James D. St. Clair">James D. St. Clair</a> who eventually gets called upon to go to the Supreme Court to make the last ditch effort to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_v._Nixon_84c5.html" title="United States v. Nixon">save the President of the United States</a>. To Welch, McCarthy should appear to be a bumbling Wisconsin red-neck brute who's terrorizing his betters and crushing a few of them, simply because no one has been brave and clever enough to sneak up and use a feather-weight weapon on the giant's most vulnerable point. Welch should be looking for just such a way to finesse a paper tiger such as McCarthy.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ (And maybe it's time to make this explicit: i'm not looking for quick support for an edit of the article. If i noticed anyone adding "my theory" to the article, <i>i'd</i> revert unless they present better evidence than i know of, that "my" theory is an influential idea abt the topic.)<br />

<dd>I think there's something to what your saying; in retrospect the patrician Welch did somewhat goad McCarthy into speaking up which provided some comic relief in a dull hearing. But as to a prior understanding, given cultural norms of the time, etc., do you suppose negotiators really were that politically correct to agree on hiding specualtion and dirt like prior to an open hearing? <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 19:40, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I do not believe the terms "fairy" and "pixie" had any bearing whatsoever on Roy Cohn. I am totally unconvinced that a seasoned litigator like Welch, during a televised hearing, when homosexuality was very much in the closet, would make such references in public, especially when it could mean his own career. Watch the hearing footage for yourself--Welch was merely exasperated with the answers he was getting while trying to determine the source of a cropped photograph, which he contended changed the context of the image, using terms that commonly described imaginary things. Think about it: what words would you use to describe an imaginary source of something? Not many choices besides "fairy" or "pixie," even today. Perhaps the two words can be stretched to being applied to homosexuality, and thus many have erroneously extrapolated that Welch was making some veiled reference to Cohn being gay. It is absurd to assume there was any sort of gentleman's agreement between anyone, particularly between opposing parties, to keep the topic of Cohn's sexual preferences (if they were even known at the time) secret. I don't think it was ever Welch's intention to go in that direction and far too much attention has been brought to Welch's choice of words to get at the origin of a photograph.

<dd>I agree as well--that Welch used "fairy" and "pixie" as words to describe an imaginary source, and was not targeting Cohn. Welch delivered them in a sharply sarcastic tone to make his point, which was the cropped photo came from an actual person, not a fairy, and he wanted to know who that person was so it could be determined who had the photo cropped. Welch was a lawyer, this was a legal proceeding, and they were in a discovery process; he was not trying to "out" Cohn! Funny that so many people assumed he was choosing those words to bash Cohn. 71.107.57.131 19:08, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the commentary track to the DVD release of <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_Order_44af.html" title="Point of Order">Point of Order</a>, director Emile de Antonio gives his opinion that Welch was definitely making a "dig" at McCarthy's and Cohn's rumored homosexuality with this exchange. It was his belief that the audience laughed because the recognized the joke as a reference to homosexuality. Emile de Antonio (who was no fan of McCarthy's) calls this a "vicious, absolutely a McCarthy-ite tactic" on Welch's part. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 01:07, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very interesting, although Welch still is the only one who knew his intent and I don't believe he ever spoke on the subject. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the room and couldn't poll people around me on what they thought Welch meant at that moment. From an objective POV, without the gay overtones, the exchange was inherently humorous, and I think Welch's sarcasm was intended to draw a laugh. While it's true some people may have taken it to mean a gay "dig," I would guess most just laughed because it was simply funny. Since you seem to have the DVD, are you able to confirm there is an exclamation point in the opening titles? 71.107.57.131 18:24, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no "!" in the opening title of the DVD version. However, it's possible that this was a recent change specifically for the DVD release; there's something suspiciously "clean-looking" about the title sequence. In some materials on the disk, such as the trailer, the title is shown with a "!". My impression is that de Antonio (or someone) has decided that the title is better without the "!", but there's still a lot of stuff around that includes it. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 18:49, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i think a short entry on this topic is appropriate, but I don't think much can be made of Schine being posted to Alaska. One fact that was mentioned in the hearings is that 90% of all servicemen were posted overseas. So it seems fairly unremarkable that Schine was posted to Alaska. Seems like a reasonable middle-ground between the trenches of Korea and the beaches of Hawaii. &#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since the hearings originated from Schine's alleged preferential treatment and the hearings at times very much revolved around Schine, it's a natural progression to ask, "What happened to Schine in the Army following the hearings?" I think this section nicely addresses that question, particularly when McCarthy had voiced wishes to have Schine sent far away. While Alaska may have been better than Korea, it must have been one of the harshest environments possible, short of frontline combat, and is interesting to note, even if nothing can be proved conclusively. It's not as though this entire entry is especially long, in fact, I think more needs to added on the Army-McCarthy Hearings topic, which captivated the whole country for weeks and has been discussed and hashed over ever since. If we keep slicing off things we decide might not be relevant, there won't be anything left! 71.107.57.131 21:54, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
