<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Men_%28series%29_cd01.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The series was based on a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a> between four main sets of plastic <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_men.html" title="Army men">army men</a>: the Green, the Tan, the Blue, and the Grey. Two other factions, red and orange, had brief appearances, but neither played a large part in the story. Two factions, the Galactic army and the Alien army, were introduced in <i>Army Men: Toys in Space</i>.</p>
<p>The series was started with <i>Army Men</i> (<a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_compatible_ec70.html" title="PC compatible">PC</a>) in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, then the sequel <i>Army Men 2</i> (PC) was released in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. Around that time the first <a href="../../../c/o/n/Console_game.html" title="Console game">console game</a>, <i>Army Men 3D</i>, was released for the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_PlayStation_43a7.html" title="Sony PlayStation">Sony PlayStation</a>. In these early games, before Army men had established itself, it is probably easy to say the biggest draw card for Army Men was that it was a -sophisticated version of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Interactive_cb76.html" title="Virgin Interactive">Virgin Interactive</a>'s <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon_Fodder_4b8e.html" title="Cannon Fodder">Cannon Fodder</a>. In Army Men, especially early in the series, realistic physics and combat situations were off-set by soldiers melting into puddles, or snapping like broken plastic as well as an apparent sense of humour on behalf of the development team.</p>
<p>The series continued with <i><a href="../../../t/o/y/Army_Men%7E_Toys_in_Space_bcf2.html" title="Army Men: Toys in Space">Army Men: Toys in Space</a></i> (PC), before branching out with the <i>World War</i> series for both PC and console (mainly the PlayStation 1 &amp; 2). At around the same time period <i>Sarge's Heroes</i> was released, a sequel was released -a year later.</p>
<p>Other variations and spin-offs of the series were also released. They included the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> themed games <i>Air Tactics</i>, <i>Air Attack</i> (<i>1</i> &amp; <i>2</i>), <i>Air Combat</i>, &amp; <i>Air Combat: The Elite Missions</i>. They also included the <i>World War</i> series. There is also a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contra_series.html" title="Contra series">Contra</a>-inspired game called <i>Green Rogue</i>.</p>
<p>The only spin-off of the series, was <i><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portal_Runner_045a.html" title="Portal Runner">Portal Runner</a></i>. A spin-off of <i>Sarge's Heroes 2</i>, it was released just a year-and-a-half after the original game.</p>

<p>The series featured many characters, of whom four were the protagonist of a game: Sarge, Captain William Blade, Vikki Grimm, and Omega Soldier. Many of the characters in the games were caricatures of well-known archetypes.</p>

<p><i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Green_Army_f38b.html" title="The Green Army">Green</a></b></i> - The 'good guys' in the series - representing a US style army. In the first few games the political balance was unstable and they were fighting against the Tan and Grey - Blue were sometimes allies and sometimes enemies, depending who paid the highest price. This changes in <i>Army Men: World War</i> when the Green ally with the Blue (French-esque) against the Tan Menace (German-esque in this game). In "Army Men: Sarge's Heroes", the Blue are Tan spies, and the Gray are allied with the Green.</p>
<p><i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tan_Army_cc7e.html" title="The Tan Army">Tan</a></b></i> - The main enemy in the series and represent various real-life dictatorships (<a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazis</a>, etc.). They start the current war with Green when they invade in three main areas of the Green nation (the Desert, Alpine, and Bayou regions). At the beginning of the game they have a partial alliance with the Blue Information network, though this alliance becomes fluid through the series. According to Sarge <i>It isn't that they're evil, kid, just because they want to conquer everyone else and steal everything they have. I think they just don't know any better. It's a tragic flaw in their character, that's beyond their control. That's why they're better off being dead.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Grey</b></i> - Again, to quote Sarge. <i>The Grays are a bunch of hit-and run <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrillas</a></i> (with a rather <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">caucasian</a> ethnicity); <i>when I was little, my dad used to scare me at night by telling me stories about the Grays. You don't have to like the Grays, but you gotta respect them.</i>. The first encounter with Grey forces is in the original PC game: Sarge is attempting to outflank the Tan and finds himself on the Grey-Tan border. Whilst both are at war with Green, they are also at war with each other and Sarge finds himself in a three-way shooting match. Shortly after Sarge discovers the Grey have formed an alliance with Tan in order to generate some rather bizarre <i>weapons of mass-destruction</i> (seen in later games).</p>
<p><i><b>Blue</b></i> - <i>The Blue on the other hand are stinkin' cowards. They make better sneaks than they do soldiers. They're more likely to ambush you then shoot you in open combat. The Tans put up with the Blues because they can use them as couriers, saboteurs, and spies</i> - Sarge. The Blue army (often with a French influence) seem to have very fluid alliances, though you rarely see them on the front lines the Blue army's real talents lie in espionage, sabotage and other such covert missions. The Blue army is often depicted as working toward anything they see beneficial, often this means paying for their services.</p>
<p><i><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Nation_%28Army_Men%29_29c8.html" title="Red Nation (Army Men)">Red</a></b></i> - Appear in Multiplayer in "Sarge's War," and you rescue one in Dr. Madd's castle, and in Sarge's Heroes in the cut-scene where you rescue Shrap from the spider machine. Originally they would probably represent a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> style army.</p>
<p><i><b>Orange</b></i> - Mentioned only in <i>Sarge's Heroes 2</i>, when General Plastro is bragging about conquering all the nations in the plastic world. Not related to the Orange aliens.</p>
<p><i><b>The Aliens</b></i> - The main enemy in <i>Toys in Space</i>. They appear only in <i><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portal_Runner_045a.html" title="Portal Runner">Portal Runner</a></i>, and <i>Toys in Space</i>. As Tina Tomorrow secures an alliance with Sarge, the aliens form an alliance with the Tan Empire and join in the quest for domination by providing a whole new armada of nasty things to make Sarge's life miserable.</p>
<p><i><b>The Galactic Army</b></i> - Allies of the Green Army in <i>Toys in Space</i>. They only appear in this game. Lead by Tina Tomorrow, the Galactic Army is light blue in colour and are provided as a spoof of early Sci-Fi serials. The main army is female with support troopers (eg Mini-Gunners) being male. The Galactic Army provides a number of unique weapons to assist Sarge through <i>Toys in Space</i> - the stun guns especially adding a new dimension to the game's strategy. The Galactic army, while of the same color, are not related to the blue army men.</p>
<p><i><b>The Cult</b></i> - Only appears in <i>Army Men 2</i>, in two levels (one of which seems to be an adaptation of <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_Now_a6a5.html" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now</a></i>). It is composed of Blue, Green, Tan, and Gray soldiers, as well as <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bomber.html" title="Suicide bomber">suicide bombers</a>. Lead by an <a href="../../../a/w/o/AWOL_9edc.html" title="AWOL">AWOL</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> from the Green Army. Sarge was originally tasked to locate the Colonel, but learning of the Colonel's insanity he is ordered to destroy the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> and his cult of followers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Men_%28series%29_cd01.html" title="Edit section: The Series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Series</span></h2>
<p><b>Army Men</b> (1998)- Game Boy Color/Windows/PlayStation/Game Boy Advance - The first game in the series. At the beginning of this game Sarge is tasked with a simple recon mission on the front line - locate some documents. At the end of this game, Sarge finds a strange portal that leads to the next dimension and the next game. Regarded as a classic by fans, this is one of the few games to actually display Sarge and his squad as merely pawns in a bigger battle. Two features that make this game almost unique in the series are its story telling (Black-White spoof of old-time war-time news reels) and the fact that it often depicts a front line or other fighting that doesn't involve the main characters.</p>
<p><b>Army Men II</b> (1999)- Game Boy Color/Windows - Starts where the last game ended. This is perhaps the most varied game in the series, with enemies ranging from suicide bombers to zombies to cult members to cockroaches. There is also a wide range of battlefields, such as Kitchen's in the "Real World", and tank factories in the "Plastic World". This game also introduced the concept of 'Portals'. Which were connections between the "Plastic World" (The Army Men world), and the "Real World" (our world). Gameplay is very similar, yet different to the first: AM2 allows much better control of individual troopers from Sarge's squad and for setting up tactical positions. Fans of the series almost invariably nominate this game as the best for Multiplay experience, both for its control style and the additional options available.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../t/o/y/Army_Men%7E_Toys_in_Space_bcf2.html" title="Army Men: Toys in Space">Army Men: Toys in Space</a></b> (1999)- Windows - This game adds two new armies, the Space Troops, and the Aliens. This game continues is exclusive, in that all the missions take place in the "Real World", or in outer space. This game introduced a science fiction element not present in any other Army Men games. This game reorganised the control of squads and introduced new weapons and units such as Alien laser troopers, Tina's Freeze Ray and her Mini-gun troopers as well as a small selection of new vehicles (though fans voted these vehicles as poorly planned and mostly a waste of space).</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Air Attack</b> (1999)- PlayStation/Windows</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Air Tactics</b> (1999)- Windows - This time the player character was Captain Blade of the Green Airborne Cavalry. This was a top-down flight sim that placed the player in a number of different helicopters. Captain Blade's main responsibilities is to act as aerial support for Sarge and his men. This game introduced abilities such as lifting heavy objects and transporting them to other locations, landing on the ground to load/unload soldiers and unique airborne combat not seen in other games. This game contained a number of mini games such as playing air-hockey versus a Tan helicopter, as well as a number of static games - these usually involved shooting your guns at the pieces to direct them. This game was also known as "Air Attack" (or Air Combat on the Nintendo 64).</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Sarge's Heroes</b> (1999)- Dreamcast/Nintendo 64/PlayStation/Windows - A console-to-PC port of the PlayStation game of the same name. Fans of the PC series were typically disappointed by the Console <i>spin-off's</i> such as Sarge's Heroes. This was mainly due to the fact that they tried to make Sarge's Heroes appeal to a much younger audience (some say this killed what was essentially a more mature game), but also due to the fact that they gave <i>Sarge</i> a name and made him a character - whereas he had previously been depicted simply as a <i>regular Joe</i> out there doing his job and they felt this also drastically reduced the realism of this series.</p>
<p><b>Army Men: World War</b> (2000)- PlayStation/Windows - This game focuses solely on combat in the "Plastic World", with most of the missions being based on World War Two. The PC game starts with a D-Day style landing after which you then progress through a number of missions that all have themes from World-War 2 lore such as <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Bridge_Too_Far_%281977_film%29_02fb.html" title="A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)">A Bridge Too Far</a></i>. The final showdown of this game is when you lead your squad of men into the Tan Capitol (eg the push to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>) and destroy the Tan Capitol Building. This is the only game where vehicles can be controlled by enemy forces. In one mission alone it is possible (with due patience) to steal an entire Tan Tank Squadron. The fans place this game as a close second to AM2 for multiplayer mode, with the ability to steal enemy tanks listed as a big plus for multiplayer. One interesting twist to this game was that it is the only PC game in the series to not have a <i>Sarge</i> character in any fashion at all - they obviously heard the fans wanted their old <i>faceless</i> hero back and decided to leave him out rather than to contradict Sarge's Heroes - this game also had probably the most in depth system for organising large numbers of men under your command and depicted a war-like situation with even more background effects and <i>sideline</i> fighting than the original Army Men had. This game was also known as "Operation Meltdown" outside the US and Canada.</p>
<p><b>Army Men: World War-Land, Sea and Air</b> (November 2000) - PlayStation - The sequel to <i>Army Men: World War</i></p>
<p><b>Army Men: Air Combat</b> (2000)- Game Boy Color/Nintendo 64 - Like <i>Air Tactics</i> it focused on a Green Helicopter pilot. This console game based game was a lot more arcade like in its gameplay than the PC Air Tactics was, there was no landing or acting as an Air Cavalry transport - focus instead was on the combat role of the helicopter pilot.</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Operation Green</b> (2001)- Game Boy Advance - Another <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_Advance_f612.html" title="Game Boy Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> game. This time, the player takes control of a generic Green soldier in a 3-D isometric world. This title is set almost exclusively in the Plastic World, &amp; there are a few vehicles available to drive. However, vehicles have a limited amount of fuel.</p>
<p><b>Army Men: World War-Final Front</b> (2001)- PlayStation - The last of the <i>World War</i> titles.</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Lock'N'Load</b> (2001)- PlayStation</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Green Rogue</b> (April 2001) - PlayStation/PlayStation 2 - Set during Sarge's Heroes, the Green Army creates a super soldier composed of DNA spliced from all the members of Bravo Company. Plastro tries to capture the supersoldier, but the crash-landing on the helicopter transporting it inadvertently awakens Omega Soldier, causing a one-man rampage against Tan forces.</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2</b> (April 2001) - Game Boy Color/Nintendo 64/PlayStation/PlayStation 2 - The sequel to <i>Sarge's Heroes</i>. It introduced several new characters, and the concept of "Plastrification".</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Air Attack 2</b> (2001/2003)- PlayStation 2- Sequel to Army Men: Air Attack. In this game, Captain William Blade is sent to take down the evil Tan pilot Baron von Beige (a parody of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Baron_4572.html" title="Red Baron">Red Baron</a>). This game features some new choppers such as the <a href="../../../v/-/2/V-22_Osprey_7c07.html" title="V-22 Osprey">V-22 Osprey</a>. It was also released on the GameCuba as "Army Men: Air Combat-The Elite Missions"</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portal_Runner_045a.html" title="Portal Runner">Portal Runner</a></b> (2001)- PlayStation 2/Game Boy Color - This spin-off of <i>Sarge's Heroes</i> focused on Vikki Grimm and Bridgette Bleu. In this game, Bridgette Bleu, trapped Viki Grimm in another dimension through the use of a portal. In this game, Viki and a lion named Leo, must find the right portal, to take them back to the "Plastic World".</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../r/t/s/Army_Men%7E_RTS_cb2f.html" title="Army Men: RTS">Army Men: RTS</a>-Real Time Strategy</b> (2002)- GameCube/PlayStation 2/Windows - This game was one of the last <i>AM</i> titles released before The 3DO Company filed for bankruptcy. Like <i>Toys in Space</i> it took place only in the "Real World", although the focus was on the characters from <i>Sarge's Heroes</i>. The main difference between this game is the fact that it is a 3D RTS. This game provided a brand new perspective on the Army Men game - base building, and a fully poseable 3D camera. Whilst this may have provided a neat step-between for introducing younger players to the RTS genre, it didn't really offer much to experienced RTS players. PC Army Men fans were then disappointed by the fact that some units didn't behave like their Army Men or AM2 counter parts (eg Mortar Men would only attack buildings - removing one of their best uses). However this game did also provide some unique elements such as collecting the melted plastic after a battle and recycling it to create a fresh supply of troops. It is regarded by many as the best game in the series.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../s/a/r/Army_Men%7E_Sarge%27s_War_43a8.html" title="Army Men: Sarge's War">Army Men: Sarge's War</a></b> (2004)- GameCube/PlayStation 2/Xbox/Windows - All green and tan except for Sarge and Malice's tan are killed. Sarge Engages In a one man war against Malice. This game was started by The 3DO Company who released preliminary trailers on their community message boards, but after the bankruptcy this game was later released by <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crave_Entertainment_b938.html" title="Crave Entertainment">Crave Entertainment</a> who had bought the rights and all the work-in-progress software.</p>
<p><b>Army Men: Major Malfunction</b> (2006)- Xbox/PlayStation 2 - Major Malfunction is the latest game in the series, released by <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Star_Software_8232.html" title="Global Star Software">Global Star Software</a> In the game you take control of a soldier named Private Anderson and fight against an enemy named Major Malfunction (A nod to the movie <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Metal_Jacket_35d6.html" title="Full Metal Jacket">Full Metal Jacket</a>, where the drill sergeant asks one of the characters "What is your Major Malfunction). The game received largely negative reviews <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/armymenmajormalfunction/review.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/armymenmajormalfunction/review.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p><b>Army Men: World War-Team Assault</b> (2001)- PlayStation - Comes Before Final Front. The plastic war is now at a standstill. The Green and Tan armies are locked in a stalemate. Seeking to gain the advantage in this conflict, the Tan have succeeded in developing long-range weapons that will ultimately spell doom for the Green forces. Intelligence agents had determined that these long-range missiles exist, but they had not discovered their location. Until Now... A Green intelligence agent had a lead on the possible whereabouts of these harbingers of doom. Unfortunately, the agent was discovered before he was able to reveal the location of the missiles base. In an attempt to rescue this agent and ultimately destroy the hidden base, a crack team of Green commandos has been assembled. Each member of this team is a specialist in a variety of fields ranging from heavy weaponry to linguistics. The fate of the free world depends on the successful completion of this mission.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plastrification, according to Dr. Madd in <i>Sarge's Heroes 2</i>, is a condition that occurs when a soldier from the "Plastic World" spends too much time in the "Real World". The soldier afflicted with this condition becomes paralyzed and grows a plastic base, ending up like the green army men commonly sold at toystores. Also in SH2, Bridgette Bleu has developed a serum that reverses the effects of plastrification, which she uses to revive General Plastro. She has also developed one that causes plastrification. The reversal serum is stored in cola cans which you have to destroy in many levels to progress.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One may see references to several famous movies scattered through out the games. One of these is a level in <i>Army Men 2</i>. In that level you must find a patrol boat on a jungle island, and hunt down an insane Green special forces colonel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vikki Grimm and Bridgette Bleu are the only characters not to have a <i>coloured</i> skin (Green, Blue etc.) instead they are modeled with flesh tones more like <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> dolls and simply wear clothing that matches the colour of their allegiance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are armies other than the Tan, Green, Blue, and Grey. In <i>Sarge's Heroes 2</i> <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">General</a> Plastro make a reference to the 'Orange Army', and later in the game, Sarge rescues a red soldier from Tan soldiers, in Dr. Madd's castle. In <i>Sarge's War</i>, in the multiplayer mode, you can play as a 'Red Soldier'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most of the titles of the levels are named after war movies. For example, in Sarge's War there's Das Drain, an obvious reference to <i><a href="../../../d/a/s/Das_Boot_bae4.html" title="Das Boot">Das Boot</a></i>. They are also named after video games like "Toast Recon" obviously referring to "<a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_Recon_581a.html" title="Ghost Recon">Ghost Recon</a>"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Army Men:RTS - features a number of breaches of chain of command during its cutscenes: Most notably the opening cutscene where Sarge is walking along and is saluted by a private (the rank of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> is a non-saluting rank). This is followed by Sarge entering the command tent where <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Grimm and an lieutenant Calt are waiting - Grimm salutes first, Sarge returns the salute and Grimm is also the last one to drop his hand. This should actually occur in the reverse order, and as it stands it suggests that Sarge outranks his <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commanding_Officer_6386.html" title="Commanding Officer">Commanding Officer</a>. However, this may also suggest Sarge has received a medal the equivalent of the real world <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Army Men series is never set in a specific date in any of the games. In a few of the games, modern weapons such as the M16-A2 can be seen, but in other episodes the vehicles and weapons seen are from the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_2_2e7c.html" title="World War 2">World War 2</a>-era. Famous battles such as the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> landing are imitated, and the style of fonts and film quality mimic the style of the 1940s.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For many of the games, the technology seems to be from the Vietnam War era; with weapons &amp; vehicles such as the M-16 A1 rifle, M-48 Patton tank, M-79 grenade launcher, etc... However, modern choppers such as the AH-64 Apache can be obtained in Army Men: Air Combat.</li>

<p><i>Army Men: RTS</i> was the last <i>Army Men</i> game to be released.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, 3DO filed for chapter eleven, bankruptcy. The major franchises were auctioned off, and <i>Army Men</i> was purchased by <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crave_Entertainment_b938.html" title="Crave Entertainment">Crave Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Crave Entertainment published <i>Sarge's War</i>. The PS2 and Xbox versions were completed by some members of the original <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_3DO_Company_0ed2.html" title="The 3DO Company">3DO</a> Sarge's War development team. Then Crave released Army Men: Major Malfunction for Xbox (as well as a limited region PS2 release), and planned a DS version, which apparently was not released, because no screenshots or reviews can be found, nor does it show up on the Nintendo website. The Xbox/PS2 version is currently the latest game in the series. Future installments are possible, but unlikely, due to the poor critical and commercial performance of Sarge's War and Major Malfunction. However, the Army Men series, 40+ game releases strong as of Major Malfunction, as well as Army Men: Platoon Command for Gamecube (cancelled), has rarely been critically acclaimed, yet still seems to sell enough to generate revenues for publishers, even outliving its original developer.</p>
