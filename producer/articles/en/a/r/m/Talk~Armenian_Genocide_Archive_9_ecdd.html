<dl>
<dd>That question is often asked by personal attackers. Clearly, whether a personal attack is truthful is a matter of opinion. And also clear, just considering the grammar of the previous phrase, is that whether something is a personal attack is independent of whether it is truthful. Notably, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_attacks.html" title="Personal attacks">Personal attacks</a> makes no mention of truth or falsity. What it <i>does</i> say is "Don't do it There is no excuse for personal attacks on other contributors.

<dd>For your information Fadix, the term "genocide" has been created after the Holocaust and United Nations resolution about this is solely for the Holocaust and ethnic cleasing events in the future. You can check out the tons of United Nations resolutions that Armenian Issue is NOT regarded as a genocide by the UN AND this kind of issues are not addressed retrospectively, therefore making it impossible to call Armenian issue a "genocide." If Armenian issue were called "genocide" then sure more than half a million killings of Turkish and Sephardic Jews of Ottoman Empire WILL be regarded as the Genocide of Turks and Jews by Armenians. By the way as Shimon Peres and thousands of historians have been stating for the last few decades, Armenians DO NOT have the right to compare their sufferings to that of the Jews. Nothing similar to the Holocaust occurred and hopefully it won't... --David</dd>

<p>As a side note, an article on Non-Armenian casualties during the Armenian Genocide would probably not fall under the definition of a POV fork. Providing the page did not duplicate information here and was restricted in scope. As far as I'm aware the main Turkish argument is that "lots of people not just Armenians died" so a page explaining that would probably be good.

<dd>Unencyclopedic proposition. It is like starting an entry about 'Non-Jewish casulties during the Holocaust' etc. The reason why the Armenian genocide has it own casulties entry is because the position of an Armenian genocide exist and is more than a fringe. An encyclopedic entry would be 'Ottoman casulties during and after WWI' or something such. Besides, 'during the Armenian Genocide' does not make sense because not much or if any revisionists have placed any 'alone' figure for the period when most Armenians have died. As professor Daniel Panzac an autority in Ottoman history writes, most Muslims died after the period most Armenians have died and that for this reason both casulties are not related. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this is your reasoning then the appropriate articles in relation to the Armenian Genocide would concern the Greeks of Anatolia and the Assyrians of Anatolia who were both subject to very similar genocidal policies and actions directed by the CUP/Young Turks. In fact the actions against the Greeks (of the Aegean coastal regions) began in earnest as early as 1913 and were akin to a Kristnacht against the Greeks that lasted for over a year. These massacres and forced expulsions were a prelude to the Armenian Genocide where the CUP was testing the waters as it were to see if their actions would provoke a response from the West. Then beginning in 1916 as the peak of the Armenian Genocide was winding down renewed actions were begun by the CUP against the Greeks - this time concentrating on the Greeks of the Black Sea (Pontos) region and against Assyrians who primarily resided to the south of Anatolia proper. Like the Armenians these groups experienced horrible massacres and expulsions at the hands of the Ottoman Turks and like the Armenians these communities were decimated and no longer exist today. There has been no such genocide against Anatolian Turks to warrent a collalary article BTW. Unless of course we place such in the fantasy and fiction section. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 08:14, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Would you consider it sufficient if Turks present a story of 500,000 (and in some cases I've seen 3 million etc) Muslims/Turks supposedly killed by Armenians during this period - where there are absolutly zero eyewitness reports for such things? Where the only "evidence" is the unsupported/uncorraborated claims of the Turks themselves? Where the only academics who adhere to such views are ones who are Turkish and/or in the employ of the Turkish government (in terms of grants and stipends etc)? Because this is what you will have. The record of this period is well known. There was no Turkish genocide during this period no more then the Germans can claim such (and blame the Jews) for thie deaths in WWII.

<dd>Again, I would have to see what was written and the references it had before I could decide whether it was fair or not. From what I understood of FrancisTyer's proposition, it wouldn't be an article about any Turkish genocide, but rather an article discussing the many Muslim/Turk deaths. If such an article were written, I would approach it with an open mind before deciding if I thought it was objective and neutral. That's all I'm trying to say. But since no such article exists yet, and I wouldn't be the one writing it anyway, there's really nothing more I can say.Shelby28 00:09, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What would be the point of such an article? Why is such an article needed outside of a generic article concerning casulaties of nations involved in WWI? (or just as some factoid in an article concerning WWI in general) What relevance is this to the Armenian Genocide? Are there articles concerning British or German or Austrian casulaties of WWI? Is there an article concentrating on Christian deaths during WWI? I totally fail to see the interest or purpose of such an article (unless somehow it be supporting the perpetuation of Turkish denilaist propoganda). Does the fact that Turks/Muslims died during WWI have any bearing on the factuality of the Armenian Genocide? Does the fact that (huge numbers of) Germans died during WWII have any relevance to the factualness of what is known and accepted concerning the Holocaust?

<dd>At the risk of repeating myself for the third time, I would have to see the article before I decided whether it served a purpose or not. Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn't. It would depend on how it related to the main article, the sources used, how well it was written, etc. I'm just not ready to immediately dismiss FrancisTyer's proposition before even seeing how someone would write it. I simply prefer to keep an open mind, so perhaps we can just agree to disagree. But right now, there is no such article and I don't personally plan on writing one - so I don't feel I can comment further on the purpose, point, or objectivity of an article that does not exist.Shelby28 13:20, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In general? Well, you only contributed to this article, mostly in its talk page, I don't see how you can draw a generality over your participation. Also, it event became an approach you took? When and where you took such an approach. The decision on creating articles depend on the subject, and either or not it is encyclopedic. The only notable figure who separated losses of Ottoman Muslims is Justin McCarthy, and he is considered the Rassinier of the Armenian genocide. Besides, separating losses as Christian and Muslim deaths is discriminatory, the only reason the Armenian genocide has its casulty pages is because there are various notable books about the issue of Armenian losses. While Ottoman casulties of WWI and after, is encyclopedic, there is no reason to exclude other groups in creating articles. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 01:01, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think an Ottoman Muslim casualties during WW1 is actually a good proposition for an article.

<dd>You are proposing a thesis, creating articles under the justification of the subject being overloocked is not encyclopedic, it is the notability that makes of a subject encyclopedic, by far per population there has been more Christian casulties than Muslim in Anatolia, and the only notable researcher that say else is McCarthy, Irving is notable, but notability for an encyclopedic article doesn't end on a persons notability but the notability of a subject too.

<dd>Again - the linkage with this issue with the Armenian genocide is nil and I don't understand why it is even being discussed here. Likewise how are casulties of Ottoman Muslims who were expelled from the Balkans have anything to do with either Armenians or WWI? This event did not occur during WWI. And Ottoman Muslim casualties from the "occupation in wake of [the] Treaty of Sevres"? Are you kidding me? Treaty of Sevres was never put into effect? And occupation of what by whom? What does this additional fiction have to do with the Armenian Genocide? - except as I have been contending and as is obvious - as a diversion from the Ottoman Turkish culpability in the Armenian Genocide - which is what this article we are allegedly discussing here is about. I suggest that those who are interested in the mortality of Mermaids and Turkish indegestion as a result of eating too much taffy while boating on the Bosphorus in sprintime be discussed on some other talk page.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 01:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You see, I have left this article for near a week I think and thought that things will settle down, but this is not what happened, visit any pages, or the Hereros, or the Khmer Rouge regime, the Holocaust, the Ukrainian famine, the Hereros genocide etc., etc., etc... and tell me if there is at least one other equivalent article that has given as much space or if any members there had as much patience as I had here.</p>
<p>No, no 'Turkish Casualties in Eastern Anatolia in 1915,' and the reason is obvious, very obvious. You can attempt to build a parallel page to this, it won't make it much encyclopedic. Why? Here some reasons why, the Ottoman records were dumping the entire Muslim population, no separation between the groups, in the East, the Kurds, the Circassians, etc... were the majority Muslim population, besides maybe Erzerum or some other places, whos majority Muslim population were Turk I think. Many Muslims died during WWI(millions of Germans died in World War II), but most of Muslim casulties happened starting with mid 1916, when already over 800,000 Armenians have died. Besides, there has been a war between the Arabs and Turks, between Kurdish revolutionaries and Turks, there has been Envers megalomany sending his army on the front to freeze in Winter, or the starving army in the East, and this as a result of the ministry of the war evacuation of the Armenians which deprived the East and amputating the food supply.</p>
<p>So, you see why you can't have a Turkish casulties page? Because Turks were not separated from other Muslims. Also, there was very few Turkish civilian casulties in 1915, Muslim casulties jumped upward in 1916, during which time the Eastern zones Armenian population was gone.</p>
<p>Does the Turkish government section not give enought space for your second proposition? Don't forget that when I have proposed this, there wasn't much space for the Turkish position, you don't expect to have nearly half of the spaces in the main article and another full for the Turkish position, do you? <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:28, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are they not as important as the Jewish so their deaths are called a genocide instead of an holocaust? Or is the word holocaust used only for what happened to the Jews between 1939 - 1945?</p>

<dd>The term holocaust means burning by fire, it was indeed used during the period to discribe what happened, but the first time it was used to refer to Armenian sufferings was the burning of the Armenian town in Adana, in which thousands of Armenians were consumed by fire in April 1909. The term Holocaust with a capital 'H' is used to refer to NAZI war crimes in Europe (in the ghettos and the concentration camps), mostly Jews, it also refers to other groups like the Gypsies, it is not much of the appropriation of the term than rather the capitalisation. Also, the term genocide isen't to be taken more lightly than holocaust, while what happened in Adana in 1909 was a holocaust, the restrictive term for genocide would somehow excludes to its qualification as such(genocide). Holocaust with a capital 'H' doesn't mean exactly the same thing as 'h,' the capitalisation refers to a specific event and this doesn't mean in anyway that Armenian deaths are less important. Bernard Lewis before his departement was founded by Turkish institutions himself has used the words 'Armenian Holocaust' to refer to those deaths and this term is still used quite frequently but not as frequently as the most used term 'Armenian Genocide' which is official and should remain as such. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 01:15, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Massacres were but one tactic used in perpetuating the Armenian Genocide.

<p>It may be necessary to go a bit deeper into the concept of genocide in general in order to justify the title to a more inclusive group. The <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> article refers to the definition in the 1946 Convention and the quote by Raphael Lemkin that also appears in <i>Genocide</i> (1981) by Leo Kuper. --<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedders_7ad5.html" title="User:Cedders">Cedders</a> 11:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for bringing this issue. Both articles have been created by a Turkish nationalist, not an Armenian involved there. The first ones content has nothing to do with the title and I still don't see the relevency of its existence, it is just a dumping of some unrelated stuff.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are right about the second point, I did already in the past suggested creating an article about the concept of genocide and the Armenian cases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lemkin’s(who coied the word genocide) first studies concerning war “crimes against humanity” as brought from H. Yahreas’ work, The World’s Most Horrible Crime, Colliers, vol. 127, 3 March 1951 was the Armenian cases. The author retraces Lemkin’s interest concerning war crimes and exterminationand reports that one of first conversation that Lemkin had about the subject was at Lvov University in 1920, when he engaged in a discussion concerning the extermination of the Armenians with his Russian Law professor. Rabbi Steven L. Jacobs, Temple B’nai Shalom, Huntsville, Alabama, and Martin Methodist College, Tennessee, who has researched Raphael Lemkin’s papers, has classed some of those concerning the Armenians and compiled them by the name "Lemkin and the Armenian Genocide." Lemkin also referred to the Armenian case, in his work “Le Crime de Génocide” as an example of extermination. Quoting here from its English version: “history has provided us with other examples of the destruction of entire nations, and ethnic and religious groups. There are, for example,… and more recently, the massacre of the Armenians.” (By Raphael Lemkin, American Scholar, Volume 15, no. 2 [April 1946]).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lemkin started his works concerning “Crimes against Humanity,” a term first used in this context during WWI when discribing the Armenian massacres. Lemkin claims that this was one of the major reasons he decided to become a lawyer. He also gave as reference the Armenian case in his work “Genocide” whose aim was to describe what a genocide is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The German word often used for the word genocide, "Völkermord" has been used to describe what happened to the Armenians, even before the introduction of the more official word, “genocide.” An example of the usage of the word "Völkermord" could be found in the work of S. Zurlinden, "Der Weltkrieg, Vol. II (Zürich: Art. Institut Orell Füssli, 1918), p.649.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This German word had not the legal aspect that the word genocide does. Lemkin at that time was pressed to release his studies and the legal aspect of such crimes, in order to have legal bases for the prosecution of people responsible of such crimes(NAZI crimes). For Lemkin the criminals responsible for the Armenian genocide were released, and for him the reason was because there were laws binding countries concerning killers and criminals, but there were no laws for criminals that in the name of a state and from its laws commit genocide, as he wrote, “Why is the killing of a million a lesser crime than the killing of a single individual?” And it is exactly why, in 1944, Lemkin was preparing the legal aspect, and knew that once the war was over these NAZI criminals would be released in the same way that the criminals responsible for the Armenian genocide were released if there were no new laws that could permit judgement of the criminals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lemkin primarily invented the term in order to have a legal basis to condemn people accused of such crimes, in order that such criminals do not escape justice like they had done in the case of the Malta prisoners, and also to name such crime that until then there was no word to describe. For Lemkin the Armenian case was the archetype, the case that was used as jurisprudence, in order to come up with legal bases to condemn NAZI criminals, and be sure that the same mistake that happened in the post-World War I period were not to happen in the post-World War II period or ever again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Months before the introduction of this word in 1948 by the UN, on the date of May 28, 1948, on which date the United Nations war crimes commission released a report concerning the mass slaughter of the Armenians in World War I, followed by, the same year, on the date of December 9, 1948, the publication of the Genocide Convention by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights. Obviously, the United Nations report released on May 28 was part of their study that permitted them to release, months later, what would become their official definition of the word genocide. Later in 1973, a reference in one of the United States papers concerning the Armenian genocide resulted on the part of Turkey to pressure the United Nations to withdraw the case of the Armenian genocide from the list. Due to the intensification of these pressures, the case of the Armenian genocide was redrawn in 1978, until another extensive study was to be conducted, thanks to Turkey the ressources and researchs in what had to become the official UN report in genocide ended up to be a failure. Turkey killed the UN official report on genocide and Jurisprudences just because of one cases it could not permit. I will be created in Summer an article about the UN report of the 70s on genocide and how Turkey killed it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here, a quote from Lemkins unofficial biography</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1915 the Germans occupied the city of W. and the entire area. I used this time to read more history, to study and to watch whether national, religious, or racial groups are being destroyed. The truth came out only after the war. In Turkey, more than 1,200,000 Armenians were put to death for no other reason than they were Christians ... <b>This is nothing but personal opinion</b>After the end of the war, some 150 Turkish war criminals were arrested and interned by the British Government on the island of Malta.<b>And what happened in Malta? - the British had failed to prove the guilt of the accused at Malta, and your reference still calls them a criminal, that's bias certainly</b> The Armenians sent a delegation to the peace conference in Versailles. They were demanding justice. Then one day, the delegation read in the newspapers that all Turkish war criminals were released. I was shocked. A nation was killed and the guilty persons were set free. Why is a man punished when he kills another man? Why is the killing of a million a lesser crime than the killing of a single individual?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I identified myself more and more with the sufferings of the victims, whose numbers grew, as I continued my study of history. I understood that the function of memory is not only to register past events, but to stimulate human conscience. Soon contemporary examples of genocide followed, such as the slaughter of the Armenians in 1915. It became clear to me that the diversity of nations, religious groups and races is essential to civilization because every one of those groups has a mission to fulfill and a contribution to make in terms of culture.... I decided to become a lawyer and work for the outlawing of Genocide and for its prevention through the cooperation of nations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A bold plan was formulated in my mind. This consisted [of] obtaining the ratification by Turkey [of the proposed UN Convention on Genocide Ed.] among the first twenty founding nations. This would be an atonement for [the] genocide of the Armenians. But how could this be achieved? ... The Turks are proud of their republican form of government and of progressive concepts, which helped them in replacing the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The genocide convention must be put within the framework of social and international progress. I knew however that in this conversation both sides will have to avoid speaking about one thing, although it would be constantly in their minds: the Armenians."</dd>

<dd>Does anyone check these references? I found this article from Oxford Journals, "Turkish Military Tribunal’s Prosecution of the Authors of the Armenian Genocide: Four Major Court-Martial Series, Genocide Study Project,Spring 1997" Paper itself says they never saw the actual documents quoting from the paper "the actual transcripts still are not available to scholars" and it continues "relying upon other sources". This paper is about trial proceedings. If you don't have access to proceedings what is the basis for this theory? How can you refer to something as a proof which itself couldn't refer to any actual document? You're not allowed to post stuff that starts with 'it is believed that...' but people actually refer to some papers that has claims based on 'it is believed that's.</dd>

<dd>This paper actually say from where it has been taken, let quote: <i>The juridical proceedings and findings of the Turkish Military Tribunal as recorded in Takvimi Vekâyi, the official gazette of the Ottoman government, whose supplements (ilâve) served as the judicial journal of the Tribunnal, form the basis of this article. The "Key," or main, Indicment and the "Key Verdict," as well as other subsidiary indicments and verdicts were based on primarily official and authenticated documents (a practice followed later at Nuremberg as well). As far as is known, outside Turkey only the Jerusalem Armenian Patriarchate Archive and the Nubar Library in Paris own the originals of these "supplements" issues. The official published transcripts of the debates in the Ottoman Parliament's Lower House (Meclisi Mebusan) and Upper House (Meclisi Ayan) in November and December 1918 have also been utilized. The Turkish daily press has been consulted for some of the details of testimony given by defendants and witnesses in pre-trial interrogations and various sittings of the court.</i></dd>

<dd><i>The auxiliary sources reinforce the findings of the Military Tribunal. ...</i> (pp. 31-32) Not to mention that the paper contains 7 pages of footnotes, which is well source considering that it is only a paper.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is true that the original transcripts of the tribunal are not available, and it would be naive to expect that the Turkish government will make them available, including to Turkish historians close to the government, but they have been published in the Takvimi Vekâyi as stated in the article. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:25, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fadix Maybe Turkish sources are naive. Because <b>they are actually available at Directorate General of State Archives of the Prime Ministry National Archives. You can even reach digitized documents from after 1900 using State Archives website. You can see hard copies on site.</b></dd>
<dd>You don't even need that much of a literature survey. If you Google it you can find current and previous prime ministers' invitations to Armenian scholars to examine archives and discuss the issues. But Armenian side (Kocharian and Balakian) everytime comes up with 'there's no discussion, you'll accept it approach'. Recently Radik Matrosian and Dennis Papazian were invited to a Symposium (December 15 2005) but they decided not to discuss the matters. A lot of people on Wikipedia defend the Armenian thesis, can anybody tell me why everybody avoids discussions or try to stop Turkish point of view from being heard? If that's as ridiculous as you think, let other people see it for themselves without your interferance. Why Armenian scholars and experts refrain from discussing it and miss such a great chance of proving the other side wrong? Why do people refer to opposing idea as 'in denial'? Don't you know that Turks also call this a tragedy and wish it never happened? There are many interesting facts that are often used for support arguments. Especially the Hitler quote. Source of this quote is a newspaper article in Times on November 24, 1945, London not Nuremberg Tribunal. Nobody denies that this quote was never in Nuremberg Tribunal. They just forget to mention it. Everyone also skips the the fact that his talk was about invasion of Poland not the Holocaust. After all this embellishment (by the newspaper) and failing to mention what the talk was about, this speech is used to justify the link between Hitler's stance and Armenian Genocide issue.</dd>

<dd>We are here to write an encyclopedic article, and personally I have no time to waste on what both sides recycle from nationalist articles as you do, I limit myself on peer reviewed materials. An example of such nationalistic trash, is your claim of the Turkish government 'invitation.' This has been recycled again and again. But little is said about the actual letter of Kocharian as answer, which was acceptation but with a condition of relations between both republics. Turkey still has a closed border with Armenia, the losses are estimated in the tens of millions per year because of that blockage, yet Turkey while denies any relation with Armenia request such investigation. It is like Israel accepting Iran's offer of investigating the Holocaust. They didn't accepted it and for a reason, Iran doesn't have any relations with Israel and still maintains a xenophobic attitude, in such conditions there is no country in the world that will accept. Second of all, it is true that Armenian intellectuals don't participate in such discussions, because they are not discussions but monologues in which both parties discuss and neither are there to come up with a solution but rather sell their products. The Turkish government request for investigation and themselves have proposed it, was not to discuss but to 'prove' that the genocide did not happen, they have shown no inclination to change their position but 'prove it'... so many questions the value of such discussions and here not only Armenian scholars have refused such invitations for those reasons.</dd>

Just recently Hilmar Kaiser the German historian who was finally given back access to Ottoman recirds claims to have uncovered two archival records very similar to two of the Andonians.

<dd>Fadix let's talk about your peer reviewed stuff. I'll start with making some statements that no Armenian will disagree. <b>First let's talk about The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915–1916 by Bryce and Toynbee (1915). Quoting from gomidas.org "In 1916 the British Parliament published a "Blue Book" that identified the events of 1915–16 as a systematic effort to exterminate the Armenian people. The Blue Book has been one of the most solid and influential sources on the Armenian Genocide." This book is one of the most referenced in your peer-reviewed articles. Ara Sarafian also has many publications that rely on historical records "United States Official Documents on the Armenian Genocide (Archival Collections on the Armenian Genocide)" of 5 volumes. Another major source of Armenian allegations come from Aram Andonian</b> whose work is called forgery by many authors, to name one Erich Feigl in "The Myth of Terror."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You are simply making this up, the Blue Book is not one of the most referenced in peer-reviewed articles, for the simple reason that peer-reviewed articles most of the time are new interpretations or new studies, while the Blue Book stend by itself and has done its time. How many paper can you cite in which the Blue Book is one of the most referenced. And no, there is no much author that call the Blue Book as forgery, and that you haven't found better than Feigl to make your point is an evidences of that. Feigl wrote that book adviced by those close to the Turkish ambassy after that his close friend a Turkish ambassador was killed by ASALA terrorists. His book was written before the uncensured version with the identification of the reporters has been published. Feigl shut the Blue Book without knowing such a thing as the key of names of the authors every existed in British records. Edgar Hilsenrath in his book: Das Marchen vom letzten Gedanken. Munich and Zurich: R. Piper, 1989 covers Feigl book as something that is so misleading that it is worthless. Also, the British government just recently confirmed the autenticity of the Blue Book, Toybee one of its author wrote decades after the book was written a confirmation of its autenticity and in his autobiography repeated its conclusions and discribing the event by using the word genocide.</dd>

<p>Had you actually read the archive of this talk page, maybe you would see this has bee covered and being a pure fabrication.</p>
<p>The Malta Tribunal that never existed. The revisionists often fabricate a Malta tribunal that actually never took place.</p>
<p>Actually, there was only one Turkish searcher that really adventured in this subject. He published various works (Turkish and English(mostly the translation and reedition of the Turkish versions) about this topic, and it is Bilal N. Simsir. I will just quote the last words from his work: “The Deportees of Malta and the Armenian Question.”</p>
<p>“As a result, all detainees at Malta were released and repatriated without being brought before a Tribunal.”</p>
<p>Even he admit there was not Malta tribunal.</p>
<p>Denialists of the Armenian genocide often claim that a “Malta tribunal” was conducted by the British, and after investigations and prosecutions, the prisoners were released because of lack of “proof.” But according to historical records there never was any Malta tribunal; such lies are meant to fool the innocent reader into believing that the extermination of the Ottoman Armenians never occurred and in the same time to divert the attention from a real tribunal which concluded that, in reality, the Armenians were victims of extermination. In fact, the Turkish military tribunal brought evidence from Ottoman high officials that the Armenians were victim of a premeditated plan to annihilate them. The apologists of the genocide claim that the tribunal in question was set by the Allies and therefore not credible. Such denialists don’t realise that such a claim would just as well discredit the Nuremberg Tribunal that brought NAZI war criminals to be judged; because the Nuremberg Tribunal was conducted by the Allies, while the military tribunal was a Turkish tribunal, so, if a "Turkish" tribunal was controlled by the "invaders," so was the Nuremberg. And if, in fact, the documents presented during the Turkish tribunal were forged, one wonders why the Turkish government until today forbids access to them. If they are forged???, why the fear of making them public?</p>
<p>Additionally, what denialists fail to mention is that many of the prisoners of Malta were handed to the British officials after being convicted as guilty by the Turkish military tribunal; in fact, there was supposed to be two tribunals, the first one being a Turkish one to judge and send to Malta those being charged, and after the end of the same tribunal to provide to the British officials the documents that allowed them to charge the criminals sent to Malta.</p>
<p>The claim that Malta prisoners were taken without any selections is groundless when reviewing the files attached to each prisoner. One example here is the one of Mustafa Abdul Halik Bey.</p>
<p>Mustafa Abdul Halik Bey Malta No. 2800 Interned 7.6.20</p>
<p>Appointments:</p>
<p>“Vali of Bitlis, March 1914 to September 1915. Under Secretary of State, Ministry of the Interior. Vali of Aleppo October 1915 to April 1917 Brother in law of Talaat.</p>
<p>Lists:</p>
<p>His name appears on Lists VI and VII ( List VII is the F.O. List).</p>
<p>Arrests:</p>
<p>A. He was arrested by the Turkish Government on 9 March, 1919, not upon our suggestion. The charge was murder. On the Turkish prison list of 7 February, 1920, he is stated to have been released on bail; date not provided (probably some time between 20.9.19 and 7.2.20).</p>
<p>B. He was again arrested by the British Military Authorities on or about the 14 May, 1920.</p>
<p>Petitions: None to date, 25.2.21</p>
<p>Accusations:</p>
<p>5027/A/20. Through Mr. Ryan on 19th September 1919. Mustafa Abdul Halik, Vali of Bitlis, took part in the councils held at Erzurum to decide on the deportations and massacres of Armenians. These councils were presided over by Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, delegate of the Central C.U.P. (one of the Principal Eight); other members were Tashin Bey (a deportee), Vali of Erzurum; Muammer (a deportee), Vali of Sivas; and Djevdet (a deportee), Vali of Van.</p>
<p>5030/B/10. On September 26, 1919, Mrs. Sophie Varjabedian, a Bitlis refugee then at Haidar Pasha, c./o. Rev. B. Bedrossian, Bible House, Constantinople, writes accusing Mustafa Abdul Halik, Vali of Bitlis, of having carried away under his personal superintendence the safe from the American Mission in Bitlis. The safe contained her money and jewellery. Miss Chane, now at Erivan, reported this to Mrs. Varjabedian. She asks for the restoration of her property and gives a list.</p>
<p>Assistant High Commissioner approved the suggestion of making inquires at the United States Embassy but there is no record as to whether any action was taken.</p>
<p>5031/A/6. Name merely appears on a Bureau d'Information Armenien list of 30. 12.18, as the Vali of Aleppo, in connection with Marash massacres.</p>
<p>5035/C/178. On June 7th, 1919, Mrs. Ahisag Ahet Ahlahadian writes, through the A.C.R.N.E (American Committee, Relief in the Near East), saying that she is a Protestant Syrian of Bitlis and that all her relatives had been massacred in 1915 in Bitlis in spite of the fact that she had paid the Vali, Mustafa Abdul Halik, to the extent of LT 541 gold.</p>
<p>5036/48. A. Account by Sympat Kerkoyan of crimes committed by Mustafa Abdul Halik at Bitlis in 1915. Starving prisoners; massacring 200 to 300 at a time outside the town; ravishing and massacring the women; extorting and looting of Armenian property. The stench from putrefying bodies was so bad that Buheddin, Director of Health, Bitlis, received orders to have the bodies incinerated. Buheddin was in Aleppo in 1918. B. Also murder of Djerdjis Kerkoyan, brother of Sympat after Mustafa Abdul Halik had extorted his fortune on promising to spare his life. C. Mustafa Abdul Halik replaced Bekir Sami Bey (the "good" Vali, now a prominent Nationalist) at Aleppo on 4.10.15. There he gave orders for the deportation and killing of Sympat Kerkoyan. Thanks to Hadji Yehia Galib Bey, the defterdar (now the defterdar of Kastambol), Sympat reached Mossul alive. The above per Mr. Rizzo on 16.10.19.</p>
<p>5030/A/21. Statement by Sympat Kerkoyan, merchant of Bitlis dated 19.5.20. Bitlis May 1915 atrocities. Massacre of Kerkoyan's family; wife and three children; three brothers and their families. Kerkoyan's deportation to Mossul by the Vali of Aleppo; Mustafa Abdul Halik.</p>
<p>…”</p>
<p>This prisoner (Abdul Halik Bey) was not arrested without reason; from British archival records it is evident that Abdul Halik was present at the Council held in Erzurum to put in application the extermination measures. From the same British archival records, Cevdet the governor of Van, Tashin, Muammer, and Dr. Sakir were also present during that Council. The group was even called “all the very worst of criminals.” (Source: Report of September 19, 1919, Andrew Ryan, BFO 371/6501, pg 4, folder 540/40)</p>
<p>The British had even selected some of the prisoners that should, under no circumstances, be released, and about the four governors that planned and executed the eradication of the Armenians in Eastern Ottoman, after documenting their guilt they concluded, “whom we propose to retain to the last they are gravely implicated in the crimes of massacre.” (Source: BFO 371/6504, folders 136, 146. As well, BFO 371/6504/E10023)</p>
<p>But later the War Office implored Foreign Secretary Curzon to release the group in order to exchange them with the two British prisoners that the Kemalists took, Rawlinson and Campell.(Source: BFO 371/6504, E10411) By doing such Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) refused to honour the Exchange Agreement of March 16, 1921 that was excluding in the exchanges several Ittihadists that had a key role in the Armenian genocide. (Source: FO 371/6500/E3375 (folio 284/15)) In fact the new Foreign Minister Youssouf Kemal asked for the “all for all” exchange. (Source: FO 371/6509(folio 47)) But the British had still tried to impose the agreement and the promises given by Mustafa Kemal himself, more particularly regarding about 20 of the most criminals among them. First, Cevdet the governor of Van with another (they and some others were called “the most notorious members of the group”) escaped (source: FO 371/5091/E16080 (folio 85)); upon finding out about the escape the British Foreign Office responded that the two prisoners “have broken parole.” On September 6, 1921, 16 other Ittihadists excluded from the exchange as well were able to escape. Angry, the Foreign Office remarked, “how little Turkish sense of honor can be relied on.” (Source: FO 3071/6509/E10662 (folio 159))</p>
<p>The Turkish sociologist and publicist Yalman, who had secret discussions with many of the Ittihadists, has been himself detained at Malta and has stated that the anti-Armenian measures reflected a "policy of general extermination" to remove "the danger" to Turkey of "a dense Armenian population in the Eastern Provinces." (Source: A. E. Yalman, Turkey in the World War (New Haven, 1930), 220.</p>
<p>The British plan to send to justice more criminals was becoming more problematic by the end of September, 1919, when Sultan Damad Ferid's Cabinet was being dissolved slowly in the profit of the Kemalism. On November 17, 1919, the new High Commissioner Admiral de Robeck, told Curzon that</p>
<p>“…the present Turkish Government...[is] so dependent on the toleration of the organisers of the [Kemalist] National Movement that I feel it would be futile to ask for the arrest of any Turk accused of offences against Christians, even though he may be living openly in Constantinople...I do not consider it politically advisable to deport [to Malta] any more prisoners.”</p>
<p>(Source: BFO 371/4174/15672 1 (folios 523-24))</p>
<p>And later also noted:</p>
<p>“…the question of retribution for the deportations and massacres will be an element of venomous trouble in the life of each of the countries concerned.”</p>
<p>(Source: BFO 371/4174/136069 (folio 470))</p>
<p>During the 20’s, Lamb, the political-legal officer of the British High Commission at Istanbul, understanding the non-seriousness in the judging of the criminals detained in Malta, warned his superiors:</p>
<p>“Unless there is whole-hearted co-operation and will to act among the Allies, the trials will fall to the ground and the direct and indirect massacres of about one million Christians will get off unscathed.”</p>
<p>(Source: FO 371/6500/, W. 2178, appendix A( folio 385-118, 386-119), Aug. 11, 1920.)</p>
<p>One must not ignore that in addition to the fact that the prisoners were released because they were exchanged with British prisoners, as well the fact that it was advised to release them because the imperial government favored good relations with the Kemalists. Another major reason was responsible of the release of the prisoners, a reason that apologists have tried to keep under the carpet. On March 10, 1921, Ankara's Foreign Minister Bekir Sami assured the British that the prisoners being released would be judged in a court. Later officially on June 11, 1921, the Ankara government informed the British that when the Malta prisoners will be released in exchange of British prisoners:</p>
<p>“…those accused of crimes would be put on impartial trial at Ankara in the same way as German prisoners were being tried in Germany.”</p>
<p>(Source: FO 371/6499/E3110, p. 190; see also FO 371/5049/E6376, folio 187; A. Yalman, Turkey in My Time ( Norman, OK, 1956), 106.)</p>
<p>The British at the end had no reason to keep the prisoners anymore. By releasing them they scored many points. Firstly, the British prisoners would be released in exchange. Secondly they would not have to deal with what they viewed as “venomous trouble.” Thirdly, in the eyes of the Kemalists they would gain some respect which as a result would open the roads of economic exchanges. Lastly, why keep those prisoners and go through the trouble of judging them, when the Kemalists promised that those prisoners would be judged in Ankara?</p>
<p>It is true that many Ittihadist high ranked were judged by judicial proceedings in Izmir and Ankara. Among them were Halis Turgut who had escaped the prosecutions of the Turkish military tribunal previously, Ahmed Shükrü, Ismail Canbolat (the right hand of Talaat), Dr. Nazim, Yenibahçeli Nail, and Filibeli Hilmi (Dr. Shakir’s right hand). Some of the killed/condemned to death were brigands and military officials and soldiers used by the Ittihadists. One of those, Yahya Kaptan, was killed in July 1922 by unknown assassins. The rumour was that he had threatened Turkish officials with releasing state secrets if they were to carry investigations on him (he had a major role on the drowning into the sea of thousands of women and children). Topal Osman was killed by a military unit trying to capture him in March 1923. Halit (Deli) was killed in the Turkish parliament on February 9, 1925.</p>
<p>Even after those trials, the honesty of the Kemalist government could still be questioned, since many influential figures in the Young Turk government as well as pan-Turkists and Turanists were later introduced in the Kemalist administration. The Young Turk ex-minister of finances, Djavid Bey, was the nearest collaborator of Bekir Sami during the London Conferences. Yunus Nadi Bey, who was as well in the Turkish delegation in London was deputy of Smyrna; he was the leader of the “Yeni Gün” that was the principal Kemalist organ. Doctor Ziya Nur, considered by some the father of the neo-Turkism, was the private advisor of Youssouf Kemal (he himself found a place in the Kemalist administration), the then-minister of foreign affairs. Ahmed Nessimi Bey, the minister of foreign affairs under Talaat’s government, had leading roles in the administration. Sami Bey was placed at the head of the postal and telegraphic services at Ankara. Furthermore many pan-Turkists like Youssouf Aktchoura, Aghaoghlou Ahmed, Husseinzade Ali, Ziya Gökalp, Köprülüzade Fuat, Mehmet Emin, Hamdullah Suphi, Ali Haidar, Halide Edip, Celal Nuri, Falih Rifki, and Yacub Kadri, among others, were introduced in the Kemalist administration.</p>
<p>The two district governors that had a leading role in the genocide, Kemal and Nusret who were executed by the Kemalist government, were considered as “national martyrs” their families received large sums of money. Nusret got a region, a school, and a street in Urfa in his name; in Bogazliyan, Kemal was honoured with the erection of his statue in the public square. Ankara’s government also allocated pensions for the families of those executed by Armenian “avengers,” such as the families of Talaat and Dr. Behaeddin Shakir.</p>
<p>Now, back to Malta, Simsir in his work about Malta, with the aim of supporting his claim that the prisoners were released because there was no evidence, has referred to Curzon, but what Simsir ignores in his work is that Curzon later calls this decision a "great mistake," and he even admits that the rationale had been to support the release of the prisoners.</p>
<p>“The less we say about these people [the Turks detained at Malta] the better...I had to explain why we released the Turkish deportees from Malta skating over thin ice as quickly as I could. There would have been a row I think...The staunch belief among members [of Parliament is] that one British prisoner is worth a shipload of Turks, and so the exchange was excused.”</p>
<p>British Foreign Office Archives, FO 371/7882/E4425, folio 182</p>
<p>Curzon’s claims that they were released because there was no evidence, from his own admission, were just a reason among many to justify the decision (release of the prisoners), when in fact there was no justification whatsoever.</p>
<p>The claim that there was no evidence in US archives falls short when referring to the British ambassador in Washington, D.C., on June 1, 1921, when he declared,</p>
<p>“The U.S. archives contain a large number of documents on Armenian deportations and massacres.”</p>
<p>FO 371/6503/E6311, folio 34</p>
<p>There never was any prosecution, pre-trial investigation, or interrogatory. So how is anyone to claim that any tribunal “proved” them not guilty, when there was no Malta tribunal in the first place? The Turkish military tribunal on the other hand had charged many prisoners as guilty before sending them to Malta. This is why many were sent there. The Ottomans were supposed to send the documents supporting their guilt. No document was ever sent, however; the Kemalists dissolved the tribunal and the files were stolen.</p>
<p>Another interesting point is how Simsir uses in his article Undersecretary W.S. Edmond’s quotations, when the individual in question was one of those recognising that the documents giving accounts of the guilt of the prisoners were in Istanbul. He was troubled by the fact that Turks would react very badly if criminals were hung because of their participations in the massacres of Armenians. He himself declared even at an early stages:</p>
<p>“Not one Turk in a thousand will think that any other Turk deserves to be hanged for massacring Christians.”</p>
<p>(Source: FO 371/4173/61185, folio 1270/278. Minutes recorded on April 22, 1919)</p>
<p>The British judge Lindsey Smith August 10 1921 declared:</p>
<p>"…a considerable amount of incriminating evidence was collected by the Turkish government but it is idle to expect to get it. The only alternative is therefore to retain them as hostages only and release them against British prisoners."</p>
<p>(Source: FO 371/6509/E10023 (folios 100-01))</p>
<p>Now, it is important to ask the question, “Where were those documents?” since it is often claimed by denialists that the allies had the capital under control and that after searching they had found no evidence. It is even more important to know where the documents are, since the Turkish military tribunal brought to light that such documents in the form of “secret orders” did exist:</p>
<p>“The massacre and destruction (taktil ve ifna) of the Armenians was executed through secret orders by men who ostensibly had the assignment to implement the law of deportation. (zahiren tehcir kanununu tatbik etmek). “</p>
<p>Source: Published on August 6, 1919 in "Takvimi Vekâyi" No. 3616, p.1, Trabzon Verdict, 22 May 1919</p>
<p>This reference in the military tribunal refers to secret orders; references about those signed orders are abundant in the transcripts of the military tribunal published in the Ottoman Law gazette "Takvimi Vekâyi"</p>
<p>“The documents, personally signed by the defendants, confirm the fact that the gendarmes escorted the deportee convoys for purpose of massacre. There can be no doubt and hesitation about this. (maksadi ... taktili oldugundan süphe ve tereddüt birakmadigindan). “</p>
<p>Source: Published on August 7, 1919 in "Takvimi Vekâyi" No. 3617, p.2, Yozgat Verdict, 8 April 1919</p>
<p>On 10 February 1919, British High Commissioner, Admiral Calthorpe sent to London reports from the British intelligence agency, from where the Turkish Public security official Mr. Aziz in charge of Interior Ministry's wartime archives declares:</p>
<p>“Just before the Armistice, officials had been going to the archives department at night and making clean sweep of most of the documents.”</p>
<p>Source: British Foreign Office Archives. FO371/4172/31307, folio 385.</p>
<p>Tunaya relying on Ittihad's Secretary-General Midhat's testimony writes:</p>
<p>“The documents of Ittihad party were crammed into a suitcase by Dr. Behaeddin Sakir after they had been removed from the party headquarters by Dr. Nazim. The suicase was taken to home of attorney Ramiz, Sakir's brother-in-law.”</p>
<p>Source: Tunaya, T.Z. "Türkiyede siyasal partiler, Vol. 2, 2nd ed. Istanbul: Hürriyet Vakfi publications. p. 96, n.16.</p>
<p>The Turkish press reported in December 1918 ("Aksam," 12 Dec. 1918; "Tasviri Efkâr," 13 Dec. 1918) that when the police raided Ramiz’ homes, they found documents that were still intact and handed these documents to the Martial-court. Following the dissolution of the martial-court the documents left were never handed to the British like promised. Mr. Aziz, contrary to the promises he had made, never handed those documents to them.</p>
<p>It must be noted here that Djemal's bureau's Deputy Director stated that, before Djemal, flight from Istanbul:</p>
<p>“...some of his files [containing] official documents were left in the custody of Syfi, one of his men, who out of fear burned them. “</p>
<p>Source: Atay, F.R. "Çankaya." Istanbul: Sena. pp. 127-128</p>
<p>The then minister of education Midhat Shukru…</p>
<p>“…made most of the CUP documents relative to Armenians disapper.”</p>
<p>(Source: FO 371/6500 p.480)</p>
<p>The documents incriminating some of the prisoners in Malta that the British were able to locate in Istanbul were reported disappearing. And the Nationalist government was suspected of being the responsible.</p>
<p>“…disappearance of documents incriminating certain persons …saying that the matter has been arranged by local Nationalist leaders.”</p>
<p>(Source: Weekly Summary, March 4, 1920, British Embassy publication)</p>
<p>Other references to the destruction of those documents could be found in Aydemir’s work, where he writes:</p>
<p>“Before the flight of the top Ittihadist leaders, Talat Pasa stopped by at the waterfront residence of one of his friends on the shore of Arnavudköy, depositing there suitcase of documents. It is said that the documents were burned in the basement's furnace. Indeed ... the documents and other papers of Ittihad's Central Committee are nowhere to be found. “</p>
<p>Source: Aydemir, S.S. "Makedonyadan Ortaasyaya Enver Pasa." Vol. 3, 1914-1922. Istanbul: Remzi. p. 493</p>
<p>It is evident when referring to those pieces of references that the allies had no access to the documents contrary to what is claimed by denialists. A telegram ordering the destruction of telegrams, from the Turkish Interior Minister to the provincial governor at Ayintab, was intercepted by the General Headquarters of the British Army's Egyptian Expeditionary force on 24 January 1919.</p>
<p>“Burn originals of official telegrams since mobilisation on files of district. “</p>
<p>(Source: FO371/4174/15450)</p>
<p>On 17 June 1919 the Turkish foreign Minister Safa protested to the British High Commissioner regarding British intrusions by trying to examine documents, and finally answered that such an intrusion will be unsuccessful, because the Diyarbekir-based Director of Telegraphic Service sent a circular telegram ordering to destroy these documents. Admiral Calthrope reported to London after this message:</p>
<p>“…attention to the tenor of this note which treats as a mere matter of office routine such an important matter as the proposed destruction of documents relating to the period of deportations, massacres, and the activities of the Turkish authorities during the war. “</p>
<p>(source; FO371/4174/102551)</p>
<p>The British, facing the destruction of the documents, in a weekly summary of intelligence report, dated 4 March 1920, declared from the British Military Intelligence Bureau:</p>
<p>“…the disappearance of documents incriminating ... Ittihadist. Talking of Rauf: he urged the destruction of incriminating documents. It is understood that Rauf had already arranged the disappearance of documentary material implicating himself and Enver Pasa.” [source: FO371/5166/E1782, Reports 575, 592]</p>
<p>Karay, who in 1919 was the General Director of Telegraphic Service in Turkey, wrote that Mehmet Emin, his predecessor, had sent orders to all principal telegraph centres in the country, directing them to:</p>
<p>“…destroy all official papers, the originals and copies of all telegrams. “</p>
<p>(Karay, R.H. Minelbab lelmihrab, Istanbul: Inkilâp and Aka, p. 221)</p>
<p>Post minister Hüseyin Hasim admitted ordering the destruction of telegrams in 3 June 1919:</p>
<p>“…all military telegrams burned on orders from the War Office.” [source: "Takvimi Vekayi." No. 3573, 12 June 1919]</p>
<p>From these Turkish and British evidences, the present Turkish documents relating to the Armenian massacres are either forged or manipulated, because the Turkish authorities, in an attempt to deny the Armenian genocide, use documents that according to their own sources should have been destroyed. If in fact they were destroyed, then the documents the Turkish government presents are "reconstitutions" and more probably "forged," invalid in court of law.</p>
<p>Raphael Lemkin, Lawyer, and the inventor of the word “Genocide,” refers to the prisoners of Malta in one of his writings.</p>
<p>“In 1915 the Germans occupied the city of W. and the entire area. I used this time to read more history, to study and to watch whether national, religious, or racial groups are being destroyed. The truth came out only after the war. In Turkey, more than 1,200,000 Armenians were put to death for no other reason than they were Christians ... After the end of the war, some 150 Turkish war criminals were arrested and interned by the British Government on the island of Malta. The Armenians sent a delegation to the peace conference in Versailles. They were demanding justice. Then one day, the delegation read in the newspapers that all Turkish war criminals were released. I was shocked. A nation was killed and the guilty persons were set free. Why is a man punished when he kills another man? Why is the killing of a million a lesser crime than the killing of a single individual?</p>
<p>“I identified myself more and more with the sufferings of the victims, whose numbers grew, as I continued my study of history. I understood that the function of memory is not only to register past events, but to stimulate human conscience. Soon contemporary examples of genocide followed, such as the slaughter of the Armenians in 1915. It became clear to me that the diversity of nations, religious groups and races is essential to civilization because every one of those groups has a mission to fulfill and a contribution to make in terms of culture.... I decided to become a lawyer and work for the outlawing of Genocide and for its prevention through the cooperation of nations.</p>
<p>“A bold plan was formulated in my mind. This consisted [of] obtaining the ratification by Turkey [of the proposed UN Convention on Genocide Ed.] among the first twenty founding nations. This would be an atonement for [the] genocide of the Armenians. But how could this be achieved? . . . The Turks are proud of their republican form of government and of progressive concepts, which helped them in replacing the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The genocide convention must be put within the framework of social and international progress. I knew however that in this conversation both sides will have to avoid speaking about one thing, although it would be constantly in their minds: the Armenians.”</p>

<p>After this basic attempt to analyse the Malta cases, one can find surprising the fact that any denialist could still claim that there was a Malta tribunal, or that prisoners were released because of lack of evidence or, even worse, that the allies had access to every document yet had found nothing. Because even after all the precaution the Turks took to hide the fact of the Armenian genocide, if one were to research this case honestly and without bias and compare it with, for instance, the Nuremberg tribunal, the researcher would quickly realise that even with all those forgeries from the part of the Turkish republic, after all those manipulations, and after all the destruction of files, one can still find that the evidence found in the official Ottoman Law gazette will without doubt show us that what the Ottoman Armenians have gone through was in fact an extermination, and those evidences by their quality show the intent more so than those used during the Nuremberg tribunal used to charge NAZI criminals.</p>
<p>One still wonders, and will keep wondering. Why going at these lengths to destroy those documents? Why did the Ottoman refuse to hand them to the British as promised? Why would the Kemalist government dissolve the tribunal? What were they hiding?</p>
<p>So let us ask this question again: Was there a Malta tribunal? No! There never was any Malta tribunal! Were the prisoners of Malta released because of lack of evidences? No! They were not, for Curzon’s admission shows us that this was not the case. Had the Allies access to every document they wanted when they were “occupying” the capital? No! Not only that was not the case, but even when using Ottoman Turkish documents, we have to conclude that even such documents show us that the Allies were unable to have access to such documents.</p>
<p><br />
This peripheral analysis of historical records points us to a fact, the fact being that there never was any Malta tribunal and not only this but that the prisoners kept in Malta were not released because of lack of “proof.” This short essay shows us that the prisoners were released to be exchanged with British prisoners, as well as to not obfuscate the new nationalist power in place. And, finally, the British released those prisoners after having the guarantee that they would be put on trial in Ankara. Furthermore, not all prisoners were released. The British refused to release about 20 among them; as a result they succeeded in escaping by the help of the Kemalist. The use of the Malta case by apologists of the Armenian genocide is one more example of the apologist’s paradox. On the one hand the denialists reject the Turkish military tribunal, because they claim that it was a kangaroo tribunal set by the Allies; on the other hand they use the release of Turkish prisoners by the Allies as evidence that there was no genocide. If Malta prisoners were to be charged, the denialists will claim that the court charging them was set by the Allies, therefore not credible, whereas on the other hand, if the court in question were to release them, the same denialists will use this release as a “proof” that there was no genocide. In this case, there never was any Malta tribunal in the first place, so the denialist’s selective portrayal makes us believe there was one. The entire denialist methodology uses the apologist paradox. The heart of this paradox works like this:</p>
<p>Case A, Evidence A forgery Case B, Evidence A not forgery</p>
<p>Let us examine case A. If evidence A is forgery, it is not an evidence. No further examination is necessary.</p>
<p>Let us now examine case B. If Evidence A is not forgery, it does not support the theses of genocide, so it isn’t an evidence to support the genocide. Therefore there is no evidence at all.</p>
<p>Those few lines are at the heart of the denialist methodology whereby they will first try to reject an evidence by trying to show it as forgery. If they are able, they will therefore conclude that this evidence is not an evidence. If on the other hand they are not able to show the evidence as forgery, they will try to give another meaning to the evidence, do everything to twist it, and finally conclude that even if it is not forgery, it does not support anything, therefore it is not an evidence. From this paradox, there can not be any evidence supporting the genocide, because the two theses lead to the same conclusion. No genocide. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 15:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To sum up, Fadix I'd understand if you denied all these references, because they conflict with your claims. I'm also skeptical about all the references but there's a fact that after a 30 month investigation, Malta case dropped because there was nothing that can be considered evidence in a court of law. <b>The fact that nothing was found in American archives discredits Ara Sarafian's referenced work and authors that refer to them. The government who published Blue Book admitted that it was no evidence.</b> Aram Andonian's work claims to show telegrams by Talat Pasha ordering a genocide. But court finds no evidence against Talat Pasha. In what position does this put all your peer-reviewed publications that refer to these sources as solid proof of what happened?</dd>

<dd>Fadix you claim to document everything very well. In our hands all references have little meaning to you while your side is always very well documented!!. You can claim that Malta Tribunal never existed but also sources that support your idea tell that "After the end of the war, some <b>150 Turkish war criminals were arrested and interned by the British Government on the island of Malta" and released including one of the sources you quoted. (Rare Books and Manuscripts Division, New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations.)</b> without referring to something called Malta Tribunal. So let's called it something else not Malta Tribunal if it's going to make you happy. Also <b>check "Special Collections of the John Vigen Der Manuelian Research Library, Genocide Oral History and Photo Archives, and Digital Collections of the Center for Armenian Research and Publication at The University of Michigan-Dearborn"</b> They claim to have</dd>
<dd><b>"British Foreign Office Dossiers on Turkish War Criminals, a collection of British documents published by Vartkes Yeghiayan on various perpetrators and agents of the Armenian Genocide who were rounded up by the British and interned on the island of Malta pending trial. Finally, we also have the actual microfilm copies of the British records on the Malta internments. "</b> Still claiming it never existed? I'm sure you documented it very well. Let's say I don't prefer your approach. I'd assume that you know that Dennis R. Papazian is the Director of the Armenian Research Center: University of Michigan-Dearborn. He's an Armenian Scholar. So it is not something you can try to coverup by saying 'It is some Turkish author's claim'.</dd>

<dd>Talat Pasha was never held in Malta by the British - he fled directly to Germany two or three days after the Mudros Armistice. He was never held by the British. Neither did the British ever make any attempt to prosecute those that were held in Malta. There had been a great deal of debate on what to do about the Turks responsible for the Armenian Genocide. While there was consensus that they must be tried for their crimes there was no historical precident to do so. The Ottomans made it clear that they wished to prosecute the Turkish perpetrators under Ottoman Law and Ottoman Parlimentary inquiries were begun which eventually led to the Ottoman Military Tribunals. By this time the Allies were divided amongst themselves on a great number of issues and cold come up with nothing better then allowing the Turks to prosecute their own (and with Talat, Enver and Jemal already fled to Germany the idea of an international trial (also never having been done before) had lost some of its luster). The Brits became apauled at the high rate of escapism from the Ottoman jails where security was quite lax and where those guarding the prisoners were sympathetic to them. All kinds of laxity and abuses prevailed. In a surprise move the British siezed the prisoners and transfered them to Malta - primarily just to prevent them all from escaping. There was never any actual attempt made on the part of the British or any ally to try and prosecute these people. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:07, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is turning into word games. The source I mentioned above is an Armenian source even it calls it a pending trial. These guys were interned for 30 months and British collected evidence against them during this period. Even your references name them British Foreign Office Dossiers on Turkish War Criminals prepared during Malta internments. This kind of internments are to prevent people from escaping so they can be taken to trial. You said yourself it was to prevent them all from escaping. Because people think they would escape from prosecution. If no trial was being planned what did the British government think these guys would escape from? What was the goal to keep them under custody? To take them to a court of law. To collect evidence and prosecute them and making sure that they don't escape during this period. If not what? To give them food and shelter for 30 months??? And 30 months is a lot of time to put together a case. If you still can't, you turn it into a political issue in the future. Compare it with any trial or anything that couldn't lead to trial due to lack of evidence even in today's law. You write to a book and name it Malta .... Refrain from using the word court, trial, tribunal etc. but give the meaning that there was an accusation, plaintiff (armenian and british side bringing charges), defendant(144 ottoman officials), internment and release. And last, this is even in wikipedia, Talaat Pasha, assassinated by Soghomon Tehlirian on March 15, 1921. He was released with a 'not guilty' verdict by the German Court in June 1921 .</dd>

<dd>Here's some proceedings that are easily accessible from many sources including Armenian sources. Soghomon Tehlirian trial</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DISTRICT ATTORNEY — The defendant testified that the massacres took place just outside the city limits of Erzinga. I am informed that, after the caravan had gone quite a distance from Erzinga, armed Kurdish bandits attacked the caravan in a pass and even many Turkish gendarmes were killed trying to protect the caravan. Would the defendant please answer whether or not they were attacked by Kurdish bandits?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DEFENDANT — I was told that it was the Turkish gendarmes who opened fire on us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>ASST. D.A. — You were "told"??</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>earlier in the trial --------</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DEFENDANT — As soon as the order was issued, on the outskirts of the city, they divided the people into groups and marched them off in caravans.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PRESIDING JUSTICE — Who accompanied the caravans?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DEFENDANT — Gendarmes, cavalry, and other soldiers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PRESIDING JUSTICE — How did your parents, brothers and sisters die?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DEFENDANT — As soon as the group had gone a little distance from the city, it was stopped. The gendarmes began to rob us. They wanted to take our money and anything else of value that we had.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PRESIDING JUSTICE — Therefore, even the soldiers were robbing the deportees?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DEFENDANT — Yes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DEFENDANT — While we were being plundered, they started firing on us from the front of the caravan.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>--- So earlier in the trial defendant is quite sure that it was accompanying Turkish soldiers who killed his family and gives all the details but the very same day, during cross examination he confesses that "he was <b>told</b> that they were Turks". When he stumbles over the question and contradicts with himself defense attorney comes with the help and speaks on defendant's behalf,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NIEMEYER (DEFENSE ATTORNEY) — I believe we can resolve the question of the Kurds this way. The principal modus operandi of the Turkish massacres was to arm the mountainous Kurds, the arch-enemies of the Armenians, as gendarmes to watch over the Armenians.</dd>

Defense Attorney asks - What did the guy look like? Defendant - He was a tall guy with blue eyes and black hair, well built and he had a mustache, he was about 6'. 10 minutes later District Attorney starts cross examination by asking "Was this a man who did these to your friend".

<dd>The, 'I was told' is not some rumors, it wasn't clear for him who exactly killed his entire family when it happened, it is obvious, from his testimony, he say he list consciousness after being hit. This 'I was told' in no way has any relevency here, since Tehlirian isen't even used as evidences in this article, neither the 'I was told' discredit his own testimony. The guy in his two month stays in Constantinople as he says, read the newspapers, and those newspapers covered cases in which the gendarms under the pretext of protection escorted the convoys to commit robery and killings. This 'I was told' could have very well been what he read in thos newspapers, what the hell does it change to the fact that he was the only survivor of his family and one of the few of his hometown? Again, I don't see the relevency of your point.

<dd>Fadix documents say that Defense Attorney used <b>insanity defense</b>. Thus proceedings are not good sources for anything. I found the insanity defense issue recently which undermines both of our claims. I didn't mention this in any way related to the article. Because I'm sure you've heard about assasination of the Mayor of Van (Bedros Capamajian) by Karakin of Tashnak committees and the path that leads to it. I can cite sources which you would not believe, so I'm not even going to bother. These documents claim that <b>Armenians were also harmed by Armenian bandits to frame Turks and cause aggression to start a revolt</b>. "I was told" part might have been related to something like this.</dd>

Secondly, you are mixing 1915 with the Hamidian era, thirdly, what claim did I make which was undermined here? Forthly, are you actually claiming that Armenian 'revolutionaries' were the ones having destroyed his hometown? If so, don't even bother answering because you will be ignored. Fiftly, I have above documented the Malta cases by using records from Turkish and British sources, yet you have claimed I did not document, don't waste my time and don't pull my legs. And finally, that you believe that Talaat was detained in Malta is an indication that you have no clue of what you are talking about, read the issue, concentrate on what there is in this article which you think should not be there, or what you think should be added then come back.

<dd>His testimony was clear, he never says about who exactlly killed those people, but that they were actually killed, he was hit without knowing who hit him and lost consciousness and his body was found with the body of deaths, he later regained consciousness. Those are clear in the testimony. The insanity defense was build around the thesis that he became insane after what happened to him and all the blooed he saw and his entire family with the very large majority of his town being killed. I really don't see what is your point, and I don't see what is fishy there. His testimony doesn't have much contradications given that the guy lost his entire family and ended up on the floor left to be death with the bodies of people. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:35, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fadix also don't twist what I meant. I said when I document things you say 'there's no such thing' in that case I can use the same argument against you to be fair. In the end you copy-paste paragraphs from various websites and they refer to some British documents which neither one of us saw and you accuse me of doing the same thing using some other websites which conflict with the ones you use. So we both say that we documented things but they don't make any of the claims proven. Also <b>there's no need to go back to 1894-1897 period.

<p>Quoting "Unlike the Armenians, the Jewish population of Germany and Europe did not agitate for separation.

<p>read the rest on The First Armenian Republic Page. Here's another pointless sentence "Ottoman Empire troops under the 4th Army, which Mustafa Kemal had commanded the same army between 1916—1917, crossed the border in May 1918 and attacked Alexandropol" What does this mean? Yes, he was the commander of that army 1 year before. Why mention? What's the relevance? In another article by Armenian sources <b>it is claimed that Mustafa Kemal was the commander while in reality Kazim Karabekir was the commander</b>.

<dd>Yeh! the same sort of religious figure as those fanatic Rabbis who also blame the Jews for their unfidelity to Yaveh and which according to them was punished through the Holocaust, or the Armenian Priest who claims that Armenians could have sperred themselves the fate of the genocide had they been more fidel to the Church. I spare you the rest of the story, or how much the Armenians have waited before obtaining the financing to build the church destroyed by the Earthquake in Turkey and how much @ kissing it took. But if indeed a religious figure's word are relevent to a historic article, I should find a Turkish card reader who recognize the genocide too.&#160;:) <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:11, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Charges against Orhan Pamuk were not brought by the government, they were brought by the Turkish Attorney General which is independent of government. I tried to revise it, but my changes were later removed.</p>

<p>In Turkey judicial system is independent of goverment as in most European Countries (Turkey's judicial system has been based on the Swiss Civil Code). Charges brought against Orhan Pamuk is not in the control of government, it's solely the decision of independent prosecutors. As it stands, what's written in the article with regard to Orhan Pamuk is factually wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So how does one become Attorney General in Turkey? If one is either elected or appointed by an elected official then I would say that it is still acting as part of the government. It enforces the law of the government, it is PART of the government. It may be given considerable freedom from the other branches, but it is still part of the government.

<p>Hello there, I read the article and I believe that it is very biased against the Turks. I am not an expert on the subject but I know enough about the subject to know that the two strongest supporters of the so called genocide (British "Blue Book" and Ambassador Morgenthau's memoirs) have been rebuffed. I seriously think that this should be taken into consideration before producing an anti-Turkish article. --85.103.194.83 14:19, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting. It might be worth noting that you are in Turkey, and likely a Turk. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancisTyers_daab.html" title="User talk:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 16:48, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Francis, I dom't think in this cases it makes any differences. It makes a differences if he is this anonymous user that keep coming back and disturb the place. BTW, is it really necessary to have all the US states that recognize it by their names? Just why not to say, 39 of them? <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You got to be a bit more specific. Morgenthau's memoirs and the Blue Book testimonials have been challenged and attempted to be debunked. The former is claimed to be written by ghostwriters and the latter on the premise that since Lord Bryce's account of German atrocities against Belgians was error-ridden, then so would the Blue Book. But from what I've heard, those claims have been have been rebuffed by other scholars. I really don't see anything anti-Turkish in the article, bias maybe, but claims that this article is a rant against Turks are not well grounded and often made only by the Turks themselves.

<p>I'm sorry but you cannot accuse everyone as nationalists who doesn't admit armenian genocide and you cannot praise anyone as intellectual who admits.Everyone has thinking freedom.So that must be removed.This article already includes too much propaganda facts.--<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaraman_c950.html" title="User:Karaman">Karaman</a> 23:24, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Karaman, I guess you are talking about the term 'Turkish intellectuals' used. But this is not about praising, the reason why they are included is because intellectuals publish, and published works make their position as encyclopedically relevent. Those that do not support the thesis of genocide too are reffered to as intellectual. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:03, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Western Scholars opposing genocide claims</span></h2>
<p>The Position of Turkey should have a subsection listing Western Historians opposing genocide claims like Bernard Lewis (Princeton University), Roderic Davison (Central European University), J.C. Hurewitz (Columbia University), Guenter Lewy (University of Massachusetts), Justin McCarthy (University of Louisville), Stanford Shaw (retired UCLA Professor)...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Did you read the work of any of those people? Roderic Davison can not be really qualified as someone denying the Armenian genocide, I know Lewy suggest this, but here too he twist things up. While Davison is one of those having signed the advertisement and has recieved ARIT grants(Turkish government founded), in his cases it is very difficult to say who's position he maintains. Read for instance 'The Armenian crises 1912-1914,' we really don't know where he stand. Lewy should go there, but it should also be added that he denies that the Gypsies faced genocide in second World War, he denied that American Indians faced genocide, and has even gone as far as to say what they faced wasn't criminal, and finally was one of those few accademics who loadly denied US war crimes in Vietnam. Hurewitz recieved at least 10 ITS grants according to the list, and doesn't have much of anything published particularly about the event. Shaw has been accused of plagiating his major work on a Turkish scholar. Bernard Lewis before the introduction in his departement of the Ottoman history chairs, wrote in his major work 'Armenian Holocaust' before doing a 180 degree turn. Sure, they should be included, but Davison definitly doesn't go there as it is difficult to classify him, about Lewy, his previous position should also be mentioned. Of course, they all should be added, afteral it is not like there are hundreds, it is acceptable when a position is a minority the name of its supporters could be mentioned. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:42, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The fact is that these scholars oppose genocide claims. As an anonymous person with no revealed credentials, your discrediting of these respected Princeton and Columbia professors has no bearing at all. You can question their motives all you want in another section but please don't twist the facts. Trying to discredit these respected individuals based on their grants is only a personal attack, it has no value. One should question quality of their work and this can be done only by other respected historians.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And how am I twisting the facts? Has Lewy not denied pratically all other genocides beside the Holocaust? He is on the restrictive list of those that still believe that the Holocaust is the only event that really qualify as genocide. This is relevent to the article, since the article is about a genocide. Lewis mention should also indicate that in his major book he uses the term 'Armenian Holocaust' before changing his opinion. Those are not twisting, those are not POV, I haven't writen Lewis book, he wrote it. Also the controversy about Shaw major book being a plagiate is also relevent. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:42, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The above list is not exhaustive. Let me add a few more from that declaration: <i>John Masson Smith, Jr. (UC Berkeley), James Stewart-Robinson (University of Michigan), Alan Fisher (Michigan Stale University), Thomas Naff (University of Pennsylvania), Rhoads Murphey (University of Birmingham)</i>. By the way, I want to point that these are all history professors unlike many so-called 'intellectuals' listed in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, adding the names from the declaration is not valide, because an important part of those there don't even deny the Armenian genocide, many have confirmed. And most of them have no publication about the issue in which they take any stance. The declaration goal was that research was needed about the issue and that archives should be opened. ATAA later has used it as a list of scholars who deny the genocide, when many were disturbed to learn that this declaration was to be published. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:42, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What a ridiculous logic again. The fact is simple: If someone asks for an investigation then it means that they are not convinced that a genocide happened based on the evidence available. These scholars don't accept Armenian genocide claims, as simple as this.</p>
<p>These are brave scholars, they stand up and tell the truth in the face of powerful Armenian lobby. This requires courage. We all remember what happened to Stanford Shaw at UCLA. Armenian students burned his house threating his life. We all remember what happened to Heath Lowry at Princeton. Genocide obsessed Armenian lobby forced him to step down from his post through continuous harrasment.</p>
<p>By the way, where can I find the list historians supporting genocide claims excluding ethnic Armenians and the ones who work for Armenian funded institutions? I'm really curious. Can you give me a few names? I know Israel Charny. I want to read what others have to say.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are a funny one. Search google book the term 'Armenian genocide' and 'Armenian massacre' search oxford journals databases, search Jstor databases etc. and compare those with the little fringe in the West who denies the Armenian genocide. The list is so exostive that I won't start giving names. There has been at least two petitions published as well. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:42, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look who's talking. I was respectful so far in this conversation, but I understand that does not go a long way with you. Why don't you give a few names from that never ending list? Who's the top gun? The matter of the fact is, respected historians are against your thesis and the truth will stand.</p>

<dd>Hey Fadix, your sidekick THOTH was salivating on a controversial documentary piece by Goldberg on the so called genocide. What he failed to mention was that most of the funding came form private Armenians and Armenian related organizations.

<dd>No one who would term the Armenian Genocide as "so-called" has any business what so ever editing or really even being involved in this discussion. There is nothing "so-called" about it (and we have been over this a great many times before) - not only does it clearly meet every qualification for being considered as a genocide - but it is well documented that Ralph Lemkin - the inventer of the word - specifically has created the word to describe specifically what occured to the Armenians - as no such word existed before. He used the Armenian case as the pre-eminent example of such a thing as genocide. So considering this and considering that it meets each and every definition of such - UN, scholarly, and pretty much any other - there is and should be no question concerning categorization of these events as genocide - and the title of the article is consistent with the internationaly acceptance of such usage. Ther eis no debate - there is no argument - unless of course one would say that there is a debate whether or not the Holocaust occured - and bestow legitimacy on those who deny this genocide as well...other then this it is a non-issue or perhaps a "so-called" issue --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 22:33, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I understand, the Armenian Genocide itself is not a subject of such laws. They only cover Holocaust denial. If the Armenian Genocide is ruled to apply to this, that is because the courts deem it falls within the perameters of the law - it is not because the law itself says that the Armenian Genocide cannot be denied. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 18:20, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only relevance of any of this is in presenting the fact that the CUP used any and every act of defiance by any Armenian as ammunition in its hate campaign against Armenains as a whole - as a people. Any excuse - no matter how fictional - would do - to justify their pre-planned actions to ethnically cleans Anatolia of those whom they thought were a thorn in the side of the Turks - who were constantly apealing to outside (Christian) powers for relief from Ottoman Tyranny - whom stood in the way of their Pan-Turkick designs...what would be mor eimportant would be to include a whole list of quotes from leading CUP thinkers and leaders concerning their beliefs on how Armenians were parasitic and/or tuberculor bodies bringing down the Turkish purity...and other racist denigrating viewpoints...all the while they scapegoated the problems of the Empire - their failure to properly govern, to right the economy as promissed and so on and so forth - all the while as they conspired to deprive Anatolia of its Armenians and steal their wealth...this is more relevant and factual...if Enver's deranged claims are to be included they should be included in the context that they were made...as ammunition - right or wrong - but just another excuse to justify the evil that they had already put into motion...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 02:05, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who talked about justifying anything? The defeat on Sarikamis is as important as the German winter defeat in the Soviet front after which the concentration camps were transformed into killing factories. Sarikamis defeat is really relevant and important. About the CUP beliefs, there are various theories about the factors, reasons and the circumtances that lead to the genocide, and the racial theory isen't much developped in notable publications. When I am talking about racial I mean not in the ethnic sense of the term but racism as it was seen in Europe. Even Dadrian in his paper on Turkish physicians implication in the genocide say that a differences with the Holocaust is that the Armenian genocide was absent of racism, since the Armenians were Turkified and many Armenian women were forcedly transfered in another group, the original theories of racism are uncompatible there. The work from a Turkish scholar I sent you, supporting the racial thesis on the genocide, while interesting is still not what most who support the thesis of genocide adhere too. I for one, don't see how a racial theory was necessary for the genocide to happen it could have helped but it doesn't provide anything not explained by the more notable thesis, the Armenians were there, they were problematic, and their presence was a major problem uncompatible with every major plans set by the Young Turk regime. There nationalisation of the economy was impossible, Armenians were controling the economy on the East. Armenians were a distinct group with a distinct language and religion and 'unturkifiable,' they were the pretext of continuous foreign intervention. They were a threat (not in the sense of attacks, but their existance in Anatolia) by their existance as being the Turks competitors for the same homeland..., those factors and many others coupled with Envers megalomanic ambitions and those amplified by the defeat in Sarikamis the Turkish autorities turned back against the Armenians and gained public support in doing so. Those are factors supported by most, racial theories on the other hand can not be presented equaly, but rather as a suggestion by some authors. But we've been already there. The point here is not what you believe being the cause of the genocide, but rather each different positions, and which position is maintained by most which should be highlined. Armenians were indeed called parasits, tuberculosis..., but thise hasn't prevented those same autorities to forcedly transfering women and dividing in the orphanged who were too young to remember (having killed the rest) and distributing them to Turkish families. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 04:00, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
