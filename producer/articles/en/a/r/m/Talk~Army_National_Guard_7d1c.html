<p>Because the Air National Guard appears to have its own article, it seemed fit to create such an article for the Army National guard. However, I am unable to work on this article. Other user input for the article would be greatly appreciated. User:69.18.16.84 2006-05-25T04:18:22</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECORNELIUSSEON_8604.html" title="User:CORNELIUSSEON">User:CORNELIUSSEON</a> and I created a page for state-level ARNG units.

See <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html#National_Guard_Forces" title="United States National Guard">United States National Guard#National Guard Forces</a> for a list of pages (sort of) showing status. In general, I started at the front of the alphabet and am working through all states. (Some states previously had state-level ARNG articles or redirects.) Since the 'template' I am using keeps getting incrementally improved as I move through these, the next article I update (probably Kansas or Kentucky) will have the 'latest' format for my template.

<p>Look at this document: <a href="http://www.1800goguard.com/guides/pdf/part8.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.1800goguard.com/guides/pdf/part8.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.1800goguard.com/guides/pdf/part8.pdf</a> The final four-five pages indicates the anticipated end state of the Guard on the national level, at the brigade level and above. I think that the material in it (open source--recruiting flyer from the U.S.G.) needs to be incorporated as well as the organizational structure it explains. I don't have time to do this now, but others may be able to. I already incorporated its elements into the <a href="../../../3/8/t/38th_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_5e45.html" title="38th Infantry Division (United States)">38th Infantry Division</a> page, as you can see.<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharnabazus_e31b.html" title="User:Pharnabazus">Pharnabazus</a> 16:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good work Pharnabzus on the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_National_Guard_1dcc.html#List_of_Units_Undergoing_Transformation" title="Army National Guard">Army National Guard#List of Units Undergoing Transformation</a> section! You have added a lot of good information. Question: When I started this section stub, I created a <b>Divisions</b> subsection and a <b>Brigades</b> subsection. Now that the division section is being expanded to add a lot of brigade information under their respective division, I am wondering if we should continue to keep the separate brigades section also? I can argue the case both ways. If we add subordinate brigade info to the divisions, then some part of the information in the brigade list (ordered by type of brigade and increasing brigade number) becomes redundant. On the other hand, with the new 'transformed' Army, it is principally the brigades that will be called up and utilized organizationally in action, not the divisions. So that might argue for the Brigade organization being primary and the division list being much more abbreviated.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other pros and cons. What is you opinion? Or anyone's opinion on how we should best organize the Transformation section before we continue to add information to it? <a href="../../../m/v/i/User%7EMvialt_579c.html" title="User:Mvialt">Mvialt</a> 19:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suggest that we keep the divisions list with the attached brigades...but that we also identify the separate brigades, such as the support or aviation brigades, which are not assigned to the divisions. That is important, because the Army has already begun to use the divisions to command assemblies of brigades not organic to the unit. For example, the 42nd Infantry Division (NY NG) had a command role in Iraq in the past few years, with both active and NG brigades attached. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharnabazus_e31b.html" title="User:Pharnabazus">Pharnabazus</a> 03:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Pharnabazus. I'd list the new arrangement of five-or-so manoeuvre brigades per div under those divisions, with a qualifying note in the main article saying how it is quite likely that the divs will never deploy with all their assigned brigades. Then separate out the independent manoeuvre brigades from all the other separate brigades. My $0.02.

<dd>To put my professional hat on here, let me say that you are all on the right track, but there is still one thing you are forgetting. The basic structure of Guard units is not changing - they will be still structured to handle local and State problems - as well as handling their Federal Mission. That means that the maneuver Brigades will NOT leave the State just because their suboirdinate units do. Here is a good First Person example. My unit, the 719th Transportation Company of the NYARNG was one of four companies in the 369th Transportation Battalion. In World War II, when the battalion was the 369th Infantry Regiment, the Regiment was converted on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">01-13</a> to a Coast Artillery Regiment [The Regiment number was re-used for a National Army unit that was assigned to the 93rd Infantry Division. They have NO relationshipo with the original 369th, before or after the war.], inducted into Federal Service, and assigned to man <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Ontario_c78a.html" title="Fort Ontario">Fort Ontario</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">01-15</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>-<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">09-05</a>. they then transitioned via Camp Edwards and Camp Stoneman, looking for a job to perform, when they were assigned to the Pacific Theater. They were moved to Hawaii in June of 1942. Upon arrival, the 369th CAR was broken up, and redesignated as follows: HHB was redesignated as HHB, 369th AAA Group; 1st Battalion was redesignated the 369th AAA Battalion (Gun); and the 2nd Battalion was redesignated as the 870th AAA Battalion (Auto Weapons). HHB, 369th AAA Group stayed in Hawaii, acted as a higher headquarters for other AAA units, and stayed where they were until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">12-11</a>, when they were deactivated in place, and restored to State service. They provided AAA service at the various airbases around Hawaii. 369th AAA Bn (Gun) was retained in place until 1945, when they were forwarded to Okinawa, anbd arrived there on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">08-12</a>. They remained there, transitioning to Occupation Duty at the end of the war, until they were rotated back to the Los Angeles Port of Embarkation on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20.html" title="January 20">01-20</a>. They were then moved to Camp Anza, California, wqhere they were deactivated on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_21.html" title="January 21">01-21</a>, and returned to State Service. 870th AAA Bn (Auto Weapons) was deployed to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbers_Point%2C_Hawaii_26be.html" title="Barbers Point, Hawaii">Barbers Point, Hawaii</a> on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_12.html" title="December 12">12-12</a>, where they remained until they were forwarded to Okinawa, and arrived there on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">05-10</a>, and remained there - transitioning to Occupation Duty at the end of the war. They returned to the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">01-13</a>, and were deactivated at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Lawton_5c3c.html" title="Fort Lawton">Fort Lawton</a>, Washington on <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">01-13</a> and returned to State Service.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Regiment was reconstituted back in its home Armory in NYC as soon as the personnel could assemble there, and the unit was restored to its historical number as the 369th AAA Regiment, with the two Seperate Battalions assigned therein.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Several reorganizations later, the Regiment was reorganized as the 369th Transportation Battalion, with HHB reorganized as HHD; the 369th AAA Battalion reorganized as the 587th Transportation Compan (Terminal Service; the 870th reorganized as the 719th Transportation Company (Med Trk); and the remainder reorganized as the 1569th Transportation Compan (MT). The battalion did NOT leave the State again until Desert Storm, when we were the first Battalion to leave New York State. 719th Trans left first, being attached to the 301sr CSB under the 101st ABD; HHD and the 1569th left next, being attached to the 24th ID, with HHD 369th acting as a headquarters along the lines of the 301st, with the 1569th being the only unit from home serving as part of the 369th during the war. 5 other Companies from the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the National Guard were subordinated to the 369th. The Battalion that included the 719th Trans was one of three NG units, other units from the RA and AR included.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The 369th is today a Corps Support Battalion, including the HHD, the 719th Transportation Company; the 10th Transportation Detachment; and the 133rd Ordnance Company (Maint).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that the Guard has always gone through reorganizations in order to remain relevant to the needs of the Army, and it has been very rare when we have gone out the door with our units intact - at least since World War II. That being true, I'd suggest concentrating on the individual basic units, and only focus on the higher headquarters should they ever go anywhere. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECORNELIUSSEON_8604.html" title="User:CORNELIUSSEON">SSG Cornelius Seon (Retired)</a> 04:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
