<p>It's not suposed to be vandalism. I tried to make it as dimensional as I could. The fact of the matter is that I hate this awfull rumor, which is why I did an article of it. It's such an infamous myth I thought it derserved an article of it's own. And I stated I wasn't trying to ofend Americans or children as I am neither ageist nor racist.</p>
<p>Keediz has been around for years even though it doesn't exist it makes me sick every time I hear it mentioned but I wasn't trying to vandalize just educate are younger readers. MJN SEIFER</p>
<p><br />
I guess you got a stalemate then?&#160;:(</p>
<p>I actaully searched for Keediz on line and like you found nothing, But I have heard it used on TV loads of times. I really love children (In a legal way) and I hate adults treating them like idiots.</p>
<p>Never the less your threats have been taken into acount and as I'm not yet finished with this site, I will refrain from posting anything Keediz realated unless I can provide proof, and to be on the safe side I will ASK you before I do so. I hope we have a neutral understanding, but this doesn't remove my pain. MJN SEIFER</p>

<p>Sorry if I was less than clear. What I mean is this. You put back the warnings, as you indicated above, and warned him. He has however now again deleted the warnings (that you put back).

<p>I am spending a large amount of my time dealing with bizarre decisions and edits and now page moves/redirects. I don't think it is sneeky vandalism but extremely poorly thought out corrections. I don't know what to do as I am wasting time that I want to use to expand and improve other articles, fixing these things. Do you have any advice or someone else I could ask to intervene? Thanks,<a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 00:49, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I asked a couple of admins a while ago. One said he saw no problem, another put a warning on his page, but nothing happened. I reported him in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> with no effect. I've reverted a few, but it is somewhat futile, if I keep posting warnings, it looks like I'm on a vendetta. Some other people are reverting his changes, but no one puts any warnings on his talk page. It's never obvious vandalism, mostly stupid useless edits that add no value mixed with edits that add confusion, like changing a word to link to a disambiguation page. Sometimes I see him make an edit that is required, a lot are changes to content where I do not know the geography enough to decide. The longer this goes on, the worse the articles become, and it will be impossible to sort out fact from fantasy. There are places to post issues - like <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a> - but I don't think this belongs there. I might post a general question in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28assistance%29_e548.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)">Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)</a> - I'll let you know. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 03:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect the next correct measured response is to open up a RfC on his/her actions, allowing several users to voice their concerns for Alec's approach, and allow Alec to respond to concerns (and so hopefully engage in some constructive dialogue). Failure to either engage constructively in a RfC, or at least take to heart its points in Alec's subsequent behaviour, could then be seen as disruptive to the overall project and thus generate a request for Admin sanctioning. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 03:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am beginning to come round to an RfC approach, though am reluctant to start one due to my relative newness. There are continuing problems on <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulse_Hill_c602.html" title="Tulse Hill">Tulse Hill</a> and now it is appearing on <a href="../../../d/u/l/Dulwich.html" title="Dulwich">Dulwich</a>. I am reluctant to keep editing them back simply because I also don't want to be seen to be on a vendetta, but the Tule Hill article is now so damaged I not sure how it can be fixed without blanking and starting again. I am also trying to engage in a discussion on the <a href="../../../t/u/l/Talk%7ETulse_Hill_7658.html" title="Talk:Tulse Hill">Talk:Tulse Hill</a> page but changes are being made whithout a consensus being formed. I have asked a third party involved in <a href="../../../l/o/n/WP%7ELon_0541.html" title="WP:Lon">WP:Lon</a> to help but all it looks like at the moment is an edit war which I really don't want to be involved in.

<dd>Quite possibly, but with all the vandalism and sockpuppetry and the mixing of present and past - somebody living and somebody dead, it's going to be hard to post an article. I would not accept anythiung from the active promoters of the article given the history.

<p>I believe you were a tad too harsh there. The background is that the user posted their stand against the deletion of certain articles, but in a way that did not address the content of each one specifically. Commenting like that even in several AfDs would not be a case of either bad-faith editing or vandalism, and at most these comments will simply be discounted by the closing sysop(s). The user also said that they were discriminate in choosing which articles to comment "keep" for. Hence I don't see the messages some editors and I left on their talk page as "warnings", which is why I reverted your re-insertion.

<p>I am getting the reference links to work, as displayed in the "health benefits" of tobacco smoking, as posted by one of your wikipedia monitors after I'd talked to him about the health benefits of tobacco. Asthma prevention and treatment is listed within the references.

Now, I don't mean to be a "vandalist", however...because I "vandalised" I was able to bring important research to the attention of Gzuckier who included it into the articles Tobacco smoking&#160;: -&gt;Health Benefits and B Vitamins&#160;: -&gt;Sources of B vitamin</p>
<p>Now some of the research that he included into Tobacco smoking&#160;: -&gt; Health benefits is directly related to the treatment of asthma.

<p>Hi there ArmadilloFromHell.</p>
<p>I am reffering to message you sent me at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ibnuasad" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ibnuasad" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ibnuasad</a></p>
<p>I know that you intend to keep wikepedia <i>clean</i> from spams and vandalism bu I believe that I was not spamming at all. I was just adding a link which leads to an article that will help people understand better on the subject. I assume that you may have receive reports from Dmoz about the link added and in the article I stated that some Dmoz editors were corrupted. Some...not all. This is just my assumption because from my website tracking logs at <a href="http://extremetracking.com/open;ref1?login=ibnuasad" class="external free" title="http://extremetracking.com/open;ref1?login=ibnuasad" rel="nofollow">http://extremetracking.com/open;ref1?login=ibnuasad</a> I see that my website had been visited by someone coming from Dmoz editors forum.</p>
<p>What I did on the Open Directory Project was not vandalism. I did not mess or delete the whole page. I only added a link to an article on How to get listed in Dmoz which in my honest opinion will be very helpful to other people.</p>
<p>Its the same thing with Search Engine and PageRank. I added a link that would help people understand better how they work in simple english.</p>

Adding links to promote sites is generally considered spam, and considering the site name and your user name, I am led to believe that you own the site, that is why an additional spam warning was given.

<p>armadillofromhell, Though I understand your concern as to the page I recently created, I beseech you to let me keep it for just a week more. In my english class at school, we have an assignment to "leave our mark" somewhere where others will see it. The teacher recomended the moorpark high school site because the only people who really look at that page are moorparkians anyways and so they would understand. I guarantee that the page will come down as of December 4th. Please grant me extra time for my class?</p>

<dd>It's not my decision, I just tag articles for deletion, and somsone else deletes it. It's important to create an article that fits our guidelines, unfortunately we cannot allow creation of articles that might at some future time be made into a good article, if we did Wikipedia would be a slushpile. New articles that clearly do not fit are usually deleted within a few minutes. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 05:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in the right mood, I just learned to do stained glass, and I came up to do some Wiki editing after making my first 3D box lid, just happened to see your articles, and I could not resist. I wanted to add something before someone (typically me) speedy deleted them for lack of content/notability. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 06:46, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With regards to the content and notability-</p>
<p>The latter first- these are all the most nnotable workshops, each making a huge contribution to the art of their day, a contribution which has been overlooked for a long time by art historians, considering how many "ordinary" people are still delighted by this form of art, usually gazing at it from a quite uncritical perspective. There were hundreds of such firms, most of them small regional glaziers who could set pretty patterns competently but who weren't up to much when it came to the anatomy of the figures.</p>
<p>Some of these stubs have virtually no content yet, but I willl remedy that. I have to get my facts together for each workshop in turn and I only have a small number of books availablle. Never mind! Maybe someone else will get exited. Have you looked at the parent article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stained_glass_-_British_glass%2C_1811-1918_e01d.html" title="Stained glass - British glass, 1811-1918">Stained glass - British glass, 1811-1918</a>&#160;?</p>

<p>Thank you for butting in on <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedarhurst%2C_New_York_2740.html" title="Cedarhurst, New York">Cedarhurst, New York</a>.

The other editor is not basing his edits on facts; only from experience as he used to live in the general area.

<dd>Because Bathurst street is not a community, it's a street, on which there there sections that are mostly Portuguese, others that are Black/West Indian, others that are Jewish but not Orthodox. The Orthodox sections of Bathurst are relatively small; next thing is we will be labelling Dufferin Street as an Italian community. The whole thing is elitist, comfusing and POV. Note that I have nominated the category for deletion. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 08:26, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you Armadillo. It terms of these labels and categories, I sincerely think that a town really needs to be associated with a certain ethnic group or religion to be labelled as such (i.e. Little Italy, parts of Yonkers, NY that is all Irish). Better yet, I would delete all these labels but thats just my opinion.

<p>Hi...What's the policy on deleting categories? As you can see with the Orthodox Jewish community issue, its getting completely out of hand. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelical_Rift_177d.html" title="User:Helical Rift">Helical Rift</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know the policy on deleting categories, this is the first time I've suggested one be deleted. As it stands, it's an argument between the original category creator, the category deleter (me) and two people who have had recent conflicts over the category. There is some input from a third party, but more uninvolved people need to contribute.</dd>

<p>Hi. I want to know if Silentbob4477 was blocked under the suspicion that he and I were the same person. If this is the case (and appears to be due to the constatnt speculation and unsupported conclusions on the issue) please compare the IP addresses of our accounts. You will find that they do not match and cannot be from different computers owned by the same person due to the fact that the IP addresses that are given on the net are those of different ISP accounts. Therefore it is not possible and highly illogical and inconvenient for he and I to be the same person. I just wanted to clear this misunderstanding up once and for all. I am not condoning any negative action/s made by Silentbob4477 but am merely trying to eliminate suspicion and conspiracy. Sincerely, Enknowed 14:07, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I could just as well ask to to provide the source as to why you changed it. You could however start by looking at the map that is linked in the first paragraph of the article. Then you can look at Google maps. Yorkville comes to a halt at Yonge street where the Central library is located. The only East running streets are Collier steet which is slightly North of Yorkville, starts at Yonge and continues Eastward to Church, crosses it, continues on the other side and then stop; and Asquith Avenue (South of Yorkville) which starts at Yonge, continues East and crosses Church. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 19:55, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess it's a metter of interpretation and POV. I used to work at the end of the street and shop there. I would never consider Yorkville to extend to Church or include Bloor. I was going to get some photos of Yorkville street and replace the ones of Bloor. If you use that map as the source for the boundaries of Yorkville, then the article should be renamed to Bloor/Yorkville as the map is titled; also most searches on Google come up with that as the name of the neighbourhood. At the moment I'm not planning on changing anything. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 16:50, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've commented on (and queried at) your BRFA. Relatedly, I've compiled <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_usertempcat_1102.html" title="User:Alai/usertempcat">a list</a> of what I think you're proposing to find by page-fetches from the live wiki, but instead from the database dump from the end of last month. Let me know if that's of any use to you; I should be able to compile a similar list from "fresher" data come the next db dump (whenever that is). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting - ti seems that's half the job done, I was thinking of doing something similar. I downloaded a dump a few days ago for testing. I was going to scan it with PHP, and then rewrite it in Python, since my Python programming is a little rusty. From the comments in the proposal, it was suggested not to use Python, and use AWB, but AWB so far does not work for me as far as making any changes. This whole thing came about because I saw an issue that needed fixing, and I like programming new stuff (I'me a full time programmer), but it seems I'm hitting snags. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 20:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you have access to a mysql server, or can get one running without too much pain, it's fairly easy to produce the above -- it only needs the "page" and "categorylinks" dumps, not the whole shebang (mercifully). I'd agree with the BAGers that AWB would be preferable, if there's indeed significant "manual assistance" actually involved -- I've used AWB on tasks where the edits need to be checked or redone by hand, and current use pywikipedia for tasks that (hopefully) just require some sanity-checking per batch. (The user page bug thingie I have no idea about.) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah that's no problem, I've got my own private Wiki installed using the Wiki software, I use it for documenting and problem tracking for a software development project, and I figured out the internals of the Wiki tables, since I generate a lot of the Wiki pages with custom PHP scripts that feed it from a separate problem tracking system. I just got AWB working and used it for something else that I just came across - very cool for that. I think that it's good anyway as a prototyping\testing tool for making sure search and replace, etc. is working ok. Thanks for the help. I'll play around some more. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 02:48, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seems like a loaded question to me; from you user page, I would guess that our styles are directly opposite. My view is that most new pages posted around 1:00am should be deleted; they are generally school kids making nonsense pages, and attacking their friends and teachers. If no one deletes them you end up with a big mess. I also believe that talk pages should not be archived for at least 5 days. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 03:18, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi I had systematically removed the new user's spamming of this link to multiple pages as the site failed to give greater detail than that already in articles. I took pity though with this final link in [{Angioplasty]] as the site's webpage seemed substantial and does have rather nice pictures&#160;:-) That's a very weak keep vote - what do you think&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny, I was testing an AWB script when I noticed his links, so I decide to run it, but by the time I changed the parameters and started processing, you had changed all but that one - fast typing! I let it do that one, as I thought you just had not got to it.

<p>I noticed that you put a db-empty tag on the article Linda is a child molestor, but I'm curious if you looked at the page history.

<dd>It really bothers me when I see someone blanking their own talk page in order to remove warnings they have received. I really got into it with an editor who claimed he had the right to remove such warnings. Of course, they are always there in the history, so it makes little difference. In this case, a user who had no intention of making any constructive contribution is blocked, and I am a little happier.

<dd>Me also. There used to be a standard warning tag for it, it was removed a month ago, reinstated and removed again. There seems to be a conflict between those who think that warnings should not be removed, and those who think that once a warning has been issued and read, the user may delete it. The problem is that when you go to a talk page that is empty of warnings you think the user is clean and issue a level 1 warning and it defeats the whole purpose. The counter argument is that it's in the history, but that's a whole a lot of extra work. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 16:06, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am in complete agreement with you on this matter. I am aware that there are serious differences of opinion amongst editors and administrators on this issue, but there should be some way of moving forward on this. It is simply strange to me that one would want to create so much more work for other editors and administrators---the warnings should remain on the talk page for reference. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 18:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently added a link in <a href="../../../d/m/o/Dmoz.html" title="Dmoz">dmoz</a> article pointing to a page rendering how dmoz once looked like (newhoo). You deleted this link, the comment said no proof. Well, all I can tell is that I found this page on the personal site of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich_Skrenta_4c34.html" title="Rich Skrenta">Rich Skrenta</a>, the founder of newhoo that became dmoz later. So I think this information is secure enough, however it's up to you to decide whether it deserves to be replaced on dmoz article or not. Have a look at <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skrenta.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and look for "What NewHoo once looked like" string. It indeed points to <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/nh" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skrenta.com/nh" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Regards.

<p>I am not sure why you deleted the page I was working on. I was trying to document the company I work for which is an emerging company with a very unique history. The reason stated was "blatant advertising" when I was merely documenting what this company does and what the affiliations were. Unfortunately, I am new to this thing and did not keep a copy while working on it, and poof! it was gone. I think you could have at least read the article without bias before you removed it! Thanks for listening. --Rwphan 19:20, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just for the record I don't delete articles, I don't have that power. What I do is tag articles that probably should be deleted. If I tagged it as blatant advertising, that's because that is what it looked like to me. If the site is no longer there, that is because an administrator agreeed with me and deleted it. I do read articles before I tag them. There is a difference between an article that provide factual infomation about a company, and one that soudns like blatant advertising. And you should note that company articles even when written correclty are not listable unless they meet the definitions provided in <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMPANY_21af.html" title="WP:COMPANY">WP:COMPANY</a> even if the company is legitimate.

As far as the old account linking to the new, I was not sure that was allowed, it just added to my confusion. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 18:57, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no idea how, but it appears you are right, the old account has been compromised. Although I haven't used the account since I changed to my current user name, since it's now under someone else's control, I've removed the redirect that linked that account with my current user page. Perhaps I should request to have the other account blocked if that is possible. Either way, thanks for informing me of the situation. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim1988_0c53.html" title="User:Tim1988">Tim1988</a> <strong><sup><a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETim1988_1a2d.html" title="User talk:Tim1988">talk</a></sup></strong> 20:11, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, it looks like this has been sorted out... or, at least, the problem has been diagnosed, yes? Now, the solution? Blocking the old account seems the right idea. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 23:09, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I added it as an afterthought just as a note and should have mentioned that no warnings had been issued. Just in case he comes back on the IP address, I have now tagged it with warnings. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 01:23, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
