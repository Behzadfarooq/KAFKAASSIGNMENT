<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV</span></h2>
<p>I don't see why we need to have the POV tag here. The article doesn't assert the views, all the disputed parts are labeled as "alleged," the article talks both about the Turkish and mainstream point of views--I suggest the POV be removed. If someone objects, they will need to make a good case.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 12:36, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because it doesn't say what Turks allege Armenians did? We should then also put the other side of the story and then we can remove the POV.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Aren't all of the Armenian contributions to Ottoman civilization covered in the Ottoman Empire entires? (are these really just alleged contributions?) If not perhaps these need to be modified to properly reflect Armenian contributions first before we move on to just why Armenians became the victims of the dominant Ottoman Turkish elements of the society. Oh and BTW - only Turks (perhaps aided by some Kurds and Circassians and some Balkan and other various Turkics - commited Genocide [against Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians])...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 05:05, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am neutral on this topic and after reading the article, I think the NPOV tag needs to go. Of course many people of Turkish origin think this whole topic is not NPOV but the way the article is written is neutral. You don't need every single Turkish allegation and rationalization because they are addressed generally. Take the tag off please. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">Talk</a> 06:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed. Do the Nazis get to push their POV about the Final Solution, about how the Jews "violently resisted the peaceful breakup of the ghetos", "slipped intelligence to the Allies", "manipulated the war through their evil global conspiracy", etc? I think we should have a formal vote if Fadix or an admin won't do the job. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 08:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said previously, I don't take the responsability to remove it.

<p>I absolutely agree with users Pschemp and John Smith above - article is most politically correct as it stands (too much so IMO) - and certainly should not have a POV lable on it any more then the Holocaust article should. Outside of (so-called) scholars who explicitly are funded by Turkey or who have very obvious ties to Turkey there are very few - if any - scholars who truly deny the Armenian Genocide and would dispute any facts or positions contained in this article. It is most shameful that some Turks are so fanatically blindly nationalistic that they cannot accept the facts in this case even though the world and scholars are pretty convinced concerning what occured. It is also most sad that we are held hostage by this denial. I argue that this article needs to be entirely rewritten and reorganized to more resemble that of the Holocaust article. It requires more background explanation and discussion however as their is less common familiarity with the events and circumstances of the Armenian Genocide and of the Armenian experience in the ottoman Empire prior to the Genocide then there is of the Jewish experience in Germany prior to WWII and the events leading to and comprising the Jewish (and other peoples) Holocaust enacted by the Nazi Germans in WWII. Likewise I am in favor of covering a variety of events and circumstances concerning conditions and events affecting the Ottoman Empire prior to the leading up to the Armenian Genocide which I feel are important for a proper understanding and context of this event. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 13:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have created a poll, so please vote at the bottom. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 15:41, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my opinion as a student of history at Manhattan College, Dr. Balakian spoke at my school about it and this entry is a far more neutral article than what he spoke about during the lecture. so As a Turkish student none the less of History the NPOV tag should be taken off. There is no bias both sides are given, its Dr. Balakian you need to talk to the guy that wrote the Burning Tigris or something like that ~Pinar</p>

<p>By the way, has anyone ever looked on the first photo at the article page?Hahah!If you look, you will see the Russian hats on the heads of Ottoman officers.</p>

<dd>Actually, I am suspicious of that picture myself, I have removed it a while back I think, but it was reintroduced. The victims were probably either Russian Armenians soldiers serving for the Tsar or Russian soldiers, who had their uniforms taken off and their victors dressing of those uniforms as it was coutume there. I may be mistaken, but still I believe there are better references pictures to have this one included, I don't believe this picture represent victims of the genocide. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just one comment, those who will vote should do it not based on what they believe to be true, but rather if they think that this article is clearly POV.

<ul>
<li><b>Support</b> the Armenian genocide is solidly established and the objections of many Turks are clearly represented in the article. Some injustice to the Turkish POV is done by not recognizing that Turkey did not always deny the genocide, however the warning represents quite the opposite view. Progress has been made on the late recognition of the genocide by Turks. If asked, I am willing to elaborate on the early Turkish views of the Armenian genocide, with references. Overall the article is NPOV. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 23:08, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>++VOTING CLOSED++ There has not been one dissenting voice on the vote after several days, so I am removing the tag as of now. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 23:50, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It appears to me this page is completely dominated by those who have a stake in this matter, and naturally this sort of vote will garner such a result. In order to have dissenting voices, dissenting parties would need to dedicate themselves as eagerly as those for whom this matter means so much. The fact that this page is stable points not to the truthfulness of many of the claims, but to the commitment of those who have made this page their calling; this article is not, in any shape or form, "objective," and does not at all "present both sides of the story."

When you add anything to a page you make an edit, thus above this is your edit to this page. I think you misunderstand the meaning of edit as used here. As of this point, ALL of your edits are to this article and its talk page and it appears you created this account purely for inserting accusations of bias into this topic. Of course you are allowed to do so, but anyone is also allowed to completely disregard your opinions.

<dd>We have a good difference in opinion. Anyone who has the capability of looking at this topic in an impartial manner knows what I am referring to; examples abound from some of the talk pages that I have read here. Many of the sources in this article are not of the variety a genuine historian would accept. (Such as undocumented photographs, fixed trials conducted under enemy occupation, and one professor of notoriety of whom even Hilmar Kaiser has concluded that "serious scholars should be cautioned against accepting all of Dadrian's statements at face value.") As Guenter Lewy has written recently, "a large number of Western students of Ottoman history reject the appropriateness of the genocide label for the tragic fate of the Armenian community in Ottoman Turkey. This list includes distinguished scholars such as Roderic Davison, J.C. Hurewitz, Bernard Lewis, and Andrew Mango. Ignoring this formidable array of learned opinion, most Armenians and their supporters among so-called genocide scholars assert with superb arrogance that the Armenian genocide is an incontrovertible historical fact."</dd>

But I realize if I exercise my right, two minutes later, someone with a highly unfriendly attitude and single-minded determination will impose her dictatorship. In order to persist, one must possess the time and will. Those of us who are not as emotionally invested cannot last very long. This is exactly why the above "vote" is invalid, when only like-minded people are present to vote. Blissmiss 10:10, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah yes, I must be Armenian because I believe this happened. Of course. There are those out there that deny the holocaust too, but that doesn't mean they need to be exhasutively included or discussed on the holocaust page. If you think those experts are so worthy, then go write a separate page about their views on the "non-existing genocide". This page is not the place for it. The article makes it very clear that some people disagree with calling it a geneocide, no more is needed here. It is the nature of political issues that someone always disagrees. We've heard that here before, nothing you say is new. Again, if you believe that strongly about it, go write your own article. You are starting to sound like a sockpuppet of certain anon contributors below who are upset because they didn't get their way either. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp"><small><font color="green">psch</font></small></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp"><small><font color="green">mp</font></small></a> | <small><a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp"><font color="green">talk</font></a></small> 22:10, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, we would delete such an article since it is a POV fork. The point is that the Armenian genocide is hardly contested outside Turkey and widely accepted as a historical fact. Immediately after the genocide and more recently it is partially accepted in Turkey too. Both the history of the genocide and the fact that many Turks and few others have reservations is well covered in the article. Therefor it is NPOV. We also cover the recent recognition of the genocide in Turkey, but are still weak on its early recognition. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 22:51, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gidonb, your sentence above does not fit the real facts on the ground. The genocide is not accpeted and characterized as a big lie in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakistan, China, Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tataristan, and almost all muslim countries. There was one who said that Leabon pseudo recognized the alleged genocide, there is no credible source to approve that. No official gov't wweb site of Lebanon talks about the alleged and lie armenian genocide. As to other countries except 15 mostly christian countries no country has recognized the genocide. Even the US characterizes it as a massacare. Your armenian love or fundamentalism has closed your eyes to reality and real facts. Try to be more correct. --<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.195.182.195.html" title="User:71.195.182.195">71.195.182.195</a> 09:04, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The countries you listed are hardly up-standing members of the international community, especially as many of them have committed State-sponsored violence against their citizens, while denying it. Indeed a lot of these countries seem to have some sort of "gentleman's agreement" where they cover up for each other in the international community whenever one does something wrong. And Muslim countries are obviously going to take the side of other Muslims. When you have countries like France, Canada or Scandavian nations saying it's a lie then there might be some credance to it. But all you've done is mention places that have a questionable human rights record themselves.

<p>Gidonb, yes it does and it does well. The countries that recognize the alleged and lie based armenian genocide are the biggest genocide doers and now they with zealot woudl like to balckmail the Turkey and label it as one of them as well. Becasue pseudo for them it would reavealing that they weren't alone in the world. The biggest genociders are France, Germany, Italy, and UK. Don't forget that 3 million died with direct inaction of the British in Bengal in 1940s. The germans killed 6 or more Jewish. I especially see the activeness of the German as they did such a wrong thing and now try to label Turkey as genocider, as this will give them the psychological releif that they are not so horrible. You just might be a German or European who have been the biggest and largest genociders in the world and nothing will clean this.</p>
<p>So as we see the countries that recognize the alleged armenian genocide and armenian lies are those countries which have done the biggest genocides in the world. See who are recognizing the alleged armenian genocide. --71.195.182.230 17:32, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anon, funny you would mention Germany. Hitler in his final solution was inspired by the Armenian Genocide. He refered to it personally and specifically. He also had the ashes of the architect of the Armenian Genocide sent to Turkey, where this man was added to the Mauseleum of the Fallen Heroes and lies until today. All this is on record. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 17:49, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gidonb, the armenian loved and faked words of Hitler is nothing more than the myth as the armenian genocide allegations. You know that better than me. Also would like to note that UK hasn't recognized the alleged armenian genocide. In other countries they were done mostly bby some group of parlamentarians, who are most likely anti muslim, anti Turk and or christian fundamentalists. So as yo u see the armenians millions are going to toilet as the flush of water. I woudl suggest those armenian diaspora people to spend this money for armenians who are dieing in armenia from poverty. It would be interesting for you to know that half of the armenian population has already left armenia. So funny that most of armenians as you gidonband and lovers of armenians for this or another reason always try to relate the armenian genocide to notorious people in the world therefore trying to justify their position. So far these are Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini. God known who will be tomorrow. May be the Pope Rome himlself.

<p>Also I don't know why Armenians want to hide that one of the biggest genociders in the world was Armenian. Lavrenty Beriya was an armenian and the right hand of Stalin. Indeed the entire massacre of intellectuals and anti-soviet people had been directly managed by Lavrenty Beriya, not by Stalin. He has killed by some estimations 30 million people in the entire former Soviet Union. Do you the see the parallel between the tendency of Lavrenty Beriya to commit genocide, and armenian in Turkey in 1915 who killed half a million Kurds and some Turks.</p>
<p>Why you don't tell the truth? WHy you don't tell that one the biggest genocider in the world was Armeninan, Lavrenty Beriya. His genocide may be exceeds the genocide committed by Hitler. --<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.195.182.195.html" title="User:71.195.182.195">71.195.182.195</a> 00:03, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Beriya was not Armenian, he was a Georgian Jew but the only person who was in the high ranks of the Communist Party at that time who was Armenian was Artem Mikoyan and he aided in policy making, not deporting and starving peoples.

<dd>I have never seen one credible source on the Jewishness of Beria. Where did you read that he was of any Jewish decent? According to most sources he was the son of Mingrelian peasants from the Abkhazian region of Georgia. The sources that claim he was Jewish seem to be from a very specific kind. Striking enough some postings on anti-Semitic forums also deny that he was Jewish. Of course, since Beria did not have many papers and the few he had were partly forged, much can be claimed about him. Beria was one of the major criminals behind the "Great Purge" (greatest after Stalin) and responsible for the death of many Jews. By the way, a well known hoax claims that Stalin himself was Jewish. Truth is that Stalin studied to be a priest at a seminary before he turned to communism. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 01:33, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I lived in the Soviet Union and books like those were viewed unfavorably by the USSR government and hence, were read in secret. It was an omnipresent view held by the people in the USSR. The books didn't have any hint of anti-semitism, they simply stated that Beria was of Jewish descent and undeniably, a corrupt and ruthless "politician" in the Stalin's government, the one who did his dirty work. And Stalin for a fact, was definitely not Jewish. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 07:03, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very true but some Soviet books were against Beria for political reasons or rehashed information. To the best of my knowledge it has not been included in a credible source. Of course I would be interested to know if such a source existed. It is not in the very detailed <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lavrenty_Beria_c874.html" title="Lavrenty Beria">Lavrenty Beria</a> article and would be if there was something to it. It also is not proven he was not a Jew. In any case Beria did not study to be a priest. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 08:03, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, quit removing, that is what you're good at. You have already removed something on the bases that it does not fit in the article and deleted an entire section. There will already by an entire article regarding Denial of the Armenian genocide, because the position of denial of the genocide exist and cover more than half of the works published about the topic. You will hardly find any work covering the topic which does not at least have one chapter about what is termed denial. It is the least one could do to have at least a little link to another article with that name, and the fact that it is largelly underused in the article is clearly misleading because if we were to give the space on denial that is covered in the academia we would have to give half of the space of the current article. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:45, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is why I took the article off my watchlist, it seems it is ok for someone to go and add the denial link without discussion, but as soon as I introduce it into discussion, I get a personal retort off you. I have made it clear before, that this article does not present the Turkish POV in a sympathetic tone as Wikipedia requires, but instead slams it at every given opportunity. On top of this, we are now placing a link called denial wherever an opposing view is expressed. This is just another instance of the discreet presupposition running throughout this article that the Turkish view is wrong. At least we have moved on from when the Turkish government position was simply entitled denial! (which if i remember you once again opposed). --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 20:59, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You have deleted sentences because you considered them showing the Turkish government in bad light and when I have reintroduced it you have deleted it as per talk page, when I have justified its inclusion and in the last part of the discussion you haven't even answered me. I repeat, what is termed as denial, should take half of the space of the article because half of the time or even more, when the Armenian genocide is reffered to is to point of its denial. This is what it is called, I already used Universalis which is owned in part by Britannica, which call it as such. In fact, the only encyclopedia that I know of that does not do this is Britannica which is the record holder on the numbers of times that it changed its entry about the Armenian genocide and it was always after intense Turkish pressures. Britannica has even mistakes in its statistic table about the entry which were directly pasted from the Turkish foreign ministry. They were even forced to remove their maps of historic Armenia which was a reprint of National Geographic map, and Tabib whom is a member here in Wikipedia was one of those who wrote for the removal.</dd>

<dd>Also, you are the one refusing the include the whole Turkish version, because when I do it, you claim it does show the Turkish position as bad light. But it is TRUE that Halacoglu, Ataov all those working in the Turkish historical society which is owned by the National Assembly(AKA government) claims that it was actually the Armenians whom commited genocide against the Turks and that even figures of over a million killed by Armenians were presented. I am ready to include those, but you will refuse, actually the Turkish version you want to be included is YOUR Turkish version not those published. Even thought it is supported by a good portion of the Turkish population, we need publications for it to be included, but the only publications that one could find are those by Halacoglu, Ataov or those published by the Institute of Armenian studies founded by the Turkish government aimed specifically to deny the Armenian genocide. Those publications are the official versions, the official version is Halacoglu's 56 thousand Armenians perished and that Armenians killed a half a million Turks, but when I have included those you wanted it to get deleted. Is it my fault that the governments version destroy its own credibility? The same government that accused nearly every Western country of genocide? But of course you also opposed to the inclusion of this, as well as your probably inclusion of the claim from the Turkish government that the Armenian genocide is an international lie and that Western democracies position is controled by the Diaspora.</dd>

Now, as for you accusation about Turkey accusing other countries of genocide, I had the support of both El C and Tony Sidaway in removing that sentence. It was an attempt by you to misprepresent the words of individuals as part of a greater hyprocrisy by the Turkish government.

<dd>And my source from the Turkish government position was taken from the books published by the Turkish governments personals which are the bases of what there is in the ministry website. Halacoglu is the president of the Turkiish historical foundation AKA society, which was founded since under the Kemalistic regime and is attached to the General assembly, he is hired and pied by the government and right now is the minister of the Armenian genocide 'allegations.' If you want to know his position and his claims of Armenian casulties or that you want a reference from his books, I will gladly footnote his claims, I was going to do that already. As for your claim that you got the support of Tony and El C, you are misinterpreting their acts the same way that you have tried to assassinate my character by claiming that I was already banned by an Administrator, when you knew that it was a mistake because my ban was lifted soon after I was banned. El C revert to vandalism to your own version is not a support, you have mislead in your edit as if there was an agreement when there was none. Tony made a remark but has not followed when I have answered. As I already said, the Turkish government had accused pratically every Western nations of genocide as an answer, and I don't even include what happened here with the Israeli minister of education who left his job after he had attempted to include the Armenian genocide alongside with the Holocaust in school curriculums. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:14, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For your information, I was not going off his revert, but off his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=27157014&amp;oldid=27151051" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=27157014&amp;oldid=27151051" rel="nofollow">reply</a> (towards bottom) on his discussion page. If I mistakenly took that as support, then I apologise to El_C. With regards to your block, it came as no surprise to me after witnessing how uncivil you can be (which I actually warned you about), that you judged it as a mistake seems to be your interpretation, If i'm not mistaken the admin unblocked you on good faith. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 20:05, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Garnet, my accusation about you removing materials is founded and you know it, not only on this thread but elsewhere, including Ataturks entry, which the critics have simply been removed, while your accusation against me was simply untrue and you knew it. You raised the issue of my blocking when you knew that the decision was reverted soon after it was implemented, but since you raise it again and still maintain that, know that the one who blocked me apologized in private and while I promessed to not talk about that, that you still don't drop that I am forced to bring that. From all the arbitrators, administrators involved in that cases only you claim I was uncivil, only you witnessed that, I guess you see what you want to see. Also, you recieved a warning yourself by an administrator and I have never fallen that low to discredit you. This was the caracter assassination I was talking about, you pointed that to picture me as someone who could not behave and was blocked therefor. As for everytime I have used the term BS they fitted there, you were deleting sentences what was I to do of that? Comming to El_C, I don't think it is a bright thing to interpret somemones remark, when your interpretion of it in light of my reply which BTW you haven't answered to, doesn't make much sense. Prime ministers, presidents etc. are very relevent more so when there is no written on stone Turkish government position and that from the same logic I could delete all that section from the same basis. When I brought that you have skipped replying to that, and that accusing various countries of genocide is generalised. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 01:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I didn't bring up your ban, your brought up your ban to again accuse me of being underhanded. The reason i ignore most of your ranting is evident from this discussion, look at the size of it! I have no interest in taking part in 1mb of discussion with you every time I want to edit an article. You even make no hint of apology in calling other peoples contribution bullshit, but instead think you are fully justified! You accuse me of basing El_C support on a revert, I show you otherwise, and you give me some nonsensical reply to avoid losing face. Now show me this warning i received from an administrator which you have been so modest as to mention, other than a 3RR I received in my early days I dont know what your on about. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 01:59, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another thing is that the Turkish government position there, is your position since you control that section and consider what is the Turkish government position. In short, you have already removed an entire section regarding the genocide, and like it or not the term denial is here to stay when the term is used in the very large majority of the works each time the question of the Armenian genocide is mentioned and one of the reasons why I have a problem to remove the neutral tag is because without any inclusion of the denial this article is misleading and does not cover it as it is in reality.</dd>

<dd>I dont 'control' that section. I only take an interest in it because it is only place in the article which represents the Turkish view. If I'm not mistaken there were previously about 3 lines in the entire article which treated the Turkish view and you deemed this as incorporating the Turkish view and therefore making the need for a separate section redundant. And I find it surprising that your idea of making the article more neutral is to emphasise the Turkish view as denial even more. And heres me thinking you were going include the non-Turkish academics who dont support the genocide thesis (which you said you were going to do no?). --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 17:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Turkish view is recorded only on publications not on what you believe as a Turk. I am ready to include Gurun, Ataov, Halacoglu etc. who actually represent the official version, and it was you who named that section to represent the Turkish government view, which is not blindly to be equated with the general Turkish population, when the last poll in Turkey about Armenians showed that the general population has no clear idea of who exactly are Armenians and how big is Armenia. As for denial,I have opposed many Armenians to introduce their POV, but I will oppose to delete the term denial, because this is what is the Turkish government position, and had the genocide not happened it would still be termed as denial, because the Turkish government refuse the official position which is the thesis that a genocide did happen. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:14, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

By Nooo!!! You will always try removing sentences that are official positions and even others which you do not deny the existance(like turkish officials accusing other nations of genocide they were even to pass a resolution accusing Armenia of genocide in Xojali). <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:26, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is now obvious that the chances of me editing this article without getting an instant revert are next to zero, not because of my edits, but because of the strong prejudice against any Turk editing this article.</dd>

<dd>I am almost sure that you noticed it, but I decided to mention it anyway. The article says "amont the first." As such, it is accurate. By the way, many scholars, perhaps justifyably, regard Abdul Hamid's massacre of 300,000 Armenians in 1890's as part of a 20 year long genocide campaign (1894-1923) in 4 stages: 1890's, 1909 (Adana, 30,000 victis), 1914-18 (1.5 million), 1920-23 (by Kemal, 300,000, mainly in Cilicia, West, and Caucasus). In that case, it does become the first genocide of 20th c. --<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 17:07, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My armenian or pro-armenian friend John Smith. If you call the week as plenty of opportunity, my response to you is that it is nothing more than a perverted understanding of opportunity. Even unimportant elections in US towns take 3 months and that with notification to eveybody.</p>
<p>Also disputed issues should have the disputed tag. That is the rule of the Wikipedia. You can not address it with 8 votes:-)))) 8 votes and that is more than enough for you to lift the tag. My friend I would suggest you to learn more about democracy, elections and voting. Be more tolerant and don't try to manipulate the lack of voice form another side to achieve your dirty puporse of cheating people on alleged and never happened armenian genocide lies. If you want to learn more about armenian lies, I have put the link below in the armenian lies section, you can see it. I am taking it to the arbitration unless you bring back the tag.

<p>Ok, I've been through the whole thing, see: User:FrancisTyers/Armenian Genocide. I would say that there are still certain "issues" with the text, but I can't fix them as I don't know enough about the subject. One thing that it is <i>sorely</i> missing is inline citations. Stuff like <i>It is believed that most of these were soon executed</i> with a citation would be bad enough, but without a citation shows a significant bias. <i>Who</i> believes this? The discussion about "deportation" is misplaced, as is the comparison with Japanese during WWII, the modern term I think would be <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internally_displaced_person.html" title="Internally displaced person">internally displaced person</a>. If you think its worth me continuing I'll go through and add fact tags to the parts that, in my opinion, are in dire need of citation.

<dl>
<dd>The lack of citations is an issue of citing and not POV. I don't think the article needs to suffer from a glaring POV tag just because of that. I believe adding fact tags should suffice. Fadix is more knowledgable on this, but I believe "deportations" is the most common term used in literature with respect to the "displacements." Plus, it is somehow accurate, since we are talking about moving people from one part of a multi-part empire (Armenia, i.e. the homeland lf the people) to another part (Syria).--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 19:26, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would agree that the citation is a matter of {{verify}} and not {{neutrality}}, however the two are interlinked in some way, for example it is POV to say <i>It is believed that most of these were soon executed</i>, it is not POV to say <i>Scholars at the Kyrgyz State Institute of Genocide Historians believe that most of these were soon executed</i> (purely random example). The deportation thing doesn't really matter, just that whole paragraph is clunky. Although this is not necessarily a problem for the NPOV tag.

<p><strike>Hi my armenian friend. I don't blame you for your unconditional belief in the never happened happening of the pseudo armenian genocide as this has been and is the official line of the armenian church which has used the genocide to mobilize armenians aroudn one issue, chosen Turks as a scapegoat (not without reason I will come to the reason later)and prevent their assimiliation within western societies. They have definatly been successful in this.</strike></p>
<p><strike>However, the alleged armenian genocide has no parallel to the Jewsih genocide that happened in late 1930s and 1940s. The Jewsish were persecuted by Germans just because they were Jewsih, to acclaim Jewsih belongings and without any ressistance and uprising from Jewsih. They were killed without discrimination. In the case of the armenian issue, what we see is the systematic fighting by armenian militia and fundamentalist groups against Turkey, killins of hundreds of thousands of Kurds and Turks and the real threat to the very existence of Turks and Turky in Anatolia. This has happened thanks to the flow of millions of francs and dollars from the West and the Russian army supplies and you know this better than me. Then Turkey takes measures, kills milita and deports armenians who are used by Western empires to weakenn Turkey and kill Turks, Kurds and muslims.</strike></p>
<p><strike>NOw the Turksih arhchives are open and anybody can see them. You can find the list of killed Azerbaijanis, Kurds and Turks by armenian milita and terrorists in this official web site of the Turksih arhicves department. <a href="http://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/kitap/" class="external free" title="http://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/kitap/" rel="nofollow">http://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/kitap/</a> The number is roughly around 500,000. how this can be compared to Jewsih genocide, which unconditioanally happened, there are facts and these were documented and everybody knows it. But somewhow it happens that only countries which try to use the pseudo "armenian genocide" issue are chrstian states, not a single mostly muslim country has recognized this alleged genocide, where the Jewsih genocide is remembered in all coutnries includin mostly muslim coutnries such as Azerbaijan, Turkey, Usbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tataristan and etc. These are facts my armenian friend, not lies or falsifed facts presented by christian missionaries and the armenian church. Why you don't tell the world how you have killed 500,000 Kurds, Turks and Azerbaijanis. The list is available from the web site I sent to you, not to mention the barbaric killing methods of armenians. --<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.195.182.195.html" title="User:71.195.182.195">71.195.182.195</a> 19:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strike>There were more than 900 thousand Armenians who had been recorded as refugees from Ottoman Empire and surviving WWI. What is called "estimates" above are based on a CLAIMED number of 2.5 million Ottoman Armenians being alive before WWI. After subtracting remaining (about) 1 million Armenians from the CLAIMED number of 2.5 Million Ottoman Armenians we are left with "1.5 million Armenians were killed". Turkey has never denied a large number of its Armenian population lost their lives, from all kinds of reasons including famine and murder. But, Turkey also dares to say, so did Turks and Kurds. An excellent source on Ottoman Armenians, going through official Ottoman population records is a book by American historian Prof. Justin McCarthy, titled "Muslims and Minorities: The Population of Ottoman Anatolia and the End of the Empire," New York, New York University Press, 1983. A summary can be found in (<a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/yayinlar/yayin1/4-McCarty(65-85).pdf)" class="external free" title="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/yayinlar/yayin1/4-McCarty(65-85).pdf)" rel="nofollow">http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/yayinlar/yayin1/4-McCarty(65-85).pdf)</a> WWI ended in 1919, for Ottomans, when they surrendered. As you notice, the title of this section reads "1914 to 1923". Why 1923? Because the Armenian propagandists would love to extend their claimed sufferings until the foundation date of modern Turkish Republic (1923). This should be another example on how far the Armenian side can go by "playing with numbers."</strike></p>

<dd><strike>1) There was no Armenian "Army" prior to 1917 (and its actions were almost exclusivly in defense of Yerevan province which was then part of greater Russia and later in defense of the first Armenian Republic from attack by Turkish troops after WWI - when we speak of the Armenian Genocide we primarily speaking of the events surounding the round up and murders of Armenian civilians under orders of the Ottoman Turkish state that occured in the 1915/16 period. 2) Any issue of Turks killed by Russians is a matter of concern when discussing military events of WWI - much as we might discuss German casualties when talking about battles such as Stalingrad in WWII. Neither are directly associated with either the Holocaust or Armenian Genocide itself respectively. 3) Antolian Armenians responded to draft call ups and enlisted in the ottoman Military where they were forced into work gangs and eventually slaughted. Many Armenians did resist being called up and hid or otherwise fled. Many Turks and Kurds and such did the same. It is no secret that gangs of Turkish and Kurdish deserters terrorized villages in the Eastern provinces during the war acting as bandits. Some Armenians did as well. However this whole claim of Armenian "gangs" creating so much havoc during this period is highly overblown (instances were small scale and localized at best) and is the result more of Turkish anti-Armenian propoganda at the time then any real issue. Much of the stories told by Turks now of relatives being killed by Armenian "gangs" relates to revenge murders that occured by Armenians who escaped the Genocide and fought Turks after 1917. Even "monuments" to such things in Eastern Turkey today that i have visited attest to this fact. 4) there was in fact armed resitance by Jews in the Warsaw and Lodz ghettos in WWII as well as Jews who fled Germany and the other occupied nations and joined the armies of those opposing Germany - much as many Armenians did...does this equally justify the genocide commited against each of these peoples?--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 04:20, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</strike>

<dd><strike>I disagree with you, erhan. Turks killed by Armenian partisans has nothing to do with the planned murder of Armenian civilians. If you want to talk about Armenian uprisings, talk about it on the relevant WWI page. But don't try and deflect attention away from the brutality of what happened to the Armenians by talking about that sort of stuff. Ref women fighting. Perhaps they fought to protect their homes from Turkish soldiers that were planning to rape them - who knows? But it still isn't relevant. In any case, what gave Turks the right to tell Armenians what to do? You're just condoning brutal imperialism if you're implying that if a subject race doesn't do what the ruler says it's legitimate to wipe them out.

You mean ottoman empire requested different things from armenians as compared to turks? A facist request? What about raping turkish woman they were also woman there were no difference. These kind of things are happening in all war in history and nobody knows if it is true. You mean that turks were facist and hating armenians and raped them?

<dd><strike>You are most incredibly misinformed - what can I say? Most sad. First this claim of 500,000 Turks killed by Armenians is at best just laughable. I believe that discussions of the pityfuly fabricated documentation which are used to support such figures has already been extensively discussed and exists in the archives here. Consider this - in an interview apearing in the Turkish paper Radikal on Oct 9 2000 Turkish scholar Halil Berkety answered this question the following way: <i>What were the losses of the Muslim population in that area during this same period? They may be 10,000 or 20,000. But it's not a question of `They only killed a few, and the Ottomans killed a lot'. The issue is as follows: The activities of the Armenian guerrilla bands were generally localized, small-scale, and isolated. But for hundreds of thousands to die, there would have to be a population of this size, which couldn't be attained merely by wandering around the villages and hamlets. In addition, it's deceptive to turn the matter into a question as to whether or not Enver and Talat Pasha gave a written order to the `Yesil' or Catli of the day. They never did so, and no such document will ever be found. In this regard, the witnesses of the day are extremely important. There is a huge body of eyewitness accounts and visual material concerning the Armenian incidents that never reaches the Turkish public. Turkish public opinion is essentially ignorant of what the people of Germany, England, France, and America see and read.</i> There has been much discussion here already of CUP/Ottoman Turkish intent to commit genocide on the Armenians - and of course there is a great body of scholarly evidence and eyewitness testimony which supports such contentions. And there can be no comparison between the massive state sponsored campaign to wipe out an entire group of people and the actions of some disorganized Armenian "gangs' who may have roamed about the countryside (much as Circassian and Kurdish "gangs" were doing at the very same time and before...) Likewise I should point out (and have recently) the parallels between Holocaust denial and Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide - a great many of the exact same arguments are used - including the fact that each nation was beset by a multi-front war (the fact that each nation was the agressor is never mentioned I should add) and that each nations could not spare the resources for genocide...yet somehow they did - and we know how in great detail - so such generalities as you make cannot be used to effectively deny what is well known. Lastly your comments reflect your ignornace not only of the Armenian Genocide and of WWI but of WWII as well - particularl concerning the state of the German Army at the start of the war. And the similaritiesbetwen the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide are too numerous and great for you to deny such based on your pathetic gibberish. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 06:16, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>Some further exerpts from the Oct 9 2000 interview of Halil Berktay that should be of interest (concerning orders to kill Armenians) - Berktay: <i>At that time there were 1 million and 750 thousand Armenians living in Eastern Anatolia. The deportation order issued by the ruling military triumvirate was drawn up so as to include all the Armenians in the region, without exception. These things are documented in writing. There was no mention of massacres or slaughter. The provincial governors and garrison commanders were directed to deport the Armenians to the region south of Turkey's current borders. However, it's clear that, in addition to these official orders, separate, non-written orders were given to the most rapacious members of the `Teskilat-i Mahsusa' (`Special Organization'), who worshipped violence and were not bound by adherence to any normal moral code. For the Armenians to be killed? Yes. Historian Taner Akcam has demonstrated this in a very sound way. There was on the one hand a legal decision and implementation, and on the other another mechanism entirely that proceeded in an illegal manner.</i> --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 06:26, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike>I always thought the Turkish version was not exactly the same and therefor trusted those sources using Gurun's book Turkish version as references <a href="http://www.kulturturizm.gov.tr/portal/default_de.asp?belgeno=3253" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kulturturizm.gov.tr/portal/default_de.asp?belgeno=3253" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, [www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/24041915/index.html], <a href="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/ES/BelgeGoster.aspx?4C64CBA40EAEACBDAAF6AA849816B2EF26F852CBE7BDEC0D" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/ES/BelgeGoster.aspx?4C64CBA40EAEACBDAAF6AA849816B2EF26F852CBE7BDEC0D" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://turkishresponse.com/francais/24041915/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://turkishresponse.com/francais/24041915/index.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>...</strike></p>
<p><strike>But the official Turkish version has been presented by Esat Uras and is indeed 2,345 (Uras E., Tarihte Ermenliler ve Ermeni Meselesi, 2nd ed., (Istanbul, 1976), p.612). This figure is also in other Turkish publications, like Cem Akaş article, who quote Dr. Heinrich Pudor in Belgelerle Ermeni Sorunu; Genelkurmay, Ankara (1983); p.168. <a href="http://www26.brinkster.com/cemakas/armenian.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www26.brinkster.com/cemakas/armenian.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, but it seems has been replaced by 'soldiers' in the English version, can anyone check if it is present in Guruns Turkish version and that the translation like in the cases of Uras work?</strike></p>
<p><strike>In any cases, this number is present in Turkish government websites as I have shown above, I will replace the source with Uras. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:43, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<dd><strike>I see from reading some of the above you had a large hand in composing this article. If you trust "Turkish government websites" so much, then your entire article needs to be revised. It is obvious 2,345 Armenians were not all arrested on April 24. Lepsius confirmed the 235 figure in 1921, and Peter Balakian exaggerated only a little with 250 in The Burning Tigris. Let us refer to your partisan sources <a href="http://www.cgs.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ws/sympo_040327/sympo_040327_Hofmann.english.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cgs.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ws/sympo_040327/sympo_040327_Hofmann.english.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, Tessa Hofmann and Taner Akcam, for what may appoximate the truth: "From April 24, 1915 hundreds of Armenians were arrested... According to the Turkish scholar Akcam, the total figure of arrests is 2,345." (In other words, 2,345 may be the total of all, "from" April 24 and not "on" April 24.)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>Please read the article before your edition, it present both figures, this has nothing to do with if I believe it or not. German records also present figures of 30 thousand Armenians evacuated from the Capital city. It already says several hundreds which includes the statistics in the hundreds, (like the one of 235, or the 300 or even the claimed 600), for those reasons I don't see why I needed to refer to a version that present nothing new to the several hundreds already included there. Also, keep in mind that the Turkish version is the original one. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:28, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</strike>

<dd><strike>Another thing, the figure of 2,345 is said to represent April 24, so it can not be said to be representing a total after the increase of 235.

<p><strike>I am not sure of the source or applicability of the 2,000+ figure in this case however let me make a few points. On the night of April 24 1915 there was a documented round up of 235 prominant Armenians from Istanbul. These individuals were taken away together (though seperated and sent to at least two different destinations en route). At the same time and on or around this same date - a great number of other Armenian civil leaders and political activists and other prominant citizens were rounded up and taken away in cities throghout Anatolia. Additionally this process continued in Istanbul and other cities throghout the following years until 1918 and Turkey's surrender from the war and the CUP abdication. This policy and strategy to round up intellectuals and community leaders - to severe the head of the nation as it were - is a clear sign that the Turks were planning the "final solution" to the "Armenian Question" - ensuring that even if the Ottoman Government failed in the war (as was looking very likely when these round-ups began) and even if the CUP policy to eliminate the Armenians were not to fully suceed before war's end - the Armenian leadership would be destroyed and the Armenian people would have no voice and no hope of quickly reconstituting and being able to articulate themselves and petition for relief from Ottoman Turkish oppression. Of course the presentation should be accurate in terms of numbers - where exact numbers can be known (and who cares what Turkish propoganda claims other then to know and understand how the Turks attempt to continue the Armenian Genocide through denial and distortion). What is important to convery - IMO - is the reasoning behind this action of eliminating the Armenian leadership and educated inteligencia and leading represetnatives of Armenian culture and arts. The motives of the CUP to eliminate such a thing as the Armenian nation begins with these acts - is made evident by such acts. This needs to be properly illustrated and explained.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 14:13, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>
<dl>
<dd><strike>You are interpreting what those numbers means, but the fact of the matter is that there are many different set of numbers and I decided to present them without interpreting what they mean. Blissmiss, add Gurun books English version, like I told you, if you think it is relevent. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:16, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dl>
<dd><strike>Not having read the specific source material I don't know what each of these numbers represents - what whoever has put them foreward believes they represent. My point is that the act of rounding up these Armenian leaders (civil, cultural, political etc) was done for a purpose. For readers to understand the Armenian Genocide and how the Turks enacted it - they need to understand the process by which the CUP/Ottoman authorities disenfranchised the Armenian community/nation. These roundups - and the initial round up, arrest, improsonment, torture and murder of these notable Armenians was done with specific intent and purpose. Understanding this and how these acts fit into the larger scheme of enacting genocide - specifically of course the Armenian Genocide - is what needs to be conveyed. It matters not if it were 200 or 2000 - the intent and the result was the same. That scholars of the Armenian Genocide rely on certain records or historical accounts and that Turkish denialists claim otherwise is perhaps another interesting footnote - but in my mind - of lesser significance then properly explaining to what effect these arrests and murders had on the Armenian community - Anatolian wide and specifically for the Armenian communities in Istanbul and in all the other towns and cities where such round ups preceeded deportations of the now leaderless population. Additionally - and this fact also cannot be ignored - is that the Turks very specifically were concerned that the Armenian community be decapitated not only to blunt resistance to the murderous Genocide being enacted - but to ensure that Armenians would remain leaderless and deprived of cultural stand outs for the generation following. All essentail elements to the genocide. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 00:07, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike><a name="NPOV" id="NPOV"></a></strike></p>
<h2><strike><span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></strike></h2>
<p><strike>I wonder if it will ever be possible to get a NPOV on this article. The problem begins with the very title: <i>Armenian Genocide</i>. Since the dispute centers on whether one should call this a genocide, it seems that the very first sentence should make it clear that scholars have not agreed on whether this tragic event is better described as <i>intercommunal violence</i> or <i>genocide.</i></strike></p>
<p><strike>I notice that Justin McCarthy is in the references, but he is not mentioned in the text. Bernard Lewis is mentioned nowhere. These are not minor scholars, their opinion is respected and it matters what they think. We will not achieve a NPOV by ignoring them.</strike></p>
<p><strike>Perusal of the talk pages suggests that many contributors consider this event as identical in nature to the Holocaust. This is an unfortunate association, since it marks those who would try to present the Turkish view of events as similar to Nazis and Holocaust deniers. We must try to understand the Turkish perspective, not unthinkingly condemn it, since only in that way can we achieve a NPOV.</strike></p>
<p><strike>I think the article can be improved in several significant ways, and I have these suggestions:</strike></p>
<ul>
<li><strike>An article this contentious should provide a citation for every assertion. As it stands today, the first citation appears in the 11th paragraph. That wouldn't be acceptable even for a sophomore history paper, and it certainly isn't acceptable for something this important.</strike></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strike>In the same way that the articles on religion avoid inflammatory words such as "fundamentalist" we should avoid inflammatory words such as "Holocaust," "revisionist," "propagandist," etc. I see that in fact some editors have done good work in this direction, but clearly more needs to be done.</strike></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strike>There is almost nothing here about the number of Muslim and Jewish casualties. There is excellent published work on this issue--Justin McCarthy might be the best source. We need to show that we are just as concerned about the death of a Moslem or Jew as we are about the death of a Christian.</strike></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strike>A serious article like this should shed frivilous vanity items like "Armenian Genocide in Pop Culture."</strike></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd><strike>McCarthy should definitly be included in the article, as well as an article on revisionism, this is what it is called and McCarthy himself consider himself as a revisionist and he repeated it during the 11th Turkish Congress of History as well as during an ATAA conference. So, I don't see why the term revisionism can't be used when not only its definition apply, but that even those that are called such do not deny doing just that.</strike></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><strike>Secondly, the inclusion of McCarthy should have more spaces than this article could permit it, and for this reason he should be largely included in an article about what is termed denial as well as the way McCarthy has been answered by the academia.</strike></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><strike>This article is about the Armenian losses, I don't see why Muslim or Jewish losses should be included here, other communities like the Assyrians who were destroyed are even not included.</strike></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><strike>As for the citations, there will be citations and a lot of work has been done to make this article close to an OK article.</strike></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><strike>And finally, I don't think you are getting exactly what the NPOV policy is really about. For exemple, you claim that scholars have not agreed of either or not it is intercommunial violence or genocide... I hope that if you are knowledgeble enought of McCarthy you are also knowledgeble enought that what you said above is simply not accurate. For exemple, one of the two scholars you present, Lewis, before his History department has been financed by Turkey, he termed in his book what Armenians faced as Holocaust, and when Israel Charny and others have requested him to provide the sources of his research that made him change his mind and declare that it was not a genocide, he didn't answer. Even McCarthy recognize that most scholars do support the thesis of genocide, Halacoglu and other such scholars call this thesis an international lie, to be considered an international lie, the thesis in question should be supported 'internationally.'</strike></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><strike>But there again, the evidences that really made me believe that you don't get what NPOV is all about is when you question the title of the article, for now I will assume good faith, but if you read Wikipedia policies perhaps you will understand why it was an exercise for me to assume good faith there. If you research the Holocaust and Genocide Studies journal, the second most reffered genocide is the Armenian genocide, it is called such, that it happened or not does in no way change the fact that it is an expression that is more than notable, in fact, it is very notable.</strike></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><strike>And finally, you say that we should try understanding Turkish perspective, this is not the job of Wikipedia, Wikipedia present and do not try to understand perspectives. The Turkish government has a section, also on the introduction of the article its position is made clear, but the Turkish government can not have equal space, or the minority of Western scholars such as McCarthy can not have as much space as the majority position. -Fad(ix)</strike></dd>
</dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><strike>Hello Anthon, I don't understand the difference between a Turkish position regarding the Armenian genocide and a neo-Nazi position regarding the Holocaust? You didn't elaborate much. In addition, there are revisonist scholars who deny the Holocaust who are ten times more reputable than McCarthy and Lewis combined. David Irving comes to mind. Revisionists can be scrutinized in a separate article, such is the case with Holocaust revisonists. The same should apply here. --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 00:11, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>Eupator - you are correct - both Holocaust and Genocide deniers make the very same claims concerning the victims of the respective genocides. Each dispute the death counts, causes of death and intent and observed actions/eyewitness testimony and each claim that their is a conspiracy of lies against Germans/Nazis (of WWII) and Turks/CUP/Ottomans (of WWI)...each (falsely) claim that genocide claims are propoganda and each uses this - Germans lost more and Turks lost more during this period then the minority groups (ignoring the fact of war and that their nations were the agressors and lost people due to the harsh conditions of war and that minority losses were largely due to very specific observed and documented [horifying] campaigns against them). In each case they ignore the mountains of evidence that the governments sponsored a mass killing campaign - (and against all evidence) claiming that their nations' were involved in all encompassing multi front wars and could never spare the resources to do such a thing - of course they even (again falsely and contrary to all evidence) dispute that there was intent or motivation. The only real difference of course is that most of the world (exept rabid Jew haters) fully accepts the Holocaust and believes that deniers are just either crack pots or haters and confers no legitimacy on such - when inj the Turkish case - denial is state policy and is supported by massive state funds. Of course the Turks of today continue to repeat the state propoganda of the period and teach such to their children and population and the myths are perpetuated. The reason that denial persists on such a mass scale among Turks but not among Germans is that after WWII Germany was totally defeated and the Nazis were ruined and utterly discredited. The Germans were forced to admit their crimes and repent - where the Turks - through Ataturk's nationalistic revolution - managed to hold off the weary Entente powers from exercising dominion over the core of the Ottoman EMpire after the war and stave off attempts at International justice/prosocution (which was an entirely new concept - never before suggested or tried - BTW) - and this is reflected in the final Lussaunne treaty (which BTW the US never did sign) - where the Turks were able to exert tremendous political pressure to eradicate all mention of the Armenians and others killed by the CUP. Likewise the new nationalist government which formed the Republic of Turkey was largely made up of ex-CUP memebers (could anyone imagine a post-war Germany governed by ex-Nazis?). This fact and the particulars of the Republic of Turkey's nation building myth - where Turks were seen (by themselves) as victims of Imperialist machinations against the Ottoman Empire (and with the Armenian's situation neatly fitting into this created history - thus "Armenians stabbed Turks in the Back" and "Armenians were just the pawns of the Imperialist powers out to destroy the Ottoman EMpire" etc) - one can see how they have been able to elude justice and continue to avoid comming to terms with their responsibility in the tragedy of the Armenians. Over the years - as Armenian groups have increased their pressure in both academic and political circles - it has become increasingly difficult for Turkey to out and out deny that the CUP/Ottomans ever deliberatly killed any Armenians - so their denial has gone from outright to the making of (unture and utimatly unsupportable)excuses - such as "the killings were mutual" and "armenians also commited a genocide against Turks" and "it was war and Ottomans never meant to kil Armenians - but Turks died too as the conditions were so bad and maybe some lawless types took matters into their own hands but one cannot blame the government" and "we are not the same Turks - how can we be held responsible" etc - and of course now - with the availability of more balanced information (for Turks - both in print and via the internet...) and with the pressure of European Union acssession - the Turks are modifying their stance again - to admit more - though not any more then they have too. In the meantime Armenians have had to live with 91 years of denial and pain and Turkey's shameful denial - which includes destruction of Armenian heritage in Anatolia and obliteration of all traces of Armenian presence and contributions within the Ottoman Empire (and prior) - and these things continue and are allowed to do so. Thus the tremendous importance that informational sites such as this get it right and refuse to give in to further outrageous and wrong Turkish attempts at denial. No one would stand for it concerning the Holocaust and no one should stand for it here! --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 14:01, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>First of all, you were free to vote on the poll, no one prevented you to discuss with others and get the support to vote. Second of, I refrained myself to vote and tried to not influence people to vote to remove it. And finally, if this article was placed to be a featured article candidate, I would refuse it myself because there still is many work left to get the quality needed. But only a minority of the articles here in Wikipedia are featured, and there are some that are featured that I'd consider still slightly POV. From the non-featured articles only a minority has a POV tag. Furthermore, you still seem to not understand when the totally disputed tag should be added, that the tag about POV should be maintained, I have no comment about that I just accept the result of the vote, but I would totally reject the uses of the totally disputed tag because it does not fit there and that you still push to get that tag there either suggest that you do not understand why it is used, either there is an ill intend behind it. I will not go as far as Thoth there, because I oppose to his position for many reasons, but that every claims in this article are indeed official claims is not a matter of dispute, what is a matter of disputed is if this article maintains a neutral language, but suppose that it does not, this in no way justify alone questioning the factuality. Because Wikipedia policies are clear there, Wikipedia present positions and NOT facts, so the only way that a factuality dispute could emerge is if I claim that someone maintains a position which he does not maintain. If you can present such an evidences comming from the article, I will be the first to add the factuality disputed tag, if you can't just please stop wasting the time of the editors this article is vanadlised and spammed very often and we don't need a veteran to revert because he refuse to adhere to the community decision. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:04, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>I agree with the poster above that the NPOV tag should not have been removed. While I don't think a "totally disputed" tag may be necessary, I feel that the NPOV tag that was here until February should remain for the time being. As evidenced by the continuing debate on this page, I think the neutrality of the tone of the article continues to be an issue for some people. They may not be a majority of the posters here (and therefore may not be able to win a community vote); however, a majority vote is not a prerequisite for keeping or removing an NPOV tag. The concerns with the article that some people still have can be addressed by keeping the tag for the time being. Shelby28 23:01, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</strike>
<dl>
<dd><strike>Fair enought, but the main problem here is that all those who have opposed the removal of the tag have requested things that are contrary to Wikipedias policies, that the article generate controversies on the talk page is not alone evidences of a nonrespect of the NPOV policy. The question here is, do the article give an opinion or present positions? If the article has sections that do not present positions but rather provide opinions or established facts, I would like you see those sections and trying to improve them. I really wish to improve the quality of the article, but when people want a tag included because the articles name is 'Armenian Genocide' rather than 'so-called Armenian Genocide' or that the article doesn't give half of the space to the official Turkish government position, the request is not serious. Again, either you help us track those POV so that we can improve them, either you criticise the article without helping us much. There is no question that I will ignore Coolcat, we've been there and the guy want something such: "This claimed genocide is disputed, many support the thesis that there was a genocide and many others don't..." And then, go on deleting nearly all the sections about the special organization etc., or deleting who maintains what position, which clearly would be to POVize the article, because those adhering to a position should be included..., you can not delete from one side and present a 50-50 coverage and claim that this is what is NPOV as CoolCat claims.<a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:59, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</strike>

<dd><strike>I'm not saying that the NPOV tag be added simply because Cool Cat says so; I do feel as, as FrancisTyers expresses below, that the article still has numerous POV issues and needs the tag. He brings up several good exampes which also caught my eye. For example, instead of "A growing list of countries, as discussed below, have officially recognized...." in the first paragraph, how about "Some countries"? Or 'Twenty-four countries" (That's the number of countries given later in the article with official recognizition) I can bring up other examples as well to help. I also feel that instead of posters here getting into a revert war with Cool Cat over a "totally disputed" tag, a compromise could be to just add the NPOV tag the article had earlier, to address the issues that others still have with the article. If nobody else wants to add it back, I can, although my intention isn't to get into an editing dispute with anyone. Shelby28 01:59, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike>Personally I think that the {{neutrality}} tag should be readded. I made some suggestions earlier and even went through and neutralised the article somewhat but most of the suggestions were ignored. Here are five glaring examples:</strike></p>
<ul>
<li><strike><i>A growing list of countries, as discussed below, have officially recognized and accepted its authenticity as Genocide.</i></strike></li>
<li><strike><i>Over the next 15 years the Armenians began to feel that perhaps they might one day be free from the weakening rule of the Ottoman government.</i></strike></li>
<li><strike><i>Some records suggest that the Ottoman troops escorting the Armenians as a matter of course not only allowed others to rob, kill, and rape the Armenians, but often participated in these activities themselves.</i></strike></li>
<li><strike><i>Enver Pasha's response to his crushing defeat at the Battle of Sarikamis was, in part, to blame the Armenians.</i></strike></li>

<p><strike>FT's points seem valid and should be looked into. However that does NOT mean the tag should be put back in. As I have pointed out, if every article that needed sorting out/was disputed had a NPOV tag we wouldn't get anywhere. If this page had stayed as it is for months I could understand. However given that certain issues have only just been raised, I think that it is fair to give us all time to address those issues. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 02:45, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<p><strike>To not do so - to not accept the Armenian Genocide as a genocide and to not accept the overwhelmingly corraborated acounts that prove it as such is just ignoring the truth and would be wrong. BTW - the proper term for this is denial...Oh and BTW - we have been here before...you may recall the posts that include the definitions of such, the affirmations by the International Association of Genocide scholars and oh BTW the FACT that Raplph Lemkin specifically coined the term to describe what before had no name - and the mass murders and destruction of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire of 1915 was the catalyst for such. Do you dispute any of these contentions? If so then I claim you are setting an unreachable standard for truth - and thus we must slap a POV/disputed not proven fact on the Holocaust article and just about every other historical article.

<dd><strike>Yes we have been here before - and then - as well as now - it is aparent that you are here to do anything in your power to prevent the truth of the Armenian Genocide from being presented. We have posted and referenced more then sufficient official positions (from organizations such as the International Organization of Genocide Scholars and others) and cited specific scholarly works and mentioned the overwhelming eyewitness documentary evidence - including the observations of the Germans operating within the Ottoman Empire during this period - that uncategorically prove that what was done to the Armenian by the Ottoman Turks during this period was indeed a genocide. So will you just get over it already. Denial of genocide is a crime in some places...and you are a denier. Anyone who denys that there was an Armenian Genocide is just plain wrong - either through ignorance - either willful or otherwise - or because of deliberate special agenda. Denial - in general - and concerning the Armenian Genocide in specific is a known thing. It is not POV - it is also factual. There is no legitimate position - none whatsoever - that includes denial of the Armenian Genocide. Including such positions - other then referencing them as denial and other then discussing the merits - or lack therof concerning specific points being made - is doing an incredible diservice to truth and accuracy and is giveing a platform to denialists. I have stated before that I think the article as written has great faults and I am in favor of presenting a broader picture of the Armenian genocide which puts it in context with surounding events and that I believe more explanation concerning the causes of the Genocide and the motivations of those who enacted it is in order. But I simply cannot accept that denial of the Armenian Genocide is a legitimate perspective and that such contentions should be given a platform in articles such as this. I need to check the article on Christianity to see if the Aetheist viewpoint is given equal time. If so perhaps indeed I do not understand what Wikipedia is hoping to accomplish here. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:13, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike>Cool Cat, FrancisTyers and Shelby28 all seem to agree that there are legitimate grounds to dispute the neutrality of parts of this article. While there are those who dispute this, I think it would be straining a bit to deny that there is a legitimate dispute here and that the reasonable objections should be settled by consensus before it is removed.

<p><strike>I am going to insert a "NPOV" tag.

<dd><strike>All fine and good - but what you do not seem at all to appreciate is that for certain Turks and those wedded to the Turkish denialist position - there will never be any acceptable presentations to the Armenian Genocide - the fact that they are even objecting to the classification of such as a genocide is most tellign here. We have presented more then enough evidence on these talk pages to make the categoriczation of these events as genopcide indisputable - yet they still dispute and discount these most highly regarded sources. Likewise - to assert that the denialist position merits equal time is absurd - and that is the gist of the claim of NPOV. Otherwise the specific objectins that I have read here of late do not amont to a true assertion of NPOV - they are more just semantics. So really now - is the position which denies the Armenian Genocide as a genocide truly legitimate (other then explaining who claims such and why?) Outside of such being denial of genocide is there really any argument here? Even if the Turkish claims of Armenian "gangs" killing Turks were true as presented (and they are not) - would this still truly superceed all evidence from eyewitnesses and all scholarly documentaion of such that proves - beyond a doubt that the Armenian Genocide indeed took place and that it was indeed a genocide? I think not. There is no legitimate basis for this article to be termed NPOV. Neither is there any legitimate basis for the Turkish government's shameful denilaist postion to be included at anything approaching equal weight with the known and near universally accepted position that the Armenain genocide did indeed occur and that it was clearly a genocide. And this is not the Armenian position - but the postion of scholars and academics and most governments worldwide (the latter perhaps apolitical issue more then one of fact - but a legitimate issue for discussion/presntation in a Wikipedia article on the Armenian Genocide). There is no more room to debate this or to include denial in this article as there would be in an article concerning the Holocaust or any other commonly accepted historical event. The only difference is the organized and government sponsoored campaign of denial that has adherents (that are overwhemingly Turkish or Turkish related). In providing these denialist equal time - we are doing a great diservice to not only Wikipedia - but humanity. And by treating this article differnt then the others - where crackpot denilaits and haters are not allowed to disrupt and distort the truth - we are allowing the deniers to suceed in their mission and we are giving these ugly forces a platform to present their distorted and distasteful views. I think this is a grave mistake. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:38, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

There are changes to be made, but I doubt that some people will ever be satisfied with this article until it is watered down to the point where a reader might actually think the Turks did nothing wrong and it was all the Armenians' fault. This article should not be turned inside out just to placate denialists and Turkish nationalists, just as the Nanking Massacre article should not be full of Japanese denial and the Holocaust page have half devoted to the rants of Neo-Nazis and anti-Semites. Tony, you and the other staff are going to have to accept that this page is about discussing the Armenian Genocide and not giving room to people trying to disprove it. Otherwise the article will never become stable.

Heads of State such as in Iran do such as well. These views are equally as valid (or not) as those who dispute the Armenian Genocide and if it is Wikipedia's position that the Turkish denialist concerning the Armenian Genocide be treated with equal weight to the truth - contrary to all evidence - then these deserve equal time as well.

According to the numbers given by the General Staff "800,000 Armenians and 200,000 Greeks died because of massacres and deportations, or in labor battalions" during the First World War. Y. H. Bayur, who transmits this information, says that "these figures should also be considered correct by our official sources". (Y. H. Bayur, The History of Reforms, Vol. III, Part IV, pg. 787). It may look amazing, but <b>the reality that what happened in 1915 was a mass murder was accepted by everybody having lived in that period, and was never the object of an argument</b>. Of course the word soykirim [genocide] (being a term belonging to the post World War II period) was not used in those days. To describe what had happened in 1915, words such as "katliam" [massacre], "taktil" [killings], "teb'id" [taking away, expulsion, expelling], "kital" [massacre] were used. <b>Mustafa Kemal has dozens of speeches in which he defines the treatments reserved to Armenians as "cowardice", or "barbarity", and names these treatments "massacre"</b>. In September 1919, the American General Harbord, who visited Mustafa Kemal in Sivas, says "he, too, disapproved the Armenian Massacre." According to Mustafa Kemal, "the massacre and deportation of Armenians was the work of a small committee who had seized the power" (see the above mentioned work of Rauf Orbay.) Again during the same period, in an interview given to the USA Radio Newspaper, he says, "we have no expansionist plan...we can give the guarantee that there will be no new barbaric deeds against Armenians." (Bilal Simsir, British Documents on Atatürk, Vol. I, pg. 171, Ankara 1973) In a telegram sent to Kazim Karabekir on 6 May 1920, he directs Kazim Karabekir to abstain from any initiative, meaning a new "Armenian Massacre". (Kazim Karabekir, Our War of Liberation, pg. 707) In a speech made on 24 April, he describes the treatments reserved to Armenians in 1915 as "cowardly".

<dd><strike>Coolcat - you and your objections are laughable. What I posted was a Quote from Taner Ackam who has written a number of well sourced books on this subject and indeed he has provided sources for the quotes. I am not posting any kind of book - in fact I have made effort to only post relevant exceprts that directly address your contention that there is some kind of reasonable doubt concerning the claim of genocide in the case of the Armenians. In fact there is no reasonable claim to the contrary. The evidence is overwhelming and is overwhelmingly accepted. The Turkish official position and that of the handful of scholars who support it has been refuted point by point and has been shown to be entirely specious. The citiations I have provided here and before make this most clear. The evidence of genocide is overwhelming and the pattern and specifics of the Turkish denial mimic almost to the point the denial of the Holocaust. Wikipedia should not be a forum to legitimize these false and misleading claims. The Armenian Genocide is well proven - is corraborated by an incredible amount of documented evidence - and its factualness is beyond question. So give it up already - you are looking increasingly shrill and trollish. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 21:42, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>The term "Armenian relocation" is entirely unacceptable and inappropriate. It would be like insisting that the Holcaust be given an alternative name such as "Jewish internment" to placate sensitivities of the Nazis. Everyone knows and acknowledges that their was a government sponsored campaign to eliminate both Jews and Armenians in their respective GENOCIDES. Any attempt to dillute this truth is denialism and is a falsehood. Wikipedia should not be promoting clearly false and misleading agendas. Of course the article on the Armenian genocide should reference and give examples or a link to a seperate (more detailed) article concerning Armenian Genocide denial (and perhaps efforts on the part of Armenians and by Holocaust and genocide scholars to achieve recognition of the Armenian Genocide in the face of the deliberate campaign of denial sponsiored by the Turkish Government). It is only in this light that the outright denial of the Armenian Genocide is legitimate as presentation material. As the denial campaign is so active and persistent it deserves acknowledgement and treatment. The history of this denial and of the specific positions and efforts by the Turkish Government and supporting scholars are legitimate subjects for presentation - however the specific refuted and irrelevant claims of the denialists do not deserve to be presented as a legitimate POV with any weight as a counter to the accepted facts of the Armenian Genocide. The denialist claims are as repugnent and fringe - from an academic and historical perspective - as any concerning the Holocaust. The Armenian Genocide is fact and there is nothing but heresay and misinformation to counter it. The essential elements of the known historical events and actions commited by the Ottoman Turks against their Armenian minority population clearly meet all definitions of genocide. This is proven again and again. We need to establish this as such here and move on to issues concerning the specific content of the article. There is no legitimate perspective that includes the view the Genocide of the Armenians did not happen. The evidence is crystal clear on this. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 22:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>How do you expect anyone to assume good faith after this? The picture is dated in 1918, and as I have already specified its source is: Armjanskij Central’nyj Komitet (Izd.): ,Al’bom’’ armjan’-bežencev’’. Tiflis (um 1918) There is no copyright on this picture we have discussed this with Cansin, and John Smith was there as well. In fact, both pictures I have loaded are two shut of the same scene. This is one example why I can not assume good faith with you, you come in and place the tag by ignoring the sourcing of those pictures and there can be no other interpretation than, you wanting to scrap all the pictures from the article. And before you start asking for "proves" that those pictures I have uploaded of Armenian burned near Mus are in fact Armenians, maybe you should read the footnotes of the article, S. S. McClure report the burnings of Mus, as well as The Ottoman commander of the third army affidavit containing this information about the burning near Mus. And as I have added, I opposed to the inclusion of the top picture on the article and I have already removed it in the past before it was reverted back. Also, know that if you remove the rest of the pictures(for the most part taken by Germans) I will replace them with sourced mass graves taken from the camps which are much worst than that. I wonder how you will request authentification that they are in fact Armenians, it will be hard for you to request that when most in the camps were Armenians and the rest Assyrians or Greeks etc. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:41, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike>

Were there Kurds and Turks deported by the Ittihadist government in those camps? If so, be glad to present any records that support that. The victims were classified as Armenians, and the pictures came from deportation cites. Of course there were among them Assyruans and Greeks, as there were Gypsies and war prisoners in the concentration camps and were also killed. But something is clear, and it is that the large majority were Armenians. As for the BS about what proves they are not Holocaust pictures.

<p><strike><br />
I have just reread the article in its entirety. I don't see how anyone can legitimatly claim that the article is POV or non-nuetral. In fact I think it more then covers the essential claims and elements of Turkish denial of the Genocide. In a longer article (perhaps in the article being proposed specifically concerning Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide - I would expect to see more concerning the evolution of the Turkish position from outright denial that it ever happened to the more current position that while Armenains may have died/suffered so did Turks - etc. Additionally I would expect to see more coverage of the major proponents of the official Turkish "position" and major incidents - such as the Heath Lowery affair - as well as other specifics - such as Turkish funding of Turkish Studies overseas and the role of those recieving these funds in promoting Genocide denial (and the pre-conditions Turkey attaches to their financial aid) etc warrent coverage. The role of the Turkish Government in stifling internal debate and access to information should also be presented - such things as laws forbidding affirmation of the Genocide and attempts on the part of the Turkish judiciary to enforce such as well as basic information concerning how the Turkish public educational system enforces teaching of its specific view denying that a genocide even occured and outright blaming the victims of such (Armenians) for inciting the violence. As for the current article itself - while it contains much accurate and useful information - it lacks a clear flow for the presentation and it is difficult to really understand the relevance and impact of the information presented. I think one area that is clearly lacking in the article is a presentation of the sources of the evidence for the Genocide - the corraborated eywitness accounts and the role of foreign government and missionaries stationed in the Ottoman EMpire in documenting the Genocide. I also feel that the historical context of the Genocide - some of the "why" questions has not been sufficietnly addressed. Likewise the major actors and the variety of means of killing are not clearly presented IMO. In general I find the presentation of the article to be sloppy and somewhat unproffesional and in need of much improvement. However I am reluctant to take on this task without some kind of agreed mandate to do such. I would not be satisfied making only minor changes - bandages on a flawed product. I think a total re-write and reorganization is in order. I disagree with much of the current article's emphasis. The Pamuk incident for instance fails to convey the important underlying issues surounding his indictal and the pop culture section regarding System of a Down is so down in the noise in terms of relvancy and importance I can't see it being included when there is far more relavent information missing. I think a timeline is vital for this as well - with major events and proclimations clearly highlighted - such as passing of the abandoned property act. etc Anyway this is my take on the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 22:28, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<dd><strike>&#160;? Face it the article is very poorly organized and written. I would love to contribute but unfortunatly my standards and approach are such that I cannot just do a sentance here or there - I am a conceptual thinker and I approach things in big chunks - thus it is nearly impossible for me to even concern myself with the minutia unless I am crafting an entire picture - it is just my way. I have however suggested topics which need to be better covered and I have provided some words which could potentially be used. However most of what I would do is reorganize and tell the story of what occured in a more coherent fashion with proper emphasis and background. I also feel that the weasle words used in the article dilute the message and make the article less then useful or even understandable. As written it is very difficult to gain any real understanding of the Genocide - in fact one can hardly even tell what a genocide is by the presentation and it certainly lacks real historical context - such as just why were Armenians victimized and why were the Turks driven to being so radical. Anyway - this article and the discussions here are so far from being anywhere close to approaching the issue correctly I really have little hope - but at least I can contribute to keep things honest and not let deniers get away with pushing BS without challenge. In the meantime I'll try not to cringe too much when I read the article - but unfortunatly - even though it does have much good information - the extremely amature and discoherent manner that it is arrranged and presented makes me do so...additionally, in my view there is a great deal of important fact and emphasis missing. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 05:53, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>Yes I agree with Fadix &amp; Eupator here. User Jester you really haven't read the article have you? Nor do you have any clue about anything concerning the Armenain Genocide or its denial. The 1.5 million claim - that is used by so many - first apeared in official (secret) German correspondence based on reports from Germans throughout Anatolia, and was essentially verified by other sources. Sure it is a rough number - but it seems that it was essentially accurate...though often one sees a variety of numbers from different reports and such - that there are differences arise for several reasons. First there is the issue of time period coverage - stricltly 1915/1916 or expanded from this (1914-1923 for instance). There are also issues regarding the geographical coverage of reported figures - just pertaining to numbers of Armenians in the Eastern provinces or do they pertain to Anatolia wide or do they even include Armenians who were killed in areas that are now in Iraq, Iran and in what is now Armenia itself - etc. Other confusion is attribution - do figures represent those directly killed or all those Armenians who died as a (direct or indirect) result of being uprooted, forced marched and exposed to the elements and diseases arising from proximity to the great numbers of dead bodies that were just left lying around in places and of course from starvation - as Armenians were givenlittle food and in fact often Turks were punished for feeding Armenians - etc I tend to think that based on likely population figures (accepted by foreign sources) the number who can be directly attributed to being killed by the Turks (or Kurds acting on behalf of the Turks etc) is at least 1.2 million (for the primary periodof the Genocide 1915-1916 for the entire region of Anatolia and areas under direct ottoman control. It seems that based on Ottoman records at least 800,000 (mostly women, children and elderly) were killed as a direct result of "deportation" with the rest likely being killed by other methods (firing squad or just mass slaughter etc) or otherwise dying from "deportation"/Genocide related conditions(and even some of course to general wartime conditions as the Turks like to claim...). Fadix has written an article (referenced in the main article) which speaks to various estimates of Armenian population numbers which could serve as a basis for understanding some of the numbers and percentages of population we are talkign about. In any event - as it is presented in the article - the number of deaths is not at all POV - this isn't the point of the dispute at all as far as I can see - though perhaps the number of Turks suposedly killed by Armenians - where some Turkish sources claim that 500,000 and now I am even seeing the 1 million claim in places - that were supposedly killed by Armenians. Of course these are entirely ludicrous and unsupportable claims - unlike the Armenian figures which are supported and corroborated by numerous diverse sources and not just by one set of doctored Ottoman accounts supplemented by I don't know - complete conjecture and wild immagination...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 06:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

Irrespective of your thoughts on this matter, there is a lot of debate going on as to whether the massacres constitute genocide (I dont see any such debate going on with the Holocaust deniers), the Armenians have put tremendous effort to provoke and vilify the Turks, you should maybe spend sometime just pondering through the sheer hate mail out there, it would probably take a life time to go through it. The point I am making is that the Armenians, through their aggressive behaviour have made it almost impossible to reconcile. Its not by provoking, intimidating, and, for a long while murdering Turks that they will get acceptance. On the contrary, it only embitters the other side. Furthermore, this whole debate is approached in a manner that is totally condescending to the vicitims of Armenian revolts, its as if their lives meant nothing compared to that of the Armenians. 06:57, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>I suggest for a moment that you consider the Armenian perspective on this issue for a moment before asking Armenians to sympathise with the Turkish one. While I can sympathise for the sufferings experienced by Turks during this period and earlier in other nearby places the issue of this article is the Armenian Genocide. I have always been one to advocate a more thorough treatment of the topic - including events and actions and such which led to the situation where the CUP/Ottomans succesfully commited a genocide against the Armenians. Regardless of the truth of the Turkish claims of Armenian insubordination (that I view as clearly being quite exaggerated and presented out of context and not in good faith) the Ottoman authorities and their agents enacted and carried out a genocidal campaign against the Armenians which suceeded in its objectives - and that is why we are here discussing and presenting this information. The evidence that supports this contention is overwhelming and irrefutable and is overwhelmingly accepted by the vast majority of scholars and historians and pretty much everyone but native Turks and Turkish government sponsored researchers. This is not the "Armenian position" any more then acceptance of the Holocaust can be termed strictly a "Jewsih position". You speak of reconcilliation...how can there be reconcilliation without truth? You speak of victims of Armenian "revolts" as if Armenians started the killings, started the repression, actually had power such as the Ottoman Government and the Kurds armed by such to terrorize and slaughter masses. That some Turks were killed by Armenian bandits and/or revolutionaries at some places and at some points in time is insufficient justification for the actions taken against the Armenian population of Anatolia at large. I suggest that you yourself are improperly informed concerning the real issues and history of the period and what went on prior to 1915. Your focus on and acceptance of the CUP racist propoganda of the time that continues to be repeated and dispersed by the Turkish government and media has caused you to fail to understand realities. The Armenian Genocide is fact. I cannot make you accept this if you choose to remain ignorant. And if you choose to remain ignorant I don't see any possibility of reconcilliation. Once you are ready to acknowledge the most basic and obvious historical truths - that the Armenians were (by definition) clearly subjected to a genocide by the Ottoman Turks - and that there was and could be no sufficient justification for such a thing - then we can talk. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 07:40, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

Its like telling a criminal that he should first acknowledge his crimes and then we can debate them with him. The genocide is not a fact, far from it, and there are plenty of reputable scholars and historians out there that question this very issue. The Armenians have through the years become so cunning in the art of intimidating those that question this issue, that its become almost impossible to approach it in an impartial manner. Its also inslulting that you trivialize the massacres commited by Armenians by making it sound that it was just a sporadic event with a few Turks killed here and there. Its again an example of the systematic dilution of the other side. I have serious doubts as to your impartiality on this issue.

<dd><strike>As I said sir - you are obviously both ignoring the facts of the overwhelming evidence that corraborates the accounts of genocide unconditionally and you are in acceptance of the rather spurious Turkish claims that Anatolian Armenians as a group ever commited any violence or rebellioneven remotely approaching what could be considered as justification for what was done to them. And you accuse me of lack of impartiality? Ha! To you Armenian claims of Genocide - even when fully backed up by overwhelming evidence and even when fully supported by the scholarly community except in a few very notable cases of scholars with proven agendas - is only "cunning and intimidation" on the part of Armenians is a clear indication of your bias/predjudice and exactly why there is no talking with one such as you. If a neo-Nazi or Holocaust denier (such as the president of Iran - Ahmdenejad) were to demand that the "facts" be investigated first (when they are all already pretty much known) we need not speculate what the response to such a denier would be - as we can see - And the Armenians deserve no less. Your claims are spurious and are stricly the respresentation of a denialist revisionist agenda. The only difference between you and your position and that of Holocaust deniers is that in the case of Armenian Genocide denial there is a concerted Turkish government campaign which actively leads the denial. We certainly can acknowledge that. As for Turksih losses - allegedly at the hands of Armenians - of course this is a subject that should be discussed. But in the manner that you propose - as some sort of a counter to the known facts of the genocide - sorry - it does not compute (and we have presented and discussed this time and time again). I would never thik to trivialize death - and as I have said - there were times when Armenian "gangs" "bandits" and/or "revolutionaries" did act to kill soem Turks - but no where near the numbers that are often claimed by certain Turkieh sources and not largely in the time or place that directly preseeds or occurs during the period of the Armenian Genocide. Additionally - to properly discuss these killings we must also discuss the repressive measures and massacres (of Armenians - and yes also of Turks - though primarily elsewhere and caused by others - not Armenians) that preceeded the Genocide and we must present the deteriorating conditions within the Ottoman EMpire and the motivations of the Young Turk leadership and forces within Ottoman Turkish society that led to distrust and eventual villianization of Armenians. likewise we need to present the attempts by Armenians for both outside redress to force reform within the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman countereaction (ussually massacre). The push by Armenians for reforms and the rise of more radical elements/thinking by some in the Armenian community in response to the increased repression and massacre resulting from reforms imposed on the Sultan from outside powers all should be properly discussed in their context. In the end - you and all will see that although some Armenians did kill Turks - these isolated killings were used more as a pretext by a paranoid and racist CUP party with an agenda of "Turkifying" and developing a "final solution" to the "Armenian problem" then for any real military reason - etc. There was no "civil war" as the Turkish government and its supporters now claim - the Armenians were overwhelming loyal and peaceful and did not resist or even act in any way to prevent their genocide - the eyewitness evidence corraborates this. Meanwhile Armenains were not only being set upon by Kurds and by gangs of chettes composed of recent emigrees into Anatolia from outlying areas (where they had been driven out by other Christians and thus brought with them a hatred for Armenian Christins which was fanned and supported by the Ottoman Government) - no not only did Armenains have to deal with these usual depridations (all well documented) but then they were subject to an additional sweeping, wisespread adn all encompassing campaign on the part of the Ottoman Turkish Governmenet to uproot and murder them - to annhilate them as a people - and remove all traces of them from Anatolia - and this is what occured - all evidence - eyewitness at the time - thousands of accounts - all observing and depicting the same thing - and of course the evidence afterward -where all the Armenains of Anatolai now? Are they all at this mythincal "deportation" point in the Syrian desert? No - we know full well what happened to them. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:35, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

Elsewhere (in the archives a ways back by now) I have posted more detail concerning the various events and forces that cause Armenians to be perhaps seen as a threat and certainly villianized by the CUP/Ottoman Turkish elite and of course there is much which can be discussed here...again...however...none of it changes the fact of what did occur to the Armenians (Genocide) at the direction of the CUP/Ottoman Turks.

Oh and yes - the "thesis of genocide" is overwhelmingly supported...that its neutrality (the presentation of such here in Wikipedia) is being questioned is more of a comment on the shameful institutionalized denial on the part of the Turks and your rabid - Turkey can do and never has done any wrong hyper nationalism and enforced ignorance then it is on the truthfulness of the Armenain Genocide and the accuracy of its portrayal here. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 23:37, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike>I feel it important that we recognize that by putting so strong a warning on a page, we're essentially saying that the information may not be reliable. The information remaining on thi page after such protracted discussions and edits is certainly not biased, especially in light of the supporting documents presented.</strike></p>
<p><strike>Yes, I'm half Armenian. My paternal grandparents were orphaned by the attempted Genocide. My grandparents were 7 or 8 years old when this happened, and most certainly were old enough to remember their parents being murdered.</strike></p>
<p><strike>To dismiss this incredible tragedy, or even cast any question upon its occurance, is to permit it, to encourage it to happen again. It has been reputed that Hitler used the very same logic to assure his close associates that the world would not care, that when challenged, he cited that the world hadn't stopped the Turks from killing Armenians, and neither would they stop him from exterminating the Jews. He very nearly got away with it, just as the Turks have managed to get away with their genocide attempt. It truly is the bane of mankind that we forget. In most cases, history is written by the victors, which certainly explains why even more substantial proof does not exist. But I can assure you, and sign affidavit, that my grandparents existed, that their parents were murdered by the forces behind the Armenian Genocide of 1915, and that this is all very real, no matter how much the Turkish government may attempt to sweep it under the carpet. The ONLY difference between this and the Trail of Tears is that the U.S. government isn't denying that they did it.</strike></p>
<p><strike>It is my opinion that, in consideration of ample evidence that a genocide attempt DID occur, it would be socially irresponsible to even hint at that the Armenian Genocide is a myth or was justified by the excuses presented. To promote such misinformation is certainly far more offensive than the unlikely possibility that the Turks may have had mitigating factors to justify their killings.</strike></p>

<p><strike>Fri Feb 17, 2006</strike></p>
<p><strike>WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's Foreign Minister Stefan Meller on Friday ruled out allowing any Iranian researchers to examine the scale of the Holocaust committed by the German Nazis on Polish soil during World War Two.</strike></p>
<p><strike>Meller's remarks came after repeated denials of the Jewish Holocaust by Iranian officials and their suggestions that more research is needed to establish the truth about what happened to European Jews.</strike></p>
<p><strike>"Under no circumstances we should allow something like that to take place in Poland," Meller told Polish news agency PAP. "It goes beyond all imaginable norms to question, even discuss or negotiate the issue."</strike></p>

<p><strike>Last week Iran's ambassador to Lisbon, who in the past served as a diplomat in Poland, said in an interview on Portuguese radio that according to his calculations based on a visit to the camp, now a museum, it would have taken the Nazis 15 years to burn the corpses of 6 million people.</strike></p>

<dd><strike>In the article and in discussions here there has been both the claim that the "Turkish position" requires equal legitimacy as the overwhelmingly accepted historical version of events and nomenclature. Additionally there has been specific reference to the Turkish President offering for Turkish "historians" and politicians to convene with Armenian counterparts to debate this issue and the (correct) refusal of the Armenian President to agree to such is used by those favoring the Turkish position as some sign of weakness regarding genocide claims. I post this here to put into proper perspective how denialists of known genocides should be treated - with disdain. I also believe that this correct reaction by the Poles (to not give deniers voice to bring foreward their pre-concieved conclusions based on erroneos manipulated and unsupportable "evidence") should serve as an example regarding how we should approach their shameful attemtps to mock these very painful historical events and to demean those of us who are still to this day affected by the actions taken against our kin. In fact all decent people should cry out against those who actively deny such crimes - as they do in the case of the holocaust so should they and we do in the case of the Armenian Genocide. Deniers of genocide do not deserve a platform to spread their lies and misinformation and IMO those who allow them to do such are guilty of complicity in the act.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 01:26, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike>I don't know where the author was coming from, but that person does not represent the "typical" Armenian, in mindset or otherwise. We don't hate on a broad-scale basis, and we don't consider people to be worthy of death, etc. There are extremists in any classification of people. I am not apologetic about how much it bothers me that Turkey would continue to deny their country's actions, and that they refuse to make reparations is likewise highly upsetting. It's reasonable that we be bothered by this. They attempted to exterminate us, and don't even grant us the dignity of recognition. But the solution is not found in revenge on people who weren't even alive when it happened. Contrition and returning some homeland to us IS within Turkey's abilities, though.</strike></p>
<p><strike>Imagine, if you will, that your ancestors for the past several thousand years lived in a region rich in history and culture, with mountains, deserts and seas. Relative newcomers sweep down from elsewhere, camp alongside... and you embrace them, allow that there's room enough for all. But they soon begin to take over, and essentially occupy you and your people. Then one day, with no valid cause or justification, they try to wipe you off the face of the planet and take your lands from you. Can you imagine that? Are you German? Irish? Swedish, French, Portuguese? You can still visit your heritage. When you take a taxi back there, the drivers and people don't deny that you existed for thousands of years. They don't usurp your architecture and claim it for their own. I'm not sure you can imagine it.</strike></p>
<p><strike>I'm first generation here in the States. My father was 1st generation in France, and my grandparents were born in Armenia, taken out of there at less than 7 years of age, orphaned by this genocide attempt that the Turks (people AND government, for the most part) still say never happened. By rights, I should be able to return to Armenia, see the history, the culture, perhaps even elect to live there. But I cannot. They took my great grandparent's lives, and continue to take that heritage to this day. Nothing can be done about their lives, and it's too late for them to replace the lack of affection that my grandparents suffered in an orphanage, the scars and memories of their parents' murder. It's too late to change how that affected my own father, and how he passed it on to me. But it's NOT too late for them to atone for it, and the first step is admitting that it happened.</strike></p>
<p><strike>I posted before about this: I remain bothered that this is being flagged as "disputed". It implies that the entire Genocide may not have happened. You effectively join them in preventing even that first step. Moderate the article as is proper; make sure that it follows reasonable fact, but... Please... do the right thing.

<p><strike>Does exclaiming it make you any more right? Sorry, you just sidestepped and waffled your way aound the point. There are some few extremists, muslim, Armenian, whatever... but to even think of judging a whole nation of people on that basis is highly irrational, and EXACTLY what you just did when you said Armenian is very specific so you can't reallycompare the two". You just tried to justify labeling a whole nationality based on the actions of a few. Tell me something: If it didn't happen, where did those million people go to?

It is a matter of fact that you can't do better than reffering to a cases of 2 decades ago, while Gocek cases was weeks ago and this has continued for years. Also, the reasons why he registered under a proxy is irrelevent, what is relevent is that he has registered under a proxy and his website contains racistic materials and fabricated quotes and there is no name attached to the site as a contact info to give that site some credibility. For example, ANI institute, if it had a non-existing quote would be contacted and will lose its credibility if it does it regularly. There are of course other such examples like armenianreality which should also be removed. I am sure that you would have been the first to jump to remove a site, if its doman name was tallturkishtales, turkishrealities, turkishclaimslies etc., but you have no problem wanting to include such craps yourself when it is directed against the Armenians. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:09, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike>It is just like Turkish deniers to attack the person and not the (true) message - look at Pamuk for instance - he is a "traitor" etc. Anyway - Akcam is fully accepted as a scholar and a scholar of the Armenian Genocide at that. Furthmore the fact that he is on the leading edge of Turkish scholars who are approaching the Genocide and the history of the period from a perspective of historical truth and not repeating CUP and current Turkish Government racist propoganda is certainly something to be noted. Additionally the analysis Akcam provides is right on the money and is most relevant and illustrative of not only the dynamics of the Genocide - but as much or even more so concerning the dynamics of Turkish denial. He is a serious scholar whose views deserve the utmost consideration - not character assasination. These bogus charges against him are a joke - and are typical of the culture of denial and of the problems Turkey has had with dissent. I could not see the views of any current American or European scholar being dismissed strictly because he had been charged or even convicted of civil disobedience at some point in his past during his youth...come now...this is incredibly weak - as are - of course - all of the Turkish arguments in denial of the Genocide. Isn't it time to both face up to the past...and to get back on topic? (of course this type of character assasination is about the only trick left in the Turkish denialist book at this point) --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 12:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<dd><strike>Thats just great, so if it was a serial rapist we were talking about, his opinion would be respected just because he supports your views! I suggest we pardon all the convicts of the world that support the view that what the Turks committed was a genocide!</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>THOTH you remind me of Irving, just another frustrated revisionist trying to blur the facts. If a convicted felon is a serious scholar for you and the rest of your fellow hijackers, then its difficult to take you seriously. I just cant be bothered to waste time arguing with you if you are going to cite former terrorists to make your point. Its just plain pathetic!</strike></dd>

<p><strike>From a partial point of view, it's just funny that Armenians spent this much money, time and effort in propagating unfounded claims. (No partial and respected historian classify these events as genocide).
