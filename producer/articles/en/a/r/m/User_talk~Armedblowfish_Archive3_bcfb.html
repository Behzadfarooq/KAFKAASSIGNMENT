<p>Hi, I see that you offered to mediate the case of the Ross Jeferies Talk page, has that lead to anything? It may be worth your while leaving messages on the talk pages of the involved parties to let them know that you are willing to mediate the case. If you need a hand just let me know. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 14:44, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for you interest in my attempts to mediate!&#160;: ) No, it hasn't lead to anything yet, but I just took your advice and posted reminders on the talk pages of the participants. I don't want them to feel rushed in deciding whether or not they would like me to mediate, however. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 23:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand that point, but often people don't have the RfM page on their watchlist, or it gets buried on their watchlist, meaning that a quick message on their talk page is usually the best policy. Like I said if you need a hand at any stage let me know. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 13:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_Archive3_bcfb.html" title="Edit section: The result of my RfA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The result of my RfA</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to vote in my successful <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_IanManka_d11e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/IanManka">RfA</a>. Despite your oppose vote, I was made an admin by a margin of 54/6/1.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why I am thanking you <i>now</i>, almost a month and a half after my becoming an administrator. There are many reasons, and I will attempt to explain these now. First of all, I am hand-typing all of my responses to all of my votes (which, admittedly, I underestimated the time such an undertaking would consume). I thought this would be rather simple, but needless to say, it is hard to think of unique and appropriate wording for each user. Secondly, the FIFA World Cup coincided with my promotion to administrator status, and so I was preoccupied with watching the World Cup. Third, I had some issues outside of Wikipedia that I had to deal with, and such issues decreased the amount of time I could spend responding to RfA votes. But those three reasons are merely excuses, and they should not be excused.</p>
<p>However, delaying my responses to votes has a postive effect for those who opposed my quest for adminship. It gives those users (such as yourself) the opportunity to review my actions as an administrator. If you so choose, you can review my administrator decisions here: <span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">IanManka</a> (<a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IanManka_56cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/IanManka">contribs</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">blocks</font></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">protects</font></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">deletions</font></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">moves</font></a>)</span>. This is, of course, entirely optional.</p>
<p>Re-reading your oppose reasoning, I feel that my response to some of the questions were inappropriate and perhaps not representative of my views on Wikipedia. I agree with your view that, in a conflict, "be polite and respect to opinions of your opponents when in conflict, not to walk away, depriving Wikipedia of your opinion and reducing consensus. In my response, I was stating what I should have done when I was in a <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">lame edit war</a> with a possible troll. The edit war in question was about piping of a single link, and perhaps I mishandled the situation. Now knowing what it is like on the "admin side" of Wikipedia, I understand now that walking away "is impractical for a Admin."</p>
<p>You also said not to take offense to your comments. Please do not feel that I am criticizing you in this response, but am instead only trying to learn from my critics. I am making an attempt to accurately interpret what your oppose reasoning was, and then, using this information, attempt to improve as an administrator.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I apologize for the tardiness of this response, and if you ever find me inappropriately using my administrator tools, please let me know. Sorry for this lengthy chunk of text on your talk page. If you have any questions about this response, please let me know. Thanks, and have a nice day! <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 19:41, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I ask you to reconsider your vote. I have found an interesting twist to this whole thing. There is a Centralized Discussion about TV episode formats, which is how policies are adjusted and created. If you look again at the debate I have linked to the appropriate articles. This is not about preference, as we both know preference is an opinion and opinions are something else on Wikipedia. The articles detail that there are multiple formats for TV pages, and that season pages is one of them. It is no longer a question of who is right and wrong, but of who was there first. Selecting a format over another based on what you prefer is hardly NPOV. The season have been there for months longer than the list page, and they are complete (granted they need work to the tone of the article, but they are more complete than the list page) and technically have seniority over the list. Voted for the list, toward the deletion of the season pages, is promoting preference in Wikipedia. I ask you to read the Centralized Discussion page and think about what this debate is really about, now that other guidelines have been found. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a>

<dd>I wish you would see that Talk page for "list of episodes". Pere requested a vote to determine if the indy ep pages should be created (which I thought was clear on the other page), in the mean time he has gone ahead and created Season 2 pages and plans to go ahead with others, completely ignoring everyone. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a>

<dd>I guess you're saying we need to finish all five season pages before moving to individual episode pages. To me, it's kind of a "if not now, when?" deal. I've already made the pages so it seems like the right time. I guess I'm prepared to make them as thorough (big) and as well referenced (thanks for the tips) as you would like. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 17:34, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi sorry about taking a relatively long (in Wikipedia standards!) time to reply. I had a case where one party was taking a very long time to actually get down to mediation etc. and so I closed the case stating that the pary was not willing to partcipate, and eventually it went to arbitration. With your case I think that is clear that enough time has passed for it to be clear that the party will not be invovled. Technically the request should be re-filled and WoodenBuddha not listed as an involved party. However, I know that this case has been on file for a long time, and so I would presume the other parties would not be keen on extending the time before starting mediation further. I personally would say start the mediation, but let Essjay know what you are up to. He'll probably reply anyway to the message you left on the mailing list. Hope that helps. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 17:29, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My apologies for that. I know that the software <i>does</i> sometimes fail to detect an edit conflict, but I'm not sure if it was that or if I went back to a revision before Terryeo jumbled my words around and forgot to go back to the most recent version to edit.</p>
<p>Terryeo is incredibly frustrating to deal with, and I have no doubt that it must seem like those of use who are pressing for him to be dealt with strongly are overreacting. But as I said before, our systems are pretty much predicated on the assumption that we <i>will not</i> have to deal with any <i>truly</i> bad actors -- only with situations where people of good faith mistake each other for bad actors. I <i>tried</i> for a very, very long time to assume good faith of Terryeo -- when he violated a policy, I said "well, maybe he doesn't know about that policy." When he radically misinterpreted a policy and started haranguing editors for not abiding by his imagined interpretation of the policy, I said "well, maybe he hasn't worked out that the examples given on that very page contradict the interpretation he's offering of that policy." When he made <i>further</i> reference to editors supposedly violating policy by not editing according to his own misunderstanding of that policy, I gritted my teeth and said "well, maybe he just <i>forgot</i> that we already established that the policy had <i>never</i> said what he claimed it said verbatim or meant what he claimed to think it meant."</p>
<p>But there's a reason that the legal system works on a standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt", not "beyond <i>any possible</i> doubt." It might be possible to believe that <i>individual</i> acts by Terryeo have some innocent explanation -- that he <i>really did</i> think he read somewhere that ChrisO was a declared <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppressive_person.html" title="Suppressive person">suppressive person</a>; that he <i>really did</i> think he read somewhere that I had been "barred for a month". It <i>might</i> even be possible to forgive acts which <i>could not</i> be accidents, such as the edits he made over a series of three and a half weeks in violation of his ArbCom ban, if such bad behavior could be seen as the exception to a general pattern of good behavior. But frankly, I think the answer is much simpler and that the total evidence of Terryeo's behavior points to it beyond a reasonable doubt: he is here to disrupt. That's it. Even getting the Scientology articles to reflect a Scientology POV is not his long-term goal -- though it's a nice side bonus to him if that happens, inevitably that POV imbalance is going to get corrected. But demoralizing Wikipedia editors, making them put up with so much personally aimed bullshit that they'll inevitably start to blame Wikipedia for letting the bullshit go on and leave -- <i>that</i> is something he can take as a lasting and long-term goal. And I think it's exactly the goal he came to Wikipedia to pursue. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if you've noticed, but quite a few things have occurred since the RfM. The case was accepted by CQJ, on the Medcabal<a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-07-05_F-14_Tomcat_23f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-07-05 F-14 Tomcat">Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-07-05_F-14_Tomcat</a>, which ended in deadlock, shortly followed by an RfC <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Wiarthurhu_5acf.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Wiarthurhu">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Wiarthurhu</a>. Wiarthurhu was banned for actions unrelated in content but related in conduct (you can see on his talk page).

<p>I concur with Mmx's view. I don't think that re-opening these sores this early in the mentorship period would lend well to what we're trying to accomplish here. That being said, the only real issue at the article page that was not resolved was if maneuverability was a design concern, and that probably needs to be sorted out by consensus and source material from WikiProject Aircraft due to the nature of what's being discussed there.

<dd>Is it the HTML length or the display length that is bothering you? I just added spaces to the code so it would break up better in the edit box, but that might not fully address your concern. The links to my talk page and email are mainly there because of my involvement in mediation, but I could shorten it to <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">t</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">m</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">c</a>). That might be slighlty confusing for new users (for whom the links are more useful), and to the rare English-as-a-second-language person or someone using an online translator such as Altavista, but then again "contribs" doesn't translate already. So was it mostly the horizontal length in the edit box you were concerned about, or would abbreviating the talk|mail|contribs part make you happier? <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 02:42, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't read the notice on top of your page until just now - I am very sorry for the confusion that resulted. Anyways, like I said the talk and mail parts are most useful for new users, who might not know about the features. But come to think about it, the "contribs" part is less likely to be useful.

<p>I don't know if I'm doing this right, but there is an editing back and forth going on in the article about comic artist Pat Lee.</p>
<p>Now, it's not my edit, I'm restoring a previous edit that briefly, and I feel, nuetrally, point out the well documented issues surrounding this artist, inclduing non payment of freelancers in his company (for which he has been sued, a matter of record) and not drawing his own pages (which again has been reported on reputable comic websites).</p>
<p>Part of the problem here is I think is that Pat Lee (rightfully so) has fans that don't liek to see "ugly" facts about him. I can understand that.</p>
<p>However, these contreversies are well documented (in periodicals such as the Comics Journal, the only real legitimate comics news publication) and are part of what makes this person "notable".</p>
<p>I hate to waste my time going through a editing war.</p>
<p>I'm doing this anonymously because I thik this is a sensitive issue and I do not want to be dogged by overenthusiastic Lee fans.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm sorry it's been awhile, but I recently agreed to mediate that case. Please either accept or reject me as a mediator there, and if you accept, please let me know if you would prefer public or <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html#Why_should_mediation_be_confidential.3F" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">private</a> mediation. Also, assuming you are still interested in mediation, please watchlist the page if you haven't already.

<dd>I just accepted. I especially like the fact that you are a programmer, and hopefully will use LOGIC and not feelings (which seems to drive my "opponents" in this mediation). I am prepared to accept your decision.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 02:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been having some problems with my ISP and/or my terminal from time to time. This may explain the "malformed" links. I'm on the Hughes Satellite system. I once had a link I <i>personally</i> checked on WP go bad on WP. Am I having a software problem or a hardware problem&#160;? These malfunctions have kept me off of the 'net and WP. Sometimes when I edit WP, I have had these tags appear: "Dataloss has happened", "This document contains no data.", "Operation has Timed out." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 08:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you saying you think your ISP is causing error in your edits... i.e. the edit you make is different than the edit that WP shows? Could you provide an example? The malfunctions you described are definitely network problems... basically, the Wikipedia servers send you information in small packets, but sometimes they get lost and don't make it to you.</dd>
<dd>I'm pretty sure that what the admins were concerned about was the quality of links you add to Wikipedia, though. Basically, Wikipedia generally wants to provide a short list of high-quality (non-<a href="../../../c/v/_/WP%7ECV_27f7.html" title="WP:CV">copyvio</a>, more or less <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, useful, etc.) (Also see <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.) I will, of course, try to be more specific as I get to know you better.</dd>
<dd>As for Talk Page probation, on that I am going to have to get to know you better. The goal will be to figure out what you were doing that was bothering people, and then try to avoid it. For now, consider asking questions on my talk page, or on the talk page of some other person willing to help you, rather than on article talk pages.</dd>
<dd>I know my reply was rather non-specific, but I have not had time to study your situation in detail yet, sorry.</dd>

<p>Even though mediation just started, I wanted to thank you for sticking with us on this case. The Peruvian Marxist left is a very arcane subject to most, and discussing the difference between El Partido Comunista del Peru and El Partido Comunista Peruano must be boring for you. All of us really owe you a debt of gratitude. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 04:11, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
