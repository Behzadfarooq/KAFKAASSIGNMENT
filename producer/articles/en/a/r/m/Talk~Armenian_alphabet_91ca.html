<p>A few things seem wrong to me, but i want someone else to confirm my thoughts before making changes. In eastern Armenian letter "ու", "oo", should be part of the alphabet where "ւ" is, and the letter և, "yev", should be 37, making the total number of leters in the alphabet 39. Or at least thats what I remember from my few years of school in Yerevan. Can someone let me know if I'm wrong, or fix the page if I am right. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.84.56.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__128.84.56.236_b2fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 128.84.56.236">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Why in the Alphabet "34 Hiun", but under "Modifiers and punctuation" the small ligature "Ech` Wiwn"? Hiun and Wiwn is the same letter, isn't it?

Hiun and Wiwn aren't the same letter in this case. The Wiwn in question is part of a ligature, and in this case is only used to mean "and" (as opposed to a letter like <a href="../../../i/j/_/IJ_%28letter%29_0bba.html" title="IJ (letter)">IJ</a>).

<p>Since many of the letter pairs have opposing but complementary pronunciation between the eastern and western dialects, like eastern Ben/Peh (b/p) vs. western Pen/Beh (p/b) and eastern Gim/Ken (g/k) vs. western Keem/Gen (k/g), maybe it's reasonable to clarify whether words are spelled using opposing letters and pronouned the same or spelled using the same letters and pronounced opposingly. Does this make since at all?</p>
<p>Being an Arabic speaker I can think of examples where Arabic is sometimes spelt differently in common speach, specially on the web, according to the local pronounciation of the letter; and I wonder if this is the case. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlef01_4b1a.html" title="User:Alef01">Alif</a> 19:26, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Alif.</dd>
<dd>There are three issues to take into consideration when analyzing the various "flavors" of the Armenian language.</dd>
<dd>1. Grammar / dialect
<dl>
<dd>i. Eastern Armenian</dd>
<dd>ii. Western Armenian</dd>
<dd>This mainly has to do with noun declension and verb conjugation (and to a lesser extent, word choice - e.g. when synonyms are involved).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. Pronunciation of Letters
<dl>
<dd>i. Eastern</dd>
<dd>ii. Western</dd>
<dd>Eastern Armenian pronunciation of letters is the more "authentic," traditional pronunciation. Overtime, Western Armenians, being closer (geographically) to Europe evolved the pronunciation, keeping only those consonant phonemes in common with Romance languages. (A minor note here is that only Armenians from Iran correctly differentiate between ր and ռ, since both Western Armenians and Eastern Armenians from Armenia trill them both in practice, even though they might be aware that only ռ should be trilled.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. Spelling / orthography

<dd>To answer your question more directly in a nutshell, words are spelled the same but pronounced differently (between Western Armenian speakers - who always write using traditional spelling - and Eastern Armenian speakers (if the Eastern Armenian speakers in question are using traditional spelling, too). However, if the Eastern Armenian speakers in question use Reformed spelling (as do most Armenians living in Armenia), then most words are spelled the same, except for <i>some</i> words that are spelled differently between Classical orthography and Reformed orthography (...). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 22:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoever wrote the 9th sidenote under the alphabet not only was far away from knowing Eastern Armenian, but must have been really angry at it. Firstly the second part of the 9th sidenote under the alphabet is a total absurd. The name Երևան, Երեվան (<a href="../../../y/e/r/Yerevan.html" title="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> is etymologically derived from Էրեբունի, (Erebuni), the name of the fortress, that put the begining of human settlement at the site of present Yerevan. Thus there is no "van" compound to the word Yerevan.<br />
Furthemore, the name Ստեփանավան (Ստեպանավան in the Western Armenian diction, Stepanavan) is formed from Stepan + avan. The first one being the first name of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepan_Shaumyan_cb3c.html" title="Stepan Shaumyan">Stepan Shaumyan</a> (an armenian revolutionary whose name was also put into the name of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepanakert.html" title="Stepanakert">Stepanakert</a>, and the Shaumyan region in <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno_Karabakh_Republic_2ff0.html" title="Nagorno Karabakh Republic">Nagorno Karabakh Republic</a>, the second word - ավան (avan) is Armenian for <i>small town</i>, <i>village</i>. So there is no (van) compound to Stepanavan either.<br />
Further yet, the spelling rules of Eastern Armenian contain a rule that explicitely prohibits the usage of և if it modifies the spelling of the compound roots, thus the explanation give there was not only a use of bad example, but totally wrong.</p>
<p>Better yet, the first part about the order and how it is formed in the dictionaries must have been writen by a person who had never held an Eastern Armenian dictionary in his/her hand. As there is no capitalization of և, the proper names starting in "ev" in Eastern Armenian are writen as "Եվ", thus the rule described above (that prohibits the usage of the ligature if it modifies the original) would make it wrong to transform the ”Եվ” into ”և” when forming derivatives from word spelled with ”Եվ”...</p>

<dd>Ulf-S, I am not trying to mock the efforts of those who put them into this article, but the entire article is less than acceptable. For example in the section of the names of the letters there is a statement about them not having been taught at the schools of Soviet Armenia, which isn't only not true, but creates a false impression of existing political pressure on those who did teach it. That's why the tag of missing references is the best thing that is doable to this article at this point, since I certainly dont want to create an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a>, and putting a long explanation of why I made each of the edits is not very high on my time-priority list. And everyone who made a contribution to the article should probably try and find a reference for every claim made. At least that's my understanding of what a <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia article</a> is. And time permitting I'll try to skim through it and bring other particular inaccuracies to the attention of the article maintainers.</dd>

<dd>Dear TeakTak, My source -- Lehrbuch der armenischen Sprache (Textbook of The Armenian Language) by Margret Eggenstein-Harutunian -- says: “Nowadays, the names are mentioned in schoolbooks but not taught.” Moreover, I do not know a single Armenian who knows the names because of attending school in Soviet Armenia. If you do not protest I will change the sentence of the article in “mentioned but not taught”. Sorry, the sentence was misleading. There will not be an edit war. The problem is that there are so far no really competent editors. <a href="../../../u/l/f/User%7EUlf-S._1d6b.html" title="User:Ulf-S.">Ulf-S.</a> 19:34, 25 September 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../u/l/f/User%7EUlf-S._1d6b.html" title="User:Ulf-S.">Ulf-S.</a> 19:34, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess we'll just find the "truth" in our continual discussion&#160;:). Can't say I am familiar with the book you quoted, but I dont understand what kind of "teaching" the letter names beyond mentioning and assigning them to learn is expected, this isn't quite the rocket science that you need to spend years explaining... And the logic of not knowing a single Armenian who knows the names because of attending school is not really bullet-proof. I don't know many people who can list all the punctuation signs of Armenian, doesnt mean they weren't taught it in school (or even remeber being taught them in school). The names of letters is not something you remember beyond the month you were taught it in, due to the lack of usage in everyday life. And it's not customary in Armenian to spell a word by using their alphabet names, as it is in English, which makes everyone know and always remember the alphabet pronounciation of the letters in the English alphabet. But believe me, and I say this having know several generations of school attendants as well as teachers of Armenian in Soviet Armenia, the letter names were taught in the schools. They weren't made a subject of worship, but you were supposed to learn and recite them by heart for a grade (sure enough you were let to forget it in a week). But of course I never made a point of digging up references for this, since this was always a common and easily veryfiable truth.<br />
Besides, what's the point of giving the letter names in Armenian? People who know Armenian wouldn't probably need this article at all, and those who cant read Armenian, wouldn't know what the names of the letters are, since they can't read them... Wouldn't it be better to include their IPA transcripts in the alphabet table? <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeakTak_868d.html" title="User:TeakTak">TeakTak</a> 13:10, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the old chart the names were included but it was not sufficiant and partially incorrect (f.e. transliteration and transcription were mixed up). The current chart is already big and I would prefer not to enlarge it. Of course, I can add IPA. Eastern Armenians have -- in contrast to me -- no problems to distinguish ճ and չ but do not understand me when I say ճե or չա. So this section is definately one that could be interesting for both native speakers (who often do not know them) and learners (when I heard f.e. ճիշտ for the first time I could only guess the diction). Generally, native speakers can find information about the history of the alphabet (some Armenians I met in Russia even do not know the alphabet and I assume that there are such Armenians in the English-speaking world too).</p>
<p>The point about “taught” is that when people read this they likely conclude that it is like in English. Maybe something like “mentioned in schoolbooks and principally taught but as pupils are not ought to know them only few people use the names at school and in daily life” (if this does not sound strange). <a href="../../../u/l/f/User%7EUlf-S._1d6b.html" title="User:Ulf-S.">Ulf-S.</a> 19:10, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then how about creating two charts, one for Eastern Armenian pronounciation/letter names/transliteration and one with Western Armenian, and then even include a chart of comaprisons between the differing pronounciations in the different dialects, now that's something I, and I think many Armenians and non-Armenians would be interested in (seldom one knows all the pronounciations of both Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian). As of now, the chart is not very readable in the sense of comparison, the confusion with the order of the last 4 letters, etc.</dd>

<dd>As to the letter names a simple "the letter names are not used in everyday life, and unlike English, it's not customary for speakers of Armenian to use the names for aloud spelling purposes, thus these names are not widely know even in Armenian speaking communities, even though they are taught as part of the elementary school curriculum." will solve the issue, and I dont quite understand why there should be any difference between the Western Armenian communities and the Eastern Armenian communities (which is implied by the inclusion of the statement about them not being taught in Soviet Armenia -&gt; not known). <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeakTak_868d.html" title="User:TeakTak">TeakTak</a> 23:59, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope the current version about the names is acceptable. I think the current chart is good taking into consideration that the history of the Armenian alphabet is <i>in fact</i> intangled and therefore there cannot exist a chart what makes understandable everything at the fisrt glance. The advantage of <i>one</i> chart is the one can easily compare the differnces in pronunciation. The alternative to one chart are at least three (for Classical, Eastern and Western) or four (for Eastern Armenian in the traditional orthography). Are the following spellings correct? կետ, ստորակետ, շեշտ, բացականչական նշան, բութ, հարցական նշան, պատիվ, ենթամնայ. Can you say the names of the others?

<p>The history is indeed intangled, but the proposal was about the common usages of literary Eastern Armenian and literary Western Armenian. Grabar, while being an interesting version of the language (both from historic and linguistic points of view) has nothing to do in this question. All I was suggesting is the alphabet is use in the present day Armenian in its two <b>literary</b> variants. The alternative to his would actually be listing all the dialects of Armenian, which is an impossible task. And I do still think that there can and should be an easily readable chart of phonetic correspondence between the pronountiations of letters in literary Eastern and Western Armenian. I'll hopefully get to the alphabet article in <a href="../../../../hy/index.html" class="extiw" title="hy:">hy:</a> soon, and would like to use this chart as a starting point, but in the meantime I'll think about how to incorporate either everthing together, or a good way of breaking things into 2-3 charts. There is a need for easily readable comparison...</p>
<p>I added a punctuation section to <a href="../../../../hy/%D5%B0/%D5%A1/%D5%B5/%D5%80%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%A5%D5%B6.html" class="extiw" title="hy:Հայերեն">hy:Հայերեն</a> (#Կետադրություն) couple of days ago, it contains all the signs in use.

<p>I have a question relating to some information in this article and discussion page pertaining to a particular Armenian character, և (0587 in Unicode). As I know next to nothing about the Armenian language, I am hoping someone here can help me to clarify the issue.</p>
<p>In the article itself, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_alphabet.html#The_letters" title="Armenian alphabet">"Letters"</a> table shows և in the minuscule column, and in the majuscule column to the left it shows (ԵՎ). That և is a ligature of ե and վ is also mentioned <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmenian_alphabet_91ca.html#.D6.87.2C_dictionaries_and_the_origin_of_compounds" title="Talk:Armenian alphabet">above</a> on this discussion page. This is consistent with what I have found on a couple of other web resources (e.g. <a href="http://www.menq.am/tarer_main.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.menq.am/tarer_main.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://hayeren.hayastan.com/english/abr.html" class="external text" title="http://hayeren.hayastan.com/english/abr.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), as well as some printed (Eastern) Armenian books.</p>
<p>However, in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0530" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0530" rel="nofollow">Unicode Standard</a>, 0587 և is listed as ARMENIAN SMALL LIGATURE ECH YIWN, indicating that it is the equivalent of ե and ւ (0565+0582). In the Unicode special casing file, it shows the uppercase equivalent of և for ALL CAPS text as being ԵՒ(0535 + 0552), or a direct uppercase mapping of եւ. This is not consistent with the information found here or in the other sources mentioned in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>So my questions for this forum are:<br />
What is the reason for this discrepancy?<br />
Is և a actually a ligature of եվ, or of եւ?<br />
What reason might there be for the Unicode standard to list և as being compatible with 0565+0582 (եւ) rather than 0565+057E (եվ)?<br />
Is this discrepency related to differences between Western and Easter Armenian in some way?<br /></p>
<p>Any explanations or clarifications on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<dd>That's probably one of the errors of the Soviet orthography (a.k.a. Reformed spelling), whose changes to the Armenian alphabet were imperfect. There are two ways to say "and" in Armenian: ու and եւ. In soviet orthography, the letter ւ is always replaced by the letter վ when it's used to make the "v" sound. (ու is kept ու since the ւ is not pronounced as a "v" but rather ու is pronounced "oo" as in "goo".) You only see և used in Soviet orthography; classical (Mashdotsian) orthography continues to used եւ, and և really is an ampersand (&amp;). Hence, since և is prounouced "yev," it is written as եվ (not եւ) in soviet orthography; and the capital of եվ is ԵՎ. Hope that helps. (related article: <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spelling_reform_of_the_Armenian_language_1922-1924_6cc6.html" title="Spelling reform of the Armenian language 1922-1924">Spelling_reform_of_the_Armenian_language_1922-1924</a>)<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 20:52, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>This statement is simply not true. (I'm speaking at least on behalf of Western Armenian speakers.) The letter names <i>are</i> used for spelling purposes particularly in Western Armenian wherein two letters may sound the same if simply pronounced (e.g. բ and փ are both pronounced as a <i>p</i>), making it necessary to annunciate the letters of the names (e.g. բեն - <i>pen</i> - and փիւր - <i>pyur</i>).</p>

To those who still think that “և was introduced in reformed Armenian orthography in the 1920s” I would recommend to walk to Matenadaran where they can see with their own eyes the vast number of ancient Armenian manuscripts all of which use և ligature. A quick search on google found <a href="http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/miniatures.htm" class="external text" title="http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/miniatures.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> of ancient Armenian manuscripts all of which again use the և ligature throughout. Both between words and withing words. The first Armenian <a href="http://www.kb.dk/elib/mss/treasures/biblen/82_175_a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kb.dk/elib/mss/treasures/biblen/82_175_a.htm" rel="nofollow">printed book</a> (published in 1666) also used և ligature along with many other Armenian ligatures. In fact the use of և ligature was so common and pervasive that in 1920s it has become a separate letter of the Armenian alphabet.</p>
<p>It is not new but now it is considered as an own <i><b>letter</b></i> whereas մն is still seen as a ligature. In the past <i>both</i> were considered to be ligatures. The current spelling of Europe in Eastern Armenian is ԵՎրոպա (EVropa). No mistake! I hate it, too, but that is the way they do it (the adjective is written ևրոպային (e͡wropayin)). It is the same with ու -- they really consider it to be <i>one</i> letter. <a href="../../../../de/k/u/d/user%7EKuddeldaddeldu_ad02.html" class="extiw" title="de:user:Kuddeldaddeldu">de:user:Kuddeldaddeldu</a></p>
