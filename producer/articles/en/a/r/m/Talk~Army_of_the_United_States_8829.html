<dd>Those are electronic publications available only through a system called NARA-Net, which you must be an employee of NARA to access. The "Case Reference Guide" is an <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPRC_0e60.html" title="NPRC">NPRC</a> online publication which is not open to the public. We've had a few people write to the agency, wanting copies, and all of these have been refused mostly becuase of the size of the document. Pretty much the only way to see it is to actually go to a NARA facility or call 314-801-0800 and have it explained over the phone. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 06:21, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think calling a phone number and having a conversation about a government publication is not too much to ask to veriofy a source. 314-801-0800 is the Customer Service line to the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Personnel_Records_Center_851f.html" title="Military Personnel Records Center">Military Personnel Records Center</a> which published the instructions.

<p>The Case Reference Guide of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Personnel_Records_Center_0d77.html" title="National Personnel Records Center">National Personnel Records Center</a> is a valid published instruction. It is published by archivists of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration_651a.html" title="National Archives and Records Administration">National Archives and Records Administration</a> and is, itself, based on memos promulgated by the Office of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archivist_of_the_United_States_bcd7.html" title="Archivist of the United States">Archivist of the United States</a>. You can write to 9700 Page Avenue, Overland, MO 63132 and ask any question you want about the instruction or call the number listed above to veriofy its existence and validity. In addition, the information in this article is also based on information contained in military service records which are primary sources. Why are we even talking about this? Is someone saying this article is not true or contains incorrect information? I think its pretty well sources and accurate. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 13:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A Wikipedian has requested sources: no justification for that request is needed. Checking sources, even for articles that look plausible, is a normal and highly-encouraged process, and is part of the road to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_1f87.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team">Wikipedia 1.0</a>. The burden is on the person providing or defending the information (<i>i.e.</i> you) to provide valid, published, secondary sources that can be examined by members of the general public. If the information is accurate, those should be available. If such sources do not exist, the article probably does not belong in Wikipedia: the only exception is the rare case where primary sources are widely available and require no interpretation. Since the sources you cite are provided at discretion, it is unlikely they are in my local library or University Library, and if they are in mine, they may not be in many others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The process of calling an agency and interviewing its personnel is the generation of a primary source, which is not the purpose of Wikipedia. The process of obtaining documents that cannot be found in research libraries and interpreting them is called <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and while perfectly wonderful for other purposes, is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In fact, given the size of the document you describe, you should really provide page references; otherwise, the process of fact-checking is unreasonably burdensome. If the information is too scattered for this, then this article would constitute a novel synthesis and would be original research within the meaning of the policy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unreferenced material may be deleted by any editor. I'm not looking to destroy your hard work or get into an edit war, and I am perfectly content to wait for a reasonable time (weeks, if need be) while you find sources that are valid for Wikipedia. My personal project for the summer is to provide/improve citations for a number of articles with no active editor but that I believe to be mostly factual. In at least one case, I have found serious inaccuracies that I plan to correct when I get time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since you are an active editor of this article, I am following the standard procedure of challenging the information in the article and requesting citations. Thank you for your hard work so far, and I am sorry if this request is inconvenient for you, but producing a quality Wikipedia is what I hope we are all after. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 14:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am actually on a military deployment for the next year or so so cannot research this article. I check Wiki from time and time and found it surprising that this article was being challenged for a source. I may, however, create an article on the Case Reference Guide to show that it does in fact exist and is a valid publication published by a major United States agency (mainly the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration_651a.html" title="National Archives and Records Administration">National Archives and Records Administration</a>.-<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 15:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That is unfortunate. We have a lot of articles with good information and bad references. I came to this because this looks like the sort of technical-sounding-but-meaningless distinction that tax-protestors like to make (distinctions between states and States, the United States and the united States, whether a flag has a gold fringe, <i>etc.</i>). I wanted to check it out, and was going to look up your citations at leisure, but now find that is impossible. The issue is not whether there is a publication by the name you cite, the issue is that it is not publicly available, so I cannot verify that it contains the information you say it does. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 15:06, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What is unfortunate is that you do not recognize a publication of the National Archives as valid. It is also not that difficult to obtain. You either call the number I have given or write the agency that published the instruction. No matter, I have 2 books which explain the difference between the Army of the United States and the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_Army_8fde.html" title="Regular Army">Regular Army</a> and have added them to the article. I could probably find more when I return in the U.S. I still *really* have no idea why this article is being called unsoruced orginial research. But, now you have the sources unless someone chooses to challenge those as well (I hope not). -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 15:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You stated above that the publications originally cited are essentially never sent to non-employees because of the size and cost. Now you say that the publications are not that difficult to obtain. Which is it? Both statements cannot be true. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 15:32, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Obtianing a hardcopy of the entire Case Reference Guide would be difficult since it is over 2000 pages long. However, writing to the agency with a question about it or calling NPRC would not be difficult. Anyway, I found the two Army books that also talk about the AUS and the RA. Those are not difficult to obtain at all. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 15:40, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the better sources. That is the sort of thing I was looking for. Calling an agency and asking questions would make the source the person being interviewed, not the publication they claim to be using. It would be like reading someone's book report instead of the book. Not acceptable. I am sorry that I have not been able to make that clearer to you.

<p>In 1994 and 1995, the Army was still using the different terms, at least for the Oath of Office for commissioned officers. I took one oath, and RA officers took another . . . I do not remember which was which, but the only difference was "having been appointed a second lieutenant in the army of the united states," vs "having been appointed a second lieutenant in the united states army." Non-RA officers who were augmented to RA, were re-sworn in with the "other" oath. --<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 20:10, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've seen such modern references as well. Mostly on Discharge Certificates, where all enlisted discharge certificates will say "Discharged from the Army of the United States", but then have a componetn, such as RA or USAR written right after the name. I have also seen the commissioning orders for officers say AUS but then the actual component in the record will be listed as USAR. I think, in the modern Army, "Army of the United States" might be a generic term different from the old Army of the United States which was a draft force. Good points to consider for future article updates. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 20:16, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's still unclear, because <a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh/faq/oaths.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh/faq/oaths.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mil/cmh/faq/oaths.htm</a> shows that it is Army of the United States . . . that's what my DA 71 shows . . . yet, in the <u>Army Officer's Guide</u> 48th edition, dated in 1999, shows the Oath as being United States Army. I'm going to hazard a guess, that RA officers, who were specifically commissioned with a branch assignment (which no longer happens, I believe) took the oath in such a form:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I, (name), having been appointed a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in the United States Army, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>on the DA 71, it shows three check blocks, both on the current version, and the one I used: Regular Army (branch when so appointed); Army of the United States, without component; Reserve Commissioned Officer . . . of course, back in the day, there were three types of commission: RA, Active Duty (which was really a reservist, on active duty for minimum of 6 years), and Reserve Officer . . .</p>
<p>This has been an education for me, Husnock, and if you get more info (you would have better access where you work), please pass it on. --<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 22:53, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>To add another interesting tidbit, retired Generals (and some Colonels) are listed as "AUS retired". I think its so they can hold a temproary rank on the retired list but get higher pay. I actually think the Army is kind of neat with these components. Over in the Navy all we have is USN and USNR...boring! -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 23:00, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Husnock, or anyone else, can we get a citation for this bit: <i>This is most common in the case of those holding the ranks of either Lieutenant General or General, since these ranks are considered held for the duration of an assignment with the highest Regular Army rank being that of Major General.</i> I have heard this to be true, in anecdotal comments, but nothing verifiable.--<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 21:34, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
