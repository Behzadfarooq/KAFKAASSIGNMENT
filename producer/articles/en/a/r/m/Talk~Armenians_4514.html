<dd>It says de-facto independent, it is self governing w/ no Azeri prescence in it which is something everyone agrees upon. But it is not officially recognized by any country in the world, including Armenia which is something we agree upon as well. This article is about the Armenian people, not Armenia. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 22:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since you show Nagorno-Karabakh as a separate entity on that list, you already automatically imply that it is de facto independent. Reference to Azerbaijan must be made because the status of Nagorno-Karabakh is different from that of Russia, France, Iran or Lebanon, which are mentioned concurrently. Since it is not possible for Azerbaijan to appear on that list, some credit to it must be given; you cannot disregard it completely unless Nagorno-Karabakh is officially independent. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 01:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But who says it is disregarded? It says "de facto independent republic, though unrecognized by any country". Since it says that, the reader will know that "the status of Nagorno-Karabakh is different from that of Russia, France, Iran or Lebanon". <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 08:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no reference to <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>. Such reference as absolutely important, since Nagorno-Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan (and defined as such by Wikipedia), and not just some undefined isolated territory that claims indepedence. Plus, "de jure part of Azerbaijan" is a much more clear and concise note than what you propose. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 09:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think this article should be listed under this category. For one thing, there are very few Armenians living under the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan's government. Those that are live in mixed marriages with Azerbaijanis. This community is not as large nor as notable as the ones in Russia, France, Iran, Georgia, Syria, Lebanon, Ukraine, and Turkey. Karabakh should be treated differently as it is not fully integrated into Azerbaijan. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 12:13, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Those in Nagorno-Karabakh should count towards Armenians living in Azerbaijan, regardless whether the region is under Baku's jurisdiction or not. For example, many parts of northwest Pakistan are not under Islamabad's constant jurisdiction (and there have been cases of military separatism - see <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Waziristan_b3b3.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Waziristan">Islamic Emirate of Waziristan</a>), but the people who live there are considered ethnic groups of Pakistan whatsoever. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 23:29, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

I would like to drwa your attention to map on page <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_War_bee2.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a>. It says - <i>"Nagorno-Karabakh is currently a de facto independent republic in the South Caucasus, but is officially recognized as part of the Republic of Azerbaijan".</i> So it is in accordance with international law (and no one can say that we don't care about IL) as well as in accordance with other Wiki pages.</p>
<p>2 - My second edits are about the appearance of Armenians in Eastern Anatolia. Current version endorces mostly nationalist version of Armenian scholars (plus Gamkrelidze-Ivanov theory). We had extaensive discussion about that on page <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a>. Many Western sources maintain that Armenians appeared in EA in 7-6 BC.

<p>So, if we mention Armenian theory we have a full right to mention other sources and theories--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 15:56, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since the term “Armenian” is thought to derive from the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armens.html" title="Armens">Armen</a> tribe who lived in east Anatolia prior to <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a>, it would seem strange that the same name would be given to an invading tribe who appeared much later. Who recorded this invasion, I would like to know, and what was their name for the migratory tribes. I have also noted that some of your sources self-contradict. <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> online, for example, both states that the Armenians replaced Urartians, and that they were called ‘Urartians’ by the Greeks. None of these three sources cite specific records or research, and we have known way of knowing where they got their information (except maybe from each other). I would prefer sources from an historical research site, university or book, rather than an unlinked page and a unsourced online encyclopedia. Another thing, even <i>if</i> a nomadic tribe did migrate into and merge with native inhabitants of Urartu, wouldn’t that just adds some new elements to the culture already there, rather than, as you seem to be stating, creating a brand-new ethno/cultural group. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 00:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This whole issue was debated exstensively on page <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a> in terms of Urartu-Armenian relations. I don't think we need to repeat it here. You can look at Talk page on Urartu. I made reference to specific books, as you wish to get, for example B.Piotrovsky, who was one of major historians of Urartu. Here since it is mentioned that Armenians appeared in EA 4,000 years ago, which is out of any mainstream theory, I put one sentence of major view on this matter. Even some Armenian historians do not believe that they appeared in EA 4,000 years ago. Anyway, encyclopedic sources can be referenced in Wiki.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 14:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It will be also good to quote sources which state that Armenians originated in EA and the Caucasus. I have only one - Gamkrelidze-Ivanov theory which basicly declined by many historians. Again - this debate was on <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a> page. However, editors of this article decided to put it straight - Armenians originated in EA (?) --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 15:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The majority of western sources consider Urartu to be the direct ancestral cultural entity of the Armenians. If you want to shove back the Armenian 'start date' then you will have to prove that the people called 'Armenians' by others were distinct and disconnected from Urartu. Here are some quick web sources that connect Urartu and Armenia. <a href="http://www.armeniaguide.com/html/appliedart.html" class="external free" title="http://www.armeniaguide.com/html/appliedart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.armeniaguide.com/html/appliedart.html</a> <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C003796/gather/bc.html" class="external free" title="http://library.thinkquest.org/C003796/gather/bc.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/C003796/gather/bc.html</a> <a href="http://www.starspring.com/ascender/urartu/urartu.html" class="external free" title="http://www.starspring.com/ascender/urartu/urartu.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.starspring.com/ascender/urartu/urartu.html</a> <a href="http://www.armenian-history.com/Nyuter/HISTORY/ArmeniaBC/Urartu/kingdom_of_urartu.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.armenian-history.com/Nyuter/HISTORY/ArmeniaBC/Urartu/kingdom_of_urartu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.armenian-history.com/Nyuter/HISTORY/ArmeniaBC/Urartu/kingdom_of_urartu.htm</a> This message left by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">user:The Myotis</a></p>
<p>It is funny. The source from www.starspring.com indeed what I quoted on <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a> page, and it says:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>It is generally agreed that the Urartians arose from the Hurrians and employed a language similar to Hurrian.</i></li>
<li><i>After the disappearance of Urartu as a political entity, the Armenians dominated the ancient highlands, absorbing portions of the previous Urartian culture in the process.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Another your source: library.thinkquest.org says:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Then they (Armenians) moved to the East and settled in western and southern regions of the Armenian plateau</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>It actually proves what I argue - Armenians came later in EA, and definitely Armenians did not originate from EA as it was put now in the article</b>.

<dd>From 4 references 1 - is Armenian community website, 2 - fomer Soviet source. I don't know how we can put that "most western sources", and my reputable encyclopedias equal "some western sources". BTW the Soviet source mention two versions (two theories) as well. Anyway, I am ok as long as this article mentions two versions.</dd>
<dd>I tried to prove that and did it while somehow many Armenian editors, including you, called that "destructive activity" - even at Arbitration page. You call everything which does not suit your POV in a such way. I hope that (as it was a case with Urartu and this page) other articles, which now a subject of Arbitration, will be sorted out. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 21:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually only 1 is Soviet encyclopedia source, the other 2 are books by American and British people. Don't distort the references.</dd>
<dd>While it states two theories, the one you speak of is the old one, it says <i>While classical historians cited the tradition that the Armenians migrated into their homeland from Thrace and Phrygia, <b>contemporary scholarship suggests that the Armenians are descendants of various ancient indigenous people</b> who combined in the tenth through seventh centuries B.C. to produce the Uraratean people (Ararateans). These views are not necessarily contradictory since <b>present-day Armenians undoubtedly are an amalgam of several peoples, indigenous (Hayasa-Azzi, Nairi, Hurrians, etc.) and immigrant</b>, who merged as one linguistic family around 600 B.C.</i> - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 21:44, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you are misinterpreting the data, Dacy. The fact that the Armenians appeared with Urartu culture suggests that an old ethnic group was rebuilding under a new name (and perhaps with new influences) rather than, as you insinuate, a new group that exterminated and replaced the old one. Second, you keep on telling us that Armenian 'origins' lie outside of Anatolia, as if the origins of any ethnic group lie in only one place and nowhere else. Genetic exchange happens frequently to all ethnic groups, even when they remain culturally definite, and continues to happened to such groups even in the modern day. Ethnic groups are defined mostly by culture, which the Armenians certainly did. Also, I would like to know exactly where this supposed Armenian migration was recorded. Was it Assyrians? Greeks? Some other civilization? And did they call them 'Armenians', or is that just one interpretation? How do we know the Armenian migration was not just some ethnographer's theory? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 23:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I mentioned once - we had exstensive discussion on Urartu-Armenians nexus on page <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a>. Please look at that article's talk page. You can find a lot of useful information and arguments of both sides. What I know for sure that wording here was twisted. Most western sources maitain migratory theory about Armenian presence in EA, but this article states vice versa. I put my references, so the reader will judge. For now I am done with that dispute. Moreover, it is a subject of Arbcom's consideration.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 03:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, as the Soviet encyclopedia said, that was the old thought, new scholarly belief is that they originated from indigenous people. Check the stuff I c/ped earlier.

<dd>I have looked at the <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a> talk page. You did not seem to come to any resolution other than being convinced that you should debate your opinion here rather there. I did notice, however, that the article states Armenia was used synonymously in many ancient sources (including the Greeks and Persians). It also mentions that the Urartuian and Proto-Armenian languages were probably spoken side-by-side in the same kingdom, which certainly suggests an ethno-cultural merge. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 04:29, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is not me who started arguing here about Urartu-Armenian links. Whole debate started when my edit was put under question. And, indeed we came to resolution on <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a> page, if you looked carefully at the page. I quote: <i>"Dacy69 has provided appropriate evidence in support of his edits. I have made a comment on the talk page of Urartu explaining that Dacy69 is making appropriate edits and inviting editors to talk to me if they have concerns. I regard the matter as closed.

<p>Your edit, I suspect, was put into question due to it's rather one-sided interpretation of the facts rather than, as you seem to suspect, just because everyone who disagrees with you is a nationalist. And it does not seem you made any significant changes to the article, as nothing of the same nature you posted here is displayed there. In any case, I think this conflict is also closed and the current NPOV version should remain.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 01:49, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe the matter is closed but don't understanbd why you continue argue that I have put one-sided interpretations. You, actually, failed to produce any evidence to support your claim. Your references indeed are supporting the theory which I second. It was <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">user:Fedayee</a> who came up with his references, and they, I believe, not overwhelmes mine. As a matter of fact, my references are much stronger. The theory which Fedayee and you are supporting is a minority view in mainstream science. And on page Urartu neutral user Dbachman supported the theory which I put forward here. As far as whose theory which I call nationalist, I would suggest you to read Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 17:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all, you are continuing your own argument. The matter is solved and requires no more discussion. Your original edit was one-sided, which is why we added the opposing thesis (producing NPOV). Whose argument you believe is stronger is irrelevant, you still can give us no original source for Britannica’s claim. And there is no 'mainstream science' view on the genetic origins of Armenians, as no ethnic group has a single genetic origin. You do, of course, realize that you yourself could easily be labeled a ‘nationalist’ from you claims; "since Armenians ‘origins’, as you put it, lie outside of Anatolia, they are racially ‘alien’ and have no right to a homeland there". But if we are to throw around that term (nationalist) to much it loses its meaning. I rather doubt, though, most academics would define Armenians by genes. And I am certainly not willing to track down some obscure political text by an unheard of author so you can prove a political point. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 00:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You just are trying to twist everything here. If you look at the page's history you'll see that I came later here and indeed I added alternative theory. Initial text claimed that Armenians were oroginally from EA. So, my edit should be credited as a step to NPOV. As for original resreach - again see <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a> page and references to Diakonov and Piotrovsky. And please don't misquote me - I never claimed that if Armenians aren't originally from EA they "have no right to a homeland there" . It is your words which you try to tag to me. I believe it does not matter where people originated - they have a full right to live where they live now. Just like in Canada - white people came 300-400 hundreds years ago - so it does not mean that they should be thrown away. And again for nationalist theory, land and origin I quote from mentioned book about Nationalism and Archeology: <i>"the "problem" only existed for those who wanted Armenians always to have lived in and controlled "historic Armenia".</i> I haven't problem with a principle who and when lived in or migrated to somewhere. All these theories about origin or indigenous people exist only for nationalists in post-Cold war era.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 16:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC) "</p>
<p>You are not reading what I am saying, Dacy. I did not actually claim that you where trying to say that Armenians have no claim to a homeland, but rather that it was how it <i>could be interpreted</i>, and that a person of such a vulnerable position should not use the label "nationalist" against all there opponents. In any case, using such labels is an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> technique, which uses accusations of an opponents motive the object rather than actual evidence, usually due to a lack thereof. Though, I do find it interesting that you would compare Armenians in Anatolia to Caucasians in the New World. Such a comparison, you should realize, automatically insinuates that Armenians have virtually no genetic or cultural relation to the former inhabitants, and that they in fact destroyed and replaced the former inhabitants with completely foreign elements. I am not certain if that was what you intended to say with your comparison, but I must know <i>do you believe that is true</i>? Also, you continually state that Armenians are "not from" Anatolia, as if you believe that there was only one genetic source for Armenians (<i>do you?</i>). Even in the scattered sources that you do cite the theoretical migration does not wipe out and replace the inhabitants, but instead absorbs and mingles with the people already present, <i>producing</i> a new entity that has been labeled as "Armenians". And since the word "Armenian" has only ever been used to describe people from the area known as Armenia, I would be perfectly accurate to say that Armenians have always lived there. After all, that was were the cultural entity know as 'Armenia' was created. Please be sure to answer my two questions in your response, as this discussion is getting rather circular.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">The Myotis</a> 01:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
