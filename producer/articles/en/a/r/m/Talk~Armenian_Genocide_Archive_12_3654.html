I wasn't going to participate in this discussion, but it clearly spun out of control. The remarks made on this talk page or extremely racist and both Armenians and Turks have shown a bad side of them here. It is a fact, howvere, that there WAS an Armenian genocide so I think we should leave this article intact and not vandalise it. A few Turks mentioned a Turkish genocide by Armenians. I haven't found any proof of that, but if it does exist I think we should have an article about it in the same way we have this article here. I suggest that people would leave that article alone and unvandalised like I would hope they would leave this one alone. Every culture and every race has done things they should be ashamed of. I'm of Hungarian extraction and the things we did in the past are nothing to be proud of either. I'm also Flemish and the things the Flemish did in the past are just as bad as all tese genocides. Weren't the crusades a Christian genocide of muslims? Didn't many Flemish people help the Germans in their cleansing during WW II? Didn't the Hungarians commit atrocities in the balkans during their reign there? I live in Ireland and during Ireland's struggle for independance a lot of bad things have happened on both sides, but the Irish seem to be open about that. Even the loyalists and nationalsists in the North of the country admit they have done terrible things to justify their cause. Let's settle this dispute and agree there was a genocide and, indeed, put a banner on top stating <i>The neutrality of this article is to be disputed</i>. If there is proof of the Turkish genocide please add this article. <i>Please, Armenians leave that article alone.</i> <i>Please, Turks leave this article alone.</i> Fight your wars on the talk pages, not by vandalising the articles. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorgenpfhartogs_f692.html" title="User:Jorgenpfhartogs">Jorgenpfhartogs</a> 13:40, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Look buddy....for Armenians and yourself to make harsh accusations against Turks stating that there was genocide is complete nonsense!!! It seems to me you are another gullible person who believes their lies! Why would Turkey deny that they committed genocide? Look how well Germany is doing, look how well Serbs are doing after their genocide of Bosnian Muslims, and not to forget all other civilizations across the world! All these countries are doing wonderfully with genocides and all!! Turkey has no reason to deny a "genocide". They would be like "yeah, we did it" and life goes on. However, the ARMENIAN GENOCIDE NEVER HAPPENED!! That is the only reason why Turkey denies it!! It’s a simple as that! Turks will never accept anything that never happened! Armenians that died or were deported to other countries was because of their decision to attack Turkey in the first place, and when Turkey acted in retaliation of Armenian attacks, they can't get mad and declare "genocide". The world doesn't work that way.....There are wars, where there are the victors and losers. Armenians initiated a battle and lost! They must learn to accept that. They can't change history and hope that they'll get some Turkish land out of their genocide lies. If you support Armenians so much it would also seem to me that you would also say that any country protecting itself is committing genocide! So I guess the United States is committing genocide against Arabic people when it’s cracking down on Al-Qaeda members! Or better yet Bosnian Muslims and Croatians initiated genocide on Serbs, when Serbs were killing them! Yeah right buddy! You must be on crack! However, I do pity you or anyone else that believes there was a "genocide". Note: From now on any country defending itself will now be classified as genocide committers - ha ha! I will soon provide articles where Turks and Azerbaijanis were slaughtered by Armenians before Turkey finally retaliated! There one can read for themselves that defense it not classified as "genocide". Thank-you!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, I think it's common practice to sign your accusations!!!</dd>
<dd>Second, I'm indeed one of the people that thinks there was a sort of ethnic cleansing during World War I in the Ottoman Empire and we have proof of that.</dd>
<dd>Third, of you will provide articles where Turks and Azerbaijanis were slaughtered by Armenians before Turkey finally retaliated I think they SHOULD be on Wikipedia, but I must say that I never heard of it, so I really, really would be interested in reading the. I'm not, I repeat NOT, against you and if there were instances where Turks and Azerbaijanis were slaughtered by Armenians before Turkey finally retaliated, I would be the first to read it.</dd>
<dd>Third, I know for a fact that during the Balkan wars, the Bosnian Muslims initiated a genocide on Serbs, just like the Serbs did on them, the Croats did on the Serbs, the Serbs on the Croats, the Croats on theBosnian Muslims, etc, etc. I was there and I know for a fact that everyone wanted their part of the country cleansed. I admire all people in Bosnia for living together in relative peace now after such atrocities were committed. Last year, I went backpacking through Hungary, Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia with a group consisting of me, Hungarians, Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats and we are still the closest group of friends you'll ever meet! We did face some hostility and were stripped naked at almost every checkpost we encountered, but the general consencus was that people found us very brave for travelling together.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Turks and Aremnians always throughout their history (dating back to Pre-Alexander eras) and I think this will never change. Azerbeidjans also don't have a good history with Ottomans although they are considered a Turk people.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fourth, I also do believe that the United States and Israel are cleansing the middle East. They want the middle east organised in a way that fits their policies. An oil-dependant economy like the US needs the Middle East. However, does not do what they want will be attacked and I wouldn't be surprised if the US will attack Turley in the future. They attacked Iraq claiming they would like to protect the Kurdish minority there, so why not use the same reason for Turkey. I'm not aware of the current situation of the Kurds in Turkey but I believe the region is a lot quieter after the conviction of Öcalan. It don't want to go into a discussion about the Kurds, I simply don't know enough about it.</dd>
<dd>Fifth, the Ottoman empire did commit atrocities all over the empire, but so did all empires of that time. The French, Dutch, Brits, etc. were the same. Look at what the Brits did in Ireland and the Turks will be excused for what happened in the Ottoman empire. Being of Transylvanian ancestry I should have a mixed feeling about Turks and Slavs but I don't. My grandfather fled for his live after Romania annexed Transylvania, but I have no grudge against Romanians. My forfathers foughts against the Turks, but I have no grudge against the. We, Hungarians, treated Serbs very badly, but I've never met one that hates Hungarians.</dd>
<dd><b>Conclusion</b>: Let's stick to the facts and rely on proof and let readers of the article decide whether they believe events in Armenia should be called a genocide. If Armenians committed atrocities please write this down with the proper proof and we'll be happy to read about it.</dd>

<li>Jorgenpfhartogs: You totally went off topic! Your comments made me laugh however - thanks! I liked the one about Bosnians and Croatians intiating genocide on Serbs. Thats hilarious! You really show your "intellectual" level. Anyway back to the topic. Firstly I will define genocide because Armenians and their supporters seem not to know what it means. According to the dictionary genocide is systematic killing of a racial or cultural group. Now, that being pointed out I will do a brief overview of the Ottoman Empire. Anyone who studied the empire knows that is was a very culturally and religiously diverse one consisting of Arabs, Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, Armenians, etc. etc. Armenians, however, were among the most important getting appointed to high positions within the empire. Did these ethnicites get killed because of their cultural or religious beliefs??? OF COURSE NOT! In fact the empire tolerated and respected them!! Proof: all these ethnicities are practicing their religion and speaking their language!! Are they all speaking Turkish and practicing Islam - NO! This is an example of the empire's respect!! Don't get me wrong I'm not saying the empire was perfect but a few important questions remain: Why would such a culturally/religiously diverse empire that lasted between 500-600 years commit "genocide" on Armenians??? Why did Turks wait so long to commit this "genocide" near the empire's fall, fighting with Brits and others so it would't lose all its land??? Would it not make sense that if Turks were such racists they would have committed genocide when they were at the height of their power?? The answer is clear: TURKS DID NOT COMMIT GENOCIDE ON ARMENIANS! Armenian propaganda distorts from the real truth and people like you "buy it". Again of course, you are most likely Christian and you support the Armenian side of things. Turks are Muslims so it is obvious that you and other Armenian supporters will not support Turks even with evidence that prove their was no genocide! Turks did not wake up one day and say "hey let's kill some Armenians"! Again I will state that TURKEY RETALIATED FROM ARMENIAN ATTACKS!!! Do you not get it!!! The Turkish Empire was falling apart and Armenians (with Russian support) thought they could get Eastern Turkey!! So they massacred many Turks that lived in the east, that is where the Turkish genocide began by Armenians. I am preparing an article that will give further details about the Turkish genocide and Armenian lies covering it up! The Turks who died in the Armenian genocide campaign deserve justice!

<dd>I totally (absolutely!) agree that the Ottoman was for 500 years a very diverse empire with many different ethnic races, different religions and different languages. Most of these lived in peace (Albanians for example didn't always). I love going to Bosnia and Romania and the Ottoman influences are eminent there in every aspect of live. I have a huge respect for other cultures and would never go black and white and see the world as Christians against muslims.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am, indeed, a Romn Catholic and if I may say so a practising one. Many of my friends have other religions and I live near the mosque in Dublin. I often visit the mosque with friends and find there are many similarities between Christianity and Islam. I also agree that the comparison with former Yugoslavia was rater poor, but I was there and I saw Muslims killing Serbs with my own eyes. (I saw everyone killing everyone in fact) But...these things always happen and the history of the war will be written by the victorious ones. I also agree that Russia and Armenia were very eager to get parts of Turkey at the end of the World War. Relations between Russia and Turkey have always been bad. Relations between Russia and Armenia have also been very, very bad at times and I don't think that Russia would have worked closely with the Armenians. If they did, they must have looked the other way when Armenians were killed. I know that Aremnians invaded Eastern Turkey in the later stages of the war and that Turkish people were killed while defending their country. May I add that many of these were Kurds that are now fighting Turkey as well? I am concerned about the killins inside Armenia and the hundreds of thousands of Armenian civilians killed. I don't care about how many soldiers were killed. It was a war and you shouldn't complain if you loose a war with big losses you shouldn't have gone to war then. Can anyone explain why so many cilians were killed? Whether we call it a genocide or not it is a fact that many Armenian civilians were killed by armed personnel. This is not a Christian view but a view of a religious person that thinks killing is wrong. You and I know that Judism, Christianity and Islam are very alike and that's it against these religions to kill innocent beings. Too much killing has been done in the name of religion, non more so than here in Ireland. I'm lloking forward to reading yor article about Armenians invading Turkey. It will be interesting to hear another point of view on the complicated story that is Turkish-Armenian relations. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorgenpfhartogs_f692.html" title="User:Jorgenpfhartogs">Jorgenpfhartogs</a> 05:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Jorgenpfhartogs: You state that you are a "fair" person and that you never see the world as black or white, however I cannot sense any evidence of that. You are quick to point fingers at Turkey, stating there was a "genocide" and thats it. A fair and logical person would not take sides and accuse a nation of such harsh accusations. You basically "ignore" the facts leading to Turkey's retaliation against Armenia but also at the same time you agree that the Ottoman Empire was a multi-ethnic one. So why would a multi-ethnic empire commit genocide? I'm sure you will not answer this question as well as the other questions I wrote earlier. Armenians killed many Turkish civilians before Turks finally retaliated. Now, if you are such a caring person about civilians dying why don't you care about the Turkish civilians? The fact is you don't care to even acknowledge them because you are only taking the Armenian side which is fine, thats your business.......but don't give me that I'm a fair person bull sh*t. The difference between me and you, is that I'm an objective person looking at all facts from all sides and you're a biased person just looking at the Armenian perspective. I looked at all sides when it comes to this "genocide" matter. And I know that the only reason why Armenian civilians were killed is because they killed Turkish people first, not because Turks had nothing better to do. It's called "eye for an eye". Armenians targeted and killed Turkish civilians and when they get a taste of their own medicine, they claim "genocide". By the way many of these Armenian civilians weren't sitting around peacefully, they were helping their soldiers killing Turkish civilians. In defense, Turkey killed Armenian soldiers and civilians, however they deported most civilians. They wanted the "Armenian terror" to stop. I think the Turkish government did a miraculous job! They were so weak, but gave all they got to save their county - what bravery! They could have easily killed the Armenians being deported, but they didn't. Thats a clear sign that in some way they did care enough not to kill them. Too bad Turkish civilians didn't have that option - they were all just mercilessly killed by Armenians.

<li>If Armenians want their "genocide" to be recognized they should also recognize the TURKISH GENOCIDE COMMITTED BY ARMENIANS. What I've discovered of Armenians is that they are wonderful manipulators and masters at the art of lying. They are leaving a pretty important fact out: ARMENIANS INITIATED THE ETHNIC CLEANSING OF TURKS, WHERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of TURKS WERE MASSACRED AND THROWN INTO MASS GRAVES. Why did Armenians do such a thing?? Answer: because they wanted to take Turkish land for themselves and instead fighting man to man, they went into villages targeting helpless Turkish civilians while the Ottoman Empire was preoccupied in other battles in Western Turkey. Afterall, the Ottoman Empire was extremely weak and lacking resources, the idea of starting an ethnic cleansing program of Armenians is F****N hilarious!!!!!!! (If the Ottoman Empire despised Armenians so much, why did they not "get rid" of them between the 500 years they were in power?? The Empire would have been a lot stronger and could have killed even more Armenians. They did not because Turks respected Armenians so much, that is why Armenians were very wealthy and successful during the Empire time). *During Armenians slaughtering and rampaging of Turkey and its civilians, Turks were finally able to defend their country. Of course, then Armenians were killed by Turks because its called DEFENSE - perhaps ARMENIANS ARE CONFUSING DEFENSE AS GENOCIDE. ARMENIANS ATTACKED TURKEY FIRST AND THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES, it's called being an adult, look into it.........Every country in the world defends itself when any enemy invades their land, in this case Armenians were the enemy. Armenians "made up" a sob story about the "genocide" to get world sympathy. They want to follow in Israel's footsteps - remember how Israel was created after their genocide, the only difference here is theirs was real and ARMENIANS ARE FALSE! Anyone who is confused about this whole situation should not take my word or any other persons word, they should read an unbiased history book, there one can see for themselves what Turks endured by Armenians before Turkey finally defended itself. And the pictures Armenians use as evidence of the "so called genocide" are mostly fabricated or pictures of people dying from disease or starvation-not of what Turks did. Please don't fall for Armenian lies and educate yourself!!!!! ARMENIANS STOP CHANGING HISTORY AND SPREADING HATE PROPAGANDA OF TURKS. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS UNJUST AND DOWN RIGHT PATHETIC!!!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: Why are Armenians always deleting my comment? I think its perhaps they don't want anyone to know the horrible atrocities they committed against Turks before the Turkish government finally defended its country - how clever! I guess thats how Armenians handle the truth - they delete it!</li>
</ul>
<p>so my armenian friends what you are doing is unethical. if you want a change bring it here if not it means edit war.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 12:39, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was not following this discussion, just few points I would like to make. First, don't use qualifiers like <i>Armenian friends</i> here as if there are 'type' of editors. Second, Davison has no place here at all, he has a review of Hovannesian major work, he has written a work covering all three massacres, in his contribution regarding the Armenians in Lewis book published in 1983(in which Lewis estimates the losses of Armenians between a million and a million and a half), he doesn't cover the issue. Isral Charny writes about thos who signed it in his study:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>several respondents indicated that</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>(a) they had no doubt about the essential truth of the Armenian genocide;</b></i></dd>
<dd><i><b>(b) they are fully aware of the Turkish government's intention to falsify the record through censorship, suppression and revision of the facts;</b></i></dd>
<dd><i><b>(c) and as to the advertisement itself, that they had not been aware that the Turks would use their call to open the archives to "prove" that there was no Armenian genocide, nor did they know that there would be repeated use of their statement beyond a single advertisement.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, we know that several of them do not question it, we know that in printed material Davison support the thesis most supported by the Accademia. Like I said, I am tired of revert wars, but definitly Davison doesn't go there, and if you are not a POV pusher you will stop with that. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:13, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look dude, he could be a garbage man, those are the results of the written answers he recieved from several who signed it. We have Davison own writtings and we have here evidences that the signature was allegedly a request to open the archives. It could have been enought to refer to Davison's publications, we now have a confirmation that he might be one of those. This is enought to remove him from the list. Lists should be based on what one wrote rather than some publicity published in the press, from many who are said to have signed it claimed not questioning the Armenian genocide. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:41, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i dont care about Davidson. I just say we are not supposed to belive anything that you write. You came up with that some time ago but never shoved a clue. just show us a page or some thing that we can see for our selves! I dont belive it because if had it been true it would give Armenians a great opportunutiy to ridicule and discredit Turkis claims. And why for gods sake none of these profs came out and said "ok guys we signed it but it was different at that time". this was not a regular puplic letter. And Profs were carelessly signing it risking their credibility? Now we are supposed to belive you or Charney. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 15:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>now again the samething. I want to see something where Charney shows us these letters he got from these scolars and in return you talk about Davidson. cool.

<dl>
<dd>Well sorry, this is not how it works, we have a published material from Davison, and regardless as far as I remember he reedited it in his Essays in Ottoman and Turkish history, 1774-1923 which was published in 1990, 5 years after 1985. This coupled with the doubt we have about whatever or not he does recognize it(when we must trust rather his works to begin with), any uses of his name beyond the reference to the advertisement is simply speculative and might hurt the scholar, in that that, if the information is wrong it makes it as if he is supporting something which he does not. You claim he does, it is up to you to show us this. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 15:50, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ahh trying to change the subject like a denialist. as I said before I dont care about Davidson and I dont care so much if his name is here or not it is only a minor issue in this f*** up article. What I am saying is "you are coming up with huge claims like "charney demonstrated that many of these scolars were tricked into something that they did not mean to" and you cant show a reliable source". this is the second time you are saying this still nothing!

<p>I just uploaded this image of Armenian women who were crucified during the Genocide. I really think we should add this photo to the article. I really think this picture disproves any notion that this was an ordinary "relocation" march. Also, can anyone here (namely the Turks) give a rational reason as to why this picture shouldn't be used besides the cliche platitudes of forgeries, biases, and embellishments?

<p>I am surprised to see you arguing again about what you by the way always refer to as the genocide, or as you like to put it "the so-called genocide". I showed you the numbers including the ones by McCarthy, and the proportions as well, I did not see ANY comment of yours regarding those numbers. My friend coming here and posting general "philosophical" stuff is not enough, you have to be scientific, be able to work with the material and simple numbers. So far I see you failing to do that. You repeat that there is enough proof out there somewhere that what happened does not constitute an act of genocide. I called and encouraged you to a discussion based on facts and numbers from different sources.</p>
<p>You know what is the difference btw your approach and that of the author of this article? It is the difference btw the lawer working with whatever material available (role of the author of the article) and someone that likes criticizing sitting in the kitchen (the role of yours). If you want to be taken serious and discuss the issue I am afraid you have to make the effort to think and dig into the literature, otherwise your comments do look rediculous.</p>

<p>It is not for us to be scientific here, thats the job of scholars as Fadix rightly pointed out somewhere. If you were a bit more attentive you would also notice here and in the archives that many valid arguments that reject the genocide thesis were submitted to the talk page and, sadly, the all too frequent response from the genocide camp was to accuse the scholars of being on the government payroll, of being nationalists or questioning their integrity etc. In other words the effort of discussing this issue has been nothing but a tremendous waste of time so please stop wasting everybody's time because we have better things to do. 83.78.49.129 19:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny - while I have seen certain folks claiming that there was no Armenian Genocide - I have yet to see any actual valid arguments that I would consider even remotely impuning such. Instead what we get is rather like the "argument clinic" from Monty Python...with the on-spot critique that contradiction alone does not make for a valid argument. Arguments are based upon evidence and supositions which are then proven by facts and data. All the counter genocide folks seem to be able to do is ad hominem attacks and saying "no it isn't" because some Turkish government pamplet says Turks are not capable of evil by definition and such...well thats not really an argument just then is it...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 23:14, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have never used this argument - however there is no doubt that lack of an Armenian state and an international voice for Armenians made it nearly impossible for Armenians to seek and recieve justice in the years imediatly following the Genocide and even up to the recent past. However the issue of the continued success of Turkish denial has more to do with the position of the Republic of Turkey and it geo-political and economic importance - initially due to its resources, commerical oppurtunities (and the competition for trade concessions) and debt situation (which the allies - particualrly France wished to recover. Turkey and the remains of the Ottoman Empire were the richest prize in modern history - an oppurtunity for the Western nations unlike any that had existed since the discovery of the Americas. Then after World War II of course Turkey's position as a bulwark against the Soviet Union and its close proximity as a base of operations against it furthered the perception of the west that it must do everything possible to not upset Turkey and to keep it within the western sphere (and Ataturk and the following [shadow] governments have used this fact to their great advantage. Now of course there is the issue of the Islamic threat and the idea that Turkey is nominally the only Islamic democracy and certainly is considered as a bulwark against radical Islam that cannot be allowed to fall/falter or sway from its Western leanings. SO all these factors have tempered any words or actions to upset Turkey and Turkey has made it most clear that (charges concerning) the Armenian Genocide is taboo subject #1 and has consistently applied threats and pressure to blackmail Western states and insitutions from recognition and any effort to force Turkey to come to terms with this issue. That is why it is "unresolved" not because there is any issue with the known facts that we have from all cooberated eyewitness testimony of the period and from serious unbiased scholarly analysis since. As to why (beyond the obvious of not wanting to admit and be known in history as a genocidal nation akin to Hitler's Germany) Turkey is in such fierce denial. I will let you ponder the quite insightful words of Turkish scholar Taner Akcam - (my preface)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dr. Taner Akcam – an ethnically Turkish sociologist who has researched and written several books concerning the reasons for and the role of the Armenian Genocide and its denial within the Ottoman/Turkish socio-political landscape makes a great many salient observations concerning how the situation in the Ottoman Empire came to genocide for the Armenians and why the current Republic of Turkey has such difficulty coming to terms with it. His insights should be considered by Turks, Armenians and others alike as they contain the possibility of breeching the gap in competing nationalistic rhetoric among peoples who cannot seem to do so. The following are some very relevant quotes concerning this issue of national forgetfulness and failure to come to terms with one’s past from his introduction to his book <i>From Empire to Republic – Turkish Nationalism and the Armenian Genocide</i> – He begins by explaining that Turkey underwent a transition from a multi-nationalistic empire to becoming a nation-state based on nationalistic lines and that this process of nation building always entails a degree of distortion and forgetfulness of the past (in this case that which is forgotten is the process of “othering” other ethnicities of the empire – and the violent criminal actions that this ultimately led to – and <b>the replacement with a national myth based on the idea of the victimhood of the Turkish people vis-a-vis outside Imperialistic powers where the minorities are only seen as pawns of these outside powers who are used and manipulated to bring about the empires destruction and ultimate dismemberment</b>. Akcam also makes a strong case for the continuity of the Ottoman elites as the rulers of the new Republic and this as a major stumbling block for past admissions…So without further ado –</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“<b>The Turkish Republic was born out of the destruction of the Christian populations in Anatolia and the establishment of a homogeneous Muslim state. The Armenian Genocide was the epitome of the policy of destruction and was declared a taboo subject immediately after the creation of the Republic</b>. One important reason for this declaration was the connection between the Genocide and the foundation of the Republic. <b>The Republic was founded to a significant degree by the members of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which was responsible for the implementation of the wholesale deportation and massacres against the Armenian population of Anatolia</b>. The authority of the Ottoman civil-military elite continued, uninterrupted, into the period marking the establishment of the Turkish Republic. This elite perceived the Christian population of Anatolia, and especially the Armenians, as internal foes working for foreign imperialist interests and the destruction of the Ottoman Empire.”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“(Turkish) Individuals who call for an open debate are stigmatized as treasonous and enemies of the nation. <b>Scholarly activity has been locked into a cycle of verification or denial of what happened in history, as opposed to analyzing the socio-political and historical factors that allowed that history to unfold</b>. We are lagging in the task of addressing the real question of why the Armenian Genocide occurred. <b>There existed in 1915 a confluence of general factors – social, political, historical, and cultural – that combined in such a way as to make implementation of genocide possible. These general factors must be viewed in conjunction with the specific factors, both political and psychological, that made the implementation of genocide seem desirable to those in power in 1915. Turkish nationalism in the years of the Empire’s decline played an important role</b>.”</dd>

<dd>“If Turkey is to develop from an authoritarian, bureaucratic state into a standard Western democracy, it must come to terms with history and take a critical approach towards the problems surrounding national identity. For this to occur…<b>the dominance of the denial syndrome must be overcome</b>, and direct interaction between Turkish and Armenian societies must take place. <b>The basic problem was and remains today the continuation of the ruling elite from the Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic</b>. This continuity is one of the biggest impediments to democratization.” --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 14:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I knew that this would be your (entirely worthless) response...perhaps I should have just added it myself...ie "Certain Turks claim that the (meticulously researched and highly respected...OK I added this part...) insights and positions of (Dr.)Akcam - by virtue of past arrest and imprisonment by Turkish authorities for association with an outlawed group pressing for expanded human rights in Turkey - automatically can be discounted and ignored...likewise we demand that Nelsom Mandella be recalled as President of South Africa due to his criminal past as a rabble rouser against a legitimate world government and we request that the State of Israel denounce Menacham Begin and that he be exhumed and stomped upon." (...of course Kemnal Ataturk was condemned to death by the Ottoman Government for actions against the Ottoman State...are his views likeiwse incapable of being considered? Should we judt consider that the government he founded is illegitimate due to his criminal past?) Again - no response or demonstrated ability to deal with actual relevent facts and issues....just ad homenim attack...this is called avoidance and denial.

<p><small>I agree with Inshanee "showing that one image has been forged does not mean that all images have been forged, nor does it mean that all of the claims about the events have been forged." But one has to admit that we are seeing a very spesific pattern here [<a href="http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/forgeries.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/forgeries.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], [<a href="http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/articles/article10.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/articles/article10.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]. Remember Andonian forgeries, Hitler quote, quotes attributed to Talat or Mustafa kemal which are still in armeniapedia or other web sites. Dear Marshall The famous painting above was enlarged and shown to the Canadian public in the 1970's, in the Yerevan Pavilion at the annual Metro International Carovan festivities in Toronto, as proof of "Armenian genocide". See the photo I uploaded. This is also a famous photo of Mustafa kemal but reckless Armenian propagandists are so sure that they wont get a reply still use it (or who will hear the reply? only Turks probably). There are a lot of pictures said to be genocide photo but only Armen wenger photos are surely known to be from that time and event. Others are all suspicious given many forgery cases. (especially the one where "ottoman soldiers" pose in front of heads. imagine! you take cut off heads go to a photo studio or call the photographer (in dar el zor "desert" or burned down Van province) set up a nice table put the heads and say cheese.)And ofcourse all photos are not photoshoped. just miss presentation of a photo from a different time or event is a forgery.</small></p>
<p><small>I also partly agree with Inshanee when he says ”It's POV and demonstrates nothing of relevance” about forged photos, but he or anyone else has to explain us what the Turkihs denial Advertisement in the article demonstrates? What is its relevance? For me it only shows that the Diaspora puts at least 400.000 dollars (a full page in The times!) for a hate advertisement instead of building a school or orphanage in Armenia.</small></p>
<p><small>I am asking once again what is the source of the first photo in the article. who are these soldiers. who are the dead people? What is the date? if no one gives a satisfying answer it should be deleted.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 00:36, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><small>So what if some Jewish leaders don't recognize the Armenian Genocide? Shame on them, each and every one of them. Many of them don't recognize the <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>, the Cambodian Genocide, the Sudanese Genocide, and think the Holocaust is its own entity that no one else can share such a victim role.

Researchers don't treat the subject as religious dogma, they do go after the facts, collect more data, and might change their opinion, whenever they realize that the facts point to the other direction.

<dd><small>I agree with you partially, and disagree with some points. I disagree that the photos can possibly demonstrate anything. Find any major historical event since the invention of the camera, and I'll show you some rather silly faked photos. Just because faked photos exist does not say anything about the authenticity of the event itself, and trying to draw that connection is POV original research. On the other hand, you bring up a valid point about the image source. With no information whatsoever, it is definatly hard to make a case for its inclusion in this article (or any). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 01:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<h2><small><span class="mw-headline">Deconstructing revisionism and preserving the neutrality of this article</span></small></h2>
<p><small>Well, the state of this article forced me to return. As the author of TAT was patiently waiting the occasion to hit once more. For the interested, here I evidence with my merging test that Deepblue06 and 24,211,192,250 are indeed the same users. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fadix/evidencepage/Holdwater" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fadix/evidencepage/Holdwater" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Obviously Holdwater(the author of TAT), who in the past was also known under his other Wikipedia login User:Torque. Deepblue06 and 24,211,192,250 have been used one after the other to escape 3RR block.</small></p>
<p><small>Isen't it amazing that I quit and soon after the page is respammed by materials which have mostly been addressed?</small></p>
<p><small>Neuro, I like when you use the term forgery, since I shall now show you few example of forgeries you brought yourself in the very same page.</small></p>
<p><small>Lets first deal with the picture of Ataturk with the dead body, which is said to be an Armenian forgery. Is it so? The picture in question was exibited to announce a conference about Denial, 'The Face of Denial.' The picture is indeed photoshoped, but it never was claimed to be an original, the photoshoped version is symbolic. Ataturk staying there represent the modern republic of Turkey, which is totally indifferent regarding the body of the dead child there. The child which was photoshoped and merged to Ataturks famous picture with the little dog, is one of the most famous picture used in published media. One of the pictures taken by Wegner. It is widelly available on the web. <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Image:Wegner-DSC_0126.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Image:Wegner-DSC_0126.JPG" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></small></p>
<p><small>The title actually say it well, 'The Face of Denial.' Forgery imply an intent to mislead. While this was a 'collage' a work of art, a marging which was symbolic. Turkaya Ataov was totally clueless, and I wonder how it could have been interpreted the way Ataov interpreted it, an interpretation which you recycled.</small></p>
<p><small>Comming to 'Hovhannes Katchaznouni' 'admissions,' this has been already addressed by me after it has been posted, follow my reply. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Armenian_Genocide/Archive_6#An_Armenian_Source:_Hovhannes_Katchaznouni" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Armenian_Genocide/Archive_6#An_Armenian_Source:_Hovhannes_Katchaznouni" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></small></p>
<p><small>Comming to your 'brand new' translation from Bolshevik Zakavkazya. You are quite fluent in Turkish I must say, since it does not concord with the original Russian version but rather the tainted Turkish version provided by Mehmet Perincek.</small></p>
<p><small>You claim that according to Boghos Nubar there was between 300,000 to 400,000 Armenians who have died and you claim having the document from French archive. Be glad to provide it to me, it'll be nice, since Boghos Nubar provides over a million. See for example, footnote number 21 in this article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Armenian_casualties" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Armenian_casualties" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></small></p>
<p><small>You also claim that ASALA assassinate over 200, while unrelated to the article, feel free to provide the relevant materials to support such a claim.</small></p>
<p><small>Here, I won't even bother addressing 24.211.192.250 who knows I have addressed the many fabricated quotes which he present in his website, and thinking I have left has used the occasion to recycle them here once more.</small></p>
<p><small>But just for the sake of it, I shall maybe raise Bronsart cases, which is recycled again and over again, just to show what sort of materials revisionists rely on.</small></p>
<p><small>Let see his admission of the Armenian destruction in closed doors. “Namely, the Armenian is just like the Jew, a parasite outside the confines of his homeland, sucking off the marrow of the people of the host country. Year after year they abandon their native land—just like the Polish Jews who migrate to Germany—to engage in usurious activities. Hence the hatred which, in a medieval form, has unleashed itself against them as an unpleasant people, entailing their murder.” (A. A. Bonn. Goppert Papers (Nachlass), vol. VI, file 5 (files 1-8), p. 4, February 10,1919). I shall for now exclude the many other 'interesting' thing about the man.</small></p>
<p><small>But, let provide other examples of forgeries 24.211.192.250 provides, which he knows them to be forgeries, since I corrected him in the past and he still recycle them.</small></p>
<p><small>Cited from Mikael Varandean, "History of the Dashnaktsutiun." The quote presented does not exist, I have provided him the content of the pages from which it supposedly come from, the work is on two volume, and it is neither in one nor the other on the page mentioned(and I see now that he just removed the page), but neither is it anywhere in both of those volumes.</small></p>
<p><small>Grace H. Knapp, The Tragedy of Bitlis, Fleming H. Revell Co., New York (1919) , page 146. This is one of the most infamious distortion, this book from one cover to the other relate to the destruction of the Armenians in Bitlis. Shall I quote from the book about what was happenong the the Armenians?</small></p>
<p><small>Other forgeries? Well, Nikolayev supposed reports originating from the Ottoman archives, part of the supposed Russian records prepared by the Ottoman Empire, like General Mayewski 'report' presented by Major Mehmet Sadik who was an intelligence officier at the General Staff Department II engaged in literaly fabricating Russian reports to justify the decision taken against the Armenians. So, it isen't surprising that the said memoir of Tatiana Karameli which you present only exist in Turkish and found in Ottoman archive listed also in the series 'dismissing' the Armenian massacres.</small></p>
<p><small>Forgeries you say? I can load the talk page with example of forgeries, non existing quotes, not only comming from TAT site, but also academics of the Turkish republic. And believe me, this reply was rather short, considering the many worthyness of the copypasting job made by Holdwater under yet again, another pseudonym. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:15, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

I wonder what he had to say about an image uploaded from Armeniapedia, which is definetely, looking the issue from a certain point of view. InShaneee calls these sites as propaganda sites. Without certain references and evidences, I urge the administration to remove that image, which constitutes a clear bias to a newcomer to the article.</small></dd>

Dear Fadix, please do not edit my comments by dividing them into half, and posting your comment in between. By saying that `I already proposed its removal` you sound like you are an authority. If you read my comment you will not see a direct proposition to you about the removal. Anyone who spends a mere half an hour in the archive pages (let alone your personal blocks) can understand your biased position to the subject. So please do not act like this. This is a common page, and I propose it to the community.</small></p>

<dd><small>I removed that picture myself, before it was reverted long time ago, I also agreed to its removal in the archive. I will not bring back things there. CoolCat placed a tag for deletion for my replacement picture while it was sourced, and while I was out of Wikipedia, it was deleted without my consent, if you read the archive, you will see that Cansin, the Turk with whom I discussed and I agreed that the picture which I requested to replace this one was indeed sourced. I do not own this article, it is very difficult to work on it, when from one side, there is Thoth who discuss about anything but the article and others like Neurobio. Also, about my biases, while I may be biased in the talkpage, you should judge my contributions according to the edits in the articles mainspace. Everyone here or anywhere else in Wikipedia are probably biased about a subject, but unlike some who will register an account to pretend to be an uninvolved party, I do not deny being Armenian, neither do I deny having a POV about the issue. What I deny though, is that my contribution in the articles mainspace is biased.

<p><small>thanks for removing that mispresented picture where Russian Soldiers were standing in front of killed people (maybe they killed these poor people). It is presented as a genocide picture and in some sites it was presented as "Turkish soldiers posing in front of dead armenians". It was so obvious that these were Russian soldiers. And you know what some of the poor dead guys seemed to have a circumcisition. Unlucky that we dont have a better resolution. Actually this picture seemed more like "armenian volunteers posing in front of their Muslim victims". Any way it is my speculation but more logical than saying that these are Turkish soldier who are wearing russian army clothes enmasse.</small></p>

<dd><small>Actually, getting the enemy naked and dressing its uniform was common practice. Or else, there is no reason to undress the enemy. As for circumcision, not a good indicator, Armenians were too. You could ask Syrian and Lebanese Armenians, you will find many who are circumcised, and they are not in the Ottoman Empire anymore.

To call what happend or the relations between the victims and the perpetrators of the genocide a "conflict" is absurd, insulting to the victims, and entirely POV. Whats next? Was what happend at Auschwitz a "conflict" between the Nazis and the Jews?

<dd><small>In my opinion, various sections should probably be rewriten. One of the problem with Wikipedia articles, is when an editor work, he classify things based on the materials he add, and consider it as an end in itself. When an article grow, sometimes there is forced patching. It is much like an open source software like Blender, adding, adding codes, and then, we come to a situation in which the sotware should be totally reworked.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>The example, is about those western scholars who oppose to the word genocide, as if opposing to the term makes them support the Turkish government and Turkish scholars position, which is not so. There is for instance a clear differences between Halacoglu belief that only 56,000 Armenians perished during the evacuation and that less than 10 thousand were killed and Lewis who maintained the range of 1-1.5 million Armenian victims while opposing the term genocide(even though in his earlier work used the term Holocaust, which was kept in its Turkish translation). This situation is a forced 'glueing' of new material. Only Stanford Shaw and Justin McCarthy among all named really qualify as supporting the Turkish government position. Other scholars should rather be included in another section. It think I will address this in the article I will creat on the term genocide and its applicability in the Armenian cases. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:51, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>I came up with examples of weasel words so that we can make a easy start. that is just a simple wiki policy still there is much opposition even to that. Fadix says "This situation is a forced 'glueing' of new material" about opposing historians. he has a point yet he still misses we have come to this point because you want to present the issue as Turkey vs the World. if you say opposition should be adressed propery then you should let us to adress it properly. the first step may be to stop using Denial title.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 19:41, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>What example you came up with? The second is a quote, quotations are positions in principle, they can contain 'weasel words.' The first one can not be changed, unless there is any other wording for that, the it is said, is not used to place the emphases on the 'it is' but for the 'genocide,' there is no other wordings which could effectivally replace it. And please don't place intentions on my contribution. Yes! This issue is mostly Turkey vs the world, at least vs the West, I am not making up anything, just pay attention to the published literature. Just as a side note, pay attention to the number of sites which deny the Armenian genocide, how many of them are not from Turks, Turkish government, Turkish associations. On the other hand, I could provide various sites which are not made by Armenians relating to the genocide. This is the exact representation you will find in the accademia. That revisionists uses scholars like Lewy further support this. The official Turkish government position is in clear contradiction with Lewy revisionist position, only does Shaw and McCarthy maintains the Turkish government position, the others that are said to not use the term genocide, covers the subject with elements which are opposit to the official revisionist thesis vehiculated by the Turkish government. that the article gives the impression that it is Turkey vs the World does not mean in any way that those who contributed to it have intentions to picture it as such. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:56, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>Tukey vs World? not really... the issue is much more complex than that. Some other historians do not portray the issue as the Turkish position but they are strictly against Genocide term. just like many other Turkish and international scolars and intellectuals. So obviously this is not really present in the article. if this is a history article, and there are historians (it is not in our authority to judge on their academic value) opposing the orthadox thesis in one way or another, their position should be the one presented just after the "genraly accepted story", if not in the main article body. But there is only one paragraph for historian opposition which is under constant vandalism. yet novelist like Pamuk and other turkish pro-genocide activist (none of them being a real historian) have their 3-4 paragraphs.</small></p>
<p><small>according to wiki guidelines one has the right to remove uncited lines. Second one has the right to change weasel words and wiki strongly encourages it. So do I have to show you each and every uncited, weasel word. I just brought it up here with <b>ramdom</b> examples to avoid an edit war. But it is wiki who suggests us to do so. why is that reaction?</small></p>
<p><small>So If by citing a name it is posible to come up with a huge and generally undocumented claim and present it in the "orthadox story"<b>than we obviously and undoubtfully have the right to equaly refer to the opposition in the entire article</b>. Or I can come up with "historian xxx cites that "a commander in erzurum withnessed that armenians wearing Turkish army uniforms or kurdish dressing were constantly attacking armenian villages in Turkey inorder to inflame riots among armenian comunity" (whic probably has better documentations than clean up story). Also is that cited historian or person spesificly talking about documents related to "genocide" or is it just other documents which include other secrets that should be kept away from the invading army. One should remember that armenian issue was not Ottoman Empires one and only trouble at that time. By citing it under this article and under Trials title you automaticly give the impression to the reader that Talat and budies cleaned their orders to exterminate armenians(as if it was possible to clean every thing without a trace). Is it what the histoian or the "eye withness" really mean? I doubt that. At least that citations need to have something like "however this claim is not fully supported and also it is not possible to know if these documents contain any evidence related to armenian events"<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 22:49, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>Look, you have claimed not knowing much the subject and now you are lecturing and disagreeing with an element of knowledge, about a subject which you have already admitted not knowing much.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>This entry is not only about the applicability of the term genocide, in fact, it also relates to what is called the Armenian massacre. You claim various historians, but this is not so, even various Western Turkish historians who deny the Armenian genocide have a position which contradicts the official position of the republic of Turkey. Do you want a comparaison? I will provide them if wanted. Even Lewy position is different. Shall we quote from 'The First Genocide of the 20th Century'? The paper he submitted to the Commentary Vol. 120, december 2005?</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small><i>THE TERM "genocide," coined in 1944 by the Polish-Jewish emigre lawyer Raphael Lemkin, was meant to describe Hitler's then-on-going campaign to exterminate the Jews of Europe. But Lemkin's interest in this most heinous of crimes--what he and others would define as the planned effort to destroy an entire people or ethnic group--long predated the rise of the Nazis. The atrocities that first drew him to the issue emerged from a different world war and a different context. They were the vicious actions not of Germans against Jews in the early 1940's but of Ottoman Turks against Turkey's Armenian minority in 1915-16.</i></small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>Also, mind you that beside the Holocaust, according to Lewy, there was no other genocide. I must have been sleeping when I have read that paper of his for the first time, for I haven't pied attention that he is calling what happened in Rwanda not more than an ethnic cleaning. He claims that the term genocide neither applies to the Armenians, nor Rwanda, nor the Gypsies in WWII, nor the American Indians and the list is growing.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>Here, this should clearly be differenciated with the plain denial of the murders, applicability of the term genocide does not amount to be caracterised and dumped as someone supporting the official Turkish government position. I have already shown a passage Hurewitz review about a work which contains primnary records from German sources regarding the treatment of the Armenians, which he consider the treatment of the subject as being a mature judgement and [with] convincing argument. That you rely on such a thing as an advertisement with signatures to attach scholars name as if they have all covered the subject, is indicative that it is indeed mostly about the West and the World. You can not glue what you propose in the article, when you have few vocal scholars to suggest that the opposition is more than a minority. Justin McCarthy himself personally admit that his view is the view of a minority.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>As for weasel words, I repeat again, you have shown two examples, one is a quote, a -quote-, you are suggesting that I modify a statment made by someone in a quote, because that statment contains 'weasel words.' The other wording which you caracterise as weasel word, is only weasel word if you suppose that the emphasis is on the <i>it is,</i> while it is on the word genocide. That term removed, it will be worded as follows: <i>It is the second most studied genocide.</i> This will be presenting it as if it being a genocide is the truth, while the term 'it is said' suggest that it might or might not be genocide.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>Again, if you can propose any other wordings, do so, or else please stop throwing me stuff and giving me the option of deleting them.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>As for the wiki guideline, please read the tags on the top of this talkpage, do you want me to quote them? I agreed to discuiss, which I do, your behavior will only bring members into a revert war, not me, because I don't engage in revert wars, I rarely if ever revert more than 2 times.</small></dd>

<p><small>I see that he still continue deleting without using the talk page. But the most ridiculous deletion of all is that the International League of Nations does not recognize it as genocide, which is simply and plainly wrong. The original Fédération internationale des ligues des Droits de l'Homme which covers the last time I have checked, over a hundred organizations, not only the French. And which actually recognize the Armenian genocide and has published various works covering it, mistaking it with the one based in New York. The original one which covers the French League of human rights has been founded in 1922, while the other one, which took that name, but in English has been founded in 1942(they claim prior, but it really got its international statu then). Both organizations originate from a French organization. The ILHR originate from the Défense de Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen, while the FIDH the French League of human rights, and which from its original name is the Fédération internationale des ligues des droits de l'homme. <a href="http://www.fidh.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fidh.org/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> The one based on New-York, does not speak in the name of the organizations, but rather is an entity, while the other does. --<a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 15:30, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>these headings are there for 1 year and there has been no conflict on them among regular contributers until John smith and Karl Meier decided they know better. I thank john smith since he is a reasonable man. he quited adding when I explained him the situation. But Karl Meier is not participating in any discussion and despite my explanation he doent stop. he has nothing to say in discussion page yet he thinks has the authority to change a title which is there almost for 1 year with a consensus. besides his headings are inacceptable and does not comply with encylopedic requirements. by the way it is cool to ask for protection instead of stoping that user you know what I am saying marshall.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 23:57, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><small>Neurobio's messages on my talkpage, was essentially nothing but personal attacks, and I of course removed them on sight. Anyway, the current headings doesn't make any sense. It is a fact that there is some who recognize and some who deny that the killings of more than a million people was a case of genocide, and I don't see why it should be controversial to mention that. There is no-one who oppose or support the Genocide, as it is a historical event, and the current headers will only confuse our readers. The only opposition to my editing has been from Turkish pro-denialist editors, that continue to argue that the previous headers has been there for a long time, and that it somehow makes them "neutral". However, still noone has explained why the more new headers with their more straight forward titles should be against Wikipedias policies regarding neutrality. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 17:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>Because you are assuming that the genocide contention is universal, which its NOT! You mention that only Turkey and its lobby reject the thesis, but many other countries and scholars side with the Turks on this matter whatever the reason for that may be. As long as this is the case, you cannot accuse those that reject the thesis as being denialists and thus dilute their message by drawing comparisons with the Jewish holocaust denialists (where apart from rogue regimes like that of Iran, the acceptance is universal)! That is plain misleading! And again I repeat: nobody is arguing that massacres were not committed against Armenians, what is being vehemently rejected here is to make this conflict a one sided story by claiming that it was an act of genocide! <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 06:00, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>As for your comment, beside mathematic laws there is nothing universal. About the Holocaust, there actually is more people who deny the Holocaust than the Armenian genocide. Visit, Iran, Irak, Syria, Pakistan etc., most of the population in such country's probably think of the event as a 'Zionist' conspiration. Also, in the west, there indeed scholars who openly deny the Holocaust, Zundel, Rudolf, Irving, Rassinier, Faurisson are just few examples. There is no much more Western scholars who deny the Armenian genocide than those who deny the Holocaust. The differences is that those who deny the Holocaust are more cautious because of threat of legal action. If France pass the law on denial(which BTW I oppose very strongly to), you could expect that in France that the Ottoman chairs will have to be completly restructured even as going as far as to forbiden financings from Turkey.--<a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:56, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>True but most of the people you site in your example come from third world countries frequently under some form of dictatorial rule. Not only that, most of these people are uneducated and prey to fundamentalism and, as you probably know, fudnamentalism teaches you to hate others for their differences! Personally I dont like the French for their faux cul attitude and for that very reason I am glad they got their asses whipped last night!

<dd><small>But this could be applied to Turkey too, that you will find those who accept the thesis of genocide per population in open minded cities where the level of education is the highest like Istanbul is again comparable(or either this or some eastern Kurdish populated villages where the government control is the weakest). The Turks who I have met on the internet and who accept the event were all without exception students of higher education. My first friend Ceyhun was a PhD in psychology, another one from now dead Turkey.com was completing a PhD degree, another one has now returned in Turkey and is teaching in a historty field. Another one has a master degree in a science discipline. Obviously education in this cases is making a lot of difference as 100% of the Turks I have met who recognize it had all beyond Bachelor degrees. For sure the sample size is too small to find any causality here between education and recognition, but this is the appearence we do have. Another appearence, those that tend to recognize it were all critical of nationalism. About the French getting their cul kicked, Italia is a much more closed society than France, check the players in the French team. Also rumors want that Zidane was called a terrorist and his mother being insulted by the guy he head kicked, knowing the trend of xenophobia circulating in some Italian societies within the country, would not surprise me to play that cheap. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:27, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>come on man, dont get me started with the French, their team almost exclusively composed of arabs and africans reflects their hypocritical nature, the French are well known for their racist attitudes, one just needs to observe the prejudices against their second class citizens living in ghettos with very high unemployment, not very different from the aborginies in Australia. As for your correlation between the level of education and the acceptance of the genocide thesis, the sample is indeed much too small to may any reasonable inference and I must be the first exception to your observations since my education is above that of a bachelors and I have never lived in TR&#160;:-) <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 06:11, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Lutherian, how many countries actually say genocide did not happen, as opposed to not recognising it? It's well accepted that the reason some countries don't accept it is that they don't want to piss Turkey off, which has stated it will take action against countries that formally recognise it - e.g. when it threatened sanctions against France earlier this year. Guess what happened - the vote was shelved. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 11:24, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>It certainly didnt stop France from recognizing the so called genocide a couple of years ago so I dont see why a veiled Turkish threat now would change matters. Also, I dont think you read my comment above carefully enough, I did point out that they remained silent for whatever reason. If countries like France who did and still does enjoy good commercial ties with Turkey piss them off, I dont see why others would not.

<dd><small>Turkey did pass restrictions on business with France and proposed tougher ones this time. The decision for countries like the UK and US is to do with business and politics (Turkey is important for many countries due to its geographical position) - it's nothing to do with whether they think it was genocide or not. Fadix also made a good point about the Holocaust being denied by some countries and academics, just as with the Armenian deaths. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 20:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>You exagerate the importance of Turkey's commercial ties, especially with developed countries, its really no big deal economically speaking. Its strategic value and importance has also been eroded significantly since the collapse of the Berlin wall and that is a fact! You are not going to tell me that the sole superpower of this world is at the mercy of a third world country when it comes to taking a stance on such an important matter especially considering the power of the Armenian lobby. <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 06:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Actually, Turkey's strategic importance grew more vital after the USSR collapsed. The United States needed staging areas for military air strikes against Iraq during the entire 1990s and for the enforcement of no-fly zones, and it was only until 2003, when Turkey refused to allow US troop movements to invade Iraq, did Turkey's importance begin to deteriorate militarily. Economically, French businessmen for example, were warned by Turkey's leaders that their businesses would collapse with their countries if the law to deny the Genocide was to pass which made them oppose the bill. And please, quit with the childish Armenian lobby fairy tales; it has nothing in terms of power and its time Turks finally discontinue their own self-delusion in constantly projecting it as if its some monolithic giant that stomps through one obstacle over another just to get what it wants. If it truly was as powerful as you say it is, the Genocide would have passed in the United States decades ago. The United Nation's subcommittees have agreed and verified the event as Genocide. Failure to remark it as such by the General Assembly or say, the UNSC, is irrelevant and misleading to say the organization hasn't recognized it as Genocide.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 01:09, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>According to the Permanent People's Tribunal, it was the UN Commission on Human Rights: "In 1971, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights asked its Sub-Committee on the fight against discriminatory measures and the rotection of minorities, comprising independent experts, to undertake a 'study of the question of the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide.' In 1973 and 1975, the two interim reports which were submitted to the Sub-Committee by the special rapporteur contained a paragraph 30 which read as follows: '<b>In modern times, attention should be drawn to the existence of fairly abundant documentation relating to the massacre of the Armenians, considered as the first genocide of the twentieth century.'</b>In the final report submitted to the Commission in 1979, the aforementioned paragraph 30 was omitted" due to protestations made by the Turkish delegation present at the committee's hearings. See the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities' report which affirms and refers to the events of 1915 as a Genocide here: <a href="http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.169/current_category.6/affirmation_detail.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.169/current_category.6/affirmation_detail.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.

<dd><small>I entirely agree - the denilaist position is given more then undue weight in this article - to the point of embarrasment. The "Turkish position" as presented in this article is merely a list of unsupported (and largely already discredited) suppositions. They have no place in this article taking up the amount of space that they do when the article is lacking in presenting a tremendous amount of substantsiated material that documents the acts of genocide against the Armenians (check out the detail presented in the Holocaust article for instance). The Armenian Genocide article demands precisely this level of detail if not more - if only because its denial is so prevelant. And denialist trolls such as Lutherian should not be tolerated. Their aim is stricly to disrupt the process of portraying the truth and create confusion - and we are letting it suceed at this reprehensible task. shame. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 14:11, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>There are some who deny that the killings commited by Turkey was a case of genocide, and there is nothing wrong with calling them "denialists". It is very accurate. Another thing is that there seems to be a lot of "new" IP-address editors appearing in articles where other editors are opposing your editing, supporting you with reverts.

<h2><small><span class="mw-headline">ASALA</span></small></h2>
<p><small>I came to this page and am surprised that it doesn't have a mention of Asala, a group of armenian ultra-nationalists who committed numerous terrorist atrocities in the name of Geno-lies recognition. Instead we have trivia concerning a song made up by some third rate metal band.</small></p>
<p><small><br /></small></p>
<p><small><a name="THE_REASON_WHY_WE_DON.27T_SEE_ASALA_IN_THIS_PAGE" id="THE_REASON_WHY_WE_DON.27T_SEE_ASALA_IN_THIS_PAGE"></a></small></p>
<h2><small><span class="mw-headline">THE REASON WHY WE DON'T SEE ASALA IN THIS PAGE</span></small></h2>
<p><small>Dear newcomer. I am a senior relative to you but relative to the other guys here, I am still a newcomer to this article. First of all, in this article, there is no Neutral Point of View policy, nor a valid accurate perspective. The people who "support" some aspects of this article, which has always been questionable - I do not say certain or vice versa -are the ones who control the page and unfortunately they are more than the people who support the opposite questionable parts. We once had something going on in this talk page, and before a consensus was achieved nobody would attack and spam the article. Any knowledgeable person will certainly find this article biased not only because the editors are one-sided, but also the article has a strong shift to their idea. You can for example check the online Brytannica- a real encyclopedia- which was edited by experts in the field, and you will see something very different. Do not waste your time here, because you will be immediately identified as a vandal, if you are to change for example the biased parts, such as references, and etc... Unfortunately, evertything according to these people showing the other side of the problem neutrally is problem. They cannot acccept that. Okay in Wiki, if you are a POV pusher, you will be exposed by the other neutral editors on an article. But what if there are 15-20 people who constantly bias the article&#160;? And what if whenever you revert, you become a vandal? What if you are using an anon account (even with a static ip ) and that is not effectively allowed in this page?( They think that anon users are by definition vandals.) No, there is no way out of this. What they seek is to post what they think. Not to introduce the whole problem. There are lots of extreme lines in the article-some of them are very silly details though - (like "he claims ... is converted to it is claimed"), but the other side's supporters are too tired to fight with these groups, since they don't have enough time, or they are fed up.</small></p>
<p><small>And what makes it even worse is that, imagine that you have a certain discussion and the most authorized person has nothing to do with it. All the admins who take care of this article , as far as I've seen, may not even know where Armenia is. They have some rules you have to attend and that is it. Never imagine that they make their own research and make decisions. They are using their Wikipedia Intuitions&#160;:) Of course you can't run a hospital if the man in charge is not even a nurse. That is the main problem. And what happened lately is that the guys who supported a single thought biased the article even more with unreferenced pictures, with irrelevant pictures, with photos that are agreed to be removed from the article etc..., and after they screamed and said the page was being vandalized (!) by anon users!!! And they called an admin and he locked the page. So, the admin did not even bother to check ,why the edit wars started in the first place! Their assumption is that if majority tells something is that way, it is true. What a shame, whan an apathy, what a sad situation. But it is not our problem since even 12 year olds can smell the bias in the air, and they are only making Wiki a worse place. I suggest you read a respectable encyclopedia if you want to see ASALA and other aspects of the problem. However, probably you will not see the metal band you are referring, not only because they are young, but also they are not the first and the last people to act like that.</small></p>
<p><small>IT is very sad that ASALA is not mentioned here. But as I said&#160;: You have nothing to do. So let them make it look like Armeniapedia which is another very very biased source. It is also in the references --128.211.201.37 22:40, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>Hi, thanks for your feedback, from what I understand you are questioning the neutrality of this article, examples would help, because from what I understand you criticise the pictures and the lack of information on ASALA but neither of those have directly to do with the text. For the pictures, I can not tell what really is the problem since I am not following recently what is happening in the mainspace, so I don't really know which pictures in particular have been added and removed or which ones are not recieving concesus. For ASALA, I can answer, there is an article on Wikipedia on ASALA. Personaly, I don't see how in an article covering what happened in the 1910s reference to events in 1970s and 1980s is relevent. Regards--<a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small><a name="Relevance" id="Relevance"></a></small></p>
<h2><small><span class="mw-headline">Relevance</span></small></h2>
<p><small>Asala articles' introduction&#160;: The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) was a Marxist-Leninist guerilla organization whose primary objective was to assassinate Turkish diplomats and politicians in revenge for the deaths inflicted upon the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
I think the relevance is obvious. There's an extremist group who - as the article suggests not me- seeks revenge of the events happened in 1910. In other words, there are some vicious terrorists ( terrorists are always vicious whatever they suport ) who kill some people in 1970s and 1980s for something happened in 1910s. SO there IS a connection right? Maybe too obvious to be included in this article</small></p>
<p><small>Moreover, if you are not following what's happening here (or maybe you just prefer to ignore since what's going on here is something you should like- based on your previous views- please check the site. Firstly, the abundance of pictures, secondly, admins who lock the article when there's a huge difference betweent the last lock and the current lock. This is outrageous. But there's noone you can tell it in Wikipedia. Because they don't know the issue. While Armeniapedia is a reliable reference but TAT is not, for example. I am sure you know that I am someone( not a sock puppet ) by your detective skills so you don't have to act like you don't know me.</small></p>
<p><small>This page has a very strong bias. And this bias is day-by-day growing thanks to fellow Armenians(they are always friends, I will never forget what I shared with many armenians, in France, Italy, Spain, in workcamps, and international forums). Support is substituted by Recognition, someone's claims becomes a general fact, extremist references are cited as reliable, irrelevant pictures are included, Pamuk's views are distorted, the word denial is excessively used and etcc etc etc... This is just I can notice.</small></p>
<p><small>Who to inquire with about these? Admins... And you can be sure that they are experts in the field. They are just teenage boys coming from the US ( you can take it as an insult if you want to ban me, these are my (almost) last entries in a biased source like this one )who have never heard of neither Armenia nor Turkey, or Genocide, or anything else UNLESS they are Armenian diaspora. Unfortunately, diaspora is not calm enough to be neutral, so relatively neutral people ( Turkish people really don't care about this because they are not schooled on this, and even if they are, it is not a big deal for them) just sit back and watch the show.</small></p>
<p><small>We have nothing to do with this page, and Fadix you can continue to act like a mild, understanding person, but I know you are not. That is sad. Just look at the page, and be happy because it only presents your views. Then please check with Brytannica. And compare. And that will make you understand WHY an encyclopedia cannot be formed by millions of users coming from different backgrounds especially on political subjects. This will decline in the future, because this enyclopedia even claims people to be murderer's...( You should know that story as fellow Wikipedians...)</small></p>
<p><small>Finally, it is disputable for you guys( especially the latest vandals like Meier for example) if these changes are that good. Okay, here's a suggestion&#160;: Just give a flavour of the opposite view so that the people who want to know the facts will not be stunned by your voluminous evidence, pictures, and references and that he will not suspect the factual accuracy of your views. Just leave a little bit of noise margin. This is an advice. Because if you go on this way, it will look like Armeniapedia which has a one line entry of Justin McCarthy, who opposes the web site's view, but has more than 3-4 pages about Elif Safak who speaks highly of her Armenian advocates.</small></p>
<p><small>Anyway, I just want you to see this constant bias, and I leave you alone&#160;:) Regards, and farewell --128.211.201.37 00:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><small>Again, you don't provide me examples. Your argument regarding ASALA makes no sense, this article at this stage is underdevelopped, I don't say that one day ASALA will not have a place, but at this stage, with the current form of the article, there is no way that you can pick anywhere in the mainspace to add such an information in a way that people won't start wondering what the hell that piece is doing there. There is no more relevency there than the Jewish vengence group who planed after WWII the poisoning of German central aqueducs.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>Secondly, about Armeniapedia vs TAT, I think it is very obvious why they don't compare. Armeniapedia author is known, that site is open, you can expend articles there, it is a Wiki. TAT is registered under proxy, the author using his anonymity slanders scholars, use fabricated references, that site is simply unreliable. This has been discussed here for way too much time. TAT will stay out from here, its name alone should have been enough to justify its exclusion, but people will add it back no matter if it has demonstrated fabrications, slanders against authors, false rumors about them. It is a site which could be shut down the day the proxy holder is threatened by legal actions by one of the authors there.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>This article provides more than enought space for the opposite side. Khmer rouge article, neith Rwanda genocide or even Bosnia massacres etc., with some cases that are even more disputed among the academia is there such space for the opposition as there is here.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>Regarding Britanica, the entry about the casulties use the same range of deaths as the one on Armenia on Britannica, which also uses the word genocide. I have also quoted from various Britannica issues from different periods to show that the entry here also concord. It concords with the entry on Universalis which tone is even more one sided. It isen't also much different than Encarta. None of the Encyclopedias gives anywhere near the space which is provided to the opposition. But sorry, you would expect a 50% coverage, something which I will never accept, neither any good intentioned Wikipedia, undue weight is unencyclopedic, and against NPOV policy and would even affect the general accuracy of this article.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>To be fair with you and not initiate noises on your erronous description of my intention or the Administrators here on Wikipedia, I will ignore the rest of the points you have raised here. If you do have any critics on sepecific sections of the article, you are welcome to present them here and discuss, but criticising the whole article without clarification is unconstructive.--<a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>
</dl>
<p><small>I completely agree. "System of a Down" also has its own article, but somehow, people made the space to include a metal band's songs in this article. But when it comes to adding a few sentences about ASALA terrorists murdering Turks for "genocide recognition" -- which this article discusses in other contexts -- nope, no space whatsoever to add ASALA, wouldn't flow, or whatever other excuse one can think of to leave it out.

<h2><small><span class="mw-headline">Yes - let historians decide</span></small></h2>
<p><small>The evidence...from German, Austrian and Turkish sources in my view leads inescapably to the conclusion that <b>the extermination of the Armenians was</b> actually <b>planned</b> by a clique within the Young Turk leadership and executed by the sinister Special Organization ("Teshkilati Mahsusa") of the army. - Dominic Lieven - Empire - Yale University Press, 2001</small></p>
<p><small>In fact most of the available evidence points to the conclusion that a systematic decimation of the Armenian population in the eastern provinces had already been decided on by the Ittihad ve Terakki regime, and that the troubles in Van and elsewhere merely served as a convenient excuse for getting a program of mass deportations and large-scale extermination. - Ulrich Trumpener, (Historian) - Germany and the Ottoman Empire.

<p><small>It is clear that the Ittihadist faction that took control of the Ottoman Empire in 1912 was the organizer of the Armenian genocide in 1915. The First World War presented the ruling triumvirate with an opportunity, as Djemal Pasha put it, to “free ourselves through the world war from all conventions which meant so many attacks on our independence.” He went on to say that “ We had determined on radical reform….” ...“radical reform” was to eliminate the Armenian problem by eliminating the Armenians. That that was their plan was confirmed at the time by Lord Bryce and Arnold Toynbee, Ambassador Morgenthau, and German officials who were there as allies of the Ottoman government. - Helen Fein - Director of the Institute for the Study of Genocide and an Associate of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the John F.

<p>Section: Process and camps of deportation. Last sentencte: "In any event, the foreseeable consequences of the government's decision to move the Armenians led to a significant number of deaths."
