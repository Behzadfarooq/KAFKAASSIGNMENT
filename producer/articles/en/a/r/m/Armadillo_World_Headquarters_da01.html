<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armadillo_World_Headquarters_da01.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Austin's flagship <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock</a> <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venue.html" title="Venue">venue</a>, the Vulcan Gas Company, closed, leaving the city's nascent live music scene without an <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_incubator.html" title="Business incubator">incubator</a>. One night, Eddie Wilson, manager of the local group <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva%27s_Headband_a270.html" title="Shiva's Headband">Shiva's Headband</a>, stepped outside a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclub</a> where the band was playing and noticed an old, abandoned <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armory_%28military%29.html" title="Armory (military)">armory</a>. Wilson found an unlocked garage door on the building and was able to view the cavernous interior using the headlights of his automobile. He had a desire to continue the legacy of the Vulcan Gas Company, and was inspired by what he saw in the armory to create a new music hall in the derelict structure. The armory was estimated to have been built in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, but no records of its construction could be located. The building was ugly, uncomfortable, and had poor <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoustics.html" title="Acoustics">acoustics</a>, but offered cheap rent and a central location. Posters for the venue usually noted the address as 525 1/2 Barton Springs Road (Rear), behind the Skating Palace (approximate coordinates 30.258 -97.750).</p>
<p>The name for the Armadillo was inspired by the use of armadillos as a symbol in the artwork of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Franklin_%28artist%29_9a38.html" title="Jim Franklin (artist)">Jim Franklin</a>, a local poster artist, and from the building itself. In choosing the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mascot.html" title="Mascot">mascot</a> for the new venture, Wilson and his partners wanted an "armored" animal since the building was an old armory. The <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armadillo.html" title="Armadillo">nine-banded armadillo</a> (<i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i>) was chosen because of its hard shell that looks like <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armor.html" title="Armor">armor</a>, its history as a survivor (virtually unchanged for 50 million years), and its near-ubiquity in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Texas_1676.html" title="Central Texas">central Texas</a>. Wilson also believed the building looked like it had been some type of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headquarters.html" title="Headquarters">headquarters</a> at one time. He initially proposed "International Headquarters" but in the end it became "World Headquarters."</p>
<p>In founding the Armadillo, Wilson was assisted by Franklin, Mike Tolleson, an entertainment attorney, Bobby Hedderman from the Vulcan Gas Company and Hank Alrich. Funding for the venture was initially provided by Shiva's Headband founder, Spencer Perskin, and Mad Dog, Inc. an Austin <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literati.html" title="Literati">literati</a> group.</p>
<p>The Armadillo World Headquarters officially opened on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> with Shiva's Headband, the Hub City Movers, and Whistler performing. The hall held about 1,500 patrons, but chairs were limited, so most patrons sat on the floor on sections of carpet that had been pieced together.</p>
<p>The Armadillo caught on quickly with the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> culture of Austin because admission was inexpensive and the hall tolerated <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">marijuana</a> use. Even though illicit drug use was flagrant, the Armadillo was never raided. Anecdotes suggest the police were worried about having to <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrest.html" title="Arrest">bust</a> their fellow officers as well as local and state politicians.</p>
<p>Soon, the Armadillo started receiving publicity in national magazines such as <i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i>. <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_magazine.html" title="Time magazine">Time magazine</a></i> wrote that the Armadillo was to the Austin music scene what <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fillmore_45ed.html" title="The Fillmore">The Fillmore</a> had been to the emergence of rock music in the 1960s. The clientèle became a mixture of hippies, <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowboy.html" title="Cowboy">cowboys</a>, and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Businessman.html" title="Businessman">businessmen</a> who stopped by to have lunch and a beer and listen to live music. At its peak, the amount of <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lone_Star_%28beer%29_4f41.html" title="Lone Star (beer)">Lone Star</a> draft beer sold by the Armadillo was second only to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a> <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrodome.html" title="Astrodome">Astrodome</a>. The <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neiman-Marcus_8a7f.html" title="Neiman-Marcus">Neiman-Marcus</a> department store even offered a line of Armadillo-branded products.</p>

<p>The blend of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">country</a> and rock music performed at the hall became known as "The Austin Sound," "Redneck Rock," or "Cosmic Cowboy." Many upcoming and established acts such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Nelson_7599.html" title="Willie Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Charles_5e75.html" title="Ray Charles">Ray Charles</a>, and <a href="../../../z/z/_/ZZ_Top_cd63.html" title="ZZ Top">ZZ Top</a> played the Armadillo. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_King_650d.html" title="Freddie King">Freddie King</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_Cody_dc13.html" title="Commander Cody">Commander Cody</a> all recorded live albums there. <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Springsteen_4811.html" title="Bruce Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> played five shows during <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.

<p>Despite its successes, the Armadillo always struggled financially. The addition of the Armadillo <a href="../../../b/i/e/Biergarten.html" title="Biergarten">Beer Garden</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> and the subsequent establishment of food service were both bids to generate positive cash flow. However, the financial difficulties continued. This predicament was blamed on a combination of large guaranteed payments for the acts, cheap ticket prices, and poor <a href="../../../p/r/o/Promotion_%28marketing%29.html" title="Promotion (marketing)">promotion</a>. The club finally had to <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layoff.html" title="Layoff">lay off</a> staff members in late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> and file for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapter_11_bankruptcy.html" title="Chapter 11 bankruptcy">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor in the club's demise was that it sat on 5.62 acres of prime <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate.html" title="Real estate">real estate</a> in what soon became a prime development area in the rapidly growing city. The Armadillo's landlord sold the property for an amount estimated between $4 million and $8 million.</p>
<p>The final concert at the Armadillo took place on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. The sold-out <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Eve_e542.html" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a> show featured <a href="../../../a/s/l/Asleep_at_the_Wheel_900b.html" title="Asleep at the Wheel">Asleep at the Wheel</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_Cody_and_the_Lost_Planet_Airmen_80be.html" title="Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen">Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen</a>. Some reports say the show ended at 4 a.m., while others claim that the bands played until <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn.html" title="Dawn">dawn</a>. The contents of the Armadillo were sold at <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auction</a> in January <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, and the old armory was razed for a high-rise <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office.html#Office_Building" title="Office">office building</a>.</p>

<p>With the success of the Armadillo and Austin's burgeoning music scene, KLRN (now <a href="../../../k/l/r/KLRU_e602.html" title="KLRU">KLRU</a>), the local <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Broadcasting_Service_0dd7.html" title="Public Broadcasting Service">PBS</a> television affiliate, created <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_City_Limits_3cc4.html" title="Austin City Limits">Austin City Limits</a></i>, a program showcasing popular local, regional, and national music acts.</p>
<p>The Armadillo Christmas Bazaar began in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> at the Armadillo, and is still held annually during the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> season. The bazaar was another attempt to improve cash flow for the hall. When the Armadillo closed, the bazaar changed locations every year, as it leased whatever large empty retail space might be available at the time. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, the bazaar settled at the Austin Music Hall, its current home. The bazaar has become one of the top-ranked <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_and_crafts.html" title="Arts and crafts">arts and crafts</a> shows in the nation with a long waiting list of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artisan.html" title="Artisan">artisans</a> who wish to show their work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"It is still on the lips and minds of a lot of people 26 years after it closed. This is noteworthy for me because of the zero-tolerance mentality, and now the city erected a memorial that glorifies the things of the past that are not accepted today."</i></p>
