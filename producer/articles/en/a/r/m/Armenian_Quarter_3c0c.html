The Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Armenian Quarter</b> is one of the four quarters of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_City_5050.html" title="Old City">Old City</a> of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Although the vast majority of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_people.html" title="Armenian people">Armenian people</a> are <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a>, the Armenian Quarter is distinct from the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Quarter_0972.html" title="Christian Quarter">Christian Quarter</a>. Although the smallest of the four quarters, with the fewest residents, the Armenians and their <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchate.html" title="Patriarchate">patriarchate</a> remain staunchly independent and form a vigorous presence in the Old City.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Quarter_3c0c.html" title="Edit section: The Armenian people and their establishment in Jerusalem: 95 BC&amp;ndash;AD 640">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Armenian people and their establishment in Jerusalem: 95 BC–AD 640</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_people.html" title="Armenian people">Armenian people</a> have inhabited parts of modern <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus_Mountains_4cfc.html" title="Caucasus Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> for more than four thousand years. The first known instance of an Armenian to come anywhere near Jerusalem arrived in the <a href="../../../9/5/_/95_BC_197b.html" title="95 BC">95 BC</a> under King <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigranes_II_540e.html" title="Tigranes II">Tigranes II</a> of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>. The Armenian armies traveled to several cities in <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a> before leaving the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">israel</a>. It was at this time that <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> may have come to trade with <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a> and settle in that far away land when likewise some Armenians came to know of the lands around <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and may have traded with [[israel]. Following the destruction of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in AD <a href="../../../7/0/_/70.html" title="70">70</a> the Romans imported "Armenian traders, artisans, Legionaries and government administrators". At precisely this time <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Jude_124a.html" title="Saint Jude">Thaddeus</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartholomew.html" title="Bartholomew">Bartholomew</a>, both <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Apostles_56fc.html" title="Twelve Apostles">apostles</a>, arrived in <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a> to preach to the Armenians and the small Jewish community there. Subsequently <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> spread to the higher echelons of Armenian <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_family.html" title="Royal family">royalty</a>. In AD <a href="../../../3/0/1/301.html" title="301">301</a>, Armenia was proclaimed a "Christian state" under its King <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terdat_III_75be.html" title="Terdat III">Terdat III</a> (Father. Norayr). During this period it is believed Armenian <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrims.html" title="Pilgrims">pilgrims</a> were already making their way to and from Jerusalem on pilgrimages. Armenian folk history also tells that already a small "upper room" of a house on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Zion_7d8e.html" title="Mount Zion">Mount Zion</a> was being used as a <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a>, thus the later Armenian claim to a quarter near <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Zion_7d8e.html" title="Mount Zion">Mount Zion</a> where the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral_of_St._James%2C_Jerusalem_830f.html" title="Cathedral of St. James, Jerusalem">St. James Cathedral</a> would later be built.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edict_of_Milan_565a.html" title="Edict of Milan">Edict of Milan</a> in AD <a href="../../../3/1/3/313.html" title="313">313</a> made <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> an acceptable religion in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. From this time forward it became easier for Armenian <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a> to settle and build homes in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena%2C_mother_of_Constantine_the_Great_c4dc.html" title="Helena, mother of Constantine the Great">Empress Helena</a> came to the Holy land in AD <a href="../../../3/2/6/326.html" title="326">326</a> and began to excavate holy sites, including <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golgotha.html" title="Golgotha">Golgotha</a>, The Nativity in <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem.html" title="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> and the birthplace of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_mother_of_Jesus_a284.html" title="Mary, mother of Jesus">Mary</a>. At this time the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre_99e1.html" title="Church of the Holy Sepulchre">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a> was built. Between the fourth and eighth centuries Armenians built as many as seventy <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monasteries.html" title="Monasteries">monasteries</a> throughout the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Land_6f3c.html" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a>, although how many of them might have been in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> is open to debate. By the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a> AD Armenian <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Bishops</a> were located in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> around what they called "Mt. Zion", indicating that a substantial Armenian community existed in the city and that the community was settling continuously in a particular area.</p>
<p>The invention of an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_alphabet.html" title="Armenian alphabet">Armenian alphabet</a> in <a href="../../../4/0/5/405.html" title="405">405</a> certainly helped the Armenian community by allowing them to keep records in their native language. This alphabet has helped spawn the more than four thousand ancient manuscripts kept by the Armenians in the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Toros_Church_9fd6.html" title="St. Toros Church">St. Toros Church</a> next to the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral_of_St._James%2C_Jerusalem_830f.html" title="Cathedral of St. James, Jerusalem">St. James Cathedral</a>. In the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> when breaking ground for the Russian Monastery on the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_of_Olives_e5bd.html" title="Mount of Olives">Mount of Olives</a>, six <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosaic.html" title="Mosaic">mosaic</a> floors were uncovered to reveal Armenian writing, once again testifying to the presence of Armenians in and around <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> from that period. A similar mosaic was uncovered in the Musrara neighborhood (200 meters from the <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus_Gate_7fac.html" title="Damascus Gate">Damascus Gate</a>) and was purchased by the Armenian patriarchate in 1912.</p>
<p>One of the central reasons for the existence of an Armenian quarter is the religion and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> of the Armenians. Armenians, unlike the majority of Christians in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, are not <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a>, rather they are ethnically and religiously Armenian. The reason for their ethnicity does not need to be elaborated on except to say that they have remained a homogeneous group, intermarrying over the years and keeping their culture intact.</p>
<p>The reason for the development of a separate <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Church_dbcd.html" title="Armenian Church">Armenian Church</a> is slightly more complicated. At the time <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a> converted to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> there was only one church. However in AD <a href="../../../4/3/1/431.html" title="431">431</a> the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Ecumenical_Council_1c6a.html" title="Third Ecumenical Council">Third Ecumenical Council</a> at Ephesus split the church between <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestorians.html" title="Nestorians">Nestorians</a> (today’s <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrian</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean.html" title="Chaldean">Chaldean</a> Christians) and the rest of Christianity. Then in <a href="../../../4/5/1/451.html" title="451">451</a> the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Ecumenical_Council_387e.html" title="Fourth Ecumenical Council">Fourth Ecumenical Council</a> split Christianity again into <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monophysites.html" title="Monophysites">Monophysites</a> and <a href="../../../d/y/o/Dyophysitism.html" title="Dyophysitism">Dyophysites</a>. The Armenians thereby joined the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coptic_Christianity_198f.html" title="Coptic Christianity">Coptic</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian.html" title="Ethiopian">Ethiopian</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> churches in the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monophysite.html" title="Monophysite">Monophysite</a> movement, whereas the Byzantine/<a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Church_6706.html" title="Orthodox Church">Orthodox Church</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Greece_29d0.html" title="Church of Greece">Greek Orthodox</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Orthodox_758c.html" title="Russian Orthodox">Russian Orthodox</a> etc) became <a href="../../../d/y/o/Dyophysitism.html" title="Dyophysitism">Dyophysite</a>. It would take until <a href="../../../1/0/5/1054.html" title="1054">1054</a> for the Latin (<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a>) Church to break from the <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Church_6706.html" title="Orthodox Church">Orthodox Church</a> and then until the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> in the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> to split the Christian Church into the factions one sees today in the old city.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Justinian_d0be.html" title="Emperor Justinian">emperor Justinian</a> (527–565) persecuted the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monophysite.html" title="Monophysite">Monophysite</a> churches and the Armenians found themselves speaking on behalf of the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian.html" title="Ethiopian">Ethiopian</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coptic_Christianity_198f.html" title="Coptic Christianity">Coptic</a> Churches, a leadership role the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchate.html" title="Patriarchate">Patriarchate</a> still assumes. Thus from AD <a href="../../../4/5/1/451.html" title="451">451</a> the Armenian church became separate from the other Christian churches in Jerusalem, a fact that would have major ramifications in the ensuing struggle with fellow Christians during the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusader</a> and <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> periods.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> conquest and sacking of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in <a href="../../../6/1/4/614.html" title="614">614</a> and the subsequent <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic.html" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> conquest in <a href="../../../6/3/8/638.html" title="638">638</a> found the Armenians under siege from their Byzantine masters and they therefore welcomed the invaders as a way to get back the Church property confiscated under <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Justinian_d0be.html" title="Emperor Justinian">Emperor Justinian</a>, and which they had been forbidden from entering. The Armenians now became subject to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pact_of_Omar_11d2.html" title="Pact of Omar">Pact of Omar</a> and they became <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmis.html" title="Dhimmis">Dhimmis</a>. They would pay a special <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poll_tax.html" title="Poll tax">poll tax</a> called <a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizya.html" title="Jizya">Jizya</a>, sometimes be forced to wear special clothing including Blue Turbans, and not be allowed to construct new Christian buildings. For this they were ‘protected’ which is to say they didn’t suffer the fate of <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagans.html" title="Pagans">pagans</a>, who were killed or enslaved.</p>
<p>The Armenians lived under different <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> dynasties between <a href="../../../6/3/8/638.html" title="638">638</a> and the coming of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Crusade_f9d6.html" title="First Crusade">Crusaders</a> in <a href="../../../1/0/9/1099.html" title="1099">1099</a>. The <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umayyads.html" title="Umayyads">Umayyads</a> based in Damascus were followed by a smooth transition to the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasids.html" title="Abbasids">Abbasids</a> (750–1258) based in <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, and the subsequent more destructive and intolerant reigns of <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatimids.html" title="Fatimids">Fatimids</a> in <a href="../../../9/6/9/969.html" title="969">969</a> and finally the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seljuk_Turks_bec0.html" title="Seljuk Turks">Seljuk Turks</a> who pillaged the city in <a href="../../../1/0/7/1071.html" title="1071">1071</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Quarter_3c0c.html" title="Edit section: 1260&amp;ndash;1517&amp;mdash;The Mamluk period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1260–1517—The Mamluk period</span></h2>
<p>The coming of the Slave Army of the Mamluks in 1260, replacing the short lived late Muslim Ayyubid rulers (1244–<a href="../../../1/2/6/1260.html" title="1260">1260</a>) had little effect on the Armenians but great effect on the other Christian communities, many of whom were viewed as being part of the Crusader mentality. The Armenian Patriarch Sarkis I(<a href="../../../1/2/8/1281.html" title="1281">1281</a>–<a href="../../../1/3/1/1313.html" title="1313">1313</a>) met the Mamluke governor and subsequently returned to his community in Jerusalem, hoping to usher in a period of peace for his people after the convulsions of the crusades. The community at this time had a significant community in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and it happened that <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">Patriarchs</a> would travel to <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> from time to time to meet with the Mamluke rulers and their constituents. The result of these contacts can be inferred by the fact that in the <a href="../../../1/3/4/1340.html" title="1340">1340s</a> the Armenians were permitted to build a wall around their quarter. This was a significant sign that the Mamluke rulers felt the quarter did not pose a threat, since the tearing down of walls had been a staple of Mamluke governance as a way to ensure the crusaders did not return. The Mamluke government also engraved the following declaration in Arabic on the western entrance to the quarter:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The order of our maser Sultan Jaqmaq which stipulates that the taxes levied recently by the town governor regarding the payment by the Armenian enclosure be cancelled and it has been requested that this cancellation be recorded in the Honored Books in the year <a href="../../../8/5/4/854.html" title="854">854</a> of the <a href="../../../h/i/j/Hijri_year.html" title="Hijri year">Hijra</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/5/1451.html" title="1451">1451</a>). Anyone who renews the payment or again takes any tax of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extortion.html" title="Extortion">extortion</a> is damned, son of the damned, and the curse of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> will be upon him.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Armenian quarter in this period kept creating "facts on the ground" by the constant small expansions and solidifications. In the <a href="../../../1/3/8/1380.html" title="1380">1380s</a> Patriarch Krikor IV built a priests' dining room across from the St. James Cathedral.

<p>Under the Ottomans Jerusalem would become a cosmopolitan city where religious tolerance to some degree functioned well and a corrupt but reasonable Ottoman administration functioned to sort out religious differences between the rival Christian churches and between the rival religions.</p>
<p>The most important aspect during this time was the increase in the Armenian demographics of their quarter and the struggle for control of the holy sites. Ottoman Jizya or tax records for <a href="../../../1/5/6/1562.html" title="1562">1562</a> and <a href="../../../1/6/9/1690.html" title="1690">1690</a> are the most accurate because they are confirmed to have actually been updated in those years to reflect the actual people living in Jerusalem rather than passed down from former tax records. Further work was done on the records, since they originally only contained the numbers of non-Muslim adult men who were not registered as full time "religious" people, which is to say <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monks</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priests</a>. In the <a href="../../../1/5/6/1562.html" title="1562">1562</a>–<a href="../../../1/5/6/1563.html" title="1563">63</a> record only 189 Armenians are counted, whereas 640 are counted in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1690.html" title="1690">1690</a>, an increase of 239%. Some have attributed this demographic ballooning to a "process of <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urbanization.html" title="Urbanization">urbanization</a>" experienced by the Armenians and other Christians in particular. Thus Armenians came to make up 22.9% of Jerusalem's Christians by 1690, becoming the second largest Christian community.</p>
<p>Armenians were overwhelmingly engaged in the occupation of craft making at this time, with smaller numbers engaged in trade and services. One must recall that the Armenians who were engaged in religious activities exclusively are not recorded in these records of occupation since they were exempted for reasons of being completely pious in nature. When one examines the actual tax rates of the Armenians we find that they made up the highest numbers of those in the "medium" tax bracket while their rivals for control of some of the holy sites made up the "lower" tax bracket. This financial situation, heavily buttressed by Armenians donations from their home country, certainly contributed to the communities demographic and financial clout in the old city. This is certainly yet another reason that the community was able to expand and control an entire quarter of the city. The other myriad Christian communities at this time were meanwhile living in their historic areas around the Church of the holy Sepulcher.</p>
<p>Outside the Armenian quarter and its residential neighborhood and imposing St. James cathedral the Armenians vied for control of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Armenians are described as the "second most important shareholder" of the Church, the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Greece_29d0.html" title="Church of Greece">Greek Orthodox</a> being the most important. The Armenians controlled the Chapel of Parting of the Raiment, St. Helena's Chapel, the Chapel of St. John and the Chapel of the Three Marys, as well as the second floor above the main entrance . The Church itself then was divided between the Greek Orthodox, the Armenians and the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscans</a> (Catholic) sects of Christianity.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Karlowitz_7595.html" title="Peace of Karlowitz">Peace of Karlowitz</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1699.html" title="1699">1699</a> the Ottoman Empire devolved into the "sick man of Europe" and "the question of the Holy Sites started transforming from an internal Ottoman problem, to an external diplomatic one". This was to prove a major disadvantage since Western Armenia had been gobbled up by the Ottomans and then in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>, the Eastern half was swept into the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> empire. Whereas most of the other Churches had patron nations, such as <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> for the Catholics and Russia for the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Orthodox_758c.html" title="Russian Orthodox">Orthodox</a>, the Armenians now found themselves alone among Christian giants. The subsequent decline during this period of the Egyptian <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copts.html" title="Copts">Coptic</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopian</a> church holdings in the city were also part of this sequence of events that deprived the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monophysite.html" title="Monophysite">Monophysite</a> churches of powerful nation-state backers.</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks the Armenians hung on, tenuously and doggedly to their quarter. The treatment of the Christians in Jerusalem was not always good and certainly was not always respectful. For instance there were many complaints surrounding the "inspections" whereby Ottoman "officials" would come into the Holy sites, particularly the Holy Sepulcher and say "You have added to your churches and monasteries. In these (places) or adjacent to them are mosques. Therefore pay us large sums of money, or else we will carry out inspections and report you."</p>
<p>These were no idle threats for various Churches and synagogues were seized after parts of them had collapsed or been damaged and the "masses" would <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riot</a> claiming that the non-Muslims were building "new" sites. It was likewise common practice for Muslims to "find" holy sites near non-Muslim buildings and to build mosques as close as possible to them. Later the Muslims would conveniently claim that the Church was encroaching on the mosque. Nevertheless although Armenian church holdings may have suffered this degradation, the Armenian quarter remained largely un-encumbered by the minaretization of Jerusalem, most likely owing to the Armenian far sightedness in self containing their quarter as much as possible, so that outsiders were not able to suddenly claim they required a Mosque in that area. While the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Nativity_a0fc.html" title="Church of the Nativity">Church of the Nativity</a> was forced at this time to house Muslim travelers due to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pact_of_Omar_11d2.html" title="Pact of Omar">Pact of Omar</a>, the Armenians retreated inside their quarter, safe to most extents from the harassment and daily travails of not being the master of your own land.</p>
<p>The Armenian Patriarchate itself became politicized at this time by struggles within the Armenian church. Suffice it to say that the Armenian Patriarchate, due to its proximity to the Holy places and isolation from the main Armenian population, played an important role in the schism that began to affect the Armenian leaderships in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/c/Etchmiaddzin.html" title="Etchmiaddzin">Etchmiaddzin</a> (seat of the Armenian church). Significantly Bishop Eghiazar, assumed the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem_fbba.html" title="Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem">Patriarchate of Jerusalem</a> and in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a> declared himself "Catholicos" ("Leader") of all the Armenian church. These types of struggles within the church hierarchy diminished the amount of the time the Church could spend on similar struggles with the Greek Orthodox and the Holy Sites.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Quarter_3c0c.html" title="Edit section: Struggles over the Holy sites">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Struggles over the Holy sites</span></h2>
<p>The Struggle over the Holy sites had little effect on the buildings themselves, save the fact that all the churches ended up agreeing in the end to split the costs of renovations. Nevertheless the Armenians and the Greek Orthodox waged a war in the Ottoman courts during the 17th century for control of worshipping practices and ownership at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and at the Church of the Nativity. The major outcome of this was that the Armenian church lost any chance to gets its hands on the former Ethiopian holdings at the Holy Sepulcher, including the St. Abraham Monastery, the Chapel of Derision and the Chapel of Christ’s Prison. Compromises today regulate everything from prayer times to renovation costs date back to the mid-17th century when the Ottoman courts tried their utmost to sort out the conflicts between the Greek Orthodox, the Armenians, and the Franciscans (Catholics) over who would control aspects of the Holy Sites.</p>
<p>As time wore on and the Ottoman Empire weakened, the issues facing the Armenians of Jerusalem remained mostly unchanged. One of their concerns regarded the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrim.html" title="Pilgrim">pilgrims</a> coming and going from Jerusalem. These pilgrims were forced to pay a certain tax upon entering the Church of the Sepulcher, and this tax perversely was used to pay for the Muslims to recite the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> daily at the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dome_of_the_Rock_4284.html" title="Dome of the Rock">Dome of the Rock</a>. The same <a href="../../../w/a/q/Waqf.html" title="Waqf">waqf</a> that today administers the Muslim holy sites was in charge of taxing the Christians during the Ottoman period. Due to the fact that the Christian buildings could not be enlarged and the abuse of the pilgrims by "fake" tax officials the pilgrimage numbers declined. With this decline the Ottomans began to lose money and the waqf began to lose money. Subsequently the Christians explained that in return for being allowed to modify and enlarge their buildings the pilgrims might be encouraged to return.</p>
<p>Thus in the 17th century the Armenians were allowed after much pleading to enlarge the St. James Monastery. At the same time the Armenian Patriarch Hovhannes VII purchased a "large parcel" of land south of the St. James cathedral called “Cham Tagh” . One interesting issue regarding the Armenian residential areas in their quarter was that upon purchasing houses they traditionally would tear them down and then rebuild them. This was due to a Muslim custom that allowed a Muslim to redeem a sold possession within three generations. Thus Armenians had found out that property bought in the 7th century was redeemed in the 8th by the seller's descendants. To circumvent the tradition the original dwelling was demolished and replaced, voiding the descendants' claim to the property. By <a href="../../../1/7/5/1752.html" title="1752">1752</a> the Hagop Nalian was busy renovating the entire quarter, and in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a> further renovations took place after an <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a> the Seminary complex at the south end of the St. James convent was completed.</p>
<p>Other changes to the Quarter in this period included the walls of <a href="../../../s/u/l/Suleiman_the_Magnificent_4f7d.html" title="Suleiman the Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> finished in <a href="../../../1/5/2/1527.html" title="1527">1527</a>. These walls along with the internal walls built by the Armenians came to determine the outline of the quarter. The Ottoman period created what is known as the "status quo" for Jerusalem. This idea meant that certain statuses for the Holy Sites would be kept and were recognized as being permanent or at least the way things should be. The City was divided into four quarters. The <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Mount_9e35.html" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a> became a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> holy place, and the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulcher_fb9f.html" title="Church of the Holy Sepulcher">Church of the Holy Sepulcher</a> as well as other various <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> sites were recognized as belonging to the Christian world. Despite the arguments over who would control what aspects of these sites the status quo has remained from the 17th century to the present largely intact. Although claims that this status quo was being violated led to vicious rioting in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, it has not been changed, and the quarters and areas remain roughly how they have been inside Suleiman's walls.</p>
<p>In the beginning of <a href="../../../1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a> Jerusalem’s 9,000 residents celebrated the coming of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt_85ea.html" title="Muhammad Ali of Egypt">Mohammad Ali</a> and his Egyptian army. The Armenian community, reduced along with the rest of Jerusalem due to the poverty and neglect of the Ottomans also celebrated. Numerous sources mention the individual nature of the Armenian quarter in this period, its “distinct ethnic with its particular language and culture, intent on retaining its separate identity and unity, minimizing the contacts with <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a> and the Ottoman authorities.”</p>
<p>Armenians embraced the modern era with high hopes. As the Armenian <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaspora.html" title="Diaspora">diaspora</a> spread throughout Europe and America they came into wealth as never before. Their status as craftsmen and traders and their dispersal allowed them to excel in international trade and business. Thus the oil man <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calouste_Gulbenkian_f2a9.html" title="Calouste Gulbenkian">Calouste Gulbenkian</a>, known as "Mr. 5 Percent" for his dealings, came to endow the Gulbunkian Library in the Armenian quarter, today holding one of the great collection of ancient Armenian manuscripts including endless copies of the various Firmens or Ottoman edicts that granted the quarter protection and rights under Muslim rule. In 1833 the Armenians established the city’s first <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printing_press.html" title="Printing press">printing press</a> and opened a theological seminary in 1843. In 1866 the Armenians had inaugurated the first <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photographic studio</a> and their first <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> in Jerusalem . In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> the Armenian community built two large buildings on the north-western side of the Old City along Jaffa Street. Armenians themselves began to brave life outside the walls, but one young husband petitioned the Patriarch, complaining “It is impossible for me to outside the Old City and leave my children in the hands of Turks and troops and other strange people." In 1905, the Armenians had represented about 2.7% of the Christians in Jerusalem, around 840 people.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the Armenians found themselves cut off from their sources of support among the western powers. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, using the excuse that the Armenians were allied with the Russians, the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Turks_61fd.html" title="Young Turks">Young Turks</a> ordered all Armenians expelled from Armenia in north eastern Turkey. The <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviets</a> meanwhile marched into Russian Armenia and annexed it as a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Socialist_Republic_b505.html" title="Soviet Socialist Republic">Soviet Socialist Republic</a>. Armenians may have been influential in the communist movement, among them <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anastas_Mikoyan_da32.html" title="Anastas Mikoyan">Anastas Mikoyan</a>, but these atheistic types would prove no help to pious Armenians of Jerusalem. Thus the Patriarch in Jerusalem seemed orphaned, a church without a homeland. Then one day towards the end of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah.html" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a>, in December <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Jack_ed30.html" title="Union Jack">Union Jack</a> was run up outside the old city, as the Turks fled the British and <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Allenby_3aea.html" title="Edmund Allenby">General Allenby</a> entered the city. For the first time in almost 800 years a Christian power had returned to the Holy Land. Unfortunately for the Armenians it was not to last, and it was to be another 80 years before an independent Armenia would play a role in the church again.</p>

<p>The British authorities, with their years of colonial experience, were quick to embrace the Status Quo, despite the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balfour_Declaration_73f0.html" title="Balfour Declaration">Balfour Declaration</a> declaring the need for the creation of a Jewish Homeland. The British looked to the Status Quo of 1852 for guidance, keeping the four quarters of the Old City while at the same time allowing a major building program outside the city walls.</p>
<p>By the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, most of the Armenian quarter had “European style gable roofs” as opposed to the domes preferred in the Muslim quarter. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> Armenians made up 8% of Jerusalem’s Christians, bringing their total number to about 2,480 people. It is also noted that non-Armenians found comfort in the protection of the walled Armenian "compound". Though events moved at a fast pace outside the city and the dark clouds of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War Two</a> gathered and were then cleared away, the Armenian quarter changed little in this period. The shock over the loss of Armenia to the Soviets and the destruction brought by the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> left the Patriarchate with financial backing to be found mostly in the wealthy American diaspora community. During this time the quarter was renovated, but the various Christian communities could not come to an agreement on the renovations at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> were set to leave Palestine, the U.N agreed to partition <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> declared her independence. Under the <a href="../../../u/2E/n/U.N._08cc.html" title="U.N.">U.N.</a> resolution Jerusalem was planned to become an international city, but the invasion of the Jordanian legion made this plan impossible. Later historians such as <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_Khalidi_6da9.html" title="Rashid Khalidi">Rashid Khalidi</a> would stress the “de-sectarian nature” of the Palestinians, exhibiting Christians such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Habash_9efc.html" title="George Habash">George Habash</a> as model Arab terrorists. Yet for the Armenians, who were neither Arab or Jewish, they were Armenian and had no "dog in the fight" using the parochial expression of the American South. Thus although the Armenians deployed a small <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a> to protect their quarter they closed their gates and hoped for the best, while the Jordanians shelled the Jewish areas and the Jewish defenders tried their best to relieve their comrades, under siege in the neighboring Jewish Quarter.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> the Armenians petitioned <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Bernadotte_ad63.html" title="Count Bernadotte">Count Bernadotte</a> to help negotiate a protection for the holy places, but it was to no avail. The Count would later be <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinated</a>, and the shelling of the Jewish neighborhoods by the Arab Legions dragged on through September. The Armenian quarter was hit several times in this period. The numbers of Armenians residing in Jerusalem and in the holy land in 1948 is disputed. One source cites a total population “never exceeding” 10,000 and a total of 8,000 in all of Palestine/Israel at the time. One must remember that as recently as <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> only 14,000–22,000 people lived in Jerusalem, making even a small Armenian presence a significant minority of the population.</p>
<p>Jordanian rule was not as equal and tolerant as modern day historians like to imagine it. Rather Jordanian law required the Armenians and all Christians to “give equal time to the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> and Qur'an” in private Christian schools as well as restricting the expansion of church assets. Nevertheless in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> the Armenians agreed with the Catholics and Orthodox to begin renovating the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. The renovations continue to this day. As the Armenians were now separated from their holdings in Israel, the Patriarch began to lease these buildings out to the Jerusalem municipality and to developers.</p>

<p>The 1967 war is remembered by some in the Armenian community as a "miracle" due to the fact that two unexploded bombs were later found inside the Armenian monastery. Nevertheless it is also believed, absent of hard statistics, that more than 20,000 Armenians lived in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> before the 1967 war. Today the number has declined to 15,000, but this is after reaching much lower numbers in the intervening decades. The fall of the Soviet Union has opened the doors to an independent Armenia. Today more than 3,000 Armenians live in Jerusalem. The Armenian quarter is home to roughly 500 of them, some of whom are temporary residents studying at the seminary or serving the church in various functions. The entire quarter is owned by the Patriarchate, as well as the other "valuable" assets in West Jerusalem and elsewhere. Finances for the quarter are helped by the prosperous Armenian communities in America. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> a seminary school was completed inside the quarter.</p>
<p>Following the 1967 war the Israeli government gave compensation to repair and churches or holy sites damaged in the fighting, regardless of who had caused the damage. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> a source claimed 1,500 Armenians resided in the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> Naomi Shepherd reported that “The <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Orthodox_317e.html" title="Armenian Orthodox">Armenian</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Orthodox_Church_3900.html" title="Syrian Orthodox Church">Syrian Orthodox</a> clergy are present and correct, but are not on speaking terms.” At this time she also reported that only 14,000 Christians lived In the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Armenian Patriarchate still owned its “valuable property in West Jerusalem and in the area West of the Old City walls”, much of which is leased to the JNF or developers. Subsequently Armenian Archbishop Shahe Ajamian sold the properties west of the Old City walls to Israel to allow for the current picturesque landscaping.</p>
