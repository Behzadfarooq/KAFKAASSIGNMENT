<p><i>The lack of a public prosecution of the organizers behind Armenian Genocide by the Allied powers was said to have largely influenced nazi Germany's fascist leader Adolf Hitler.</i></p>
<p>Sure nazism is influenced by facism but I think it's missleading to use "NAZI Germanys FACIST leader", in my oppnion it should simply say nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerMeister_247e.html" title="User:DerMeister">DerMeister</a> 20:05, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, how about this version "It is said that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was encouraged to commit genocide against the Jews because of the lack of any public prosecution for the organizers of the Armenian Genocide." or "It was said that the lack of public prosecution of the organizers of the Armenian genocide imfluenced Nazi leader Adolf Hitler decide to commit genocide against the Jews." I'm just trying to make it make sense, I am not making any judgement about the statement.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mass Graves Found In Eastern Turkey</span></h2>
<p>I think we should add this information in this article about the findings of mass graves in Eastern Turkey believed to date from the 1915 Armenian and Assyrian Genocides. <a href="http://www.aina.org/news/20061128104356.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aina.org/news/20061128104356.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aina.org/news/20061128104356.htm</a> Also in Turkish <a href="http://www.kurdistan-post.com/News-file-article-sid-13065.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kurdistan-post.com/News-file-article-sid-13065.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kurdistan-post.com/News-file-article-sid-13065.html</a> Also if Turkey claims there was no Genocide than why is the Turkish government trying to hide this finding and the military personnel forbade the villagers to tell anyone about the site and then they closed the site. Although this information was leaked Turkey pressed the villagers to give the names of those responsible for it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I read about this too. To me, this incident isn't surprising and it's probably one of the more blatant examples of Armenian Genocide denial (like you said, if there was no genocide, then why is the Turkish government so concerned about these bones?) This news is important and should be posted on both this article and the article on <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nisibis.html" title="Nisibis">Nisibis</a> (Nusaybin). -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 22:55, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The accc.org.uk is Armenian controlled, whereas regnum.ru is a Russian nationalist website, which features as a top story in its Russian verision an article denying the Ukrainian Holodomor. I checked the news in Turkish newspapers though, and it seems that the Turkish newspaper Özgür Gündem has indeed reported on the discovery of some bones and it seems also that it has been suspended for 15 days after remarks by a Turkish general of it being the mouthpiece of the PKK as reported by Radikal <a href="http://www.radikal.com.tr/ek_haber.php?ek=r2&amp;haberno=6445" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.radikal.com.tr/ek_haber.php?ek=r2&amp;haberno=6445" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. For now, I would refrain from any speculations on this apparent mass grave and await an investigation by experts. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasanidin_2480.html" title="User:Hasanidin">Hasanidin</a> 04:42, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since the Turkish government closed off this site and told the villagers that found the site to remain silent. I really don't think there is any other way for experts to come and investigate this findings if the Turkish government is trying to keep silent regarding the finding, since this site was discovered on October 17, 2006 and kept secret until one of the villagers leaked the story. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 05:01, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>all news sources refer to a single newspaper here "Özgür gündem" the newspaper of the PKK terorist organisation. However if you could have read Turkish you would have seen that Kurdistan news tell the story quite different. stating that the villagers have found the grave while trying burry their death. and they covered the grave with stones. No mention of soldiers coming and closing the grave and warning people to remain silent. it is just said that villagers were asked to close the grave and not to do anything (obviously not to damage the site)and it is stated in the upcoming days the place will be investigated. this is simply a thing that any goverment will do. just two months ago Turk history society challenged Armenians to come and find the mass graves of Armenians in a joined effort. This has not hit the head lines of course. So it is unfair to give an impression as if Turkey is trying to hide something. Finding a mass grave is not surprising since many people were killed during that period. what is interesting is that suddenly Swedish foreign minister jumped into that. the history is repeating it self over and over. Turkish mass graves found in so many places are no news. yet a gossib about a possible Armenian/Christian mass grave moves the Sweden parliment so deeply.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 09:54, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the Turkish government is not trying to hide anything than we will see if the Turkish government will respond to Insan Haklari Derneği (IHD), a Turkish organisation working with human rights issues, which has sent an open letter to the Turkish ministry of the interior demanding an investigation of the mass grave discovery, to answer if the mass graves that were found near Nusaybin has something to do with the Assyrian and Armenian genicides. By the way since the Turkish government kept quiet for a while after discovering this graves the only newspaper in Turkey that took pictures and reported about this findings they dug further into it and came into contact with professor David Gaunt at Södertörn University in Stockholm who has done a lot of research about the Assyrian genocide and the news about the mass finding was distributed by Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå (TT), Sweden's top news agency and was thereafter published in several Swedish media, including the two leading morning papers Dagens Nyheter (DN) and Svenska Dagbladet (Svd) this is why "moves the Sweden parliament so deeply" like you said. Also you claim there were "Turkish mass graves found in so many places" can you give me reliable sources for your claim? I want to see what your sources are from, when you accuse me of having a false source from a terrorist organization newspaper. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 22:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No one is accusing you of anything. "özgür gündem" is the newspaper of PKK and if these newspapers are using it as a source it is their fault not yours of course. here you can read an article on Turkish mass graves <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/yayinlar/yayin1/7-Konukcu(143-154).pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/yayinlar/yayin1/7-Konukcu(143-154).pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/yayinlar/yayin1/7-Konukcu(143-154).pdf</a>. and here you can see the pictures and details of excavation <a href="http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/massacres/assesment.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/massacres/assesment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/massacres/assesment.html</a> <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 23:16, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Neurobio I went to those websites that you gave me, but both of those sites were from a Turkish websites and I tried using google to find out if other countries websites claimed the same thing that were on the websites of Turkey, but I couldn't find any. I don't think that is a reliable source since only Turkish websites had those claims and the stuff I was reading were anti-Armenian website. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 03:31, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>that only confirms what I have said most of these graves were opened decades ago. there were foreign professors present at the excavation. Still you can not find a single word about it in the international press. But these are scolarly documented. that is the reason why Armenian genocide issue has become common knowledge. For example you cant find a word about the malta tribunal or the armenian rebelion except for Turkish web sites. Despite the perfect documentation. such as this one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>To call these "scholarly documented" is a bit of a joke. I have read private reports from (non-Armenian or Turk) individuals who have examined much of this "evidence" and who have noted in some cases quite a bit of doctoring of what otherwise are likely Christian/Armenians to make it look as if they are Muslims. The same hold true for a number of artifats that are kept is supposed museums that depict Muslims slaughtered by Armenians. Much of this is very amaturish with obvious mitakes that in fact shows the opposite of what is being presented/portrayed. Again, I'm not claiming that there was none of this - Armenians killing innocent Turks. When Russians took over areas Russian Armenians, Cossacks, Russians and even Ottoman Armenian men who had fled the Genocide - did torch towns and villages and commit atrocities. And as sad as these criminal acts of war are - they still do not equate - in any respect - concerning government intent and policy and the totality and severity of the acts carried out against innocent woeman and children and such - the CUP directed program to annihilate its ethnic and religious minorities - of which the Armenians were first and formost on the list to be eliminated. Let us not forget that Assyrians and Greeks were similarly (later) treated to the same fate. Were Assyrians and Greeks likewise claimed to be collaborators with enemy forces commiting atrocities against Muslims? And even if there were some Assyrian and (Ottoman) Greek individuals or even forces that happened to join the Allies (such as Jews and Jewish units that joined the allies in WW2) do we then accept that the government directed and prosecuted genocides against these people never happened?--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:49, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In regards to the Washington Post article on the left, read the text, it refers to the <b>Russian Armenian</b> Army in the city of <b>Kars</b>, moving in the Ottoman Empire. Kars had been under Russian control since 1878 so by then, any Armenians living there were subjects of the Russian Tsar, not the Ottoman Empire.

<p>In several <b>towns occupied</b> by the Russians the Armenian students have shown themselves <b>ready to join the invading army</b>.

<p>what does occupied and invade mean??? Where is Van? where is Feitun. "Zeytun" in Turkish.

<dd>Winston Churchill himself noted that at least 150,000 Armenian rebells joined the Russian army during its invasion of Turkey, and as many of them had fallen in battle, Armenians had to gather again around 35,000 to maintain the front against the Turks in what he called "liberated" Armenian territories. Why are you denying this mass uprising of the Armenians?</dd>
<dd><i>The Russian Caucasian army, which occupied the liberated Western Armenian provinces, was in disorder and rapidly disintegrating, and the Russian soldiers deserted to return to their homes. The first task of the new Caucasian government, limited though its means were, was to gather an army which could maintain the Turkish front. Since the Tatars refused to fight their Turkish cousins and the Georgian Mensheviks were under the sway of an inconvenient and illogical pacifism, the entire burden of the war fell upon the shoulders of the Armenians. Winston Churchill writes: “At the beginning of 1918 the Russian army abandoned the front in Asia Minor and became a scattered flock whose only desire was to return home. Russians left the front very quickly and the Turks had not yet advanced. The Armenians who stayed behind made a desperate attempt to defend their country, Armenia, and the Armenians in the Russian army gathered and, with the volunteer units, for a time, were able to stop the Turkish advance. <b>Of the 150 000 soldiers that the Armenians had supplied to the Russian army, all had fallen in battle or were scattered over the empire, so that the Armenians were not able to gather more than 35 000 men.</b>”</i></dd>
<dd><i>At the start of 1918, the Armenian army, continuing in Armenian military traditions, the hope and the condition for an independent Armenian government, took up position at the Western Armenian front. The Armenian army was led by commanders such as General Nazarbekian, General Andranik (known as the Armenian Garibaldi) and Colonel Morel, the Russian officer who was its founder and protector. The army fought without respite to defend Western Armenia and Transcaucasia, a 400 km front, against the Turkish army. General Brehman subsequently recorded: “The efforts of the Armenians at this remote front has been concealed from the European general public, but their place in history should be assured with the heroic deeds carried out during these battle.</i></dd>

<p>I'm only curious Neuro. I only ask these questions whenever a particular source does not make sense and deserves scrutiny. It would be more sound if the information was coming from, for example, consulate officials or missionaries in the region or intl. observers rather than for obvious reasons, the government of the Ottoman Empire. In the case of the NYT article that appears on this article, it clearly states who is the source (i.e. the American Relief Society) and subsequent newspapers also state where their information is coming from (US Consuls, Ambassador so and so, etc.) Naturally the argument for the Genocide implies that all other Turkish officials, the valis and the kaymakams included, were privy to what was going to occur so such statements are of the norm.How many times have I asked for raising your opinions on the cited information on this article? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 07:40, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unfortunatelly I regard missionary sources as the most dubious ones. Simply because they actively took part in the Greek and Bulgarian independence wars. Also think about therir deeds in the oldworld in America continent and Africa. these "men of god" unfortunately has served as tools of invasion and propaganda for a century. They also gave the same news of atrocities from these places while all Turkish population was continuously massacred and exiled there. No one still ask what happened to Turks that lived in Greece and Bulgaria. their population now is almost non existant. I lost hope here because my simples adits like "some western scholars also has the idea as the Turks" are just removed in an instant. As you know I respect your attitute but please try to read other sources also. here I have found another article and the source is petrograd.

<dd>Are we now establishing a policy that whatever is printed in an American Newspaper regarding the Armenian Genocide and suroundign events is entirely factual? If so that I would guess that we might have hundreds of entires - if not thousands to add to the database. In any event - so these articles present that some Armenian "students" have taken up arms against the Ottoman Turks - well this should be no surprise - after several generations of abuse - and recent massacres of very large numbers - that some Armenian have become dissatisfied with the protections offered by the ottoman State - or lack therof - and have taken it upon themselves to be prepared to defend themselvs and their families. As for rumours of numbers and towns such as Van being besieged - they are just that - rumors - whose sources most likely are Turkish Government connected or otherwise questionable. If of course we see that these thigs are being reported from a variety of sources (not just from a variety of newspapers using the same source) then perhaps we can judge them credible. Until then we will take the word of actual eyewitnesses to these events and rely on information that it is clearly cooroborated by multiple sources.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:37, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considering that's how most information is acquired in this world, yes. But to help bolster those news reports come testimonies from everyone: Armenians themselves, Germans, Americans, Austrians, Swedes, Danes, Norwegians and even Turks that Turkish government soldiers with the help of irregular brigands took part in widespread massacres without <i>any</i> regard for age, indiscriminate, sadistic, systematic killing.</dd>

<dd>Yes, many Armenians deserted the Turkish army when they saw the Russians coming in. Would you blame if some of them did (and this some is at most, several hundred)? They had been desperate to leave the miserable conditions the Empire had been forcing upon them and had been deluded by the CUP's promises for constitutional reform. Reread Ramsey's quote and see how he describes that Armenians and Greeks were "dogs to be spat upon". After all those massacres and outrages and abridged rights they had been living under for centuries, would any normal human being still tolerate them and risk his life in fighting for that same government.</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, yes, they would as the vast majority of Armenians poured their hearts into wishing well the armies of the Ottoman Empire, of blessing Armenian troops who were to be drafted, of pledging to donate foodstuffs, of condemning Armenian soldiers who deserted, of telling their people not to fight back if provoked. And look where all that blind obedience led to. A two year old child living in the heart of Turkey at that time was in no way complicit in the acts of a minority group (Russian supporters) and the fact that that child died in the Syrian desert is proof as to why the Genocide is undeniably true.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 18:06, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ok Marshall can you do something like that. check your sources about previous "Turkish crimes" and mark them on the map. you will see they are cumulated in an area where revolutionarists were active. Mainly Van, sasun, bitlis. But armenians were living every where. No real big thing ever happened in other areas that armenians lived. This centuries of massacres is simply un true. everything started after 1870s when Russia offically got the right to be the protector of ottoman Armenians. Every thing happened in the area is politically motivated. there has never been a racial hatered agains Armenians. one this is true about the Ottoman empire it supresses any uprising most brutally. But this holds true for anybody the same thing happened to pure Turks of Aydin, Kurds of diyabakir. No special treatment ro Armenians due to hate. there are thousands of quotes about the fairness of Ottoman rule one must have tried hard to find that piece "dogs to be spat upon". this is just the most stupid accusation ever. Armenians had hundrest of high ranking officers in the Ottoman empire. Read Armenian survivors testimonies at least they tell about their life there. you see I read the real Armenian sources but you do not. please read Hrant sariyans diary and see that the miss treatment is confined to the areas in uproar. Are you like Clevelander who can not stand any thing against his dogma.</dd>

<dd>If have talked what genocide is hundred times still you say it is undeniable the act. Many people died this is the undeniable fact but calling it genocide is simply outrageous. lets say all your claims are true but still if Armenians rebelled and joined the enemy and helped them this shows that the actions taken by the goverment is because o military or political conditions. Genocide can only be present in the highes level of hatered against a group. there is no such thing.</dd>

<p>We have already discussed this before. Just because the Germans had never attempted to exterminate a race until 1941, did not mean that they didn't commit genocide in that time period. Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians and Jews <b>were</b> dogs to be spat upon in the eyes of Muslims. All that nonsense coming from Voltaire and other Europeans who traveled through the region is worth nil; they never had their wives taken from them with impunity, they never were forced to pay multiple taxes, they never lived under that system so they are unable to make those judgments that the Sultan was as benevolent as they described him as. Ramsay lived there for twelve years and that's what makes his account much more credible. Armenians, Christians and Jews for that matter, did not start truly begin integrating and serving in the military until the Balkan Wars of 1912.</p>
<p>Even claiming that Armenians held such high positions (economic wise, the Ottoman Mint, ammunition, etc.) was due to the Islamic law which precluded Muslims from entering banking or interest loaning, that's the worst excuse of the "equality" argument of all.</p>
<p><i>but calling it genocide is simply outrageous</i> I don't make up the evidence, the fact that nearly every single person living there at the time, Turkish ally or not, stated that they saw Armenians being destroyed systematically. The fact that much of the evidence <b>in private correspondence (telegrams, letters, etc.)</b> comes from Turkey's allies is what makes it so damning when wartime censorship in Germany strictly omitted such references.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 23:16, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The status of the Armenians in the Empire</span></h2>
<p>How about the POV in the pre-CUP history? The life of Ottoman second-class citizens was not nearly as repressive as the author makes it sound. Non-Muslim Ottomans could testify in religious court, but their testimony meant less. Like, say, if there is a believer's word against an "infidel"'s word. Mind, this was only the state within the <i>religious</i> courts. These always dealt with the more domestic side of the law and, even in this capacity, tended to touch and less-and-less upon the regular legal proceedings within the empire throughout the modern era. Until the fervour of nationalism infected the decaying empire, the non-Muslim Ottoman was <i>not</i> more often spit on than doffed a hat to; the Non-Muslim Ottoman was granted rights to facilitate the practices of his or her own faith and, before the seizure of power by the CUP, Christians and Jews had enjoyed two generations of being priveleged enough to choose between serving in or paying into the army. Armenian Ottomans dominated European land trade in and out of the empire. Members of the Armenian populace could win, by their merits, the respect of their Muslim, Greek and Jewish neighbours. I would also like to add that citing a European travelogue to characterize the treatment of Christians in the Ottoman Empire can only cast doubt on the validity of your characterization, based, as it seems to be, on unqualified Orientalist pulp. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.81.123.57 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.81.123.57_b487.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.81.123.57">contribs</a>) 07:03, 3 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

Well, still no change on this part of the article. I dare not make an attempt because I know this is such a sensitive and highly controversial topic; my changes would probably not last a minute. I just can't understand why people so jealously protect their status as victims. I can imagine it must be hurtful when parties claim that your murdered ancestors were never murdered (or that they deserved what they got), but inaccurately painting the everyday treatment of non-Muslims in the Ottoman Empire does nothing to lift the veils from these eyes. It must be that hateful philosophy, nationalism, that makes some Turks vehemently deny the CUP's crimes as if today's Turk would have to inherit the blame of the atrocities if they would admit the verity of them. It must be an attempt to appease the dead that makes some Armenians wish to paint with such dark colours the daily lives of their ancestors. I must repeat, Armenians did not live in constant danger, fear and disrespect from the time that the first Turcoman tribes trickled into their homeland until the establishment of an Armenian-Nation State. We need to examine the purpose of such slander. How does it help the debate between Turks and Armenians when we make it look like only non-Muslims were subject to the whims of the arbitrary and intrusive state? Wasn't it the case that all Ottoman subjects were affected by the rare occasion that the Sublime Port managed to intrude into provincial matters? Wasn't there ever any neighborliness between Muslim and non-Muslim Ottomans? What purpose is served by ignoring the data which contradicts this British ethnographers and his friends in Wikiland? If you care, check out Colin Imber, Donald Quataert or Mark Mazower and stop trying to stir up ghosts. It hurts an impartial observer to watch this. I say I'm impartial, but I am not alien to claims of victim hood. I'm Irish, but you don't see me flinging red paint at today's English. It has recently come to my attention that I may be allergic to wheat as a direct result of English prohibitions on my ancestors' diets! This, at least, is a crime against my very person. Unfortunately, none live today whom I can punish for the crime. Admittedly, few would dare deny the crimes committed against my people (and I haven't heard any accusations of genocide leveled against my forebares), so you can say that I'm speaking from privilege. All I can say in response is that no ghost is lain to rest when you greedily clutch at claims to victimhood from a position of willful denial.</p>

The text which I endorse would go as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In principle, Armenians, like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_people.html" title="Greek people">Greeks</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a>, and other <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christian communities</a> across the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> were originally subject to a corpus of laws and regulations which gave them a different legal status within the Empire than their <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> counterparts. Armenians were barred from serving in the military (and instead forced to pay an exemption tax), their testimony in Islamic courts was inadmissible against Muslims, they were not allowed to bear weapons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In practice, the status of ethnic Armenians varied widely based upon geographical location and socio-economical conditions. Whereas ethnic Armenians might have been treated as second-class citizens in rural, conservative areas of Eastern Anatolia, others living in cities like <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and <a href="../../../i/z/m/Izmir.html" title="Izmir">Izmir</a> were able to reach a considerably high status and even serve in the high ranks of the public administration. <a href="http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=ft6199p06t&amp;chunk.id=d0e6309" class="external autonumber" title="http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=ft6199p06t&amp;chunk.id=d0e6309" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>During the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzimat.html" title="Tanzimat">Tanzimat period</a>, a series of constitutional reforms provided a limited modernization of the Ottoman Empire. In <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>, the <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatt-%C4%B1_H%C3%BCmayun_4ac7.html" title="Hatt-ı Hümayun">Hatt-ı Hümayun</a></i> promised equality for all Ottoman citizens irrespective of their ethnicity and confession, widening the scope of the <a href="../../../1/8/3/1839.html" title="1839">1839</a> <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatt-i_Sharif_97c4.html" title="Hatt-i Sharif"><i>Hatt-ı Şerif</i> of Gülhane</a>. The reformist period peaked with the Constitution which was promulgated on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_23.html" title="November 23">23 November</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> and which established freedom of belief and equality of all citizens before the law.</dd>
<dd>This constitution, however, was short-lived, since <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abd%C3%BClhamid_II_89a9.html" title="Abdülhamid II">Sultan Abdülhamid II</a> suspended the constitution on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">13 February</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>, inaugurating a period of rather repressive and authoritarian rule over the Empire.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The single event that possibly triggered the chain of events is most likely the Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Turkish_War%2C_1877%E2%80%9378_88fe.html" title="Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a>. At the end of the war the Russians took control over a large portion of territory inhabited by ethnic Armenians but ceded much of it after the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Berlin%2C_1878_3b6e.html" title="Treaty of Berlin, 1878">Treaty of Berlin</a> was signed. The Russians claimed they were the supporters of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodox Christians</a> within the Ottoman Empire. The weakening control of the Ottoman government over its empire in the following 15 years led many Armenians to believe that they could gain independence from it.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>First paragraph</b>: The current content is expressed in a more neutral way. A reference to alleged "heavy taxation" (which suggests an ethnic-based selective fiscal burden, while not providing figures and references) is deleted. You may want to check out on İNALCIK &amp; QUATAERT, <i>An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300-1914</i>, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1994 or ZÜRCHER, <i>Turkey: A Modern History</i>, London, I B Tauris, 1993 to know more about fiscality in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p><b>Second paragraph</b>: The sentence <i>they were treated overall as second-class subjects</i> is a subjective opinion that could spark endless debate. While it is fair to say that there was no "equality before the law" in the contemporary Western acception, I think that it should be mentioned that geographical and socio-economical parameters had a huge impact on the status <i>de facto</i> of Armenian individuals and communities. For Armenians serving in the Ottoman administration, see for example AKARLI, <i>The Long Peace. Ottoman Lebanon, 1861-1920</i>, Berkeley, University of California Press, 1993.</p>
<p><b>Deletion of Ramsay's quote</b>: This passage must be put in the proper context. The cultural background of a 19th century English traveller might include a "propensity" (not to say bias) in favour of Christian populations which could include prejudices and sterotypes against Turks (and/or Muslims in general). If you read the autobiography of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder_ddc1.html" title="Helmuth von Moltke the Elder">Helmuth von Moltke</a> you can read a much more complex depiction of that society, even though again through the eyes of a European observer.</p>
<p><b>Third paragraph</b>: These are historical <b>facts</b> expressed in a way that I assess fair and balanced. I think that adding these details gives a more correct explanation of what was going on at that time, instead than just writing (in a quite sloppy way) that Abdülhamid <i>ruled as he saw fit</i>.</p>
<p><b>Fourth paragraph</b>: There is a minor correction. Russia endorsed the rights of Orthodox Christians.</p>

I hope that no one will not object when I translate those texts to English Wiki.

<dd>It is well known, however, that the Ottoman archives remained closed for decades to Western scholars.

<p>hilmar kaiser and Ara sarafin and many other Armenians worked in the Turkish archives and the copied some 3000 to 8000 archive documents. after working for a long time he was thrown out due to his disregard to Archvive rules. Meaning unauthorized copying and smuggling of documents. And the only noteworthy thing Ara sarafian published as far as I know is he found that the number of armenian deporties as documented by ottoman archives was not 700.000 as formerly believed. he found that that number was actually the Turkish deporties. No proof of genocide or what so ever came out.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 20:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adolf Hitler</span></h2>
<p>On August 22, 1939 Adolf Hitler gave a speech outlining his plan for Lebensraum. Lebensraum was Hitler's plan for wiping out the Jews and the Poles to create living space for his new Third Riech. In this speech Hitler refers to a little known event that he calls the Annihilation of the Armenians. Hitler pointed out that very few poeple and no governments recognize or even remember what happened to the Armenians during WWI. Basically Hitler was using the Armenian Genocide as an example of what he would be able to get away with while dealing with the Jews of Europe. 206.78.245.35 16:55, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether the Wikipedia article says so or not, the reason the quote is in dispute has to do with the fact that the Turks want to hide this embarrassing part of their history. Western European governments as well as the US do not wish to upset the Turkish government or people because Turkey is new to the EU and NATO and serves as an important jumping off point for wars that are fought in the region (ie Iraq). There is more to gain on all sides if the Armenian Genocide just goes away (thus the growing denial movement). There is very little to gain in making up the Armenian Genocide as the world community - and the UN - doesn't really do anything about genocides as you can see from what's happening in Sudan and what has happened in Rwanda, Shri Lanka, Somalia, and many dozens of other places around the globe.

<p>Remember the simple fact that the "document" containing the hitler quote was rejected as "unreliable" in Nurenberg trials. the presence of this quote in the genocide museum actually shows how reluctant The armenians are abouth accepting the truth.

<dd>Not a single claim you make here is accurate or truthful. The truth is that the "Lochner" version of the Hitler speech(s)was known and accepted as the most thorough of the three versions (all from notes taken as there was no prepared text or such). The reason it was not used was that the portion of the speech that was useful to the nuremburg prosecuters concerned pre-meditation of the attack on and Hitler's plans against Poland and all of the documents contained the passages related to this. The prosecutors were aware of the aggressive cross examination and attempts b the defense to discredit documents and even though all were confident of the accuracy of the Lochner document (and have maintained this under oath) the issue had to do with the veracity of the chain of possesion of the documents. As the other two versions were taken directly from captured German Officers (at wars end) they were much more difficult to challenge then a version obtained much earlier (1939) through Lochner. Thus there was no need to enter into evidence a document that could cause delay or such from a defense challenge. And the "so-called" Andonian documents have never been proven to be forgeries. However they are difficult to verify as the originals of the documents have been lost. However, the primary content of the telegrams has been verified and corroborated through other sources - thus one can assume that these documents are in fact accurate as nothing in them has ever actually been contradicted and they conform with what is known from other sources. However, much like as with the "Lochner" version of Hitler's speech(s) the "Andonian" documents are unecessary as a proof of the Genocide as there exists a plethora of corroborated and sourced and clearly reliable data that prove the Armenian genocide with more then sufficient detail and confidence. 1.5 million figure for the Armenian genocide is at least as accurate as the 6 million figure for the Jewish Holocaust and both figures can be thought of similarly - as an approximate number useful to guage the size of the crime in terms of general numner of individuals killed. In each case whether the actual figure is somwhat more or somewhat less is immaterial. What is important is the utter devestation of the ethnic communitiy and the deliberate systamatic plan engaged to exterminate such. And what is also noteworth is how deniers of each genocide continually harp on these figures and attempt to dispute the accuracy of such as if this actually matters or changes anything. It doesen't. What it does is show the lengths that deniers will go and exposes the paucity of argument that they have to dispute the basic and known and important facts of the matter. And in this regard, as in most others, genocide deniers only show their true colors to the world.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 01:47, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well you've heard wrong. I always find it funny that some Turks would even attempt to make the claim that there was a conspiracy during/just after WWII to link Hitler with the Armenian Genocide (claiming that thses statements were fabricated...by who? For what reason? There was absolutly no Armenian effort towards Genocide recognition at this time and no involvement of any Armenians in this besides - it is an absurd claim and bespeaks of Turkihs paranoia and desperation) And indeed these are not the only statements made by Hitler concerning the Turkish extermination of Armenians - there are several on record - this one is just the most famous. And again - no one has ever "proven" the so-called "Andonian" telegrams as forgories...based on what? - official Turkish scholorship??? please - are you trying to make a joke...I'm certainly laughing.

<dd>they are forged for robust and simple reason. 1. in one of the telegrams the person who sends the telegram was not working in that region at that time. 2. the guy who forged the telegram made another fatal eror by forgeting the time difference between regular calender and the callender used my muslims. 3. the paper style does not match the papers used in otoman communication and archives 4. the signatures are not real (doesnt match the real signature) as proven by forensic experts. 5. the real documents are not around no one has seen the originals but the copies. And dadriann is really respected. he was the chanpion on defending the andonian documents.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Legal Vandalism</span></h2>
<p>Some people prevented me from translating Turkish article on Armenian genocide to English and add it to the main article as a section without changing the content of the main article. Considering the fact that almost everyone making a research does not visit the related pages, it is a pity to not to mention of Turkish thesis in the main page. It can be accepted by most of the people that the name of the events took place in 1915 in Turkey is genocide, but the people disagreeing are not few in number. Hence, Turkish minority has the right to express themselves in the main page. The same people who prevented me from the translation were complaining about the vandals in Wikipedia. My problem is that if the page were not in the position that they do like, then they would most probably be vandals themselves. They prevent other opinions to be expressed in order to protect their opinion to be served as the best and the only opinion. It is quite unfortunate that wikipedia itself is considered to be a reliable source, but it is certainly not objective. Until such vandalism is stopped, I will not continue editing the site. It might be until forever but who cares.

<dd>Don't preach to us about vandalism. One of the largest vandalisms in written <i>history</i> was carried out by your government during the creation of the modern day republic of Turkey, and in the words of the late American ambassador to Turkey, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Morgenthau_c302.html" title="Henry Morgenthau">Henry Morgenthau</a>, "<i>Whatever crimes the most perverted instincts of the human mind can devise, and whatever refinements of persecution and injustice the most debased imagination can conceive, became the daily misfortunes of this devoted people.</i>"</dd>
<dd>Don't talk to me about vandalism. That of the approximately 2,500 Armenian monasteries and churches in Turkey, only 6 remain in existence, <i>that</i> constitutes vandalism, and was perpetrated by <i>your</i> government which created a country from the looted property, money, and treasures of the Armenian people, and has blood all over its hands.</dd>
<dd>Don't talk to me about vandalism. That my maternal grandfather <i>narrowly</i> escaped death from the hands of the Turks in <a href="../../../d/i/y/Diyarbekir.html" title="Diyarbekir">Diyarbekir</a> in 1915; that my grandfather was sentenced to death because he was an Armenian Apostolic Christian; that with the quick-thinking of his mother and while the Turkish guards were looking the other way she pushed my grandfather with the other much smaller set of children who were Armenian Protestants and who were not going to be massacred due to the presence of American missionaries; that without this whim of a woman, without that random thought I would not be alive today haunts me to this day...</dd>
<dd>And yet you, who are ignorant of your own country's past, come here preaching vandalism? You, whose grandparents and great-grandparents have removed the Armenian people from their historic homeland while killing off 2/3 of them; who ripped open unborn fetuses from the belies of pregnant women; who raped Armenian women in front of their husbands before killing both; who took the most beautiful women for themselves; who plundered, burned, ruined, and destroyed forever any remaining evidence of Armenian churches, monasteries, libraries, illuminated manuscripts, books, metal artwork, church icons, khatchkars (stone crosses), embroidery and needlework, carpets, antiques, sculptures, tombstones, woodcarvings, alfresco paintings, and medieval documents, as well as many other specimens of Armenian culture; whose vandalism lead to the irretrievable loss of the culture and the arts of the Armenian people whose value cannot be measured in any way.</dd>
<dd>Go! Read the <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Trial_of_Soghoman_Tehlirian" class="external text" title="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Trial_of_Soghoman_Tehlirian" rel="nofollow">Trial of Soghomon Tehlirian</a> , the man who assassinated one of the masterminds of the Genocide - Talaat Pasha - and who was found "not guilty" in a German court. Read the eyewitness accounts of the genocide in that trial. And then go tell your countrymen about it; tell your parents, your girlfriend, and all your friends about what your great-grandparents did to the Armenians living in your country. Tell them how Turkey was founded. The ghosts of the dead and the cries of the living will forever haunt you, otherwise. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 23:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An Ottoman naval officer in the War Office described the planning:</p>
<p>In order to justify this enormous crime [of the Armenian Genocide] the requisite propaganda material was thorougly prepared in Istanbul.

There are plently of works including those pictures, they have been presented during the exibiton of Wegner pictures and are confirmed, in this cases the scan comes from him, but only because he had the written permission. The other picture which I have loaded, comes from the Soviet Union and confirmed by reports of that cites of mass burning as the description of the picture says from those who took the picture.

<p>Well, this page should not be the place to discuss those, but since it has started, and since I think it might help to improve the article and the talk page empathy-wise, I’ll be posting it here. We can later move it to the arguments article if it’s more appropriate. I hope that you read all of it.</p>
<p>First of all, I’ll try not to use the word “Genocide”, not because I deny it, but because I think it’s a major dialogue-cutter, and as soon as someone blurts out the words “genocide” or “not a genocide” it’s not possible to discuss anymore.</p>
<p>I’ll start with briefly commenting on the very first entry under this header which said “Republic of Turkey should not shoulder the responsibility for what the Ottoman Empire did” and responses to that;</p>
<p>I personally do not believe in any kind of behavior inheritance. One should neither be credited nor criticized for what his predecessors have done. He can be proud or embarrassed of his ancestors, but since he is not an allottee, he is not the one to be praised or accused.</p>
<p>And in this case of “the disgraceful event in 1915” (that’s how Atatürk called it), the new Turkish Republic certainly bears no responsibilities. The administration who were responsible for the event were exiled from the new republic; and Enver pasha (the brain behind it) even tried to lead a Soviet backed military coup against the republic. And THOTH, to your question; yes, it was the Nazis who committed the Holocaust; not the people. The German nation was just their pawns. They might be held responsible for bringing them to power, but not even strongly for that. Let me explain;</p>
<p>I attend to those children camps named CISV, and there we have an interesting game called “Peace war peace”. You split the kids into groups, and let the each group to build their “Perfect city” (made of cardboards/paints/scissors etc.&#160;:) ) for couple of hours. Then you send each group to a different city, and order them to destroy it. There is a brief moment of hesitation, until somebody starts smashing. And as soon as kids see their “Perfect city” getting smashed, they just smash the others’ more passionately. In the end we ask each of them why they did it, and the answer is same all the time; because they were ordered to do it…</p>
<p>Now you may oppose me by saying grown-ups should know better than kids. But believe me they do not. Misguidance supported with biased information can make people act in a way that they would never do or believe in things that they would never believe. Today, we are in the age of information and there are still so many people deceived by the biased information. (Just the other day I was trying to convince a Greek guy that in Turkish maps we do not show Greece as a part of Turkey) And yet a century ago, without mass media or Internet, misguiding the people was way easier for the rulers to. (Günter Grass was an SS for god’s sake)</p>
<p>And one more point to this discussion; the history imposed to us is deflected to begin with. I think a quote by George Orwell is best to explain it. “He who controls the past, commands the future. He who commands the future, conquers the past” The reason why Holocaust is so widely known is because of the Allied propaganda to justify their prior massacres and war-crimes, and the powerful Jewish Diaspora. If it was the Axis who won the war, we would probably listen to the stories about massacres in the British colonies and American natives wiped out in the new world. Yet USA, the only country to use a nuclear missile and thus is responsible of its direct or indirect effects on six million people (and this just made me think another thing, could you held the American citizens responsible for that?), today launches itself as the symbol of Democracy. Ever wondered why only a few know about Dresden Bombing, a civilian massacre in the once considered the most beautiful city in the Europe after it was certified that the Axis lost the war. I am not defending Hitler or whatsoever, looking at what he did he was a terrible guy, all I am saying he was not “the” terrible guy. And don’t forget that the new-arising genocide recognitions are –unfortunately- nothing but political games. Ask an average French or an Argentine about the Armenian genocide and they probably do not have any idea about it.</p>
<p>Back in the subject. Right now I am almost about to finish a pro-Armenian Genocide book called “the Great Calamity” by a Turkish scholar Halil Berktay. I believe I can see it from Armenian point of view. It’s simple, a nation seeking independence just like Greeks and Bulgarians, backed up by Tsardom of Russia of the Allied to finish up already wounded Ottoman Empire. Then I can see the Ottoman point of view, once a world renowned glorious empire, now leaking, trying to cleanse the infidels from every bit of its land left. Combining it with the misguidance I mentioned above, I bet even the Armenian ultra-nationalist of today would take part in the Ottoman side in the 1915 events if they were born Turkish, and vice versa.</p>
<p>I clearly remember the first time I heard about the massacre in 1998, when I was 15. That was in Italy. Before that, I had never heard anything, not even a word about it because of our Governments’ policies. I was asked about what I think about it, and I had no idea. It’s not that I am constantly doing researches about the subject, but since then I had been thoroughly reading everything that I come across. And I think that both Turkish and Armenian approaches to the subject are awful. Turkish education system trains people to be ignorant defendants parroting the word “relocation”, while the Armenians are getting filled up with rage and hatred against the “bloodthirsty Turks”.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, acceptance or denial of the Armenian genocide should not be the issue at this point. I, as a Turk, personally feel embarrassed of what some of my people did in 1915, but I think even Armenians should feel a portion of that – As a human. “The disgraceful act” should remain in the past, never to be forgotten, but not to be burdened on the shoulders of the new Turkish generation.<a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsee_0c2d.html" title="User:Ombudsee">Ombudsee</a> 17:14, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will try to answer the points you bring up. First, if there is no justice done to the perpetrators (or their descendants) then history quite simply repeats itself. And this is why legal institutions have been created.</dd>
<dd>In regards to your empathy point, try this on for size: How would you feel if a future "temporary" Armenian government (similar to the CUP in intent and time of power) attempted to annihilate Turkey, but only be able to wipe out 2/3 of Turkey's population and confiscate the property and assets owned by 99% of the Turkish population; politically went out of power; and the new Armenian government denied it ever happened, hired historians to rewrite that chapter in Armenia's history, taught subsequent generations of Armenian people that the incident never happened, destroyed any Turkish mosque or other cultural building in the part of the territory which it attacked (even 50 years <i>after</i> the fact), removed all traces of the word "Turkish" from Eastern Anatolian tourist guides, and claimed that even if the Turkish Genocide <i>was</i> true, that the new government could not be held responsible, since it was a different government who perpetrated it. Have you thought about how you might feel about that? Are you implying that it would be <i>alright</i> if Armenians completely disclaimed any responsibility, accountability, and even association, if they allowed such a "crazy" Armenian government to temporarily come to power, wipe out the bulk of the Turkish population, and then be replaced by a new government?</dd>
<dd>In the U.S., when a new president is elected or a republican-controlled Congress is voted out and replaced by a Democratic one, the new president or Congress (and the American people who brought them to power) continues to bear responsibility for any liabilities incurred by the outgoing administration (as much as they reap the benefits of any inherited <i>assets</i>). Once president George W. Bush is gone, the incumbent president won't be able to say, "Iraq is not our responsibility, we're pulling out. Fallujah? What is that?", or "You remember that 8 trillion dollar national debt from a year ago. Well, that was just part of the <i>old</i> administration. They had nothing to do with us. We're a new start, everyone deserves a fresh start. How do you expect us to be held liable for what they did? They're <i>long</i> gone." You see, no matter <i>what</i> government controls a country, the people are ultimately responsible for bringing that party to power. The continuum here is <i>the people</i>, and although leaders change, the people who bring them to power don't, and therefore are collectively responsible for their actions in the past, just as future generations will be for their collective actions in the <i>present</i>.</dd>
<dd>As an aside, there is ample evidence of the participation of the <i>local</i> Turkish population in the massacres during the Hamidian massacres as well as the Armenian Genocide. The sentiments of the Turkish locals were displayed in their preference of using bludgeons to beat to death their Armenian neighbors. (Albeit it can be argued that not <i>all</i> Turkish locals felt this way, but evidently the sentiment <i>against</i> the Armenians ultimately won out the sentiment <i>for</i> the Armenians among the Turkish people.) <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 19:12, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all you just can not hold responsible the descendants of the perpetrators. That is against the law. That would be like sending you to the jail because your father committed a crime and died before he was punished. Your example about US Government is totally irrelevant. Change of administration is one thing, finding a new government, overthrowing the old one, and sending the old executives to exile is another.

<dd>About your story of empathy; As I said, I am not defending Turkish point of view. Nevertheless I am criticizing it. I just said that I have never heard about this tragic event until I was 15. So I am on your side about the unfair behavior done to your people. What I am saying is, you could hear another empathy story from a Turkish ultra-nationalist as; (your style - changing the words Turkish and Armenian) “How would you feel if Armenian men were on a battle in Eastern Armenia, and the Turkish gangs attack on the undefended Armenian women and children in western Armenia, gathering them together in a church and burn them alive”. -That’s exactly what I mean-. It’s probably not only our history that was re-written and biased – Yours is too. Right now you think of the Dashnaks as valiant partisans fought for their independence. For many Turkish people lived in the Eastern Ottoman Empire they were bloodthirsty villains! It’s clear that both of our histories look at this event from two extends, and truth is somewhere in between.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>About the Turkish population joining the massacres, of course they did! In the end it was not only Enver Pasha himself committed the crime. I already told it in the misguidance part of my first post. Again what I am saying was that the Armenians people also reacted the same way to Turkish locals (Action – Reaction). It happened almost a century ago, and neither you nor me are in responsible for any of these; but we humans, don’t we love to sow seeds of hatred for generations.<a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsee_0c2d.html" title="User:Ombudsee">Ombudsee</a> 20:13, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Ombudsee: "First of all you just can not hold responsible the descendants of the perpetrators. That is against the law."</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what law you're referring to and in which country, but there is no statute of limitations for crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court; this includes war crimes and crimes against humanity (e.g. genocide).(See <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm" rel="nofollow">ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT</a>)</dd>
<dd>2. Ombudsee: "And plus, it was not the Turkish people who brought the Enver Pasha to power to begin with."</dd>
<dd>Then who? The Morrocans?</dd>
<dd>3. Ombudsee: "... gathering them together in a church and burn them alive”.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to see a reference to that account you're referring to, wherein Armenians rounded up Turks and burnt them in a mosque. It sounds fabricated, to me.</dd>
<dd>4. Ombudsee: "Again what I am saying was that the Armenians people also reacted the same way to Turkish locals (Action – Reaction)."</dd>
<dd>Wrong. Armenians didn't react in the same way, because they <i>couldn't</i>. The Ottoman government disarmed all the able-bodied Armenian men who were recruited into the Ottoman army and who were fighting <i>on the side of the Ottoman Empire</i>, they were forced to work in labor battalions, and were subsequently slaughtered. Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire <i>couldn't</i> react the same way, because there were no able-bodied men to protect the civilian population in most of Anatolia - hence the unabated forced marches of the civilian population into the deserts and in circles. (Now once the news spread of the massacres, the small portion communities which <i>could</i> defend themselves did.)</dd>
<dd>5. Ombudsee: "but we humans, don’t we love to sow seeds of hatred for generations."</dd>
<dd>Obtaining due justice for the crime of the Armenian Genocide is not to "sow seeds of hatred." Rather, it is about sowing seeds of justice, an act of <i>enforcing international law</i>, for a more <i>peaceful</i> world. How? By <i>deterring</i> those intent on enacting genocide in the present and in the future. So that future generations will understand that the act of genocide is a crime punishable by the law, that it is a crime that is <i>enforced</i>, not something lost to time and fading memories. And, importantly, that crimes against humanity have no statute of limitations, that there is no legal loophole wherein one government can commit a genocide, only to have a subsequent government deny association and responsibility. This is the <i>crux</i> of genocide law.</dd>
<dd>Ultimately, genocide law enforcement is about creating a more sustainable world for future generations of humans. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 20:56, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are way off the charts Serouj:</dd>
<dd>1* You have no idea what the ICC is about. + see the principle of the non-retroactivity of the penal statutes. I left a very detailed explanation about this couple of weeks ago, in which I explained the position of the international law on this. I suggest you take a look at it again. I explained what conventions, courts apply/don't apply, and for which jurisdictions or acts. No court on the face of this earth has the authority to judge this except a "half-court" which can only do so if it is seized by concerned nation-states, and that only for an opinion, not a judgement. I am not going to waste my time writing all my opinion again, it is up there. ICC cannot even judge the American soldiers in Iraq, what r u talking about?&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>2* What he meant was the analogy with the Nazis: Nazis were elected, however Enver Pasha &amp; co. came to power via a ~palace coup (kinda).</dd>
<dd>For the rest.. I don't want to get in since I am not a historian. But also know that your last paragraph was completely false and filled with half-truths: a) there is no statute of limitations for crimes against humanity but there is <b>no retroactivity either</b>. In any case, they apply for individuals, and they are all dead b) ditto for genocide law. I am an intl lawyer, and if you find a legal precedent that says the Genocide convention is retroactive without its express modification and ratification by its signatories (something that was not even proposed until today), then I will throw my Bar membership to the garbage.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>In any case, this article is currently based on historical analysis. So do not bring in modern political disputes into it. As for crimes against humanity, you can sue the individuals, but they are all dead. As for genocide, can't sue Turkey since the convention is not retroactive. Simple really. So stick to the historical analysis and establishment of dialogue between Turkey and Armenia so both sides can share their stories: no need to speculate about other things like compensation, territory etc.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:26, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It would actually be nice if this issue could have been settled by some courts back in the day <i>either</i> way. Then at least people could get a move on. I am just saying that, unfortunately, the obscurity surrounding the legal situation (in its entireity: genocide question + the issues concerning individuals) will continue until the end of time, unless there is some sort of extremely unexpected event that takes place (i don't know what that would be).<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:35, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>3. Actually (and ironically), might be surprising to you, but I read that event from that Pro-Armenian Genocide book I mentioned before. And just the feed your appetite quickly, I typed the words "burn, mosque, Armenian, alive" to Google; and reached this web site; <a href="http://genocide.blogcu.com/1280868/" class="external free" title="http://genocide.blogcu.com/1280868/" rel="nofollow">http://genocide.blogcu.com/1280868/</a> Towards the end, you'll see the English version of it. Now you'll probably say that it is a POV source - And that's what I had been saying from the beginning! We – both – have – biased – POV – sources. But there’s “a portion of truth” in all of them, and “the truth” is somewhere in between.</dd>

<dd>4. You picture Armenians as sole defenseless victims that showed no resistance while massacred. (Or maybe that’s how your history told you so) However, there was a constant fight between the Armenian gangs, fed by Tsar’s Russia, and the Armenian nation was unfairly punished for that. I want to put a stress on unfairly, since I strictly believe that wars are between armies, not an army against civilians. Actually <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> is again right in this issue. I may have gone too far in this reply though I am not a historian.

Your lust for revenge won’t bring back the massacred people of you, but a step towards may prevent the similar events of the future.</dd>

<dd>First, please quit the personal attacks of "aggression" against my person; there is no basis for that.</dd>

<dd>If you don't mind, please re-cite the book and the page number.</dd>
<dd>4. "You picture Armenians as sole defenseless victims that showed no resistance while massacred. (Or maybe that’s how your history told you so)"</dd>
<dd>I studied the Armenian Genocide at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a>. Armenians were defenseless in the vast majority of their communities in the Ottoman Empire, once able-bodied men were enlisted in the Ottoman army, disarmed, and subsequently slaughtered.</dd>
<dd>5. "How can you even talk about punishing The Turkish people of today for a more peaceful world?"</dd>
<dd>In the same way I, and the rest of the world, can talk about holding Germany accountable for the crimes of the Third Reich.</dd>
<dd>6. "the seeds of peace is not sown by punishing (that is like beating your kid when he does something wrong); but by forgiving, listening to the other side, and never forgetting."</dd>
<dd>And in this utopia of yours, do murderers, rapists, and robbers roam the Earth as free men? "Forgiven" and "listened to," even befriended by the families of their victims? Or are they incarcerated? Or some how held accountable for their crimes? I, and the civilized world, certainly prefer accountability; that's why we have created <i>laws</i> and corresponding <i>penalties</i> when those laws are broken.</dd>
<dd>7. To answer Baristarim and you regarding genocide law, international law as all law is continually evolving and is meant to maximize sustainability of human life on Earth. To this end, maximizing justice (which includes amending and reforming current law) benefits all of humanity, because it leads to greater peace (by deterring others from carrying out the same crime). Will international law on genocide be applied retroactively in the future? Perhaps, if in so doing human sustainability is increased (and with sufficient diligence on the part of humanity). History is in the making today, and we're all a part of it. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 23:17, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The name of the book is “Büyük felaket; 1915 Katliamı ve Ermeni Sorunu, Belgeler, tanıklıklar ve Halil Berktay, Taner Akçam, Stefanos Yerasimos’un yorumlarıyla”, rawly translated as “The Great Calamity, 1915 Massacres and Armenian incident; Documents, eyewitnesses and the comments by <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halil_Berktay_d8ff.html" title="Halil Berktay">Halil Berktay</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Taner_Ak%C3%A7am_fee4.html" title="Taner Akçam">Taner Akçam</a> and Stefanos Yerasimos” page 8 - A memory by Suat Yalaz. Plus; I came across something else in the same book and would like to share that; It is from the Interview by Die Zeit, of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Aznavour_20a4.html" title="Charles Aznavour">Charles Aznavour</a>, the French artist with Armenian ancestry whose parents migrated to Paris from Istanbul (as you probably knew before), who is one of the biggest defendants of recognition of Armenian Genocide by the French Government. He states “why should one weigh down the hunchback of 1915 Genocide on the today’s Turkish Generation? Yes, why? Why should today’s generation carry this burden! It’s obvious that what has been done, how it has been done and who has done it.”</dd>

Besides, it’s even more of an utopia to apply retroactivity in crimes. One third of the USA would join Mexico, while the other two third of Americans go back to Europe – because their ancestors committed crime against American Indians. Let’s please be realistic and a little bit positive while we still have a chance. We can not change the past, but we can reminisce, respect and learn from it.

<dd>(edit conflict) (to Serouj) You really made me smile, and I am not being sarcastic! I really wish that the world was that romantic and idealistic. Unfortunately, it is not. I wish some of the things you said about law were true.. Law doesn't exist to maximize the sustainibility of human life on earth per se, it exists to provide "order" first and foremost. From a Marxist point of view, you can also say that it serves to "legitimize" the violence of the rich against the poorer classes. <i>However</i>, what's tricky is that, "maximizing the sustainibility of human life/the greater good" doesn't mean the "ideological good". "Good" is a matter of interpretation. I definitely don't see the genocide convention being amended, and <i>not at all</i> because of Turkey/Armenia: because of much greater wars and "genocides" that took place in China, Africa, Soviet Union, with <i>much greater</i> casualties. Besides, from a philosophical point of view, retroactivibility of notions is not correct: it can lead to anachronisms and confusion of notions with eras. But who knows, maybe it will be amended one day. But what will it bring at the end of the day?</dd>
<dd>I also prefer accountability, however one should also not forget to be pragmatic and remember one of the basic tenets of nature: "time". Human creations of "law" and "ideology" are no match for the creations of nature: "time". It has been nearly a century, there won't be any "accountability". Not to mention the increasing fuzziness about what happened. My grandfather was born 1910, what r u talking about? Acccountability of what to whom precisely? Time took care of that: there are no second takes in life. So, I agree: history for historians.</dd>
<dd>And nobody should emotionalize the issue: that's not a good outlook on life. Life is hard&amp;complicating, and emotionalizing issues won't get people somewhere. So get a grip. In any case, this is not a forum: how is this discussion relevant to the article? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. "Your solutions are only to turn the problem to a feud."</dd>
<dd>I don't think so. Germany was held accountable for the crimes of the Third Reich, and relations between Israel and Germany are quite alright, no feud there.</dd>
<dd>2. We're talking about the Armenian Genocide here; not the genocide of the Rwandans, Native Americans, etc. Each of those are significant and have their separate articles, so please stick to the subject.</dd>
<dd>3. "we should not fight over the wording of what has happened in 1915, but instead commemorate and show respect to the unfortunate common history we have."</dd>
<dd>Right. Turks should accept the Armenian Genocide for what it is.</dd>
<dd>4. "Your alternative to “my utopia” is punishing the children of the murderers, rapists, and robbers. Not the actual criminals."</dd>
<dd>Some entity has to be held accountable, and that is the republic of Turkey, which inherited the Ottoman Empire and has been politically considered to be the same state. In the same way that Turkey has inherited the assets and liabilities of the Ottoman Empire, it also has inherited accountability to war crimes and genocide.</dd>
<dd>5. "we should not fight over the wording of what has happened in 1915, but instead commemorate and show respect to the unfortunate common history we have."</dd>
<dd>I think the average Turk turned out okay in the end: he got his Armenian neighbor's house, property, money, and perhaps his best-looking daughter as a concubine or wife — all for free. So I fail to see the unfortunate "common" history.</dd>
<dd>6. "The only way we can punish the ones who were responsible is by building a future together thus proving them wrong."</dd>
<dd>The last time Armenians agreed to build such a future "together" with the Turks was with the Committee of Union and Progress. Same promises, same hopes, and we know what that future looks like: physical genocide, cultural genocide, and now denial of genocide. (Indeed, the Dashnaks were among those who signed up for this "collective future" and helped the CUP come to power, which I think is one of the ironies of the Armenian Genocide.) You must therefore take me for an imbecile. I don't think the collective memory of Armenians are that short-sighted (mine certainly isn't) to sign up with Turks again, especially with today's Turkey not even admitting <i>guilt</i> on the part of the Ottoman Empire.</dd>

<dd>Well, historical "guilt" could be a tricky one, particularly if "guilt" is not clearly attributed and/or not defined. Frankly, I think that people should just get a move on. None of us were alive back then, even my granpa was six years old during the FWW. And he is already dead. So I don't understand why people of today should start guilt-tripping. "Recognition" won't bring anything either. Even if one day Turkish parliament says "yes, Turks are genocidal barbarians", I know exactly what will happen: nothing. What is it going to bring? The only thing, that I have felt over the years, that would bring "closure" to some people would be to establish some sort of Great Armenia et al. Well, there you enter modern politics and exit the realm of history. In fact, sometimes I think that the only thing keeping alive the Armenian identity is the fact that Turkey contests the attribution of the g-word. If it ever did, I think that a majority of the Armenian identity would dissolve and Armenia become an ordinary small state of the world. So, it's a double-edged sword: do people want Turkey to use the g-word knowing that doing so would lead to the dissolution of the Armenian identity in a few generations? That's the food for thought 4 today&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:01, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're absolutely right. Nevermind the Armenian language, Armenian traditions, Armenian architecture, Armenian stone masonry, the 1700 year old Armenian Church, Armenian literature of 1600 years, Armenian embroidery, the 1600-year-old Armenian alphabet, Armenian dance, Armenian food, Armenian songs and music, Armenian cultural monuments of millenia, and 2,500 years of Armenian history. Certainly none of <i>those</i> can be considered Armenian culture and the basis of Armenian identity. After all, just like other humans, Armenians are limited to only 100 years of memory, and the Armenian clock therefore starts ticking shortly before the Armenian Genocide in 1915... Surely not back to 500 B.C... Who remembers <i>that</i> long?</dd>
<dd>You're absolutely right. Just like the Jews, Armenians will forget their identity once the genocide perpetrated against them has seen justice.</dd>
<dd>Surely as the Jews dissolved Israel after the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a>, after the Armenian Genocide is properly recognized and justice served, Armenians, too, will have an identity crisis, will dissolve Armenia, and call their 2500-year-old collective existence quits.</dd>
<dd>NOT! That doesn't fly with me!</dd>
<dd>Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.</dd>
<dd>Like the Holocaust was for the Jews, the Armenian Genocide was a wakeup call to Armenians on the true intentions of Turkey and its leaders: a Pan-Turan across Asia; and that means there's no room for Armenians nor Armenia. Their respective genocides is something that <i>neither</i> group can forget, and indeed has become part of the psyche of any group surviving such unimaginable suffering. Furthermore, Armenians can never forget the deception of the Turks (specifically, the governing CUP) up to the very last moments of the Armenian Genocide. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 19:43, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, I think this marks a new trend in genocide denial. Here's a brief history:</dd>
<dd>1. "Genocide? What Armenian Genocide? They were harmless deportations and relocations, inter communal warfare."</dd>
<dd>2. "Alright, genocide, but on the part of the Ottoman Empire; not Turkey! Certainly you can't hold <i>us</i> accountable, even though we <i>did</i> inherit everything else belonging to the Ottoman Empire, and are in fact the same state legally."</dd>
<dd>3. "Okay. Okay. The Ottoman Empire executed the premeditated genocide of the Armenian people, and Turkey should be held accountable, as did Germany after the Third Reich. But so <i>what</i>? What does <i>that</i> change? That didn't change the relationship between Germany and Israel an inch!"</dd>
<dd>4. And finally today... "Do Armenians really, truly, surely <i>want</i> recognition of the Armenian Genocide? Surely they can't be <i>that</i> short-sighted; after all, with the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, Armenians will lose their their 2500 year old identity! Stop now, Armenians, while you can! It's a geno-suicide!"</dd>
<dd>Indeed, the human mind can be quite creative when it doesn't want to believe something — an interesting evolutionary trait of man. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 19:43, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Frankly, I think that people should just get a move on. None of us were alive back then, even my granpa was six years old during the FWW. And he is already dead."</dd>
<dd>No one is forcing you to stay out of your free will. Fortunately, enough eyewitness accounts (both third-parties in the Ottoman Empire, as well as survivors of the genocide) have been documented and disseminated, thanks to the inventions of writing and the printing press (and, of course, the camera) that we don't <i>need</i> to have those eyewitnesses alive today; their testimonies have been written in books (e.g. by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Morgenthau%2C_Sr._d795.html" title="Henry Morgenthau, Sr.">Henry Morgenthau, Sr.</a>) (and sometimes with cross-examination, in the case of the trial of <a href="../../../s/o/g/Soghomon_Tehlirian_9f57.html" title="Soghomon Tehlirian">Soghomon Tehlirian</a>). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 20:20, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"So I don't understand why people of today should start guilt-tripping."</dd>
<dd>There's no more "guilt-tripping" here than there has been for the pressing by Jews and others who suffered at the hands of the Nazis for proper recognition and justice for the Holocaust. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 20:20, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aha.. The difference between Israel is that the Israeli people do not wish to carve back today's German lands for themselves. Secundo, analogy with the Jews is not correct: it is just a tool to get greater publicity, I am sorry to say. In any case, to clear a misunderstanding, I was referring primarily to the Armenian diaspora. Armenia will stay there obviously, but it is a very small country - that's all I was trying to say. + what are you talking about germany having been held accountable and all? Germany was never held accountable, and the treaties signed after the second world war specifically specified that Germany will not be held accountable for anything against anyone, neither against any individual or any state. Nuremberg trials were for the individuals, not the country. My father's uncle married a German Jew back in the 50s, and the only compensation they ever received was part of a settlement in 2000 between the German <i>companies</i> who had used Jewish labor and their descendants. That's all. Germany never a) paid a cent b) compensated with territory c) done anything except attending memorial ceremonies. Was that right? Maybe not, but all I am trying to say is: put things in context. That's all. This whole issue has become definitely not historical: This whole thing has become a mix of pyschological and sociological projections, some at the deepest level, reflected on a wide range of issues supported by various obscure and undeterminable traits of human nature, all with completely different aims. This goes for everyone involved by the way. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Theres nothing tricky about historical guilt the ottomans were responsible for thousands of Armenians death the turks say they were simply relocated Armenians that actually falls in the category of 'Ethnic cleansing" the ottoman empire had a population of almost 2 million Armenians while they were slowly disappearing. There were many wars during the noted genocide years so you can't blame the Turkish government for all that. But nower days people are doing very bad things the newer generations are breeding hate so much on both sides its sick very sick people fighting over these things obviously a historical debate will not help all that would do is cause more constriversy if one side doesn't aggree after. Millions of Armenians were simply "Relocated" that caused them to suffer and die without homes, refuges, homeless etc. Also theres nothing wrong with recognizing a crime you have done Germany took it well so should turkey if it wasn't a genocide it was a massacre either way thousands of Armenians were being persecuted in the hands of there governments, or discriminated against, maybe the militias started this but thats no reason to take it out on the poor civilians and propaganda is no way to look at this. The Assyrians and Kurds were also victimized by the ottoman empire. Even if it was genocide or not millions were being deported from there homes the turks dislike this and they cant believe there ancestors would commit such crimes i guess. Both sides suffered alot thousands were killed the fact is turkey denying such a thing is irrational to the Armenians while the some turks claim Armenians killed one million turks Eh let the historians debate this.

<dd>Well, whatever "hatred" there is, nothing much will happen at the society level until the general situation in the Caucausus, Middle East and Western Asia improves. I mean, the situation is so s... in that part of the world (not because of Armenia/Turkey, but with all sorts of weird political stuff happening in every km square), that I am sometimes surprised that things are holding out the way they are now. <i>That's why</i> historical discussions are not taking place in a healthy environement. The day there are no borders and there is some sort of unity between the states of the region like in the EU, there won't be any problems at a social level either. France and Germany kicked each other's a... for centuries, but all is cool now. That's the only way, and nothing else. Otherwise every ethnicity in the region will continue to be at each other's throats for a long time to come. I wonder if I will ever see the day when I can go around in Western Asia like I can in the EU...

<dd>It is true that this article is quite disorganized, and that could be an understatement. I thought that one of the best comments in the RfA were Francis' about how the article kept goind around and around. Many comments in the RfA had good points, and one particular thing was how the talk page had this (unavoidable) tendency to become a forum; and sometimes like one of the talk pages of Google or MySpace groups, if I may add. Maybe we should ban everyone and let some completely unrelated and non-Wikipedian people write this article, like Japanese, Peruvians, Eskimos etc&#160;:) If it were possible, I would suggest the Martians or Andromedians. Generally, and not targetting anyone in particular <i>at all</i>, I notice that editing this article is like skating on an <i>un</i>frozen lake, really&#160;:) Even the slightest of edits can lead to all sorts of edit-wars and admin protects. This article has been full-protected a third of the time since I have joined Wikipedia, and semi-protected nearly all the time. In fact, I honestly don't remember seeing this article without some sort of protect tag at all. There are edit-wars even on New Year's Eve, go figure!

<p>Actually You should have know that I never challange anything without solid proof. I just found the original book of Ahmet refik and found the page that the quote is. Once again I am delighted to see another Dadrian trick. When I see that real unbiased admins are managing an arbitration I will bring every thing out. if not it is a total waste of time. And I can also cite numerous articles of real historians on the value of your main stream sources/historians. also please check which publishers published pro turk wievs. Not to mention that publisher doesnt mean much in terms of Academical value. and finally lets see the sources in detail.</p>
<p>The main core of the article (except from the art section) has 55 citations. out of this 55 some is also about the recent political issues and the position of Turkey today. not related to history.</p>

<p>This article only cites non armenian historians 7 to 8 times. All other citations regarding the main article is Either by Armenian "Historians" or non historians and historical enemies of the Ottoman empire at that time.

<dd>Those figures have much more credibility than do the pro-Turkish stooges on the Turkish government's payroll. True, many of them are not historians per se but exactly how does this disqualify them? Is it perhaps the overwhelming evidence that not only comes from "historical Turkish enemies" but also their allies who all agreed that there were no Armenian uprisings some how compel them to hold the Genocide view? Please Neuro, the Turkish conspiracy card is a flimsy excuse and does not work under Wikipedia's rules.</dd>

<dd>I don't want to create much problem, but I have a few questions. First, why there is not a turkish POV section in this article? <i>Denial of the Genocide</i> is not Turkish POV. <b>Denial means that such an event truly happened but it is ignored.</b> I don't think that Turkish POV is to deny it. <i>Refuse</i> would be a better choice to express turkish POV. Some poeple even tried to insert an armenian genocide paragraph in the history of Turkey article, where the whole seljuq and ottoman era is overviewed in a solitary paragraph. Why can't we insert at least 5% turkish POV to this article?</dd>

<dd>Third question: Are you qualified enough to say that Turkish sources are less reliable than Armenian sources? And if turkish sources are all invaluable, than why do you use the works of Turkish historians who admitted the genocide e.g <a href="../../../t/a/n/Taner_Ak%C3%A7am_fee4.html" title="Taner Akçam">Taner Akçam</a>. Are only the historians who admitted the genocide are reliable? I take it that the reliability of the sources depends on whether the author admits the genocide.

<dd>Hi Caglarkoca, admitted the genocide is a strong word; the term genocide did not still exist at the time. Had he accepted that the previous regime was responsible? Yeh, he did in more than one occasion. He referred to the killing of 800,000 Armenians by the previous regime to General Harbord, Rauf Orbay relate in his memoir a discussion him and Ataturk had relating to the previous regime destruction of the Armenians. (Rauf Orbay, Rauf Orbay'ın Hatıraları, (Vol. 3), Yakın Tarihimiz, İstanbul, 1962 p. 179). I an interview of August 1, 1926 issue of the Los Angeles Examiner includes a passage, Ataturk relate to the previous regime destruction of the Armenian population.</dd>

<dd>Regarding Armenian vs Turkish source. The problem is not more on the secondary sources if there is no manipulation of primary sources, but rather the primary sources themselves. There are not much primary Armenian sources, and in the academia it is the Armenian primary sources which are discarded not Turkish. Take McCarthy for example, while the majority of the references he uses are Ottoman or Turkish records, when finding an Armenian primary source contradicting those, he plain and simply call them forgery, when they are Western, he call them prejudicial and anti-Turkish. So, I don’t think the problem is much Armenian vs Turkish sources, but rather Western vs Turkish sources. Turkish not as “Turkish author”, but as Turkish records. BTW, I exclude here forgery, since I restrain myself to the academia, and don’t consider forgers as academics. You will be surprised to find many Turkish scholars who aren’t in the list included in the article and who covers the subject academically, but since they are in the majority position line, (I mean Turkish scholars living abroad), you won’t hear about them much. I personally met some.</dd>

<dd>Lastly, regarding the Turkish POV, I have some difficulty with that term; positions should not be classified as Turkish, Armenian etc. POV, positions are entities by themselves, a certain class of people will support one position against the other, while we should definitely write those adhering to it. The text transcending should present simply the positions, and then saying who adhere. So, I believe, a section titled something like “critics” or something such. Not because Denial is not a good term, but simply because there is more than just plain denial. Zurcher disagree with many scholars, but he still considers the Ittihadists having planned the destruction of the Armenians, so I refuse to call him a denier. A denier is not someone who refuse the qualification of genocide. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Ataturk thing.. Well, I read the whole story when it first starting going around and I have to say that the interpretation was <i>really</i> stretched, and I also noticed some problems with context. Ataturk regularly gave speeches, and the full text of his speeches for all his life take <i>many</i> rows and bookshelves in the Turkish National Archives. In that particular speech, he was talking about WWI and the following wars, and was lamenting the chaos and the loss of human life in general. Ataturk talked about <i>every</i> thing imaginable, from airplane factories to the need for more Opera houses, and that's normal since he was trying to rebuild and reorient a whole country that was created out of the remnants of an Empire. Anyways, going back to that speech, he didn't mention a genocide, but he was talking, in those series of speeches, about the general loss of life and devastation of the wars of the thirty preceding years. From what I could gather, he was complaining about inter-ethnic strife that was caused by the wars (between Kurds, Turks and Armenians) and the lack of protection that should have been offered to Armenian deportees, both of which resulted in loss of life. To stretch that and say Ataturk accepted the AG is not academically correct since he also talked about the conflicts that ravaged every part of the country. Besides, that has practically been the main Turkish POV in the first place. Is it right or not, people can debate it all they want; I am just trying to clarify... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 19:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As I said I will not waste too much time. Just some reminders.</p>
<p>1. The Washington post newspaper states the source as "An official communication from the general staff of the Caucasian (russian) army under date of Nov. 10, says:" 2. Italian council and Winston Churchil quotes are from publicized sources not secret dispatches. 3. Apart from the point that Baristarim made Ataturk quotes are much dubious and/or totally fake. I can prove it when nessesary. Just think why Ataturk Who robustly stated no crime is present decide to confess to an US newpaper? 4. Actually Tonybe admitted himself that it was meant for propaganda purposes but maintained that the info is true. I have the copy of his original mail to an Armenians lady. I can send it when nessesary. Second it is published by England foreign office (a country in war with Ottoman empire) in the war time. It can never be regarded as a history book or 100% reliable. Lastly all the sources (which were just codes or nicknames in the first edition) were later discovered. They Turned out to be Missionaries or Armenian thasnak members. Check out the new version by Ara sarafian (2000). 5. the highest figure of armenian population is 2.3 by the Armenian patriache at that time which has good reasons to inflate the numbers. are you kidding me by showing the article that you created as a source. Let me remind you again that in Lousanne peace treaty armenian population before the war was taken as 1.4 mil. And finally if I were to push my POV I would have gathered a gang an start an edit war. I see only one gang around. 6. the so called hamidian massacres are all from Sasoon and surrounding region. the newspapers of the time clearly descibes that no western observer were there to report anything in most cases. and when they were there they said the figures were much lower and incidents started by armenian unsurgent provocations.</p>

<dd>Thank you for the information fad(ix), you tried answer my questions, but couldn't satisfy me. You are pushing too hard by stating that Ataturk himself admitted the genocide. And you say that you found it in "Rauf Orbay'ın Hatıraları". Rauf Orbay is considered a traitor in Turkey, he signed the Armitice of Mudros, and was the head of the opposition to Ataturk. This is one of the basic facts of Turkish war of independence. Wouldn't it be possible that Orbay tried to vilify Ataturk? Can you provide us the exact quote? Both in Turkish and English. I believe Baristarim explained it quite right. Ataturk had a word on almost anything, so it is easy to manipulate a quote from Ataturk.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, in order the refuse the qualification of genocide, there must be a <i>genocide</i>. Turkish refuses that the unfortunate events were not a genocide, so <b>Denial of the Genocide</b> is neither the position of Turkish Republic nor the Turkish POV. There are many Turkish historians who <i>refuse</i> the idea of genocide and they are supported by a number of western scholars. So, there are enough people to establish a section called '<b>Turkish Thesis'</b>. I stopped translations because there were enough pressure on me to stop it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The sources part... You say that Turkish sources are more favored than Armenian sources, but almost every work used in the article is written by non-Turkish people. It is not a suprise to me to see that 1/3 of the works used are written by Armenian scholars, but I would expect to see as much Turkish historians used in the article as Armenian ones, because Turkey and Armenia are sides to this conflict.

<dd>You are mixing primary sources with secondary I think. True, many Armenians have written about the genocide, what I am talking about is not scholarship but records, primary records. It is no secret for no one that Armenian primary records are nearly non-existing. You will hardly find more than few references to Armenian sources in published work, and no matter if the book is written by an Armenian or not. It is obvious that per population Armenians have written much more about the subject. But this doesn't mean anything. Most scholars of the Holocaust are Jews, Hilberg who wrote the major work about the Holocaust is a Jew. What matters here is the documentation of the work, most of it is not Jewish. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:35, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When he says he can prove it, he actually means that he will dump the crap from tallarmeniantale, which I have already covered here more than necessary. The interview wasn’t even about the Armenian massacres, but about the attempts against Ataturk life, which was the subject of the interview itself. Secondo, as usual neurobio is injecting crap directly from tallarmeniantale when talking about the Blue Book, what he says is simply the same lies there which I have also already covered. This is what could be found from the Key to name of persons by Bryce and Toynbee.</p>
<p>At least forty one reports found in the blue book could still be found in the U.S. Department of State archives.</p>
<ul>
<li>From them, ALL were sent from the Ottoman Empire.</li>
<li>Fifteen of these were written by American consuls(we will come to that later)</li>
<li>Ten by American missionaries.</li>
<li>Eight by other nationals (four of whom German)</li>
<li>Six were unclosed sources.</li>
<li>And ONLY TWO were from the Dashnaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neurobio claims to check the new edition (Ara Safarian 2000), well, this information could actually be found on p. x, of the work. Safarian covers from p. ix-x, opposing and documenting specifically the non-factuality of neurobio assertions. But since that work was referred on tallarmeniantale, of course he presented it without actually knowing of what he was talking about. The ‘’lies’’ he is talking about were still presented in 1967, in Toynbee’s work Acquaintances (1967)</p>
<p>"The collection and collation of the evidence from which the Blue Book [The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire] was compiled had occupied most of my working time for an umber of months; and, after the Blue Book had been published, I could not dismiss its contents from my mind. I was not only haunted by the victims' sufferings and by the criminals' deeds; I was exercised by the question how it could be possible for human beings to do what those perpetrators of genocide had done.</p>
<p>My study [of Armenian Genocide]...left an impression on my mind that was not effaced by the still more cold-blooded genocide, on a far larger scale, that was committed during the Second World War by the Nazi.</p>
<p>Any great crime - private or public, personal or impersonal-raises a question that transcends national limits; the question goes to the heart of human nature itself. My study of the genocide that had been committed in Turkey in 1915 brought home to me the reality of Original Sin."</p>
<p>I guess, in 1967, the British were still at war against the Ottoman Empire. Another interesting note, is how neurobio is just like the author of tallarmeniantale equating the term propaganda with lies, when even his fetish scholar Justin McCarthy claimed that propaganda does not mean lying, a justification of his request that the Turkish government uses propaganda against “Armenian allegations.”</p>
<p>Coming to those American Consuls whose reports could be found in the Blue Book. Consuls were actually stationed on the spot. Lets give the example of Leslie Davis who was actually stationed in the East and on the spot, he was requested to investigate the reported massacres, since the reports were about a mass killing never reported ever before with such a brutality, he started being skeptical about. He actually requested a Turk to be his guide for one day and show the spots of the Armenian massacres. He submitted as a result a report in which he confirms and even say that what he actually saw was worst than could have been reported.</p>
<p>So, when neurobio claims that those there actually claimed much less than those who were not there. This too is not accurate, it is actually the contrary, the Italian consul for instance who witnessed what was happening, could not even believe what his eyes were showing him.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, the Turkish government sent a letter to the British government, presented on the House, requesting the Brits to apologies for the Blue Book and “admit” it to be forgery. The House reconfirmed the Blue Book as authentic and reaffirmed its historic value. Taner Akçam in a series in a Turkish newspaper has covered this request and said that it was an embarrassment, since still the signed reports could still be found in American archives.</p>
<p>Coming to the population, Neurobio claims that during Lausanne the figure of 1.4 million Armenians has been used, the sort of crap he recycle from the tallarmeniantalewebsite. What he is actually mentioning is the Ottoman Census Statistics of 1912 which was presented by the Turkish delegation. If neurobio believes to be up to the task, he could bring the trash he recycle on the Ottoman Armenian Population article, or shut the @ off about the validity of that article itself. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

In <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>, if the investigation of neurobio is right (even though you don't believe him, he wouldn't have lied too easily; especially when regarding to the number of references in a wiki article) one third of the references are to Armenian historians where there is no references to the turkish historians, who refuse the genocide.

<dd>Look dude, what do you think readers will conclude? A user who slander an entire people in every given occasion and dump materials from a known racist website and use it as sole source in one side, and another user who slander that member in particular? Regardless of the policies here? As for personal attacks. Did you see me on this page slandering other Turks? I am even having good relations with Lutherian. Regarding Rauf Orbay, yes! I did not answer you, and for a simple reason, the guy was accused to destroy large junk of materials involving him in the massacres, his aubiography itself is full of praise of the Kemalistic regime and the accusations about him being a traitor have been cleaned up, including by the republic of Turkey. So him being a traitor and wanting to make up things allegedly said by Ataturk is your oppinion. You are not forced to believe him. But I fail to see why someone who was accused of destroying records of the destruction of the Armenians will make up thing to support a position which evidences bringing to it, he has destroyed? Comming back to neurobio? Someone who calls this article trash and hasn't any respect to the entire project which he calls in his namespace a made house, could only be here for a single reason, which he is so good at, that is, slinging here back and forth what he could use as immunition from the website tallarmeniantale. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 01:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Orbay knew that a Kemalist system would have resolved almost all problems of Turkey, but he advocated the American Mandate in order to accomplish it. He called Atatürk an adventurer. He was also the one of the founders of the first opposition party in Turkey, which was supported by mostly fundamentalists. I haven't heard of him being accused of destroying the genocide documents. BTW, while I was reading the biography of Orbay, I recalled that U.K held a trial in Malta about Armenian Genocide and all the Turks were cleared of the case! If it couldn't have proven in 1921, just 6 years after the <i>crime</i> is commited; can it be in 2007?<a href="../../../c/a/g/User%7ECaglarkoca_4bc9.html" title="User:Caglarkoca">Caglarkoca</a> 03:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>I recalled that U.K held a trial in Malta about Armenian Genocide and all the Turks were cleared of the case!</i>. That is perhaps the worst lie repeated by the Turkish denialists. We have discussed it dozens of times in the archives, however for the record, <i><b>there was no such thing as the Malta Tribunal</b></i>. There were 60 Turkish criminals held by the British on the island of Malta accused of crimes against the Armenians BUT they were released not to a lack of evidence which you guys so earnestly repeat but were in fact <b>traded</b> for several dozen British hostages taken by the Ataturk nationalists including British Colonel Alfred Rawlison.</p>
<p>Their trial was pending, the evidence was abundant and they were hopefully going to be tried by an intl. criminal tribunal. 43 of the criminals held at Malta were released in Aug. 1921 a decision made by Winston Churchill who stated that the "whole transaction [was] tantamount to complete capitulation to Turkish blackmail."

<p>THE LETTER OF PKK&#160;!!!!! Hi ,in this article REF NO 62 ,is a letter from the head of an terrorist organisations. It probably ment to support Armenian thesis. Before drawing your attention to this terrible mistake I have a few words to say. I am from a village near by city of Sivas in Turkey,and am a Caucassian origined Turkish citizen.In our geography Armenians,Turks,Kurds,Georgians,Cherkesses,Abhazians,Karachais,we all are brothers.Turks and Armenians live together for a 1000 years,Turks are in Armanian's humuor,Armenians are in Turk's humour,married to eachother ,grew up together,sang songs together and unfortunately died together. In a certain era of the history these two highly reputable nation had been enemies of eachother,by Russian and British Empire's influence on Some adventurous Armenians.(whereas on the other side there was another adventurous young Turks by the influence of Germans) As Anzac forces was fronting the British army in Gallibolu ,Armenians was fronting the Russian army in East. When Anzac youth was dying, as there were no tears in the eyes of Brit commanders,when Armenian and Turkish and Kurdish brothers killing eachother ,there were no tears in the eyes of Russian commanders,either. I read all your commends here guys both Turkish and Armenian. There was no any hattrate between Armenians and Turks that time to cause a genocide,and I don't think Memets in Turkish army was that violent either.Becouse I 've been in Gallibolu and have seen Memets and Jonhy's lyng in the chest of brother country,and I read their memories and have seen their pictures.THe soldier in Van area of Ottoman Empire was no different then the soldier in Gallibolu. I have loads of Armenian friends in Istanbul,Grand Bazaar. They are the most magneficent goldsmiths and the nicest people you can meet,trusthworthy ,honest ,hardworking and good friends. In my village there are 3 Armenian families (my cousin married to one the family's daughter)My family and them living together for the last 90 years.Their grandfather Tırtatt told me their story,how they moved to our village.They were one those deported families. I live in U.K now,but when I was living in Turkey.I was a close witness to how we brothers menage to live together in peace but individually,as Nazım Hikmet says, like a tree but in brotherhood of a forest. If this genocide discussion is a blame ,both sides has a lot of it to take, in different aspects. More then anything ,it seems to me that ARmenian diaspora loves to deal with it,and love to poison their youths mind with this hattrate,and I think this is just to cover a mistake once some Armenian adventurers made and regreted but couldn't get rid of it. Otherwise ,'''''''<i><b>just to prove that their thesis is right ,why would they use a letter of an exteremely violent terrorist organisation called [[[PKK]]]who killed over 30.000 people ,as a reference in this article'''''''</b></i>. And if the wikipedia editors are so objective in this discussion why would they let this letter to be used. hope you guys one days realise that we are brothers not enemies.</p>

<p>OK. I hope that this username is not as spammy as the latter. So, why have the external links disapeared? I see this as rather a lack of knowledge among the editors than anything else. Just because certain people are not well informed about this topic (or deny it) does not justify censurship of this kind. Our site, among those external links deleted, contain professional educational and informative data, video and material and I can not see why educational information such as a video of a lecture conference is not relevant in this area.</p>
<p>Furthermore I can not see why ths topic is often locked. Terrorising the topic should not result in locking it for editing. Whether the information added is biased or not can be discussed, but never the less the discussion must go on. And bare in mind: the Armenian genocide might be a political controversy but it is a historical fact. The main deniers are the Turkish offical side. The rest are mostly Jewish historians who are either functionalists themselves (regarding the Jewish genocide) or are singulaists (also regarding the Jewish genocide). So please do not mix these two issues together and keep on to the facts.</p>

<p>Well, I understand the basic argumentation, but</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think that anyone would treat the Holocuast article like this if neo-nazis or Holocaust deniers would step in and add their point of view. I firmly blame this on lack of general knowledge about the Armenian Genocide and the fact that people mix policitcal point of view with historical facts and evidence. And as far as it goes for historians denying the Armenian Genocide, there is very simple explanation once you look at who these persons are and their historical views in general. E.g.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>- Andrew Mango is born and educated in Istanbul and working almost with Turkish related areas including a comprehensive book about Ataturk. So I guess you could say that his view of the things might be coloured by his upraising, education and work.</p>
<p>- Bernard Lewis' view in regard to the Armenian genocide is very much like the discussion between the two camps of Functionalists and Intentionalists in regard to the Holocaust. These argue whether the Jewish genocide was intentional on the part of the German authorities or was it a by product of the war as the functionalists claim it to be. Mr Lewis belongs to the latter group sa far as it goes for the Armenian genocide. He affirms that some 1 million Armenians were killed, but this was not the intention of the Turkish government, but rather a by product of the war. As in the Holocaust discussion the intentionalists would beg the difference.</p>
<p>- Guenter Lewy is a supporter of the singularity of the Jewish genocide, i.e. he means that it is unique and no other "genocides" could be compared to it. Professor Yair Auron, Jewish historian and lecturer in Israel, blames the American lack of recognition on Israeli pressures. According to him, the Holocaust (the Jewish Genocide) plays a central role in Israeli society and within historical circles, increasing in importance as the years progress, and relying on the uniqueness of the Jewish Genocide. Political Israel, he argues, has intentionally repressed and refused to acknowledge the existence of the first genocide of the 20th century. He is not alone in his claims. Other Israeli historians, such as Professor Yehuda Baur and Shlomo Avineri, the former foreign minister of Israel, have openly called the Armenian massacres a genocide.</p>
<p>- Justin McCarthy is awarded Order of Merit of Turkey by the Turkish President Süleyman Demirel in 1998 for his "services." He has based his entire claim on the fact that the deportations were "relocations", nothing more. His argumentation is quite shallow and in disregard to several other parameters in the equation, such as the ethnic cleansings that these deportations resulted in.</p>
<p>I think it is quite important to lift forward this smal facts which make a huge difference once they are mentioned. It is these details that the denialist side comfortably "forgets" to mention. The above mentioned people are the major non-Turks. The rest are exclusively Turks who follow the policital agenda of the Turkish Foreign Ministry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eventhough if say armenian-genocide.org covers the chronology, Armenica.org gives a much more detalied overview of the circumstances and the history which led to the definitive genocidal measures. Now days many people (inlcuding this article) put much emphesis on the genocide itself, wihtout mentioning important details about the reform demands and efforts during the period 1878-1908. Furthermore, the entire focus is set on Turkish and German actions, while the role of the British, Russian, French and US failure in realisation of the demanded reforms or the later recognition of the genocide is not touched upon (at least not as satisfactory as it should). Secondly, 1) the link to our site (armenica.org) was not meant as a pointer to the text, but to the video lecture with quite exhaustive facts, information and argumentation which is unique in its kind as far as online informative material is concerned 2) when I then visit the article about the denial of the Armenian genocide I see 31 external links pointing to Turkish sites. If this is not biased behaviour then I don't know what is. The articles of wikipedia how informative than they might be, are a great source for further reading (at least for me). I agree that links to sites with almmost identical content should be replaced by only one link to the "best choice", but I can't see how the sites included in the external links even cover the parts presented on Armenica.org, with, among others, interview with Prof. Taner Akcam, lecture by Prof. Dadrian etc. And bare in mind that other updates are conitnuously added.

<dd>Does the Holocaust article make any mention of Germans that were killed by Jews in revenge or as part of allied armies? I can think of a great many more relavent details concerning the Armenian Genocide that could be included in the article - such as all the many (tens to hundreds of) thousands of Turks who enriched themselves off of stolen Armenian properties...or specifics regarding the murders of Ottoman Officials who resisted deportation (murder) of Armenians by CUP operatives (thugs)...or the large scale (CUP) falsifying of claims/reports of Armenian rebellions - countered by reports of local Ottoman and German officials and other eyewitnesses....etc etc who claim that no such thing was occuring. I can think of a great many relevant details to include regarding the annhilation of the entire Ottoman Armenian nation (1.5 million +) that have quite a bit more relevance then the deaths of hundreds (or even a few thousand) Turks at the hands of Armenians...more Turkis were killed by Kurdish bands, Turkish deserters and CUP/Ottoman Special Organization "gangs" then were ever killed by any Ottoman Armenians....think about it...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 07:31, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I think here the situation is <i>a little bit</i> different than the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, I find it very amusing to see that you always compare the so called Armenian Genocide to the Holocaust. Jews didn't have a chance to declare war against Germany, but Armenians indeed openly attacked Ottoman empire. On the washington post in the talk page, it is clearly stated that <b>Armenians join Russians</b>, isn't it? Then here we have a war situation rather than a Holocaust like genocide, where jews beginning from 1933 were systematically destroyed, in spite of not joining <i>Russians</i>. Armanalp is quite right. <a href="../../../c/a/g/User%7ECaglarkoca_4bc9.html" title="User:Caglarkoca">Caglarkoca</a> 06:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm so sorry that you aparently just have no clue. You say that Jews never "attacked" Germany - however the Germans at the time claimed that in fact they did and they quote Weizman's "declaration of war" against Germany as proof of this and make many other claims as well - equally spurious as your claims that Armenians "attacked" the Ottoman EMpire. You talk of Jews being systematically destroyed by Germany since 1933 - and of course we are well aware of the various campaigns - economic, political, social that were undertaken to exclude the Jews from German society and disenfranchise them - however Armenians and Greeks of the Ottoman Empire generally experienced far warse prior to 1915. Massacres, depridations and other predatory behaviors against them were common. The Sultan and then the CUP particularly took many steps to exclude Greeks and Armenians from participation in the economy. Many of the very same steps to exclude Jews from German economic and societal life were taken agaionst Greeks and Armenians - and far worse. And the Genocide commited against Armenians was in most all senses EXACTLY like the Holocaust was to the Jews. Your contention that there was no Armenian Genocide because some Armenians may have joined with Russians (prior to the Genocide this numnber is estimated at less then 4,000...when there were 250,000 Ottoman Armenians in Ottoman armies at this time) is quite ludicrous. And besides - Ottoman Muslims experienced more attacks against them from Kurdish bandits, Turkish deserters and CUP Special Organization units then they suffered from any attacks commited by Ottoman Armenians. In 1917 Ottoman Military accounts indicate that Turkish/Muslim (civilian) deaths in Anatolia that could be attrributed to Russians and Armenians combined amonted to no more then 5,000 and Turkish historian Halil Beketay believes that no more then 10,000 Turkihs/Muslim civilian deaths can be attributed to Russians and (primarily) Russian Armenians through the entire course of events from 195-1923)...as opposed to 1.5 million + Ottoman Armenians killed by the Ottoman Turks....so come now. Your claims are entirely spurious and are not supported by any legitimate sources scholarly opinion. The history as recorded by eyewitnesses, memoirs/confessions (of CUP/Ottoman Military and Special Organization members), and incredible amounts of detailed documentary evidence do not support your claims in any way shape or form. And besides dose the prescence of Jews - even German Jews - in the armies of the Allies during WWII mean that there was no Holocaust? No it does not. So are you really telling us that you are unaware of the details of the Armenians Genocide...that you cannot fathom that 1.5 million + Armenians just disapeared from the face of the Earth - most within the space of a few short months - the rest in just a few short years - because of some natural causes? Are you just entirely unaware of the detailed records and statements from ex-CUP and Ottoman Officials and operatives and their German allies present at the time attesting to secret orders that "deporatation" meant extermination of the Armenians - that this was deliberate policy and that in fact it was undertaken and thouroughly witnessed and that the (successful) results are quite clear. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 16:07, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Of course, you might have some right points, especially on the fact that the nationalist CUP make the life miserable for the non-Muslims. But the terms genocide and Holocaust are too strong to be used for those unfortunate events. I must confess that the events in 1915 were truly dark marks on the Turkish/Ottoman history. Even if there was no genocide (as I advocate for) delocalizing a whole nation is a very huge guilt. I admit that. But I am against the content of the article. As I said before, Holocaust is too insane to be compared with these events. And the lack of Turkish POV... That is what I am trying to say beginning from the first day I entered wikipedia. BTW, I am quite interested in 250000 Ottoman Armenians in the Ottoman Army. Do you have a source? Thanks for the valuable information. <a href="../../../c/a/g/User%7ECaglarkoca_4bc9.html" title="User:Caglarkoca">Caglarkoca</a> 19:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry to sound crass - but your opinion on whether or not "genocide" or "holocaust" may or may not be the correct terms is not the issue. The issue is that the overwhelming number of scholars and historians and scholarly historical sources fully accept these events as genocide and that all definitions of genocide are clearly met by the CUP/Ottoman Turkish actions taken against the Ottoman Armenians and the results of such. I am pleased (not sure of the right word - but close enough...) that you (as a Turk? [I assume]) at least understand/appreciate the feelings of guilt or perhaps shame might be a better word for what your nation (the Turkish nation of the time that Turkey of today is the inheritor for) should rightly feel for what was done. However when you continue to claim that the events of the time and the experiences of Armenians of the Empire do not consititute genocide and are somehwo less "insane" as you say it - less brutal, less demeaning, less destructive etc and that Armenians somehow experienced less persecution/destruction and so on then the Jews of WWII - well in this claim you are entirely 100% wrong. I am always perplexed that so many Turks - even ones who seem to have some conception of what occured - cannot understand how what the Armenians went through was in fact the very equivilant of the Jewish experience in nearly every concievable sense - and this is clearly demonstrated by the vast and corroborated eyewitness accounts and documentation of the horrors that were carried out against innocent and defeseless Armenians empire wide. Like the Jews - Armenians provided very little resitance and were mercilessly and brutally slaughtered - individually and en mass. I would really urge you to read more of the eyewitness acounts and testimonys to try to achieve a greater understanding of the level of brutality and one sided predation that occured during these times to better understand and conceptualize these events. I doubt that anyone who reads these accounts and who takes the time to read about and understand the history and development of the extermination plans and how they were carried out will possibly come away not thinking/understanding how these events were - for all relevant purposes - no different whatsoever then what the Jews experienced in WWII. As for the 250,000 figure of Ottoman Armenians in the Ottoman army I do have a source - but not where I am right now. I will try to check on this for you. And as far as Turkish POV - well IMO - beyond acknowledging such - that it is a view of denial of these events (and in fact such position has changed/morphed over time from an outright denial that such things ever happened at all to now claiming that it was more akin to a civil war of some sort - etc) - I think mention of this view is warrented - but beyond mention of it - it really does not warrent any detailed treatment as their is really very little corraborated basis for such arguments and they are in fact political arguments (and accusations and denials) not really based in fact. The facts speak for themselves. They are not the "Armenian"perspective - but the overwhelmingly accepted and understood version of what actually occured. Granted a great deal more could be presented and discussed which would provide context to these events, could add to the understanding of how circumstances led to the situation as it did and to the mindset of the CUP leadership and cadres and of the carious Turkish people who took part in such things - and I have often supported the idea of doing such. But we must remember this is essentially an encyclopedic article - not a definitive tome or historical analysis and accounting. The goal here is to partake a level of understanding of these events so that the casual reader or amature researcher is able to seek and recieve a basic understanding of just what is/was this Armenian Genocide thing all about. The article, as it stands, more or less accomplishes this. It certainly can be improved and I have in the past expressed my opinions in this regards - but expanding upon the denial of the events is IMO - not where the presentation is really lacking - it is in providing some overall background and context (some of which might be seen/interpreted to some degree as additional Turkish perspective) and I also believe that a more accurate chronology that depicts when and where major massacres and "deporations" occured and how procedures differed from place to place (primarily regional differences in how the genocide was carried out) would be helpful in allowing the reader a better feel for just what it was that occured that we (properly) term/call the Armenian Genocide.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 20:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this dialog is becoming more helpful than the previous ones:) To be honest with you, I do not have a great knowledge on this area. It is mostly limited to Turkish+ English wikipedia+ a few more sources; and I have never said that I know the topic very well. What I usually say is about the format of the article. I am aware that the events of 1915 is considered as <i>genocide</i> by overwhelmingly many scholars and countries so that what is on the wiki is not the Armenian POV, but the worldwide (I mean by the majority) accepted version. But the ones that does not accept the term genocide is enough to have the right to express their opinion in wikipedia. You understood what I meant by Turkish POV very well. We claim that unfortunate Armenian Unrest followed by the delocalization caused many people to lose their lives. This POV has the right to expressed under the title Turkish Thesis on the Events of 1915 or Refusal (rather than denial) of the Article, and as you stated civil war sort of thing should be included in that article as well as the position of Turkey. And for my feeling... I know it is of wikipedia, but I must state them:) I would feel <i>ashamed</i> if I have decided on delocalization or supported the idea of delocalization. Therefore shame is not the best word. But I admit that it was a very insane guilt to delocalize a whole nation. (BTW I am Turkish) Please think about the addition of Turkish POV to the article. And don't forget to provide me a source on the Ottoman Armenian soldiers.

<dd>OK - you admit to not having great knowledge of these events - yet you continue to insist that a (widely discredited/not accepted) minority view - pretty much held only by Turks and scholars who are linked to Turkey in some manner - deserves to be presented and explained in a manner beyond just introducing that such a view is held - and I disagree (I think it has been given greater emphasis then is deserved). Additionally you continue to espouse this idea the the Armenian Genocide was just some sort of "delocalization" (whatever this really means) - when the overwhelming evidence (that is demonstrated by numerous collaborated accounts of C top CUP member's statements as well as an examination of the methods employed etc etc) clearly proves that there was a desire and deliberate pre-planned cordinated action to eliminate Armenians (as a group with any real presence) from Anatolia - and that this involved killing most of them and only displacing a few in comparision. Taner Akcam discusses the CUPs stated desire to have no more then 10% Armenian presence in any one area and how - with the arrival of some number of deportees (who somehow survived - in many cases quite unexpectadly) in the areas around Aleppo and in Der Zor - that a second round of outright massacres (and deliberate starvation in death camps) was undertaken to ensure that the number of Armenian survivors would not exheed this percentage. Well the CUP more then suceeded with its plans - and its leaders were quite pleased with themselves in this regard and stated such numerous times. It is also enlightening to read accounts of Ottoman Parlimentarians (reconvened briefly after the war) and of Ottoman newspapers from just after the war where many express outrage over what was done. In any event - accusations that Armenians were responsible for all of this (their own demise) are quite laughable (or very sad really) when one knows and understands the facts. I would suggest that you educate yourself further in this regard. And perhaps then you might (properly) feel some shame for the actions of your nation - in the past - for comitting this genocide in the first place - and now - for denying it so vehemently.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 14:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thoth--Some of what you have written is slightly confusing to me. I am not terribly familiar with the events we're discussing, nor do I have a personal stake in the matter, but it seems to me from what I've read above that there is a significant disparity in the evidence cited regarding the Armenian incident. (I am hesitant to use genocide because I really don't know much about the issue at all.) The reason the Holocaust is universally accepted as a genocide is because of the extensive primary <i>German</i> documentation discovered by the Allied armies, along with testimony from German soldiers/officers. Furthermore, the simple fact that the evidence left behind in concentration camps was discovered and documented by various third parties lends more credence to the Holocaust's unequivocal classification as a genocide.. Looking through the sources for this article, however, paints a much more colorful picture: as an example, the article cites Peter Balakian, whom I know personally and can assure you is the worst kind of scholar. He teaches at Colgate University and was kind enough to be openly hostile to Muslim students on campus--enough so that numerous students complained to the administration about him while I attended the institution. Clearly an issue such as this is going to be extremely sensitive, but the impression I get from reading the cited sources is that the article relies heavily on evidence presented from what can only be described as biased sources. There are a few "neutral" sources--the U.N. report on genocide, the NYT dispatch dating from 1916--but they are peppered in between numerous Armenian scholars. Please note, however, that I do not think this makes them less valid! Far from it. However, given that precedent, we are obligated to lend similar credence to the genocide refusals, unless a body of evidence that is sufficiently neutral can be directly cited. It is not our place as wikipedians to determine what viewpoint is more "valid." We're only here to present the situation as it stands. I have no qualms including the fact that the vast majority of scholars agree that this should be considered a genocide. But unlike the Holocaust, we don't have the circumstances necessary to declare any opposition stances invalid. And if we do in fact have those circumstances, the vast majority of our citations should reference them, and not the secondary sources it currently does. Let me know what you think.

<dd>First - I've never seen any "evidence" that in any way disproves the huge volumes of such that clearly show the Armenian Genocide to be such. Evidence includes 37,000 documents in the archives of the United States on this issue. 9,000+ (don't know exact numner) of such documents in the German Archives. Thousands and thousands of direct eyewitness reports (far more then what documents the Holocaust even), as well as numerous Ottoman documents (including testimony, confessions, correspondences, memoirs...etc - that clearly make the case for genocide. The "other side" (standard Turkish view and that supported by so-called Turkish scholars and those supported by Turkey) offer nothing to invalidate this huge compliation of corroborating evidence. What they do is to essentially repeat wartime Turkish propoganda - that is the equivilant to nearly identicle Nazi wartime racist hate propoganda against the Jews - and expect us to accept such as truth - when the documentary evidence and eyewitness testimony - even from a great many Turks and from germans and Austirans who were allies to the Turks and present during these times - utterly refutes the counter-claims. Inclusion of Armenian Genocide denial - beyond just a reference that Turkey and certain Turkish shupported scholars deny it and a very minimal mention of why this might be so and the jist of their (discredited) argument - is all that this view warrents. Only by the fact the the inheritor government of the perpetrators of this genocide continues to deny it (and to aggressively sponsor, lobby on behalf and fund such denial) is there any significant difference between denial of the Holocaust and denial of the Armenian Genocide - and the article as it stands more then addresses this fact. If you are so keen on finding non-Armenian scholarly sources that paint a most clear picture of the factual record of the Armenian Genocide then I would strongly suggest that you read Turkish scholar Tanar Akcam's latest book - <i>A Shameful Act - The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility</i>. The book is based entirely on first hand Ottoman Turkish and to some extent first hand German documentary and eyewitness accounts and it clearly documents the culpilbility and genocidal intentions of the CUP Ottoman Turks in planning and carrying out the Armenian Genocide. It is impossible that any who reads this book will ever again question that the Armenian Genocide was not deliberatly undertaken and that it indeed was a genocide in every sense of the word and that the article in Wikipedia as it stands today is accurate and supportable. If anything a great deal of factual information that bolsters this case has been left out and any Turkish (or other) objection is left as being quite groundless.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 03:15, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading only parts of this argument, I saw that the comparison between the Holocaust and this Genocide were being dispiuted because the Armenians "declared war" and the Jews didn't.</dd>

<p>First of all, its is disputed whether or not the Armenians joined the Russians in world war one. In any case, the Russians were badly losing (due to German support ) and did not reach any were near Cilicia were most of the Genocide occured. Secondly, there was no Armenian declaration of war, because there was no country!!! Thirdly, war does not mean total annihalation of a population. Its why Hitler's thugs were tried for war crimes. Armenian genocide was not just Turks defending themselves against rebels. They killed women and children too, or atleast left them to starve. Either way, this was defintely not a war no more than if I may qoute it was a war between "men and maggots" except that I think in this situation, the maggots have more honour than the men. <a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7ETourskin_1665.html" title="User:Tourskin">Tourskin</a>.</p>

<dd>I don't know specifically the answer to your question - however I think it may have had something to do with the continued efforts on the part of some (vandals) to present the (so-called) "Turkish position" (which is clearly a minority position not held by the vast majority of scholars nor supported by sufficient evidence)that denies that the Armenian Genocide was/is indeed a genocide. As long as such vandals continue to push this idea objecting to characterizing the Armenian Genocide as a genocide - contrary to all eveidence (that has been repeatedly presented here in the talk pages) then I fear this article will always need some sort of protection. However, if the article is specifically labeled as "disputed" because of the notion that the genocide itself is (legitimatly) disputed - then I would agree that this is not proper.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 18:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

The thing is, the reverts and additions were so complex that I am not able to figure out from the article's history what exactly the dispute was.

<dd>I think that any info needs to be added will be added when it becomes unprotected. It involves somewhat a delicate addition, and its place and wording needs to be decided following the wikiprocess, which means many editors will need to have the possibility to edit continously until a compromise and concensus version will be born. Until then, any unilateral addition which would leave the other editors without the ability to edit will be unfair. Just wait until the page becomes unprotected - besides, there are some disputes about structure that (still) needs to be ironed out.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 17:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Caglarkoca, stow the "unethical" nonsense. Nobody is editing a protected page. This is the TALK section, and as such is EXACTLY where this sort of dialogue belongs.</p>
<p>To separate Armenian/Turkish relations from the genocide attempt is patently rediculous. The two are intrinsically linked, and will be for many generations to come. That happens when people try to exterminate a race. Those they miss are bound to have issue with it, and this is not a separate topic at all.</p>
<p>Much as I'm trying to avoid the soap box, I feel the need to remind that the Armenians and Turks lived side by side as neighbors for a very long time before this betrayal and attrocity occurred. Young Armenian men, feeling the urge to be soldiers as some always do, signed on with the Turkish army, even unto 1915. That, too, is Armenian/Turkish relations. But it's not a separate subject, and trying to diminish the ongoing conflict and/or the damage done to subsequent generations, this is tantamount to squelching history and turning a blind eye to an inconvenient truth. Had the Turks not performed those actions, there would be no Armenian/Turkish Relations, not any more than there would be a Guinean/Senegalese Relations article. Do you see a Turkish/Swedish Relations article? There's not even a Turkish/Greek Relations article. Why not, I ask, rhetorically. No, folks, sorry... it isn't a separate subject, and these actions - whether by Armenians or Turks, should not be swept under the carpet. --<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalc_7ee1.html" title="User:Falc">JT</a> 08:16, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>ARGH! For the record, after becoming curious as to who this Caglarkoca is, I went to his page. He specifically has flags stating his opposition to the term Genocide, and also in favor of the recognition of Cypress as a Turkish place. In short, his protests that he has no opinion and is unfamiliar with the issues are pure BS. Nice try, but no cigar. --<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalc_7ee1.html" title="User:Falc">JT</a> 09:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is it also forbidden in Wikipedia, just like it is in France and Switzerland, to say that the <b>alleged genocide</b> hadn't happened? Is it also against laws of wikipedia to state that TRNC exists? You have inserted the link to there. It doesn't matter whether your edit is minor or major. That page was under protection that means that the page is not to be edited. Moreover, have ever claimed that I have a great knowledge on the issue? No, I don't I speak of the format, rather than the information. Do I have many mainspace edits in English wiki? No, I express my opinions in the talk pages. (I have translations from English to Turkish wiki) So why are you trying to insult me due to my opinions on the alleged genocide and cyprus? It is clear you don't know much about the Cyprus, i.e Atlilar Massacre which was the main reason of Turkish interference to the island. Or you don't know EOKA. I just write cyprus because you brought it here even though it is not relevant.

<p>As an aside, the way that this article and forum goes demonstrates exactly the way/nature/problem with this situation. The Turks continue to attempt to deny, just as does the Turkish government. ven those of us with both bloods in our veins are willing to admit, as does the rets of the world, that the genocide attempt occurred. Yet there are the handful who would deny even those facts. Why they feel compulsion to obsfucate the facts today, when they themselves could not be held culpable, is beyond me. Yet here is their record, chronicled on these pages and now in the real world newspapers, proof that they are willing to kill over it. Gratefully, there remain men such as this one:</p>

<p>It is not in the least bit inappropriate. Rather, it demonstrates an aspect of the ongoing persecution, that it remains a hot topic nearly 100 years later, and chronicles the ongoing situation, so we do not forget. As I wrote you semi-privately, Baristarim, it is essential that we learn from our mistakes. That people think that this is all "a long time ago, in the past" is further proof that such additions are essential to a complete and accurate depiction, historical fact, and even to the ethical treatment of this subject.

<dd>The question is not about the content, but editorial encyclopedic spirit: when an article is protected, it is not fair when an addition can be made by an editor and not the others - this goes for any article, not just this one. It will be unprotected - it is against Wikipedia policy to protect articles for more than a couple of weeks. There was a particular structural dispute that led to its protection and it should come out of protection soon enough. Many articles get protected from time to time in Wiki, and the normal editing process resumes when they become unprotected.
