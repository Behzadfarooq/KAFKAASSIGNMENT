<h2><span class="mw-headline">Christianity in Independence section of infobox</span></h2>
<p>I have removed the phrase "<a href="../../../3/0/1/301.html" title="301">301 AD</a> Official Adoption of Christianity" from the infobox. While the adoption of Christianity was undeniably an important moment in the history of Armenia, it has nothing to dopla with gaining independence or sovereignty: it was a decision by an already independent state. It deserves a lot of attention in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Armenia_cfa2.html" title="History of Armenia">History of Armenia</a>, but the infobox is not meant for information like this. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><font color="black"><sup>knocker</sup></font></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 00:41, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>301 AD is one of the most important dates for all Armenians. In a sense, it helped to establish the Armenian nation in a significant way as it shaped the Armenian identification. For me, an Armenian, the year that Armenia adopted Christianity is just as important as those years when it was established or became independent. It should also be noted that <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> has its Christianity adoption date included on its infobox. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 01:00, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said, it was undeniably an important moment in the history of Armenia. That's why it should be mentioned at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Armenia_cfa2.html" title="History of Armenia">History of Armenia</a>. But an important moment for a nation's identity is not automatically related to the independence of that nation. Adopting a religion is not a declaration of independence, or acquiring that independence. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><font color="black"><sup>knocker</sup></font></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 01:10, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The infobox IS meant for information like this!

<dl>
<dd>First of all I wanna urge you to calm down. Words like "who are you to decide" here or "utter crap" in a previous edit summary do not contribute anything to wikipedia. I would also like you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on my part: like you, I don't have an agenda to follow (of which you accused me in your edit summary on <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>).</dd>
<dd>We can both read. We can both see that the bold text heading that section says "independence". In every other country article, it simply says: independence declared: then-and-then; independence recognized: then-and-then. And that's what it should say in a section titled independence. Adopting a religion has barely anything to do with declaring or acquiring independence. It may be one of the factors in starting a process that can eventually lead to independence, but that's not enough to make mention of in the infobox. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><font color="black"><sup>knocker</sup></font></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 01:33, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am trying to figure out where you are coming from with this, when such significant historical events have been tolerated for many country articles infoboxes, and I urge you to tolerate it for Armenia and Bulgaria. I see now those were the only countries you removed it on, but they both happened to come up on my list so I wrongly guessed you were doing it to several other countries as well - sorry if I overreacted. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 01:43, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you point me to some of the "many country article infoboxes" on which "such significant historical events have been tolerated"? I've now been through all of the European countries and much of Africa and Asia, and I've only come across Georgia, Armenia and Bulgaria. In Georgia, the reference to christianization has been removed, so only Armenia and Bulgaria remain. Why should these two be any different from the other countries? Yes, the christianization has played an important role in the national history of these two countries, but it has played an important role in the history of other countries as well. Could you explain to me how adopting a religion equals declaring or acquiring independence? <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><font color="black"><sup>knocker</sup></font></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 16:46, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm fine either way, but one can make the argument that it's more important on the Eastern periphery of Europe than say in Central, Western or Nothern Europe. --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 16:55, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At the risk of going off-topic: That's indeed an argument one could make, and as a historian I find it feasible to some extent. However, western European countries were largely responsible for the spread of christianity in other continents. Christianization has been important in different ways in Eastern, Western, Central, Northern and Southern Europe. It's very hard to attach comparative importance to those differing historical trajectories of christianity. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><font color="black"><sup>knocker</sup></font></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 17:05, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Armenia is Non-European, Proposed Changes</span></h2>
<p>It is an offensive Point of View to include Armenia on the European continent, Armenia is located in Asia. How would you feel if some stranger stuck their picture in your family photo book? This is the case of a small group here trying to force Armenia into the European family.</p>
<p>I propose the following changes to remove the subjective point of view that Armenia is in Europe. The following changes will create a more truthful and accurate article that will cease to offend Europeans.</p>
<p>1.) Replace "Eurasia" with Middle East or Asia Minor, "Eurasia" is far to broad of a geographic area and replacing it with an accurate and more narrow geographic location will better serve Wikipedia readers.</p>
<p>2.) Replace this quote with the following, Current Quote</p>
<p>"Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is considered part of Europe, however the official geographic classification of the country varies according to different sources. As a result, Armenia is sometimes seen as a transcontinental nation."</p>
<p>Proposed Quote "Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is unique among it's Middle Eastern neighbors."</p>
<p>discussion of geography should be limited to the geography section.</p>
<p>3.) At the end of the Article the "Countries of Europe" section should be removed to avoid confusion and only leave Countries of Asia and West Asia.</p>
<p>Armenia is in Asia therefore it is an Asian culture and people, it may have had some European influences like the US, Canada, Australia, etc. but this does not make them European nations, nor should Armenia be considered European.</p>
<p>Please let's put a stop to these offensive and dishonest European connections and stick with the factual truth.

<dd>I honestly don’t think it matters whether or not Armenia is considered a European or Asian nation. It is, of course, technically in the continent of Asia, but then again, so is most of Russia, a certainly “European” nation. And it would be inappropriate to deny the enormous cultural influence of the Greeks, Byzantines, and Romans on our people. Why Europeans would find the inclusion of Armenians among European peoples to be ‘offensive’ is hard to fathom. Would it offend central Europeans to have Cyprus, Crete, Sicily, or the Ukraine, or people in the Ural Mountains classified as European? East Kazakhstan falls within the boundaries of geographic Europe; would you consider eastern Kazakhs Europeans? ), and while the modern Armenian Homeland is located north of Anatolia, Diaspora communities have existed through the Middle East and southeast Europe for thousands of years. Besides, there is not strict guideline of what is ‘European’. Europe as both a cultural and genetic entity, has invaded (and, in turn, been invaded by) countless nations, both neighboring and afar. Many long-term inhabitants of the European mainland have closer connections, both cultural and genetic, to south and central Asia than they do to their neighbors. Europe is not a family; it is a thousand families who happen to share a chunk of history and a chunk of land. Geographical classification is no reason to disconnect Armenia, who has been a part of European history since before the birth of Christ, from being a ‘culturally European’ nation.</dd>

      Armenia is completely contained within Asia, therefore it is an Asian Culture.
      
      To say “Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is considered part of 
      Europe…” is wrong.
     
      Using this same logic, The US, Canada, Australia, New Zeland, etc. would also be 
      considered part of Europe. This would be an absurd conclusion. 
      Culturally Armenia has a predominate language, alphabet, traditions and customs 
      that originated outside of Europe, whereas the other aforementioned nations do not. 
      So they would have even a greater claim based on this logic.
</pre>
<pre>
      As for Armenia being a Christian nation, somehow qualifying it for inclusion in 
      Europe, this is also a fallacious criterion. By this logic Albania would be considered 
      part of Asia. More importantly the boundaries of Europe were clearly defined long 
      before Christianity was introduced.
</pre>
<pre>
     As for the Counsel of Europe, this is a non EU private organization. Being within the 
     Borders of Europe is not a requirement for membership. Any nation with significant 
     trade activities with Europe could join.
</pre>
<pre>
     In the larger picture even the EU does not require a nation be in the boundaries of 
     Europe to accept membership, e.g. Cypress. The EU is an organization with 
     expansionist Economic and Political goals.
</pre>
<pre>
     In a spirit of compromise and concession, I propose the following changes.
</pre>
<pre>
     1.) Replace "Eurasia" with Asia Minor, "Eurasia" is far to broad of a geographic area 
         and replacing it with an accurate and more narrow geographic location will better 
         serve Wikipedia readers.
</pre>
<pre>
     2.) Replace this quote with the following, 
         Current Quote
         "Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is considered part of Europe, however                 
         the official geographic classification of the country varies according to different 
         sources. As a result, Armenia is sometimes seen as a transcontinental nation."
</pre>
<pre>
         Proposed Quote 
         "Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is unique among it's Asian neighbors.  
         Armenia has been highly influenced by European culture, trade, and politics, while 
         maintaining a rich indigenous culture, language and traditions"
</pre>
<pre>
     3.) At the end of the Article the "Countries of Europe" section should be removed to avoid 
         confusion and only leave Countries of Asia and West Asia.

<p>I'm not sure I understand the objections here.

As far as I am aware, Armenians themselves consider that they have cultural links to Europe, and, indeed, there has always been a large Armenian diaspora in Europe proper. Armenia is of course geographically in Asia, but that's not the be all and end all. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:56, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The geographic ambiguity is already addressed here and everywhere else. Footnotes are abundant in the templates for Europe and Asia. Culturally, ethnically and historically Armenia is an extension of Europe. Due to the ambiguity of the region the term Eurasian is applicable for geographic purposes. Armenian self-definition and identification as Europeans counts for something as well. The EU also considers Armenia as well as Georgia long-term entry candidates for EU membership. We also have Cyprus as precedent. If you want to attempt to change Wiki consensus attempt an RFC, just try it :) You will need to do it for Cyprus, Georgia and Armenia.

<dd>Hayastan is culturally in Asia, not in Europe. Its language is closely related to Persian and is not a member of European linguistic unity (which is based on Latin and Greek borrowings).

<li>I think one of the issues here is the need for coherence. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> is - according to Wikipedia - Eurasian. These two articles being in the same encyclopedia, there must be internal coherence.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Turkey is Eurasian, and Armenia is beyond Turkey (ie, separated from conventional "Europe" by Turkey), it must either be Eurasian or Asian. Physically, it can't be European, unless Turkey is European as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Another issue I find in this debate is the unfortunate use of the word "offensive". As a citizen of one of the oldest European nations - and I believe I am speaking for millions of other Europeans - I am not in the least bit offended if Armenians are considered (or consider themselves) European. They have a beautiful culture, and I'd feel honoured to count them among the European family if that is the geographical consensus.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>If I were Armenian, I would have felt hurt by the suggestion that my presence in the continent could be "offensive". 83.132.98.80 10:58, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most accurate statement would be that Armenia is located in the Caucasus, which is essentially a borderline between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. It would be correct to include Armenia in any of these categories but incorrect to exclude it from them. Saying Europeans wouldn't appreciate Armenians also being Europeans is nothing short of xenophobic. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 15:23, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To address the "cultural" connection, the following journal article cites that Armenia is growing closer to the Middle East culturally and moving away from Europe.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we have both credible academic, non-politcal sources that do not place Armenia in Europe on a Geographic Basis, as well as academic peer reviewed journals that place Armenia culturally in the Middle East. Can we get a consensus to my proposed changes and close this discussion? My proposal is restated below with the subtraction of the Eurasia request, in the spirit of good will and compromise I will drop that.</p>

<p>There is very little debate or controversy on this subject.

<dd>The geographic and cultural status of Armenia is a non-issue.

<li>What you seem to fail to understand, Caligvla, is the "boundaries" of Europe are arbitrary lines drawn through the Ural Mountains and Caucasus so that Geographers could break part their workload into two sections. These lines do not mean anything, and have no cultural, ethnic or political significance. Slavic people of identical culture and genes live on both sides of the Ural Mountains, yet one group lives in 'Asia' and the other in 'Europe'. Europe is a clutural sphere without any lines or borders. Another thing you failed to do is answer the most important question I asked in my last post, the one on which your entire argument balances. <b>"How do you define European??"</b> You keep on saying that we are "offending" Europeans be classing ourselves among them, but you never give your personal opinion on what Europeans are. Are the Roma people European, despite migrating out of north India during the middle ages. How about Ashkenazi Jews? Crimean Tartars, Eastern Kazakhs? They both live in Europe. You cant focus your argument on a adjective you refuse to define. I will keep asking you until you give me a precise definition. Unless you can give me one, don't even bother answering. In case you did not see it the first time, again <b>"How do you define European??"</b></li>

In all cases those who put Armenian and Georgian “European” identities under question are politically motivated. Armenians identify themselves as European, and their self-definition is the most important factor to consider. This is definitely a legitimate POV as exactly the qualities and symbols associated with the European identity have played an uttermost role in the formation of the Armenian nation even though the Oriental influences have always been strong.

<dd>I thought I said 'If you can’t give me a definition, don't bother answering'...*sigh*... Let me put it this way, your personal opinions are, of course meaningless, but there are several distinctly different ways to define 'European', and you don’t seem to be using any of them. You must have a specific definition and you must only have one. Academic citations are meaningless unless you define what you are trying to prove. Who knows what definition the Scholars where using? I'll make this easy on you; I will give you multiple choices. <b>A</b>- A person belonging cultural group based in the western reaches of the Eurasian landmass. Armenia would certainly qualify, particularly considering its alphabet and connection with Greece. <b>B</b>- A person residing within the borders, according to one or another definition of the boundaries of Europe. This line usually is drawn somewhere through the Caucasus, often (but not always) including Armenia. <b>C</b>- A person ethnically belonging to one of the northeastern Caucasoid groups. Judging by some of your earlier edits, I suspect you may think this, if you will not argue it. Just pick one.</dd>

<p>It seems to me that, even if the Canadian government and BBC aren't peer reviewed, they represent a very real understanding of the situation; these people aren't flipping coins to decide whether Armenia is a member of Europe. The point of Wikipedia is to report on what is, not what should be, so with an issue such as this one, where arguments have been made both ways, the job of an encyclopedia is to acknowledge the differing definitions and move on. I don't think that there will be concensus on placing Armenia in or out of Europe, unless and until Europe's borders change drastically. Armenia lies at the physical border, but that border is nebulous and ill defined. It's also not the only border, as there are cultural, in addition to geographic definitions of Europe. Finally, (and I'll admit here that I'm a resident of the US, who has never been to Armenia) I'm not sure what is gained by placing Armenia in Europe, nor am I sure of what is gained by not doing so. I'll admit this is a guess, but isn't there a lot more to Armenia than whether it's technically part of Europe or not? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 17:46, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

A fellow colleague brought this controversy to my attention. I am an Armenian-American from Burbank, California and have an interest in how Armenia portrayed in the media. After careful review of Caligvla's cited sources this issue should be closed, the suggested changes are appropriate. It seems the opposition has a personal axe to grind due to Caligvla's lack of sensitivity to point of view of the Armenian users on this site. Regardless of Caligvla's lack of tact in his earlier contributions, which he has seemed to back off from, the facts remain on his side and the other users who have supported this position. The user Caligvla is not the issue, just like on CSI you have to follow the evidence. --<a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWordlytrin_6c57.html" title="User:Wordlytrin">Wordlytrin</a> 18:57, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Caligvla: I don't think it's very nice of you to claim to simply move an entry to the geography section, AFTER you have changed the wording to circumvent consensus on this article. I will support a ban of your username if you continue to pull crap like this. Also, there is a ~6 hour space between your 'request' and when you assumed there were no objections.

<dd>I think making an assumption like that is generally a bad idea, because he may actually have something to contribute... if all the hard work he claims to be doing is actually taking place. My only suggestion is that his additions go through a careful review process before being added to the article. 24-48h should be enough time for people who are watching the article closely to make a judgement. I agree however that as of this time he should not just be making edits on his own whenever he feels like it.--Roboczar 15:17, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Okay Eupator, since you keep plastering those links everywhere, you can and on as many talk pages as you can and I am tired of following them around and posting explanations. Each time I do you delete my responses, so I am posting them here as off topic as it may be, but since you posted them I will respond here.</p>
<p>Link 1: Armenian Crime in Glendale, CA. Between 2005 – present, there have been over 20 murders in Glendale, CA. They all have been committed by Armenians. You don’t find this notable? Yes it is, but I posted in the wrong article and I have ceased trying to put it there once I found other articles that cover Armenian gangs and organized crime. Armenians do commit the overwhelming majority of crime in Glendale, CA. and before the 1990s Glendale had one of the lowest crime rates in Los Angeles County. You don’t believe me? Call or write to the Glendale Police Department 131 N Isabel St Glendale, CA 91206 (818) 548-4840. Blanket deleting factual information in Wikipedia will not delete the suffering of many innocent people in Glendale, CA. Again I have to state was that the right article to post it in? NO. Is this the right place to respond, NO. But you keep bringing it up and I have to defend my actions.</p>
<p>Link 2: Swarthy, excessive body hair, and monobrows This was posted in the Classification section of the Armenians Article. There seems to be a strong North American bias here, since when is describing common physical features a bad thing. Just because North Americans have their own sense of aesthetics, doesn’t mean the rest of the world shares your views. The section claimed Armenians were like Slavs and Germanics, I pointed out the most common differences. To not do so would mislead readers. There was no ill will here, only an attempt to distinguish those who were compared to.</p>
<p>Link 3: See Above</p>
<p>Link 4: I proposed the addition of 3 images from an academic scholarly anthropological journal. These images were of 3 Armenian men from 1911 and 1912. Since my written descriptions were rejected, I tried to continue in a civil manner and upload neutral academic pictures so readers could decide for themselves. No one liked the pictures so I recently tried to upload a picture of a young Armenian boy who was quite handsome by even the most subjective of North American standards yet that was unfairly deleted too.</p>
<p>Link 5: The term Eurasia means next to nothing, it was far too broad, Middle East, Asia Minor, West Asia, Asian Caucasus, would all be more narrow and accurate. Eurasia leaves open the possibility that part or all of Armenia is in Europe, which it clearly is not.</p>
<p>Link 6: This section presented an unbalanced POV, while I personally feel ALL nations should recognize the Armenian Genocide and label it as such, I though it would balance the article to mention that the world’s two largest economies refuse to call it a Genocide. Since this is such a sensitive topic I decided to drop it.</p>
<p><b>Now let’s get back on topic!</b> Armenia is not located in Europe, therefore it can’t be a European culture, but like many others is an European influenced one. I am only asking for this one minor change that would keep the article balanced.</p>
<p><b>"Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is considered part of Europe and Asia, however the official geographic classification of the country varies according to different sources. As a result, Armenia is sometimes seen as a transcontinental nation."</b></p>
<p>And relocate the statement back to its original position in the Geography section. This compromise is more than fair and serves both sides.</p>

<dd>About the crime in Glendale, from my understanding almost half of the population in Glendale is Armenian. Hence, it is misleading to present Armenians as a sort of overly violent minority.

<dd>Perhaps if that were the entirety of the edit you actually made, Caligvla, we may have had a discussion about it, given more than 6 hours time to respond. However, there was additional text changed, and placed in a 'move' edit to mask the fact that words had been changed and sentences added. This is not acceptable behavior from an editor. I implore you to either take this issue to a mediation committee and hash it out with the rest of the editors with a third party to broker a compromise, or drop your dispute. I am considering taking action myself, even though I am not a regular contributor to articles on Wikipedia. This has got to stop, and if you won't start mediation, I will.--Roboczar 18:03, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mediation - I am open to the idea of mediation, but if I am the only one participating it won't acomplish much, do you think Eupator and Clevelandar would participate?</p>
<p>RfC - From what I read it stays open until all parties agree, make the change and then it's case closed, if I do it they will all jump on me.</p>

<dd>That's not quite true. I would support that particular edit, if I had assurances that would be all that is changed. What bothers me is that more was changed the first time, and that there was not enough time to discuss the change before it was made.

<p>First up, the EU considers Armenia a valid country for eventual admission wrt geographical location criteria. Second, the "Armenia is beyond Turkey" argument is a red herring. The traditional boundaries of Europe are the Bosphorus, the Urals, and the Caucasus. That Armenia is way beyond the Bosphorus is irrelevant; it straddles the Caucasus, one of the other boundary lines. In terms of plate tectonics, it is part of the European continent. That's a physical fact which isn't really subject to debate. Any debate on Armenia being European is purely political, and the dominant political bodies in Europe are happy to recognise it as part of Europe. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhialto_3647.html" title="User:Rhialto">Rhialto</a> 01:14, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hello,I am from Germany and I don't usually spend much time in the English wikipedia, so I am not sure if it is my place to comment.There seems to be a minority of voices from Western Europe here.

It is located in Asia, and put a footnote that states the 2 or 3 sources that place it outside of Asia.

<p>This really is a political issue and should be labeled as such. Armenia currently has a spark of hope in joining the European Union. Armenians are reinventing themselves as Europeans, just like Madonna does each time she releases a new CD. If they get in, they will become more and more European. If they get rejected I am sure they will go back to their Middle Eastern roots and the EU will be on the long list of nations they don't get along with. With that being said, Armenians who live in Europe already, are about as European as you can get. Same goes for Armenians in the USA, they always try to blend in. So it really is a broad issue with a lot of political agendas at play. I think once the EU decides what to do with Armenia, this discussion will become a moot point. Just out of pure wonder, has there been any Armenians from Armenia to say how they feel about this? I am from the USA, and Armenians here are proud to be American, they could really care less about the EU.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Thomasian_b7f3.html" title="User:Craig Thomasian">Craig Thomasian</a> 22:02, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Armenians "reinventing themselves as Europeans?" I don't wish to be rude, but that's nonsense. Armenians have always looked towards Europe for their cultural cues (even back in antiquity - many historians consider the Kingdom of Armenia (or Great Armenia) to have had a strong Hellenistic influence). Also, to answer your question about how Armenians in Armenia feel about the possibility of EU membership, many are very receptive. In fact, 64% of Armenians in Armenia are in favor of EU integration and some Armenian political leaders (particularly in the opposition) have favored the idea and some have even hinted that Armenia will make its bid for membership in a few years. The present Kocharian administration, however, maintains a policy of remaining tied to Russia and the CIS for the time being. Actually, I don't blame Kocharian either. If you were a country bounded by two states that are hostile to you, what would you do? For now, Russian military support, security and protection are the only solutions for Armenia. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 22:53, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, in fact any country in the Middle East (such as Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan) had strong hellenistic influence in the past. This does not make them European. Many countries would support joining the EU if suggested. Try suggest it Egypt, Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan or Israel. This also does not make them European.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 15:14, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, last time I checked neither Afghanistan nor Pakistan were in the Middle East. Central and South Asia maybe, but not the Middle East. Second, I was not suggesting that because the Armenians of Armenia welcome EU integration automatically makes them European, I was merely responding to Craig's question. Aside from the Hellenistic influence (which I admit also had an impact on many countries in the modern Middle East), there have been other examples of the Armenians looking towards Europe for their cultural inspiration. In fact, unlike most of those Middle Eastern states that you mentioned, Armenia never accepted the Arab influence, Islam, or gave up its Hellenistic influence (which allowed it to retain especially strong relations with the Greeks). During the Crusades, the Armenians of Cilicia joined Western Europe in the fight for the Holy Land. Even under Ottoman rule, the Armenians looked towards France and Italy for their influence. Since the conquest of Eastern Armenia by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, Armenians have also felt a certain degree of influence from Russia and the Slavic countries of Eastern Europe. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 16:45, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Take India. It has Indo-European language (just as Armenia), had significant <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Greek_Kingdom_5277.html" title="Indo-Greek Kingdom">Hellenistic influence in the past</a>, never accepted Arab influence or Islam, had been British colony for a long time and joined fight during WWII on the side of British Empire.

<dd>Of course there was the Indo-Greek Kingdom, I don't dispute that. However, most of its territory is in present-day Pakistan, not India. Also, yes, certain parts of India did accept Islam. If they didn't, then there would be no Pakistan or Bangladesh. Even today, there are areas of India with Muslim majorities. Also, India, as part of the British Empire, had no choice but to join the allies in both world wars, whereas the Cilician Armenians clearly made the decision to join the Western European countries in the Crusades. I'll repeat this again, even under Ottoman rule, the Armenians looked towards France and Italy for their influence and since the conquest of Eastern Armenia by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, Armenians have also felt a certain degree of influence from Russia and the Slavic countries of Eastern Europe. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 17:51, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not only the Indo-Greek kingdom influenced Indian culture. Note that even under <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashoka_the_Great_a1f9.html" title="Ashoka the Great">Ashoka the Great</a> emperor's edicts were written in Greek. Yes, India now has Muslim populated areas, but Armenia also has some Muslim part of population. Armenia has bad relations with its muslim heghbours, so it is a natural ally for Christian world. For example, Lebanon also supported Christan crusades and maintained Christianity as a state religion (the situation changed in the 1980s with large Palestinian immigration). Modern Israel will also voluntary support any US or NATO crusade against Muslim world, but we do not call these countries European.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 18:14, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand how Craig feels, I think it's hard for Armenians in the US. Everytime I fly to the US and leave, I am treated like a terrorist. Because we look like Middle Eastern people we are subjected to long searches, interviews by TSA, and once you make it through all that you have to be stuck on a plane with a bunch of people giving you dirty looks. I try to keep clear of politics, so I don't really care where you want to say Armenia is located, for me being Amenian is in my heart. I don't think it's fair to beat up on an Armenian who hasn't been to Armenia. I have never been there, I just haven't had a chance to. Does that make me less of an Armenian? I hope not.

Armenians are all over the world. There will be almost a half million the US soon, who have very diverse viewpoints on a wide range of topics.

<dd>I only offer my two cents as an FYI because of late I've been doing extensive research on the Balkan peninsula, and as a Latvian have also done research on "European Russia." Culturally, there were Armenian settlements well into the Balkan peninsula. The European cultural connection (i.e., push westward and influences returned) is definitely there. From a geographical perspective, the best comparison is what has historically been referred to as "European Russia"—which extends <b>far more eastward</b> than people would expect, that is people who only know mostly modern Europe (i.e., for most of their lives, Eastern Europe stopped at the Soviet Union). European Russia extends far enough eastward to span the entire territory between the Black and Caspian Seas. The Urals are the traditional eastern boundary, beyond which lies Asia. Just as there are the Urals on the east, there are the Caucasus to the south. <b>However</b>, the southern boundary of European Russia (between the Black and Caspian seas) reached to Turkey (just north of Ararat). It would appear to simply boil down to what does Armenia consider itself? It's unequivocally not "too far" east to be Europe, and it's well within the historical boundary of European Russia to the south. Yes, technically beyond the Caucasus. While there continues to be lack of clarity in differentiating the south Caucasus states from from central Asian ones in the post-Soviet era, there's nothing that indicates Armenia can't consider itself European and be identified as part of Europe. Anyone believing making Europe "bigger" is somehow hurtful or insulting to the "Europeans" most likely has no idea how huge "Europe" really is and who the "Europeans" really are--that is, how many cultures were hurt by being forced out of the European fold into the Soviet one for half a century and are now only trying to reclaim their rightful historical identity. —<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<dd>First, please do not oppose Soviet culture and European culture as the former is a type of the last. Armenia definitely was in Soviet cultural areal, but this cannot make it European just as India did not become European being British colony. Second, Armenians really have large diaspora in Europe (although it is smaller than Arab one), but they also have diaspora in Asian countries. For example, the current president of Lebanon <a href="../../../%C3%A9/m/i/%C3%89mile_Lahoud_20fc.html" title="Émile Lahoud">Émile Lahoud</a> is from Armenian descent and Iranian cosmonaut <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anousheh_Ansari_a0a2.html" title="Anousheh Ansari">Anousheh Ansari</a> also. Second, yes, Armenia is not too far east to be considered European, just as Israel (which lies in the same time zone with Moscow) or Eqypt. In fact Armenia <b>too far south</b> to be considered European.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 09:32, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You misread my comment. With regard to the first, I meant that in popular culture, geographical Eastern Europe ends where the boundary with the former Soviet Union begins, that is, Western Europe is the core of Europe, Eastern Europe is on the margin of Europe—when, in fact, geographically, it is Western Europe that hangs off the much larger Eastern Europe. With regard to the second, that's really the crux—as I stated, there doesn't appear to be much agreement or scholarship on the "continentalism" of the South Caucasus states, as the mountain range rather inconveniently bisects countries and territories of ethnic and cultural influence. Georgia, adjoined to the north, is counted as European. If a country physically adjoins a country considered part of Europe; and it, in its policies and pronouncements, considers itself part of Europe; and European organizations accept that country as European; then I don't see the rationale for denying that country its aspirations. (Well, they're <b>not really</b> Europe, they <b>only pretend</b> they're Europe to get the <b>benefits</b> of being in Europe, etc., etc.) And Europe <b>has</b> rejected "membership applications" from countries obviously "too far south" (e.g., Morocco). If you would like to put in a proviso that, "A strict definition of geographical Europe, using the Caucasus mountain range as its southeastern boundary between the Black and Caspian seas, places Armenia and parts of other adjoining countries considered European into the land mass of Asia," that's perfectly reasonable. —<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<dd>Mr. Vecrumba's comments echo most of what I have read on this issue.

On a second note, disagreeing with someone is fine, and perhaps Mr Vecrumba's comments do qualify as original research, but comments such as "thanks for trying," and "nice to see some intelligent comments in a sea of idiocy," belie the intelligence of the people writing them and are simply unprofessional. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 18:01, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For Armenians in Europe, "Historical Atlas of East Central Europe" by Robert Magocsi. (Armenians have inhabited east central Europe since the late sixth century, in many cases longer than those currently considered to be the indigenous peoples.) For European Russia−that is, the European part of Russia—numerous maps, including Gaskell's Atlas of the World, showing European Russia extending south to the River Aras (and beyond, along the Caspian Sea). I'm not inventing a particular wheel to fit a particular cart to go a particular place—I entered this with neither a personal agenda nor original research. To <a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a>, again, I believe my suggestion suitably separates culture from geographical features. Israel does not abut any territories currently considered to be part of Europe, as does Armenia, so your repeated use of Israel as a "counter-example" can only be for its intended rhetorical effect.

<dd>Jews and Arabs also inhabited Europe for a long time and outnumbered the indigenious population in certain areas. This does not make Arab states or Israel European. Armenians also for many centuries liver in the Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon and Iran. Next. Armenia is currently not a part of Russia.

<dd>I'll just start back here beyond the event horizon as the black hole seems to have reappeared directly above. Did I say Armenia is part of Russia? I said that Armenia is in the territory which once formed a part of European Russia (the empire), and that this "European territory" extended all the way to Turkey, encompassing the entire "Caucasian" area. The Armenians consider themselves a European culture and point to historic ties and other evidence that support their claim: as the Armenians <b>are</b> a separate Indo-European branch, Armenian being classified an <b>Indo-European language</b> (of the Paleo-Balkan branch), it is, indeed, just as the Armenians maintain. (Georgian, for example, is not Indo-European, so they actually have less of a European cultural "claim"—theirs is more through association.) As for the sources cited "proving" Asia (CIA, U.N.), these are not academic sources, nor do they say anything about culture, which seems to be what all the shouting is <u>really</u> about: <b>do we classify Armenians as Asiatic based on the boundaries of the present-day state of Armenia?</b> To which the only possible objective answer is, "No." So, if we wish to describe the European "situation" in the very strictest of senses, it might be something like: "Using the Caucasus mountain range between the Black and Caspian seas as the geographical limit of southeastern Europe, the territory of the current state of Armenia, as well as parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan, are situated on the land mass of Asia. However, the Armenians and Armenian culture and language are European in origin based on their Indo-European roots." (And I really don't understand why Israel, Jews, and Arabs keep surfacing in the discussion, how are they relevant?) —<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<dd>It cannot serve as a basis to be "european". Tajiks and Indians as well as Iranians and Afghanians also speak Indo-European language. What does matter really is that Armenian language does not belong to European linguistic unity (which is determined by Greek and Latin borrowings). This criterion clearly distinguish Europen languages from others. For example, in English vocabulary there are about 70% Latin/Greek borrowings, and in Russian it is about 50%. In Armenian it is less 2%, while most borrowings are from Persian or unknown non-Indo-European languages.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 13:42, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hogwash! Can you cite sources for numbers? Of course you can't. Btw, Russian has many non-IE loanwords. From the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> article:"Russian phonology and syntax (especially in northern dialects) have also been influenced to some extent by the numerous Finnic languages of the Finno-Ugric subfamily: Merya, Moksha, Muromian, the language of the Meshchera, Veps etc. These languages, some of them now extinct, used to be spoken right in the center and in the north of what is now the European part of Russia. They came in contact with Eastern Slavic as far back as the early Middle Ages and eventually served as substratum for the modern Russian language. The Russian dialects spoken north, north-east and north-west of Moscow have a considerable number of words of Finno-Ugric origin". "Modern Russian also has a considerable number of words adopted from Tatar and some other Turkic languages.". At least Armenian loanwords are from IE languages not some turko-mongol dialects...Even some of the earliest recorded Russian words like <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogatyr.html" title="Bogatyr">bogatyr</a> are of Turkic origin.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 13:58, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Nixer is right on this, recent DNA studies have shown this to be the most likely case. However we still don't really know with absolute conviction where anyone came from. What we do know for fact, and 99.9% of all reference books support that Armenia is 100% in Asia, it doesn't even border Europe. We know they speak a Middle Eastern langauge, that has similar sounds to Persian and Arabic. The alaphabet was a complete invention and looks nothing like any European written script. Their Physical features are more in common with the Middle East, more European looking Armenian families, often have several actual Europeans mix in the blood lines, this is do to their long period of Soviet control. Prior to that we have provided photographic sources from a respected academic anthropological that shows Armenians are not related to Europeans in anyway. To say every nation in Europe believes Armenia is in Europe is a complete lie. Just because you are an EU member state doesn't mean you support or obey all of their edicts. As for what Armenians believe they are, we have also seen conflicting views on that. As we have seen, any Armenian who even had a slightly different view was quickly insulted and attacked by our two resident pseudo-Armenian editors.

<dd>So what if their alphabet is invented? The Latvian alphabet is a complete invention also, the current Roman characters in use bear no resemblance to runic Latvian; it is purely the result of Germanic conquest. What an alphabet looks like is not a measure of the culture. "They look and sound Middle-Eastern, therefore they are?" We might as well be discussing phrenology. Nor is Caucasia the Middle East. From <u>The Armenians</u>, by A. Elizabeth Redgate (1999), hailed as a seminal work on Armenian history (and a non-Armenian with no "agenda"), she concludes: "despite their geographical position and their entanglement with Assyrians, Urartians, Persians, Arabs, and Turks, both ancient and early medieval Armenians have a European significance. It is not only that their <b>origins were western</b> and their <b>language Indo-European</b>, it is also that <b>Armenians contributed to western life, in the Christian period particularly</b> ...."—also bringing us back earlier to the relevance of religion, that is, the Armenians did not "take" from early Christianity, they "gave" to early Christianity, becoming a formative influence in the Judeo-<b>Christian</b> tradition which we regard as an integral part of European civilization. —<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<dd>Actually, the Phoenician alphabet gave rise to the Aramaic alphabet, from which the other scripts are derived. However, it is incorrect to state the Armenian alphabet shares those roots. Both Cyrillic and Armenian scripts are artificial inventions created to enable the writing of religous texts in the languages of the indigenous peoples being converted. —<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<p>Here is the facts. Before there was any notion of a European or Hellenic culture, there were Armenians around with their own culture, and traditions. Armenians have had dealings with all of the ancient kingdoms, and when I say ancient, I'm not speaking of Hellenic Greece or Rome, but of Sumer, Akkad, Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, and some researchers even suugest Dravidian India. To suggest that Armenians moved to eastern Anatolia is incorrect, Armenians are one of the oldest, if not the eldest, Indo-European group. Also, I'm glad to see that no all of you are looking at what Europe gave to Armenia, but what Armenia gave to Europe. Therefore as more and more scholars are finding out, the Indo-European homeland was Armenia, not north of the Crimea or the Central Asian steppes. As many of you may have discovered, there's editors out there who havd an agenda and are very good at white-washing truth and spreading their lies, in the form of NPOV. All the <b>real</b> historians know the true history of Armenia, not the half baked crap presented by hatemongers, so whether you believe Armenia is European or not, remember that when Armenia was around some of your ancestors still lived the uncivilized life of a hunter gatherer.--<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoosh88_7095.html" title="User:Moosh88">Moosh88</a> 02:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hunter-gatherers live much closer to the environment, and the world might be better off if none of us had ever moved beyond hunting and gathering. Apart from anything else, we wouldn't have nuclear weapons, over-population, chemical polution in the water and air, etc. More to the point, I don't see how that applies to the subject at hand. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 13:51, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Give "Armenians are Middle-Eastern" a rest. Endless repetition doesn't make anything more factual. To <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a>, I believe the point was that as perhaps one of the three oldest civilizations on the planet, the Armenians were "supping" while my ancestors—I freely acknowledge—were busy "stalking" rodents for their next meal. Certainly with respect to east central Europe, Armenians were the earliest European civilization. Saying they're "not European" is a bit like saying American Indians "aren't American" because they got here too early. After all, look at them, east of the Mississippi, they're only "diaspora" existing in gambling casino colonies. And come to think of it, they don't <u>look</u> very "American" either.... —<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<dd>Native Americans live in America and Armenians never lived in Europe (except for diaspora). Their ancestors probably came from Europe, but it was long before Armenians formed as ethnos. They just as Europeans as Tajiks, Kurds or Indians. Saying Armenians European is just as calling native Americans "Asians". I already said you that Armenian history is closely connected to Assyrians, Urartians, Persians, Arabs, and Turks. The ancient Armenia constituted large part of Mesopotamia with Euphrates dividing it into two halves.

<dd>Regarding factual basis, perhaps you missed the (acclaimed) academic texts I've quoted earlier. "Diaspora" is a term used to describe peoples scattered to places based on external forces, from their traditional place of habitation. For example, I'm "Latvian" diaspora as my parents fled the Soviets advancing to re-occupy Latvia. The old/ancient/historical presence of Armenians in east central Europe (Balkan penninsula) does not qualify as "diaspora" under that definition, as opposed to, for example, Armenian-American "diaspora." Regarding, "Armenian history is closely connected to Assyrians, Urartians, Persians, Arabs, and Turks," my last quote specifically addressed that. Entanglements with other cultures do not define a culture. I am no more Polish, Swedish, Russian, or German than an Armenian is Assyrian, Urartian, Persian, Arabic, or Turkish.</dd>
<dd>    Having my own employer enlist me once to speak to the captains of Soviet industry about our products because, "Hey, you're Latvian, that's Russia? Right? Hey, you can talk to them in their own language, that'll be great!" So, there I was, hawking our product to people representing the government responsible for deporting my relatives to Siberia to die there. So, I'm quite painfully aware of the effects of mis-identification of culture.

<dd>It's not connected to those cultures anymore than any other European nation that was around before the Middle Ages, that narrows it down to a few but still. Also Armenia only had one small province in the Middle East for a while and that was in Northern Syria where Edessa is, even that was essentially "colonial". The only time Armenia had possessions in Mesopotamia was uder Tigranes the Great's empire and that barely lasted two decades. As for Turks and Arabs, there is absolutely no connection there. Unlike lets say Albania, Bosnia or or Malta. Hell Spain and Portugal are more "connected" to Arabs than Armenia ever was. Arabs were more successfful there than they ever were in their short occupation of Armenia. The only real connection with Arabs is through the Armenia Diaspora that was established in the last 100 years. Nixer, you're fighting an uphill battle.

<dd>Things are getting a little tangled - what I think I hear is that there are a few ways to define Europe, and thus a few different ways to decide whether or not Armenia is in, out, or associated with Europe:
<ul>
<li>Geographically - I have the sense that from a merely geographic (i.e.: lines drawn on a map) standpoint, there is consensus that Armenia doesn't fall within the <i>drawn</i> borders of Europe.</li>
<li>Culturally - this seems to me to be the biggest sticking point. I have the sense that there is agreement that Armenia has a rich culture, but disagreement as to 1) whether cultural connections can place a country within a continent and 2) if yes, then whether Armenia's cultural connections to Europe are strong enough to place it in Europe</li>
<li>Economically - similar to cultural, above, but seen from an economic standpoint.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Armenian language and culture</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> has brought up several times that "Indo-European" is not any measure of European-ness. Specifically: "Tajiks and Indians as well as Iranians and Afghanians also speak Indo-European language. What does matter really is that Armenian language does not belong to European linguistic unity (which is determined by Greek and Latin borrowings)...."</p>
<p>Greco-Latin borrowings is a poor means of language characterization. It might be a good approximation for describing the Romance languages and borrowings into the contemporary Germanic (English in particular), but it breaks down as soon as you move further afield. For example, Latvian and Lithuanian are thousands of years old--parts of Latvian resemble, and decline remarkably like, Latin, but are not borrowed from Latin in any way shape or form. Still other words have barely changed from Sanskrit in 5,000 years. Yet still European. Chaucer is still readable by those knowing contemporary English, yet Beowulf, which is as far from Chaucer's time as he is from ours, is pretty much unintelligible. Yet still European.</p>
<p>So the question is, how to get from a "branch" of "Indo-European" to "European?" Is there some commonality of roots?</p>
<p>Regarding the ones <a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iranian branch -- descended from ancient Persian, includes Farsi (aka Iranian, Dari, Persian) ["Iranians"], Kurdish, Pashtu ["Afghanis"], Tadzhik (close relative to Farsi) ["Tajiks"].</li>
<li>Indic branch -- derived from Sanskrit, mainly northern India ["Indians"], includes Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, and Romany (the language of the Gypsies).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can be agreed these branches are not European. They did not originate in European territory and neither they nor their ancestors have been spoken there by peoples who would be counted as among the indigenous population. (The ultra-nomadic Romany is rather a special and unique case; fortunately, not having to be discussed here.)</p>
<p>Let's look at the ones we can (likely) agree are European:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celtic branch -- originated in central Europe, remained in Europe: Welsh, Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, and others</li>
<li>Germanic branch -- English, Dutch, German, Flemish, Icelandic, and others</li>
<li>Latin branch (aka Romance languages) -- Italian, Portuguese, French, Romanian, and others</li>
<li>Slavic branch -- Bulgarian, Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovene, Macedonian, Bosnian, Ukranian, and others</li>
<li>Baltic branch -- Latvian and Lithuanian, Prussian is extinct</li>
<li>Hellenic branch -- modern Greek, all others extinct</li>
<li>Illyric branch -- Albanian, all others extinct</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are a couple of extinct branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anatolian branch -- extinct (Hittite et al.)</li>
<li>Tokharian branch -- extinct (northwest China)</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, we are left with one remaining branch—I'm sure we all know by now which one that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thracian Branch -- modern Armenian</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also three extinct languages in that branch: Dacian (Dacia), Thracian (Thrace), and Phrygian (ancient Troy). We have related languages of the same branch, Dacian and Thracian, of ancient kingdoms of the Balkans. We have also the Armens, of the Balkans, from whence they expanded/migrated to the "Armenian highlands", assimilating the indigenous peoples, the Hayasa. Armenian, the language of the Armen, is an ancient Palaeo-Balkan (i.e., east central European) language, survived to the present day, infused with Farsi as the result of historical entanglements mentioned elsewhere--and not as the result of some common Middle Eastern heritage as has been alleged. As we all know, language is culture. The Armenians are of Europe: "The Armenian culture is rooted in ancient Europe." Not Persia/Asia/Middle East/et al. —<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J. Vecrumba</a> 01:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

GDP (purchasing power parity): $13.46 billion (2005 est.) GDP (official exchange rate): $4.868 billion (2005 est.) GDP - real growth rate: 13.9% (2005 est.) GDP - per capita (PPP): $4,500 (2005 est.) As we see here, the GDP is $13.46 billion, and GDP per capita is $4500. As of 2006, to the best of my knowledge, the GDP per capita is around $5400. GDP per capita is the most important economic factor of a country. Besides the GDP, GDP per capita also depends on the population and it's growth rate. The GDP growth rate should be greater than the population growth rate in order for a country to have some economic benefits. By the way, Caligvla, you are right about inflation...

<blockquote>
<p>"Armenia has a long, rich cultural history, reaching back to the founding of the Armenian nation c2500BC. Armenia’s location near the <a href="../../../u/r/a/Ural_Mountains_314f.html" title="Ural Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> has enabled the nation to influence and be influenced by both European and Asian cultures. Assigning Armenia to either Asia or Europe thus becomes difficult, for although present cartography places Armenia in Asia, adjacent to Europe, the historical variation of the Asia:Europe border, coupled with Armenia’s cultural, economic, and political ties to nations on both sides of that border, present strong arguments for the nation’s membership in either or both continents. As a result of this, the geographic classification of the country varies according to different sources. Also as a result, Armenia is sometimes seen as a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental_nation.html" title="Transcontinental nation">transcontinental nation</a>."</p>

<dd><s>Conditional Support:</s> Armenia is at the crossroads of Europe and geographic Asia (asia is used now to describe the Orient)Maybe Middle East and Europe as an idea.FYI: The Middle East is a region that overlaps Europe, Asia, and Africa and is where all three continents meet if anyone wants to critique my suggestion. I think it is a shame that some Armenians are pushing for a strong Eurocentric classification becuase the old Armenians did not consider Armenia European (or Asian), but distinct. Why don't any of you use the official categorization of Armenia used by its government? <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.196.164.190.html" title="User:69.196.164.190">69.196.164.190</a>

<dd>Right, two users who have just joined only to support your bs and do nothign else. Sounds very convincing. Understand that when checkuser is complete your ban will not be temporary.

<dd>-My vote better count. I was asked to look into the debate, I wanted to contribute to it, but didn't get around to it (time, illness prevented me), just because you disagree with my vote doesn't mean it is discounted. If the vote is 25 to 10, the concensus will be to the 25, even if you're part of the 10. So, get over yourself Eupator. Canvassing is needed to make people aware there is a vote (notice he didn't try to sway me), if I disagreed with the proposal I would have voted to oppose, but I support it. Would you consider AfD and Requested moves canvassing? Canvassing isn't against policy. But then again, I wasn't canvassed, I simply asked Caligvla for the link. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 17:10, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

Considering that all (of the vast majority) of Bonaparte's anon edits to Wikipedia are through open proxies (in fact, he was banned for open proxy sockpuppetry), then it is extremely likely that this is what is happening. If my suspicions are confirmed, then this will have interesting implications for Caligvla.
