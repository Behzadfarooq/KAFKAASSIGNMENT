<p>I tagged paragraph with POV, maybe more contributors will express their view on this. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 22:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Could we discuss the folowing disputed paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Relations between Lithuanians and Poles were strained during most of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interwar_period.html" title="Interwar period">interwar period</a> due to conflicts over the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Vilnius region</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/v/Suvalkai_region.html" title="Suvalkai region">Suvalkai region</a>, areas whose population was a mixture of Poles and Lithuanians. Germans relocated Lithuanian families to Vilnius region from Western parts of Lithuania by force, and this complicated situation. During the war these conflicts resulted in thousands of deaths, as groups on both sides used the opportunities offered by the war to commit violent acts against those they perceived as enemies."</dd>

<dd>I have taken the liberty to move this section up to the main medcab section, where we have been discussing this para anyway. As this para is disputed by Sigitas, I think we all will appreciate his reply to why he persists in deleting most of this paragraph; as I think no other editor finds it objectionable.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 15:37, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't appear to be there ATM, but I think that the first and third sentences are rather NPOV and semi-obvious, and can be easily referenced with some of our existing refs.

<p>After some thinking I have reservations regarding the "thousands of deaths". AK probably killed 4000 locals in "ethnic Lithuanian lands" but many of victims were Belarussians, Jews and Poles. Thousands of Poles would be killed by Germans with or without Lithuanian administration in place. Sonderkommando Ypatingasis burys in Paneriai were killing people not because they "took the opportunities offered by the war to commit crimes" but because they were forced to. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 09:47, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>You should evaluate these data carefully. I know for sure that at least some of the villages burned by Territorial Defence Force were simply invented by Polish propagandists, for example killings in Grauziskes, when Territorial Defence Force didn't even reach this place before being destroyed by AK. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 15:46, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've never heard about killings in Graużyszki, as indeed, Plechaviczius men were defeated earlier; however, In Sienkowszczyna (quite near Grauzyszki) Plechaviczius men were burning houses and killing people - probably that's why they were so easily defeated, since AK attacked while the butchers were busy with shooting the civilians. As for Burys being forced to kill Poles, well, they were all volunteers; <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 07:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC) EDIT: plus Pawłów, Adamowszczyzna, Tołminów
<dl>
<dd>Witnesses say they there ambushed marching by AK, which probably was tipped by Germans. I don't know much about these events though. Burys' members volunteered to assist germans initially, but not to kill people in paneriai. Most of them only were aknowledged of their role in killings after arrival to Paneriai and had no option to say "no" (Arūnas Bubnys (2004).

<dd>This is sad, but the same could be probably said of many Germans who did not go to army to murder civilians but then had no choice. I think the times were difficult and we're really often too easily assigning blame. On the other hand thousands of people were murdered in Paneriai and this also requires some justice and we cannot pretend that nobody killed them. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 11:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it can indeed be said about many people involved in war. We cannot say "used the opportunities offered by the war to commit violent acts against those they perceived as enemies" as this wording would mean voluntary and enthuasiastic participation in killings, when in fact Burys' people volunteered for escorting Jews to Ghettos, not for killings in Paneriai. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegionas_6357.html" title="User:Legionas">Sigitas</a> 12:49, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly what I meant. The "thousands of deaths" seems to be an oversimplification of the rather complex situation and may easily lead to misinterpretations. I'm not sure how to rephrase it in a NPOV, yet meaningful way, however.

<dd>You are very quick. Thank you. Still I would like to ask some questions, Addhoc. Particular contributor Piotrus in one of the articles demonstrated examples of weasel words <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vilnius_University&amp;diff=85415120&amp;oldid=85114714" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vilnius_University&amp;diff=85415120&amp;oldid=85114714" rel="nofollow">weasel words</a>. looking in the light of this, I would like about this particular sentence in the article of AK: <i>the <b>nationalist[11]</b> and <b>extremist</b>[10][19] Lithuanian Vilnija organization claims that</i>. Please observe the ref of <i>nationalist</i> 11 is Polish Gazeta Wyborcza, while <i>extremist</i> also link to Gazeta Wyborcza also. According to Piotrus (evidence provided above) these particular words should be referenced in English. And second note near the word extremist contributor also placed and this EN source <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YB-ZwiBf5HgC&amp;pg=RA9-PA151&amp;lpg=RA9-PA151&amp;sig=sLsTZZC_fXMHVQkXjW2hws3mFYc" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=YB-ZwiBf5HgC&amp;pg=RA9-PA151&amp;lpg=RA9-PA151&amp;sig=sLsTZZC_fXMHVQkXjW2hws3mFYc" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> From this ref it does not clear is Vilnija is the same as mentioned in this article, or it is another organization (or association&#160;!), that context in this article and in provided ref. Some my question - is this EN source is credible in this context, which speaks about AK, not about 20-21st. politics and relations plus is this the same Vilnija? <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 17:25, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, I'd prefer we rephase it - it is important to note that Vilnija is not only nationalist, it represents extreme end of a political spectrum by being very anti-Polish (several refs I have refer to it as an organization promoting hate...), and thus has very low reliablity (like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin_Society_cb41.html" title="Stalin Society">Stalin Society</a> or, for examples of Polish organizations one should not really cite on encyklopedia, see <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Maryja_bc70.html" title="Radio Maryja">Radio Maryja</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Polish_Youth_c809.html" title="All-Polish Youth">All-Polish Youth</a>).

Or: if it is called Vilnija, exhibits behaviour consistent with all refs I could find, particularly ones used in the article, and if we use the Vilnija described by the source as 'extremist' to back up such claims in the article... the answer is: yes, I believe that if the source calls Vilnija extremist, and the article calls Vilnija extremist, and uses the source to reference that claim, than yes, both the article and the book are talking about the same Vilnija.

<dd>M.K, I find your defence of Vilnija on such thin 'legal' grounds rather discouraging. There are not many Vilnija's, and there is only one involved in Lithuanian politics as far as I know. If you have sources to show otherwise, please do, but the existence of a business incubator with the same name does not make it likely it is that organization which is talked about in the book about politics. Anyway, per peer review suggestions, I think we should split the Lithuanian section off this article and leave an uncontroversial summary here; then we can worry about the controversies and details in the subarticle.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 23:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did not committed any "legal" defense of Vilnija, if I did it would be in different format, and I am <b>not</b> wiling to do so; that I doing is raised question about source credibility in presented context. And Vilnija is not listed as any major "party", or very active in politics. Presented googling hits shows nice variety of Vilnijas. Your message - <i>with the same name does not make it likely it is that organization which is talked about in the book about politics</i> , indeed the same name does not make likely and I am talking about the same issue.

<p>I reverted this article to older versions for several reasons. First of all the splint suggestion was labeled for very short time, so other neutral contributors could not evaluate all sides of it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=95823001&amp;oldid=95822774" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=95823001&amp;oldid=95822774" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=95942068&amp;oldid=95938438" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=95942068&amp;oldid=95938438" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. The split was done without any further talk, which parts, facts and statements should go to separate article so this can lead to loss of facts and could present one person’s POV. Very important issue is additional requests for neutral contributors to evaluate problems of this particular state article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:GA/R#Armia_Krajowa" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:GA/R#Armia_Krajowa" rel="nofollow">[12]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAddhoc&amp;diff=95624437&amp;oldid=95310557" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAddhoc&amp;diff=95624437&amp;oldid=95310557" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> not to transferring existing problems of this article to other sub article.

<dd>First of all, it would be nice if you could ask in the future before reverting others; also, don't revert copyedit changes and such, this is not good style. Second, comments from peer review all advised splitting the section, feel free to submit the split of article to further reviews. Splitting this section was discussed weeks ago (see archive), there were no objections. After the split, this article contains no controversial information, which is a significant plus, the split of controversial info was not really relevant to this article (like the Vilnija issue).

<p>I think my opinion on this matter is neutral, because I honestly had never heard of this event in history until I read this article. If I understand the issue here correctly, Piotrus is trying to split the "Relations with Lithuanians" (RwL) section off into a separate article and M.K. objects? In my opinion, the RwL section should be it's own, separate article. The RwL subject is secondary to the main topic, which is about the Armia Krajowa. There appears to be more than enough secondary information out there to support a separate RwL article. All this article needs is a couple of paragraphs (cited, of course) that explain the Armia Krajowa's involvement with the RwL issue and that's it. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 03:54, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two of the best and most prominent members of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">WP:MILHIST</a>, Kirill and Cla68, proposed in the relevant peer-review that a seperate sub-article about "Relations with Lithuania" should be created, because the current section is too long. Per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a> this is probably the adequate solution. If a sub-article (sub-article of this article, but main article about the RwL) is created including the infos in the current section, no info will be deleted, and, therefore, I do not think that Piotrus should be reported for anything - he does not delete anything; he transfers encyclopedic material to the main article on the particular topic. If a main RwL can stand on its own, I think that what Kirill and Cla68 proposed is the best solution: a main RwL article and a summary of it in the relevant section of this article.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 09:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think I understand M.K.'s objection. He/she feels that there should be more information in this article specifically about Armia Krajowa's place in the "RwL" issue? Some mention of that in this article is fine, but it's ok for it to be somewhat short with a "further details" link to direct to a longer, more detailed article on the issue, which I believe is what Piotrus is trying to do, and is supported in doing this by myself and at least a couple of other editors, judging by other comments here on the discussion page. As long as the information (cited of course) is in a linked article I don't see a problem with doing it that way. I don't think that's a "POV fork", because there's apparently more to the issue than just Armia Krajowa's place in it, and there would still be some mention of it on this page. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 07:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>M.K, seeing what you're trying to do, I'd like to comment that I think that this section in the article should be shortened, not expanded. I believe it should contain only the outline information and all the details should go the the separate article, devoted to the subject. Also, we should try to avoid potentially incorrect, and certainly disputable statements like <i>"Such ethnic cleansing continued most of the Armia Krajowa`s operation time in Lithuania"</i> or similar. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 11:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

But, as there is a main article and it has 26 or so refs, it'd be best to make this section a 2-3 paragraph summary, leave the main article link in place, and STABILIZE the section and format it better or it WILL loose GA status eventually. This section has format issues, such as periods go before refs, not after.

<p>Since M.K. quotes this publication so extensivly, I recalled that we already discussed the reliability of this source at <a href="../../../g/l/i/Talk%7EGliti%C5%A1k%C4%97s_51bc.html" title="Talk:Glitiškės">Talk:Glitiškės</a> and did a new search, hoping to find (finally) a single English review. Unfortunatly, I failed; as far as I can tell all the reviews are either in Lithuanian (which I cannot understand - hope some editor can compile a list with summaries) and Polish, which I do understand. Of course Polish sources will be somewhat biased, but it is interesting to see that they are <i>all</i> condemning this publication with rather strong words (note: some references describe a documentary movie based on the book). The most telling and official is the statement on the official pages of Polish Ministry of Foreign Affrairs:</p>

Kavaliauskas, an advisor to the Lithuanian president, said: 'The film left a bad taste in my mouth... I am sorry it was shown... it was pointless... it was a political not historical film". The film is called 'not objective' and 'one-sided'. Motiekaitis, the spokesperson of the Lithuanian TV 3 which showed the film, promised that it will not be shown again and more careful screening will be put in place to avoid such controversies. Other critics of the film include Polish-Lithuanian historian J. Wołkanowski,Lithuanian journalist from "Veidas", A. Baciulis, and expert on Polish-Lithuanian pyblications, Jan Sienkiewicz, who reffered to Garšva as 'pseudohistorian'. Garšva is also reffered to as 'known for his anti-Polish sentiments'.</li>

<p>Dear Piotrus, care to tell why Lithuanian sources are wrong, and English are good? I know, you have found one "English" book written by Polish author, that uses extensive weasel language and adjectives (exactly or even more than Garšva does). This author even admits his intention on the back cover - we find out that he was living there, at the times as it did happen. You might check reviews of hat book at amazon.com, to understand what I'm talking about. Somehow you do not find it to be contraversial and POV'ed. Isn't this so, only because it does support your POV? This makes me think, that everything you do not like is going to labeled as POV or and authors as "extremists".</p>
<p>In my opinion - denial is not a way to reach compromise, and I was hoping, that moving all the subject to separate article could help. I know that AK fighters are regarded as heroes in Poland, and i do agree with that, that's why separate article was good. Although heroism of Warszawa uprisal does not give any right to deny crimes in other regions (like Lithuania and Belarus).</p>
<p>Ah, and last thing - if historian states his opinion to a newspaper, it does not change decision of court -you are confronting things of completely different weight.<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokyz_fe40.html" title="User:Lokyz">Lokyz</a> 12:04, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you'd care to share <i>which</i> book you have read, it would be quite useful in allowing me to reply to this general statement. I am not aware of any <i>AK crimes in Belarus</i>, perhaps you should expand on that. I value average Lithuanian sources as much as Polish, but in such controversial cases prefer English academic ones, when I can get it. As for national sources, I find it difficult to evaluate them when the author is virtually unknown abroad; unfortunatly this is the case with authors M.K. uses - with the notable exception of K. Gasrva who is apparently <i>notorius</i> enough to get an <i>extremist</i> label in at least one English academic publication, which does not feel me with the desire to threat anything he contributes to as <i>reliable</i> (per <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Extremist_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Extremist_sources</a>). Also, it would be interesting to learn who published the books and so on. From various references I could find none was a good review of the dispute sources; and statements by people like an advisor to Lithuanian president that he is sorry a film was aired again don't make me feel like those publications even represent mainstram Lithuanian research. And you say that the case has concluded - but I found at least one source to the contrary. Which is right? I'd expect that a declaration that AK committed genocide would be widely discussed in both Polish and English media - but they are silent, and it's only mr. Gasrva who seems to be writing about it...

<dd>I did read it - it does not say that non-English books are POV'ed by default.

<dd>Although it is one of the most boring things in Wikipedia IMO, I checked the differences in dispute, per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AYannismarou&amp;diff=100311395&amp;oldid=100302327" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AYannismarou&amp;diff=100311395&amp;oldid=100302327" rel="nofollow">M.K.'s kind request</a>. I don't want to go into an evaluation of the conflicting Polish-Lithuanian comments, and I do not want to decided on who has the historical truth with him! In any case, I think that there is a chance to avoid endless edit wars here, if you try to implement three basic principles in the relevant section:
<ol>
<li>Do not overexpand the RwL section, and respect rules of <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>. Any addition or rephrasing of this section should respect this rule, so as RwL section to remain concise.</li>
<li>If you decide that, despite point 1, a new assessment is absolutely necessary to be added in this section, then use verifiable sources. A Polish or Lithuanian source is not enough for me. In order a regarded as Pro-Polish or Pro-Lithuanian addition to stand in the section, a third party source (preferable english) should be needed. Clarification: Not a Polish or Lithuanian source translated in English! No! Not a book of a Pole or Lithuanian writer in English! No! No!! No!!! A third party source (Not Polish! Not Lithuanian!) preferably written in English (although German or French would also be fine IMO).</li>
<li>Communicate with the <i>altera pars</i>. Assume good faith, and, if you think that a new addition of yours is going to annoy another editor of the article, do not hesitate to communicate with him. You may reach a wording satifying for both parties; you may reach a compromise!</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Now, let's be more specific. I think the main problem here was two additions by M.K.:
<ol>
<li>"In 1943-1944, Armia Krajowa collaborating with Nazis as well".</li>
<li>"During this period hundreds of Lithuanian policemen, teachers, farmers and other civilians were killed,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> especially were damaged Lithuanian schools, which activities were paralyzed.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>"</li>
<li>"On 1993 Lithuanian Government established commission pronounced conclusions that Armia Krajowa threatened to Lithuania’s territorial integrity,<sup id="_ref-KG_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KG" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Voruta_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Voruta" title="">[4]</a></sup> made <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimes_against_humanity.html" title="Crimes against humanity">crimes against humanity</a>,<sup id="_ref-KG_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KG" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Voruta_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Voruta" title="">[4]</a></sup> killed civilians,<sup id="_ref-KG_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KG" title="">[3]</a></sup> mostly Lithuanians.<sup id="_ref-KG_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KG" title="">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> On 1999 the Prosecutor’s Office of Republic of Lithuania after investigation concluded that Armia Krajowa made <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a><sup id="_ref-Voruta_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Voruta" title="">[4]</a></sup> of Lithuanian people, hoping to reoccupy <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_Region_19ad.html" title="Vilnius Region">Vilnius Region</a>.<sup id="_ref-Voruta_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Voruta" title="">[4]</a></sup>"</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>M.K. regards that these addition do not violate Point 1 of mine, and per Point 2 should be added. He did not implement Point 3 trying to find a compromise with the <i>altera pars</i>. I'm going to comment in detail these two additions:<br /></dd>
<dd><b>Addition no 1</b>. I agree that five words (<i>collaborating with Nazis as well</i>) do not violate Point 1. The problem is: is this assessment accurate? Do we have a third party source substantiating and verifying that AK co-operated (we speak for an official co-operation here! Not some actions of AK that may have served Nazi's interests! Let's be careful here!) with the Nazis. If M.K. can provide such a source (and not a just a Lithuanian one) I would accept this addition, but I would aslo give the right to the <i>altera pars</i> to contradict this assessment with third pary's sources again, although we should have again in mind <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>. Let's say that both M.K. and Piotrus provide third party sources -the one in order to substantiate his allegations agains AK; the other to contradict these assertions. A compromise wording would be the following (don't take it word by word as a ready form to add! - It is just an crude example):"In 1943-1944, Armia Krajowa is said to have collaborated with Nazis as well, (cite third party verifiable source) although these allegations are disputed (cite third party verifiable source)."<br /></dd>
<dd><b>Addition no 2</b>. Similar commentes with Addition No 2. I must underscore here that <b>verifiable third party sources should be demanded for both sides here - not only for the Lithuanian one!</b>! I say that, because in this assessment <i>"In response, Lithuanian police, who had already murdered hundreds of Polish civilians since 1941</i>, I see as a source a Tadeusz Piotrowski who is a Pole (from Wrocław in Lower Silesia!). But his book is in English?! And what?!! The fact that his book is in English does not make it a third party verifiable source! Neither makes his assertion undisputable. Third party verifiable source also needed here IMO.<br /></dd>
<dd><b>Addition no 3</b>. In this case M.K. exposes undisputable facts. I have no reason to ask third party sources, because I do believe that these were the decisions of the Lithuanian governement. Nevertheless, in this case I have to give the right to the <i>altera pars</i> (It's you Piotrus!) to respond, and say what was the reaction of the Polish government to these allegations against AK. Let's say that both these additions are accepted. Are we OK? No! Because we forgot Point 1!!! Where is <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>?! <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a> in the mist of the additions!! So, I just think: should you really overexpand here, and tell what are the accusations in detail of the Lithuanian government and the response in detail of the Polish government? Why don't you agree on a POV concise wording - maybe a very brief presentation (in one sentence) of Lithuanian government's allegations, and their denial by the Polish government (in one sentence again or combined in the same sentence)? And leave all the further details for the RwL sub-article?</dd>
<dd>So, my final conclusions:
<ul>
<li>Any additions should not harm <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>.</li>
<li>Any pro-Polish or pro-Lithuanian assertion, which will remain there, should be verified by a third party verifiable source. A Polish or a Lithuanian source translated in English or a book written in English by a Pole or a Lithuanian writer is not a third party verifiable source! <i>Assertions <b>of both sides</b> that do not fulfil this criterion should be omitted.</i></li>
<li>I think my three points above are a good basis for reaching a compromise here.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Thank you, Yannismarou, for making the comments; I will try very try to answer to them today at night&#160;:). But very technical question:</dd>

<dd>Lets drop in this case text removal, and note that pictures were added separately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=100301240&amp;oldid=100301107" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=100301240&amp;oldid=100301107" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, but they were removed as well for several times without any explanation, despite the urge to restore them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AArmia_Krajowa&amp;diff=100037962&amp;oldid=100031188" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AArmia_Krajowa&amp;diff=100037962&amp;oldid=100031188" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. So how do you see this situation then <b>historical</b> value pictures were deliberately removed several times without any reason, by Piotrus and other Polish contributors? <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 10:51, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>These are very strong images, and they help me understand the sensitivity of the whole issue for both sides. I tried to find similar examples of such images in other articles. And I did found in a Greek-Turkish related article: [[Image:He-smyrna-vict-line.jpg]] in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_Smyrna_c397.html" title="Great Fire of Smyrna">Great Fire of Smyrna</a>. I think that their use is legitimate, because they do illustrate history. But they also incite passions, and, therefore, I wouldn't use them, so as not to provoke the <i>altera pars</i>. Nevertheless, if I was a co-editor of this article, and you wanted to add these picture, I would not impede you, because it is your right to do it, despite my disagreement. But under one term: I would demand you to verify the accuracy of these pictures, in a way that will convince me that the persons depicted are really victims of AK. Who took these pictures? Are they published only in Armija Krajova Lietuvoje? Exact date and year they were taken? Are they exposed somewhere? Have they p[ossibly been a subject of controversy? As you had initially added the pictures, the caption provided insufficient information (the caption of the photo I used as an example also provides insufficient information). With better captions and a solid verification of their content, I would definitely accept them as part of the article.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 12:03, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yannismarou, thank you very much for taking time to address this issue in such a detailed and constructive manner. I completly agree with what you wrote. Now, to address some specific details: 1) &amp; 2) the issue of cooperation between AK and Germans is already addressed in a well referenced and more relevant section - check second para of 'Relations with the Soviets' (refs are primarily based on work by Tadeusz Piotrowski, a sociologist and historian at University of New Hampshire <a href="http://www.unhm.unh.edu/faculty.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unhm.unh.edu/faculty.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and not the Polish lexicographer - <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadeusz_Piotrowski_e788.html" title="Tadeusz Piotrowski">Tadeusz Piotrowski</a> is a disambig, btw). As for 3), I disagree that the sources are reliable. One (Kazimieras Garšva. Armija krajova ir Vietinė rinktinė Lietuvoje (Armia Krajowa and Local Detachment in Lithuania). XXI amžius, No.61 (1264), 18 August 2004) is a newspaper article by a very unreliable author (see <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazimieras_Gar%C5%A1va_0513.html" title="Kazimieras Garšva">Kazimieras Garšva</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnija.html" title="Vilnija">Vilnija</a>) in a newspaper (XXI amžius) that the user who added it admitted <i>XXI amzius has weakest journalists and I will avoid using its publications when possible.</i> (see <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmia_Krajowa_Archive_1_4ddd.html" title="Talk:Armia Krajowa/Archive 1">Talk:Armia_Krajowa/Archive_1</a>, post from 22:29, 6 June 2006). Then we have another newspaper article (<a href="../../../v/o/r/Voruta_%28newspaper%29.html" title="Voruta (newspaper)">Voruta</a>). Kodėl negalima sakyti tiesos apie Armiją krajovą? 2005) of unknown author, and last but not least, another Garsva's work (A. Bubnys, K. Garšva, E. Gečiauskas, J. Lebionka, J. Saudargienė, R. Zizas (editors). Armija Krajova Lietuvoje. Vilnius-Kaunas, 1995 p.3) which as was discussed here, on his page and in several other places was shown to be very controversial to say the least (the movie based on it was criticized by <i>both</i> Polish and Lithuanian governents, and the publication itself had many negative reviews in Polish press (per links above, I am unaware of any English and despite my requests no Lithuanian ones were provided)). Further, most of thos revelations seem to be contradicted by other sources we have (see my post above from 16:42, 13 January 2007 - and look at chronology <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_relations_during_the_World_War_II_6bfd.html#Postwar_developments" title="Polish-Lithuanian relations during the World War II">here</a> - in 1999 AK is supposedly declared 'genocidal', a 2001 article notes the investigation is ongoing and in 2004 L. government allows AK veterans to use the AK name and encourages reconciliation between AK and L. veterans? Something doesn't add up, wouldn't you agree? And that something is, not suprisingly, Garsva and Vilnija claims). Summarizing, I am not convinced that Lithuanian government presently supports such claims; it seems to me that occasionaly <i>in the past</i> such claims were made by lower officials, but they were politically motivated (as was admitted by <a href="../../../a/r/%C5%AB/Ar%C5%ABnas_Bubnys_96b4.html" title="Arūnas Bubnys">Arūnas Bubnys</a>, a respected Lithuanian historian asked about them) - as such they fail <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>. As for 4) images, they are sourced to the controversial <i>Armija Krajova Lietuvoje</i> work. For both the reasons of disputed reliability and because this section should not be too long, those images don't belong here (please note the images were not removed from <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_relations_during_the_World_War_II_6bfd.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian relations during the World War II">Polish-Lithuanian relations during the World War II</a>). Lastly, please note that per WP:NPOV#Undue_weight if we want to add images of casualties, why not add the much more numerous Polish casualties in the Vilnius region? Alas, I don't insist on adding [[Image:Lithuania Ponary Monument.jpg|such images here], instead I believe that uncontrovesial image of local AK commander is a much better picture for that section.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 21:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Sorry, Yannismarou, I would not finish to answer to your questions, as I promised, my paper work killed all my free time. Will try to do so in upcoming days. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 00:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry for long delay Yannismarou, various disputes regarding contributors and articles prevented smooth discussion in this particular field. You raised points taken into account. But the problem still exists – particular AK activity in the Lithuania is limited described in English sources. Let’s begin from the first mark 1): collaboration. Actually the Poles themselves do not deny the fact that collaboration between AK and Germans/Soviets was established. But Piotrus “argument” is that collaboration has “more relevant section”. By such logic many statements could be placed under “more relevant section”. Related issues with Lithuania should be mentioned in proper part and not somewhere else, especially then in summary mentions one side cooperation but keeps silent about another. Lithuanian multiply sources mentions AK`s collaboration and Polish too. So there is a problem? Nevertheless I keen to look for some German sources, because they also investigate collaboration question. Yannismarou, you could help in this field too. 2) Second point, I can not present for it a third party source now, because it almost direct quotations form the Lithuanian source. And I am not familiar that any (including Polish) scholars, who would interested in Lithuanian schools in particular context (while source presents comprehensive study about this issue). But worth to keep looking and will do 3) While yes this presented facts from 1993 Commission report (which was not denounced till present day; despite Piotrus attempt to discredit source using only his speculations). As you say that this particular section is too wide, lets summaries – for example: government`s established commission concluded that AK committed crimes against humanity in Lithuania. Because now we have section: <i>Its activities in Lithuania have been investigated by a special Lithuanian government commission in 1993</i>. So what? Does reader not deserve to be informed, at least briefly, main concluding points? Because now it is empty words. Second distorted summary element: <i>Lithuanian police, who had already murdered hundreds of Polish civilians since 1941,</i> Is it balanced? 1941? While AK started major it activities in 1943 in Lithuania. Or maybe we also should place a note about Polish bad deeds from 1920? Another note, the first paragraph is too wide. It can be summarized even more to consume a space for more important elements. Images. Some voices say that my presented pictures, which there were disruptively removed by Polish contributors, somehow wrong, so we going to remove them and from Holocaust related articles, because there they are even more dramatic. And now in article presented picture is quite controversial, especially with such “remarks” as <i>(now Vilnius).</i> And one more note if we look from the presented rules, section strongest remarks are made with non third party sources. Btw, Yannismarou, do you think that removal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=100313336&amp;oldid=100312307" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=100313336&amp;oldid=100312307" rel="nofollow">this sign was appropriate</a>&#160;? <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 20:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your points:<br />
1) What I believe is that the relevant section should be concise; and this stands for both sides. Now, I cannot go into the wording of each sentence. I don't have the time neither the courage! But I do believe that both sides shouldn't overexpand here, and treat in detail the relevant issues in PLR article. I could help in order to find a content and wording satisfying both sides, if you all agree on that. About your additions I expressed myself above, although this was weeks ago, and I have almost forgotten me. If you could tell me particularly that x,v, and c sentences of the current section are my problem and I would prefer this wording, and that I would like to see in the section a,b, and c content additions or changes, and if I had specific responses of Piotrus on these sentences and additions, I could make more concrete proposals. If I can help about the sources: Honestly, I can't! For three reasons: A) I have limited free time for Wikipedia during this period, B) Although in German I have the Kleines Sprachdiplom, I have years to practice them, and I have almost forgotten them! C) I'm also involved in Greek-related conflicts (e.g. the Pontic Greek Genocide issue), I'm righting my own articles (4 of them are right now pending!), and I have also to conduct research for these issues as well. I could express my opinion for the conclusions of your research and Piotrus', but conduct my own research on this article is almost impossible for me right now.<br />
2) Yes, it is worth looking, if you want to strengthen your arguments.<br />
3) "government`s established commission concluded that AK committed crimes against humanity in Lithuania." I would be fine with that. But we need another sentence after this on, presenting Poland's response. Thus, IMO something like that would be fine: "Lithuanian government's established commission concluded that AK committed crimes against humanity in Lithuania during WW II. Nevertheless, Polish governement rejected the commission's conclusions arguing that ... " Piotrus says "I am not convinced that Lithuanian government presently supports such claims; it seems to me that occasionaly in the past such claims were made by lower officials, but they were politically motivated (as was admitted by Arūnas Bubnys, a respected Lithuanian historian asked about them)". Can you provide sources (news reports etc.) verifying that the Lithuanian government endorsed and endorses these commissions and their findings? I think this should not be tough.<br />
4) About the POV tag: Not the whole article is disputed; only a specific section. But if you manage to settle your differences the tag in this section will have no reason to be there! Otherwise, you can add it; Lisy will remove it; then you'll readd, and you will be playing hide-and-seek, until one of you violates the 3R rule! Another solution is to lock the article until you settle your differences. Me or somebody else will put an ugly padlock at the top of the article, and we'll wait until issues are settled! Anyway ... About the particular removal: IMO the POV-tag should not be removed but placed under the relevant section; but IMO as well this issue should have been already settled in order not to need POV tags.<br />
5) About the photo, I expressed myself. But Piotrus is right when he says that these pictures are exposed in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_relations_during_the_World_War_II_6bfd.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian relations during the World War II">Polish-Lithuanian relations during the World War II</a>, which is after all an article with a broader topic, and, theoritically, more readers. If you add the photo, then the Poles will ask the addition of the photo depicting a "Monument commemorating Poles murdered in Paneriai massacre, Paneriai, Vilnius, Lithuania". Would you be fine with that? From one side the one photo, and from the other side the other photo?<br />
I don't know if I am constructive here. The problem is that whatever I may or may not say, you will live with this article, and you must find a way to settle the differences. Whatever comments or efforts I may do, if there is no ground or will for a solution satisfying both sides, any "third party involvement" will be pointless. The failure of such initiatives is unfortunately the rule in Wikipedia. And then we have RfCs against users, mediators, ArbComs etc. etc. etc.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 19:03, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right saying that it is time too see some actual suggestions. As I am convinced that the section is not NPOV I re added tag and also think solution from this situation is to go step by step discussion of paragraph sections. Lets start from the first part:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Relations between Lithuanians and Poles were strained already during most of the interwar period but during the war the previous conflicts escalated. Although Lithuanian and Polish resistance movements had in principle the same enemies - Nazi Germany and Soviet Union - they never became allies during the war. The main obstacle in forming an alliance was a territorial dispute centering on Vilnius. Only in 1944-1945, after the Soviet re-occupation, did Lithuanian and Polish resistance start cooperating in the fight against Soviet occupants.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe section is too big, and can be summarized further in oder to have more space for other issues. My initial suggestion of this part is:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Relations between Lithuanians and Poles were strained during the interwar period, and they escalated further during the war.The main obstacle was a territorial dispute centering on Lithuanian capital Vilnius.

<dd>While I agree it can be further shortened, I have two objections: reffering to Vilnius as 'Lithuanian capital' in that time is highly POVed; for Poles it was the capital of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilno_Voivodeship_1e28.html" title="Wilno Voivodeship">their voivodeship</a> and we can just as well refer to it as 'dispute centered on Polish voivodship capital'.

<p>"in principle the same enemies - Nazi Germany and Soviet Union" - <i>in principle</i> 1941-1944 Lithuania was a German ally and Poland was a British ally, Lithuanian police fought Polish underground, Lithuanian soldiers killed tens of thousands Jews and Poles. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 13:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was no Lithuanian police, because there was no Lithuanian state.

Ergo Lithuania was not fighting on either side. The fact that Lithuanians did participate in those structures is regrettable and shameful, although it does not throw shadow on Lithuanian state as such. As for the statement about Lithuanian soldiers killing Jews - you are misled again - at the time no official army of Lithuania existed - contraversial LAF, colaborationist "Lithuanian" police and other structures which included former officer and soldiers of Lithuanian army, were not representing Lithuanian state.</dd>
<dd>The only <i>Local detachment</i> that never gave oath to Hitler did not participate in any mass killings.</dd>
