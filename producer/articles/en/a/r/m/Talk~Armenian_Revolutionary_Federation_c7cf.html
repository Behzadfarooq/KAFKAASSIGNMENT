<p>For an organization established in Russia, by the way Tiflis in 1892 was within Russian boarders, there is no information about the activities until the establishment of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Republic_of_Armenia_cf42.html" title="Democratic Republic of Armenia">Democratic Republic of Armenia</a>.

<p>As far as I can tell with my limited knowledge, the article meats all GA criterias. The only one I can not be sure of, is whether it covers all important aspects and is completely neutral and unbiased. To ensure that, I recommend a peer review.</p>

It wasn't even me who wrote about it or added the source...it was there and sourced when I first read the article.

<p>Stop spreading edit wars to this article. The CIA is as credible as it gets and that version will be the one included. The CIA itself works on intelligence who multiple sources so what it says is most probably the truth. Why else would the population be 90% Armenian at the time yet be under Azeri control? It was handed, stop these edit wars when the issue has been talked over a thousand times in the NKR article. And that addition by Dacy was nothign but vandalism to purposely de-stabilize the article.

<p>My reference goes to Armenian scholar. It is well-known fact - I mean terrorist activity of ARF - you can find it in works of other Armenian scholars, for example, G.Libaridian. So, don't throw accusation. I remain civil.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 02:52, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is about the party, not the view of an Armenian that is all of a sudden accepted as scholar because it suits Azeri POV. I guess all those other people against Azeri POV are not notable at all. I guess the CIA are mindless idiots who gather false intelligence. I have already stated that they possibly participated in assassinations, I have mentioned that there are claims of ties to JCAG (a known guerrilla organ operating vis-a-vis of ASALA). Let the reader judge for himself if these are acts of terrorism. We do not need to feed them what some scholar thinks of its actions as. You should very well know the saying: "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter".

<p>For you every scholar is idiot, if it does no match your POV. I told you it is not one scholar - several. And what Papazian is actually saying is that about ARF revolutionary activity - let's exactly a reader judge - what was it - freedom fight or terrorism. I give facts - well-known facts--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 03:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It takes a little satisfaction for some POV pushers to use Papazian to support a point. You have no knowledge of what you are talking about so it is best for you to come clean and stop this revert war. In the 30s, a war of world has engaged between the Dashnaks and Armenian bolshevists. Papazian work from the first pages makes it clear on the purpouses of the work itself. While in the 30s Armenian intellectuals in the West have started publishing pressures requesting the intervention of the West and the revival of the possible reinsertion of Armenia back on the table for a possible liberation and respect of the allied promesses after the war. (See Turkey reference to Montreux convention and its blockage to it) As a result Bolshevic Armenians with co-authoring gimmiks have published works having attacked the ARF and claiming Bolshevism to be the only way Armenia has been liberated.</p>
<p>On p. 55, this is what Papazian writes.</p>
<p>"The patent criticism leveled by the Dashnagtzoutune at the present Soviet Armenia is that, it is not independent, and it is a communistic and not a national government. These criticisms have no ground to stand on. The Dashnags themselves, while they were at the helm, tried to place Armenia under the protection of some great Power -- the United States for one -- through the League of Nations.

<p>So stop edit warring; and you are hardly convincing in your pretention that this is about removing sources, as Papazian work is known and recorded to be a bolshevic propaganda, the worst way the Bolshevics have found to vilify in the 30s. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 07:15, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't claim to know anything about the ARF and Armenian history beyond what I read in this article, but I would still like to make a few comments:</p>
<p>Though I am really impressed by the work that has been done on this article, I am going to have to side with Dacy69 to a certain extent here. There are still some POV issues in this article, as it is pro-ARF and pro-Armenian. And if there are notable sources calling the ARF terrorists then that should be mentionened in the article, even if they are only propaganda or whatever, that way the reader can in fact decide whether they are in fact freedom fighters or terrorists. Again, I don't claim to know whether or not these sources are in fact notable, but if they are their view should be mentioned per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>: "NPOV says that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by a verifiable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each."--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 16:41, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Carabinieri, aside from POV issues, Dacy69 intrusion has nothing to do with this. I don’t care about ARF, like all other political affiliations like the Hinshaks or Ramgavars. What I can comment on, is that Dacy69 has copypasted the stuff he found from the web, when he didn’t even know the material he has pasted. If he had the book written by Papazian, it would be even worst, because he would have quoted en connaissance de cause, which would mean that he would have used a bogus material knowingly. The work in question has not been criticised in a positive way by the academia in the time. Not only among Armenians. George F. Gracey critic of the work is one such example (published in International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1931-1939) Vol. 14, No. 4 (Jul., 1935), pp. 584-586).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Coming to the terrorist word, the modern concept of terrorist/terrorism was used first in 1947. A work published in 1934 can not support the usage of a word, when the modern notion did not exist. Beside, like I have said, Dacy69 has no knowledge of the ARF, his purposes here is simply introducing such bogus sources he fished from dubious sites. If you pay attention to the quotation from the work I have provided. The work claims that an Independent Armenia would not have been free, while a Soviet Armenian IS free. Without knowing the Armenian situation of the 30s, one can not post such a quote there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here a historic for you. In the 30s, Armenian intellectuals highly supported by the ARF have brought back “The republic of Armenia” to be discussed. It was very harshly answered by Bolshevic Armenians in the press.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this context, Papazian write in that work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The patent criticism leveled by the Dashnagtzoutune at the present Soviet Armenia is that, it is not independent, and it is a communistic and not a national government. These criticisms have no ground to stand on. The Dashnags themselves, while they were at the helm, tried to place Armenia under the protection of some great Power -- the United States for one -- through the League of Nations. The mandate of any great Power, if it had materialized, would have meant a limitation of Armenian independence.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Armenia has now secured its political existence, not by accepting the mandate of a great Power, but by joining hands, as one of the federated republics, with the great commonwealth of nations known as the Soviet Union.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It failed, at the end of the 30s, with the threats of the World war, the negotiations stopped, on such threats; Armenians have turned from the request for an independent Armenia, to the request on Western Armenia which was since the Treaty of Lausanne attached to Turkey. Armenia requested to the center government of the URSS for a representation, Georgia jumped in too. It was waited until 1945, when the world war ended, and the claim was officially submitted and rejected on May 30, 1953 (see: A Calendar of Soviet Treaties, 1917-1957 by Robert M. Slusser, Jan F. Triska; Stanford University Press, 1959 p. 298) on the basis of the Montreux convention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a long history of word wars, between two Armenian factions in the press, which ended up in the 50s, and in a lesser extend in the 60s. Papazian was a Bolshevic Armenian, Darounian himself engaged on such war himself with his works. Yeh, the famous author who also accused members of the US government during WII with collaboration with the NAZI.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I have engaged in Armeno/Azeri historic stuff there, I can confirm that my knowledge of Western Armenian in comparaison to Eastern Armenians is on the ratio of about 5:1, while Dacy obvious has very little knowledge of Eastern Armenians, and NO knowledge of Western Armenians.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The edits now about Nagorno Karabakh, this is also one other example. Do you side with Dacy there too? In all fairness, how am I supposed to assume good faith there? Check the diff. This article is about the ARF, and things are written this in mind. The section of Nagorno-Karabakh is not about the history of NK, when it was established, but rather the role of the ARF in connection to the NK. Which means, that even in the NK, the subject is the ARF. So OBVIOUSLY, the article has to start with the ARF xyz in NK. But Azeri users, concerned with every single Armenian related article, would be using this article too with such an edit on the purposes of giving this impression: “Remember it was established in the Azerbaijan SSR” and this PASSING before the business that the ARF had to do in NK. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, I have that paper you cite.</p>
<p>You are for sure distorting it. It only takes to post the paragraph preceding and the one following the one you have pasted, to see that my interpretation is the correct one.</p>
<p><i><b>Within the Soviet Union, a semi-autonomous Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ASSR was created on onesixth of the territory of historic Armenia. With time, the ASSR developed into the most homogeneous of all the Soviet republics. With the city of Yerevan emerging as the Armenians’ “cultural center of national identity,” ASSR leaders claimed to speak for the “authentic homeland” and the Armenian people as a whole. This claim was not readily accepted by segments of the diaspora, especially by Dashnaks who rejected the Soviet Armenian regime. Yet even the Dashnaks had to accept the fact that Soviet Armenia was a homeland base, however truncated, and had to adjust themselves to Moscow’s domination. The exiled Dashnaks also faced the strong desire of other genocide survivors to keep the Armenian people unified despite their divisions and dispersion. Soviet propaganda manipulated the ASSR, as the source of Armenian national pride and peoplehood, in mobilizing diasporic financial assistance. Recognizing that Armenian independence was a distant dream while diasporic life would be long lasting, diaspora activists shifted to an emphasis on identity retention focusing primarily on the memory of the genocide ‘over-here’ in the diaspora at the expense of national aspirations ‘over-there’ in the ASSR. Assimilation and the fading memory of the genocide were seen as the “white massacre,” while “knowing Armenian and some rudimentary facts about Armenian history became the new license to diasporic leadership.”</b></i></p>
<p><i>By the late 1970s, the diaspora and Soviet Armenia achieved a modus Vivendi in their relations. With communism in the ASSR becoming more and more tolerable to the diaspora in part because after 1965, the Soviets allowed commemorations of the genocide, and with a new generation of diasporic Armenians demanding greater militancy in the struggle for genocide recognition, the Dashnaks shelved their anti-Soviet orientation and entered a new phase in their national crusade. Armenian terrorism primarily against Turkish targets won international attention for their cause and helped to rally the diaspora to demand international recognition of the genocide, albeit mostly via diplomatic efforts. One scholar notes that “the true audience of Armenian terrorism was not Turkey and its NATO allies but the Armenian Diaspora, whose fraying culture is constituted to a remarkable degree by old stories.”</i></p>
<p><i><b>In the two largest Western centers of Armenian diaspora—the United States more than a million and France roughly 500,000—activists focused their efforts on keeping and spreading the memory of the genocide, in the face of Turkey’s refusal to take responsibility for the atrocities or even to admit they ever happened. Because 80 percent of diasporic Armenians were descendants of genocide survivors, the memory of this atrocity became the most important vehicle with which to trigger a national identity dynamic. The Armenian Church also provided an institutional structure for group cohesiveness and ethnic mobilization. Tens of millions of dollars were raised to sustain Armenian day schools, churches, and other institutions in their efforts to nourish a viable diaspora. Millions were also channelled to family members in the ASSR, especially during the 1988 Armenian earthquake.</b></i></p>
<p>The CAUSE in question has nothing to do with terrorism. The authors note that the terrorist activities gave an international coverage of the Dashnak backed diaspora’s cause. Nowhere in this article by its entirety, does it say ANYWHERE that the Dashnaks committed acts of terrorism. The ASALA committed such acts, and those acts did have a huge media attention, in that the Armenian causes was then known in the press. I am sure that you are enough intelligent to know that it has nothing to do with what you are alluding to. The article itself is a very good text to read, and I agree with the authors 100%, an article which is very well researched. ALSO, the authors are also VERY SYMPATHIC to the Dashnaks, and you should be very well aware of it since you viewed yourself the text in question. Now if please you could stop distorting and stop wasting my time with this. It will be fine. Dashnak has nothing to do with ASALA. The Dashnaks even harshly slandered the ASALA, even with various memorandums. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 21:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Fadix, I am glad you recited the paragraph I brought above, including the much argued relation of the sentence about Dashnaks to rest of the text, which quite fits the context of terrorism. About your comment, the cause and activity are two different things. For instance, Nazi's cause was the national socialism, while their deed was the World War II and the Holocaust. Yet another reference, more direct and from Armenian source:
<dl>
<dd><i>President of Armenia L.Ter-Petrossian suspended the activities of the "Dashnaktsutyun", having accused it of maintaining within this Party a <b>secret terrorist service</b> "DRO", involved in international drug business and illegal economic activities</i> (Suren Manukian, "Республика Армения: органы власти, хроника событий, политические организации, биографии", Moscow, Panorama, 2000, p. 95)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Besides this many moderate Diaspora Armenians do admit that ARF has rather radical and terrorist agenda. Not to mention that leading members of ASALA were members of ARF. If you really have doubts about this one, I would suggest you to read the famous book by brother of Monte Melkonian.

Aliev was accused of drug trafiking, a leader of a mafia group, the party which established the first Azerbaijan republic has a militia unite called the "Savage Division," its members had a close role in the establishement of the first nationalistic Azeri SRR government. They all have a much worst recorded history than the ARF which has an established long history. Fitting the context of terrorism is an interpretation. The term "terrorism" has already been discussed on various articles like in regards to the PKK and there is an overal concensus on its uses in articles.

The article in detail covers the cause in question, which was about awaken the Armenian causes and get media attention. This media attention was obtained by the terrorist acts commited by the ASALA. Say that someone is on a waiting list for treatment, and that the person before him get killed, the killing helped the one following to get the treatment more quickly, it doesn't mean he killed the other guy.

<p>Atabek, you must be pretty damn gullible or just plain blind to believe the horse manure that Dashnak members were actually conspiring to kill members of the Ter-Petrosyan cabinet in 1994. Ter-Petrosyan's government was wallowing with low public opinion ratings and they knew that ANM members were going to be unseated by the Dashnaks. Not even Libaridian, the guy who presented the evidence against them, believed they were guilty. It was obviously to prevent them from gaining the seats and you're honestly using nonsense as proof that the ARF has connections to terrorism? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 00:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well Suren Manukyan is wrong.

Accusations of biases is clearly against assume good faith, but much like the slanders I have recieved fro your compatriotes I won't lower myself to some levels by reporting members just to shut them. Papazian was a known adherent to Bolshevism, the quote I have provided was one example, from the cover to cover allusions on how Bolshevism has liberated Armenia and how a real democratic Armenia would not have been free. But again, do push your accusations of biases and my alleged protecting of the "Dashnaks." Neither had I any interest to even participate in this article nor such group involved articles, which are too much ideological driven for my rational mind. But that you have here to brought an edit war and dragged a member (Ferdayee) who was minding his own business creating an article, into a revert war and worthed his first ever block, say much of your purpouses on jumping in, in an articles which subject you totally ignore about.

<dd>First of all, nothing can be restored because of you and I would like to congratulate you on successfully stopping a good article like this one. And did you not read the essay Fadix composed so you at least get some info on modern Armenian history (which you obviously lack). What does it matter that it was published in Boston?

<p>Below are the statements from Vahan Hovanesyan, ARF member and Deputy Speaker of Armenian parliament, which not only reveal the terrorist but also plainly fascistic and intolerant nature of this leading ARF politician. Quotes are from interview of Vahan Hovanesyan to Armenian Russian-language newspaper "Novoye Vremya", published on March 16, 2004:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>- "I am proud that in the Karabakh war we killed 25,000 Azeris and only 5,000 Armenians were killed"</dd>
<dd>- "I am proud that in 1915 my people resisted the Turks and Kurds, who were carrying out genocide, and while dying took such a big number of enemies with them that till today they say that representatives of their peoples were also killed."</dd>
<dd>- "I am proud of those Dashnak teams which in 1918 in Baku did not let another genocide be carried out." (pride of Dashnak participation in March massacres in Baku, when 12,000 Azeris were slaughtered).</dd>
<dd>- "if we do not complain about the behaviour of Azeris, ordinary people or the elite, in that case there are no factors to prevent Karabakh being within Azerbaijan"</dd>

<p>Is this all you could provide? Full text of the interview? Actually, Its Baku today translation, I want to see the original of that, and don’t ask us to check, it is actually to you to post it.</p>
<p>Here is why I doubt the translation is accurate.</p>
<p>"I am proud that in the Karabakh war we killed 25,000 Azeris and only 5,000 Armenians were killed"</p>
<p>If he has used the qualifier “we” in one side, and no they on the other, there is a logical fluency problem.</p>
<p>Either it was:</p>
<p>"I am proud that in the Karabakh war we killed 25,000 Azeris and they have killed only 5,000 Armenians."</p>
<p>Or it was:</p>
<p>"I am proud that in the Karabakh war 25,000 Azeris were killed and only 5,000 Armenians were killed."</p>
<p>Or, it could have been.</p>
<p>"I am happy that in the Karabakh war 25,000 Azeris were killed and only 5,000 Armenians were killed."</p>
<p>Or, better yet, in this sense.</p>
<p>"I am happy that in the Karabakh war 25,000 Azeris died while only 5,000 Armenians have died."</p>
<p>The third quote with the parenthesis you have added. The only official investigation in British records talk about 2,000, and even pro Azeri authors either use 3,000 or 3,500. This has already been discussed. The Dashnaks were able to keep the front in Baku, against the penetration of the Turkish army, this is a recorded history, and once they have penetrated, there was at the very least the double of the numbers of Armenians killed than Tartars previously. German records on the preparation of the Armenian massacres in Baku abound. The rest of the quotes are of no relevancy. If you have better material, go ahead, if not stop it. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:03, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How exactly are individual members of the Dashnak Party representative of the views of the Party itself? There are many stupid things Democrats or Republicans say which are clearly out of line with the Party's stance but do we hold them synonymous because its a minority view?</dd>

<dd>As far as I have been able to count, Dacy's (and yours to Atabek) pernicious POV edits have spread to at least 3 Armenian-related articles where administrators have been forced to lock them due to disputes with the apparently sole aim of tarnishing the individual or the topic in the article, one way or another. This is hardly the way Wikipedia works. I suggest you guys re-read 5 pillars of Wikipedia once more and then return back.

<p>It is still an opinion, it does not dictate the party's stance. He openly says "<b>I</b> feel proud"...it's his own feelings and emotions, it is a personal interview and not an interview on the part of the party. If I recall correctly, when the Azeri soldier Ramil Safarov <b>AXED</b> Gurgen Markaryan in his sleep, he got alot of praise by various officials in Azerbaijan, that is their personal opinion and I doubt that represents most of Azerbaijan or who they represent/work for. <a href="http://budapest.sumgait.info/azerbaijani-response.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://budapest.sumgait.info/azerbaijani-response.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Anar Mamedkhanov, MP</p>
<p><i>"I always tell our officers who study in Turkey: 'You are needed in Karabakh. They [Armenians] must be killed in Karabakh not in the other countries' "</i> Does this represent all MPs in Azeribaijan?</p>
<p>Dr. Akif Naghi, Head of the Organization for the Liberation of Karabakh</p>
<p><i>"I make Mr Safarov a honorary member of the OLK. He is a great lad and fulfilled his duty under the conditions under which he found himself"</i> Someone saying such a statement is normal? And who says this represents the entire OLK?</p>
<p>Elmira Suleymanova, the Ombudswoman of Azerbaijan</p>
<p><i>"R. Safarov must become an example of patriotism for the Azerbaijani youth."</i> What about her?</p>
<p>Hovanessian states that: <i>Moreover, we should fight for the democratization of Azerbaijan. It is strange, but this is our task. We should always draw the world's attention to what is taking place in Azerbaijani propaganda, the press. This is a task for our public, human rights organizations, but not a "witch-hunt" in their native land.</i> Yeah this is terrorism too huh.</p>
<p><i>If they settled those refugees in flats taken from Armenians, the problem would be settled. But as those flats were mainly good ones, the Azerbaijani elite occupied them, not only Aliyev's elite but also late President Abulfaz Elcibay Elchibey's, which is in opposition today. That is, the Azerbaijani elite inherited what they took away from the Armenians and did not share this with these unfortunate people.</i> Hmmm...</p>
<p>Anyway he also talks about how Turks and Azeris are not racist and other stuff. Of course, I had to fetch this myself in order to see it. All those comments you highlited above are again his personal opinion and have zero trace of terrorism for reasons I have states in my other batch of comment.

<p>I see it is written a way to clear up the activity of ARF. If we use (like on page Urartu) reference to Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia I see no reason why we can't cite Papazian. Besides, even it is bolshevik POV, we have other evidence about ARF militant activity. Vorontsov-Dashkov, Russian 'namestnik' in the Caucasus wrote about ARF militant activity (I'll supply reference tomorrow, on Monday). Again, you'll argue that it is POV too. So, only your view isn't? Malevskiy also wrote about Dashnak militant activity (again on Monday I'll put reference) Libaridian in his book 'Modern Armenia: People, Nations, State" wrote that until 1903 ARF abstained from military confrontation in Russia (p.108). But after 1903 ARF activity is notable. I mean, there is plenty of evidence about ARF militant activity in Russia and other places, and links with terrorist activity as well. Whatever rivalry was btw Ter-Petrosian and ARF we have reference to ARF clandestine activity in Armenia. I have a bunch of other sources (eg Patrick Brogan, World Conflicts, etc) Atabek gave also enough information. You can't just throw away them because you think that they all are POV. Here in Wikipedia editor's task to give information - verifiable, based on reputable resources. Reader will judge. No historical event or process has one-sided coverage. Experts argue about the Columbus discovery as well.</p>
<p>I am not going to argue here anymore without third party involvement. I was insulted enough.

<dd>Dacy, using the Bolsheviks to cite the ARF is like using Azeri sources to cite Armenian or vice versa. You can't take an opposing side because there will be POV as we have all agreed upon w/ Armenian-Azeri articles, such as Nagorno-Karabakh war, citing the opposing side. Bolsheviks and ARF have despised each other in history. Bolsheviks threw the ARF out of Armenian SSR. As you know, the USSR was totally against nationalism...you don't get more nationalist than the ARF. ARF worked for yearssss to get an independent Armenia, don't you think this would irritate the USSR and the bolsheviks. The ARF did not have a prescence in Armenia until the collapse of the USSR. Didn't Fadix explain you the history previously a little up from here? We're going over the same things over and over again... And why do you keep victimizing yourself? And what's up with the word "punishment", you're talking as if we are criminals and I don't appreciate that. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 02:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fedayee, Hovanessian is a high level representative of ARF. So if he makes fascistic comments, and ARF does not officially disassociate itself (in a written PR) from these, it's quite normal to attribute the opinion of a high-level party functionary to the whole party's position. Of course, Hovanessian cannot express the position of Armenian parliament in any case, unless he was explicitly authorized to do so, but he can definitely represent ARF as a party. Same goes with your example of Mamedkhanov, who is MP, he does not represent the entire Azerbaijani parliament, but if he was a member of a particular political party, he would certainly represent its view by his comment.</dd>
<dd>Regarding Elmira Suleymanova's comment above, you're taking it out of context. She did say "Ramil Safarov became an example..." as a statement of a fact, not as an expression of her personal or political opinion, neither did she express the position of the state.</dd>
<dd>Akif Nagi is a war veteran and independent group leader. They openly state their position and do not deny it. But they're neither representatives of government nor parliament, unlike ARF is.</dd>
<dd>Also, when Hovanessian cites few Armenian flats in Baku taken over by angry Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia, he seems to suffer from amnesia that about 200,000 Azeris were deported from Armenia in 1988-1989 bringing the percentage of Azeri population in Armenia (which in the beginning of century according to George Bournoutian was at 80%) down to 0%. And continuously citing Sumgait?? With 26 dead against hundreds or thousands of Azeris butchered?</dd>
<dd>So the policy of Hovanessians and ARFs was nothing more than ethnic cleansing and intolerance. And they still dare to point their blood-stained fingers to Azerbaijanis, yes, those same fingers that were scalping the Azeri child in Khojaly 15 years ago, cutting its eyes out, and now fighting to deny it all over the world.

<dd>Atabek, if Hovanessian was attributing what he said to the entire party's stance, he would've used the words&#160;: "The Dashnaktsutyun, the ARF or the Dashnaks is/are proud" He would not have said I am proud. You cannot interpret his words the way you want them to be as I know that the ARF is despised by Azeris and Azerbaijan. If he would've said "the party" or any of the above, then the comments are the party's stance. Check here, current ARF leader Hrant Markarian being interviewed, he clearly says "the ARF" etc when representing his party's stance <a href="http://www.yerkir.am/eng/index.php?sub=interview&amp;id=32" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yerkir.am/eng/index.php?sub=interview&amp;id=32" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<p>&gt;With 26 dead against hundreds or thousands of Azeris butchered?</p>
<p>Your choice of words scare me...dead for Armenians, butchered for Azeris...hmm, and you are getting too emotional when stating stuff. That death toll of 26 is understated by the Soviets and it does not mention the rapes and pillaging of Armenians businesses etc.</p>
<p>&gt;So the policy of Hovanessians and ARFs was nothing more than ethnic cleansing and intolerance. And they still dare to point their blood-stained fingers to Azerbaijanis, yes, those same fingers that were scalping the Azeri child in Khojaly 15 years ago, cutting its eyes out, and now fighting to deny it all over the world. I am sorry that Armenian people follow such fascists and feel pride for them.</p>
<p>This remark has nothing but POV and is your own personal opinion. The ARF is not the army, the ARF holds 11 seats out of 100+ seats in the Armenian parliament, it does not have a personal army or anything. Your claims are nothing but Azeri POV towards the ARF which is hated. You have so much POV in your words and you want to contribute to this article. The ARF is not Mussolini, it is not Nazi, if it was, it would've been longgg exterminated before. It is insulting you consider Armenians fascists. Btw you forgot to deny on Hovanessian's want to help Azerbaijan become more of a democracy and help its human rights...very fascist indeed. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 02:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well the whole talk started from the opinion that ARF was associated with militancy and terrorism, which is quite well proven by the facts presented above from various sources (including wealth of Armenian ones), as well as by statements of its prominent member. About fascism, Fedayee, I don't consider all Armenian people as fascists, there is scum in any nation. Not all Germans were Nazis either but they followed Nazis. It's funny how the person who is proud of killing 25,000 Azeris can desire to help build democracy in Azerbaijan, and someone who is proud of taking out human life can desire having human rights for those same people. Hovanessian should concern himself first with abysmal human rights in Armenia itself, but it's hard to do for someone who is driven Machiavellian thoughts and whose hands are stained with blood of blinded Azeri child, the picture of which became a chilling symbol of Khojaly Massacre.</dd>
<dd>Apart from these, ARF page was blocked because of edit war with standard (though false) Armenian claim that Karabakh was handed over by Stalin in 1923. Given the fact that no Kavbureau decision text on establishment of NKAO says so, the quote has no basis. NK was established within Azerbaijan SSR. If you have counter arguments, please, present the text of Kavbureau decision from 1923 in full for discussion.

<p>We already responded to all those POV Bolshevik links, which is the equivalent of an Armenian source to cite Azeri stuff and vice versa. The article deals with links to guerrilla organization JCAG (which can be viewed as a terrorist group) so I don't know what else you are all looking for by going through all this trouble. I did not say you consider all Armenians fascist but the ones who are sympathetic w/ the ARF. The ARF is huge, it has links worldwide, how can such a "fascist movement" not be banned, persecuted etc by any country in the world (including the leader of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a>, the United States, where the ARF is big). Your claim is only your POV and possibly most of Azerbaijan's POV. The badly translated comments on the Karabakh war is his opinion as explained above which I will not go through again because this will be kicking the dead horse. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Armenia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Armenia" rel="nofollow">Human rights in Armenia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Azerbaijan" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Azerbaijan" rel="nofollow">Human rights in Azerbaijan</a>, check em out. Hovanessian cannot be held responsible with the tragic deaths in Khojaly, that is anti-ARF labelism from you.</p>
<p>Despite it being a source directly from the CIA factbook, the same factbook news agencies use, the factbook from the CIA which I guess gathers wrong intelligence, despite its use in other Azeri articles, I am willing to settle for this which is being used in the NKwar article: <i>These factors lead the committee to reverse its decision and award Karabakh to Soviet Azerbaijan in 1921, and later incorporated the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR in 1923</i>. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 18:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CIA is not the best source on this, historical facts are not intellegence information.

Anyway I will change it to the version Khoikhoi suggested which seems fair enough. I don't see why this article about the ARF should be tagged and stopped because of a widely sourced sentence that certain people don't agree upon. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 18:32, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, mind <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>. I did not insult you, you should not make personal attacks either. Second, when the sources differ, you don’t choose one reliable source and ignore others. You either select a middle ground or provide for all existing points of views. Khoikhoi’s version is OK by me, it does not support any of interpretations and allows for all existing points of view. I do not object to removal of tag either and consider this dispute to be resolved. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 18:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You falsely accused me of wanting to own this article, something I have never claimed. I don't see any personal attacks man...all I see are wikipedia rules. Anyway, Khoikhoi's looks good. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 19:06, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I did not accuse you, I just stated a fact that you do not own the article, same as nobody else does. Let's consider this matter settled, I'm not gonna make an issue of that and I hope you will stay cool in the future. Good luck. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:16, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am cool, there is nothing to make an issue out of anyway. Spare me of your blackmail, if you are reffering to my choice of words, I simply used a wikipedia rule in effect. - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 19:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just wondering? Shouldn't the AYF (Armenian Youth Federation) be mentioned as falling under the umbrella of the ARF? Just a thought--KingVegeta2000 08:06, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It already mentions the AYF. The AYF isn't simply an umbrella organization, it is a integral part of the ARF, just like Badanegan. <sub>At least, that's what I understood!</sub> -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavo88_09f3.html" title="User:Davo88">Davo88</a> 12:29, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
