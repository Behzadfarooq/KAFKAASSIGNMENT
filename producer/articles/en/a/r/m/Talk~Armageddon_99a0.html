I kept the information on Armageddon, the theological concept, and Megiddo, the ancient city and battle (and redirected Megiddo to here) because I felt they were intimately related, that to inform about Megiddo, you needed to describe Armageddon, and vice versa, so why not keep them together, instead of separate entries? <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a>Jun 02</p>
<p>Theoretically a good idea, however Megiddo (and Megiddo Junction, the bus terminus) are viable geographical locations which have no <i>mythological</i> associations e.g. if you wished to discuss the recent suicide bombing at Megiddo it is markedly unhelpful to do so in the context of Armageddon. Perhaps these two could be simply disentangled with a marker between them, i.e. in Armageddon mention its relationship to Megiddo and link it and, of course, vice versa. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So that's why not. I agree.</p>
<p>I'll do it like this <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armageddon.html" title="Armageddon">Armageddon</a> will ref <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Megiddo_7386.html" title="Battle of Megiddo">Battle of Megiddo</a> and vice versa. Reserve <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megiddo.html" title="Megiddo">Megiddo</a> (currently redirected) for contemporary Meggido, about which I know nothing. (I don't think demons from hell will be showing up any time soon, but it is kind of neat, don't you think, first battle/last battle?) I started on this because the entry on Armageddon as I found it didn't even mention the Battle of Megiddo!<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></p>

<p>This is an article (from a mostly Christian perspective) about a future event. The Christian perspective is not that the Earth is filth or covered with filth. It is a world fallen from the perfection of it's creation and existing in rebellion to God, i.e. sin. The world as created was good (c.f. Genisis ch. 1 &amp; 2 where God repeats "...and it was good." after each phase of creation. Treat as allegory if needed.) The Earth and the things in it are good, not filth. Yet it will all be destroyed because of sin. This is a Biblical perspective on a future Biblical event (or allegory). This is not Zoroastrian stuff and I am not the one who made the original edit that you corrected. And with the exception of this one word I agree with your edit. However if you still have problems with this, please respond here and lets reach a consensus.<br />

<p>You should have just changed that one word from my edit. I thought you were trying to reinsert the Zoroastrian baloney (which your edit had the effect of doing), since that was all I remember changing. That stuff was all I had a problem with; there's no problem with your latest edit. --168.215.149.103 06:45, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Zoroastrian baloney? It is because of POV "scholars" like you I've given up on Wikipedia. Either you're innocently ignorant of Zoroastrian doctrine and its influence upon eschatology, or you're protesting too much, unable to reconcile comparative religion with your own faith. It deserves to at least be listed in 'see also'. End times, coming of a world redeemer, battle between good and evil, final judgement, fulfillment of prophesy. No, certainly Zoroastrian "baloney" has not the slightest relavence to this article. The focus should remain on the Christian belief of course; but Zoroastrian references seem suspiciously lacking considering Bahá'í and Rastafarian ones are included. I'm sorry and ashamed if I've drawn the wrong conclusions and displayed bad faith in my opinions, thereby unduly judging user's motives. 68.32.211.183 05:54, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are two words that are original to the book of <i>Revelation</i>: "Nicolaitanes" and "Armageddon". Christ said he hates the deeds and doctrine of the Nicolaitanes. "Nicolaitanes" is an anagram for "O satanic line," a reference to the beast line of the Ouzo Cross (see<a href="http://tycho.i8.com/ouzo/prophecy.html" class="external text" title="http://tycho.i8.com/ouzo/prophecy.html" rel="nofollow">"The Ouzo Prophecy"</a>). Armageddon is the location of the final battle between good and evil. "Armageddon" is an anagram for "Dame Dragon," a generalized personification of evil, similar to other generalized personifications such as Mother Nature and Lady Luck. Anagrams are related to gematria in that both are number/letter codes, anagrams being based on ordinal numbers and gematria on cardinal numbers.</p>

<p><br />
Even if this "numerology" and "gematria" stuff were true, they wouldn't be amagrams IN ENGLISH. Let's get serious and do what's best for the article and not push crank theories. _____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The book of <i>Revelation</i> was written for all peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues, and since English is becoming a universal language, I believe the book of <i>Revelation</i>, as translated and edited as of 1946 in the KJV, was indeed written for an English-speaking audience. This is not a crank theory, O my brothers in tribulation.</p>

<p>How many times have the conspiracy theorists tried to make the ridiculous claim that a certain politician is the antichrist? This was common when Reagan was president based on the childish belief that each of his names -- Ronald Wilson Reagan -- contained 6 letters, hence the 666 (mistakenly referred to as the sign of the devil, which it is not -- it's the sign of man, taken in relation to the perfect 777, which is God).</p>
<p>The antichrist -- or "the Beast" which is the more appropriate term, is or will be, in my opinion, a nation. If we consider that possibility that the beast is on the planet today, it would likely be the nation of Islam, based on their unquenchable thirst for innocent blood.</p>
<p>Trying to connect George W. Bush with "the antichrist" is not even good enough to be considered sophistry.</p>
<p>Well, he technically is. the antichrist is supposed to be a leader who gains trust by <u><i>everyone</i></u>. That rules out George Bush.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What people believe can be amusing. Jesus plainly stated that there <b>were</b> many antichrists and that there <b>would be</b> many antichrists. Anyone who tries to take the place of Jesus as the means of salvation by God is an antichrist. Reading the Bible would make that plain. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_m_d217.html" title="User:George m">George</a> 18:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can we please try to keep this scholarly?</dd>

You are being scholary? I understand from your "...it would likely be the nation of Islam..." that you consider yourself a representative of Christianity. very well. all this discussion is under the the heading of the antichrist. unquenchable thirst for innocent blood? just like cannot and do not present george bush as a model Christian, we do not forward some radical groups as ideal Muslim. secondly, plz tell me, what do you know about the Islamic concept of armageddon? and Antichrist? ANTIchrist? you seem quite a scholar. pick a copy of Koran and find me one verse about Jesus in Koran that you disagree to. and as to the definition you give of term anti-christ, tell me WHY do you expect Jesus to be the last Prophet? arnt u following the Jews on the same path considering what they think of Jesus?</p>

<p>The amount of material about the Jehovah Witnesses seems way out of proportion to me. There should be something about Dispensationalism, since this probably the interpretation that has had the greatest impact on in recent times, with the Hal Lindsey books and so forth. Also, I think the article needs popular culture section. <a href="../../../k/a/u/User%7EKauffner_58c3.html" title="User:Kauffner">Kauffner</a> 13:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the "Armageddon" of Rev 16:16 is nothing but an approximate Greek transliteration of Har-Megiddo. There is no need to provide any citation proving that “Megiddo was the location of many decisive battles in ancient times”: they are already amply provided at the various <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Megiddo_7386.html" title="Battle of Megiddo">Battle of Megiddo</a> sub-entris. Consequently I am going to remove the relative “citation needed”.</p>
