<p>Originally there were a lot more school districts in the area. Pennsylvania wanted to have less small school districts and more bigger school districts. The Armstrong School District is made up of a lot of smaller school districts that became one. The Armstrong School District has existed since 1966.</p>

<p><b>Armstrong School District Food Service</b></p>
<p>At the Armstrong School District, we believe that the breakfast and lunch programs are part of the educational system. We are responsible for teaching children nutrition and offering new and exciting food items. We strive to make the lunch menus appealing, encouraging the children to eat meals at school. We closely monitor food preferences while trying to introduce new foods.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Overview and History of School Food Service School food service is the world's largest food service business, serving more meals a day than the fast food industry. School lunch has often been referred to as the original fast food operation: serving millions of lunches across the United States in a time span of 1 1/2 hours. The National School Lunch Act of 1946 established the National School Lunch Program to safeguard the health and well being of our nation's children. Studies found that the overall health of Americans was poor and many were malnourished. Minimum nutritional requirements were defined. Prior to 1946, school lunches were done primarily by volunteer groups serving mostly cold lunches.</p>
<p><br />
School Meal Initiative The third addition of the Dietary Guidlines for Americans was released in 1990 and triggered the new guidelines for school meals. The School Meal Initiative is designed to meet 1/3 of the dietary guidlines for children for lunch. All school lunches have an age appropriate calorie allowance, with less than 30% of the calories from fat and 12-15% of the calories from protein.</p>
<p><br />
<b>National School Lunch &amp; Breakfast Regulations</b></p>
<p>Each School Lunch Includes: One-half pint milk Two ounces meat or meat alternative Three-fourths cup of fruit and/or vegetable One serving bread or bread alternative (Eight per Week)</p>
<pre>
Each School Breakfast Includes:
</pre>
<p>One-half pint serving milk Two servings of meat or bread One-half cup fruit and /or vegetable</p>
<p>Lunch and breakfast prices are set by the Armstrong School Board of Directors as food costs fluctuate. The 2006-2007 prices are as follows: Breakfast $1.00 Elementary Lunch $1.70 Secondary Lunch $1.90 Milk $.45</p>

FREE &amp; REDUCED MEAL PROGRAM Participation in the National School Breakfast and Lunch program makes meal benefits available to ALL students. The parent / guardian can apply for free or reduced priced meals at anytime during the school year. Applications are available at each school building. Applications are sent home at the beginning of each school year. A new application is required yearly for the program.</p>
<p>The School District uses a roster system to record lunches in all buildings so there is no overt identification of a students eligibility.</p>
<p>The Armstrong School District has been chosen by the PA Dept of Education (PDE) and Dept of Public Welfare (DWP) to pilot a program that has been added to a statewide program called COMPASS. COMPASS is a system, currently being used by DWP, that allows citizens of PA to apply for programs, such as Food Stamps, Energy Assistance, Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), etc. online through the internet. For the first time, applications for free or reduced price meals as part of the school lunch program are now available on line. Since Armstrong School District is participating in the pilot, you may complete the “Household Meal Benefit Application” online at www.compass.state.pa.us or you may use the paper “household Meal Benefit Application” provided to you by your school. The information you enter on COMPASS is kept confidential and used only for the purposes indicated during the application process.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armstrong_School_District_%28Pennsylvania%29_8c42.html" title="Edit section: Technology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technology</span></h2>
<p>The Armstrong School District Board of Directors and Administration are committed to implementing and supporting modern technology initiatives throughout our schools. By providing our students with diverse technical opportunities, our students graduate with hands on technological experiences and skills necessary to compete in today’s post secondary environment and life.</p>
<p><br />
The district has worked in conjunction with state and federal programs to make key technological systems available to students: updated computer labs; videoconferencing systems; classroom computers; local and wide area networking; online research systems; Internet access; and career planning systems. Coinciding with these efforts, business, technology, and programming courses district-wide are routinely revamped to address current and future technological demands. Currently, the Armstrong School District operates 17 secondary computer labs, 8 elementary computer labs, 6 interactive video based distance learning classrooms, 1 video bridge, 4 computers per classroom in grades 1, 5 through 12, and 6 computers per kindergarten classroom.</p>
<p><br />
Connecting all of these technological devices, is a massive network support system comprised of local and wide area networks designed at tying the districts 15 buildings together to provide equal access to online systems regardless of building location.</p>
<p><br />
Technology and the role it plays within our educational system is constantly being reviewed and upgraded as part of the District’s 3-year Technology Plan and 5-Year Strategic Plan. The Armstrong School District believes that education via curriculum should drive technology efforts. Technology is in place to enhance curricular offerings and assist in making our learning processes more efficient and effective.</p>
<p><br />
The links to the left are provided to give more insight into the technology in use within the Armstrong School District. Feel free to look around at the exciting things we are doing.</p>
<p>District Computing The district maintains computing equpiment in lab and classroom settings.</p>
<p>Computer Labs Currently the district operates twenty four conventional computer labs and one wireless notebook computer lab. The concentration of the computer labs lies at the secondary level where they are utilized for a variety of technology based courses and curriculum integration activities.</p>
<p>Each elementary utilizes one computer lab for weekly computer instruction and curriculum integration.</p>
<p>Armstrong School District has developed a scope and sequence of computer technology skills that is being implemented through a spiraled curriculum approach. Technology skills are being phased in and interwoven with curriculum goals as they are taught seamlessly within Technology Integrated Lessons (TIL’s) as a support to the core curriculum.</p>
<p><b>District Computing</b></p>
<p>Armstrong School District is one of the 2002-2003 award recipients of the Pennsylvania Department of Educations Enhancing Education Through Technology (EETT) competitive grant. As part of this grant, the school district is implementing advanced curriculum integration software that will be utilized as a supplement to math and reading instruction for primary grades in both lab and classroom settings.</p>
<p><b>Networking</b></p>
<p>Networking Overview: The ASD network infrastructure is comprised of local and wide area technologies designed to provide voice, data and video to each of our fourteen buildings.</p>
<p>Local Area Networks: Within each school building lies a self sustaining local area network facilitating user authentication, file and print services, and application services. The building servers were upgraded at the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year.</p>
<p>The backbone portion of the network is based on Gigabit Ethernet with Layer 3 switching at its core. Each closet is connected to the main distribution frame via dual gigabit ethernet trunk lines. Desktop connectivitiy is provided through a switched 100 megabit connection.</p>
<p>Each of the local area networks is part of the district's wide area network which is based at the administration building.</p>
<p>Wide Area Networks The wide area network provides building interconnectivity via point to point T1 circuits from the administration building to each individual school building. Several servers housed at the administration building provide email services, filtered internet access, access to district resources, administrative applications, centralized management, and help desk services.</p>
<p>Internet Access: Internet services are provided via a T1 connection to a Tier 1 Internet Service Provider. There is no direct connectivity between the district local and wide area networks and the internet. The district maintains a hardware based firewall separating the districts internal network from the internet. In addition to the hardware firewall, a Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server in firewall mode is used inside of the firewall to provide internet access to district computers.</p>
