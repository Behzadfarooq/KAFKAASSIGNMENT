<li>Hi, I'm just wondering about the page <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rap_metal.html" title="Rap metal">rap metal</a>. It's currently a stub, and I'm wondering if it could be just made into a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">redirect</a> to <a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_metal.html" title="Nu metal">nu metal</a>.

<li>Hiya! Our <a href="../../../w/e/b/Talk%7EWeblog_797e.html#blogs_are_never_intresting_to_read" title="Talk:Weblog">little chat</a> got me thinking, so I hunted around, and I came up with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#A_simple_formulation" title="WP:NPOV">a pretty interesting way of looking at the Wikipedia NPOV policy</a>. It answered a couple of questions I wanted to ask, at any rate.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../t/-/b/User%7ET-Boy_4523.html" title="User:T-Boy">T-Boy</a></li>

<li>Just wanted to give you a heads up that 2,000mg = 2g. <a href="../../../e/l/b/User%7EElBenevolente_e171.html" title="User:ElBenevolente">ElBenevolente</a> 05:57, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, in regards to (diff) (hist) . . m Dextromethorphan; 04:05:31 . . Arm (Talk) (Theres no way you could take 2grams of DXM and live.), I must disagree. Through personal research and intimate knowledge of the drug dextromethorphan, I have ascertained that for average body weight, 3-4g is in the potentially lethal range, while 2g is actually a rather normal (if high) dose. I know many people, albeit with high tolerances, who ingest this amount on an almost daily basis, and I assure you that they are still alive. DryGrain 15:39, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>I'm talking about 3000 mg of pure dextromethorphan. Now I dont really have much experience with the drug. Just read around dextroverse.org and William Whites DXM Faq which I hope you read. According to them taking over 2 grams is not recommended and people died from taking 3g.</b></p>
<p><b>Unless your friends have very high tolerence I dont see how they can take so much Or if they do, how well do they function? Or where do they get so much DXM?Arm</b></p>
<p>3000mg == 3g. 3g is in the <i>potentially lethal</i> range. I am a former active member of the Dextroverse and have read William White's FAQ a few times, and I have quite a bit of expierience with the drug. (I'm 'not' trying to give you the message that "I have more knowledge, so your opinion is worthless", and if it comes off like that to you, then I apologize.) The Dextroverse and the FAQ have both padded the lethal dose ranges in order to avoid liability. Hypothetically, if I had ever abused DXM recreationally (wink) the highest dose I would have ever taken is 2.2g (or 2200mg). I know some people who have gone as high as 3g (3000mg). As far as I know, there has 'never' been a death from an overdose of dextromethorphan. (However, if it's taken in the form of Coricidin, there is also an antihistamine in the pill called <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorpheniramine_maleate.html" title="Chlorpheniramine maleate">chlorpheniramine maleate</a> which 'can' cause overdoses in excessive quantites.) In answer to your question about where one comes across such amounts of DXM, there are many online chemical supply houses which sell DXM in bulk quantities. Omega Fine Chemicals and American Chemical Supply are two popular ones. Usually, 20 grams of DXM powder, bought in bulk, costs only about $40-$60, making it relatively cheap compared to many street drugs, considering that 20 grams is at a minimum, about 7-10 (very) large doses, and at a maximum about 40-50 small doses.</p>
<p>Hope that answers your questions, if not, let me know what I can clarify. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryGrain_7436.html" title="User:DryGrain">DryGrain</a> 08:11, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding your comments at Yngwie:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok this is <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_n%27_roll.html" title="Rock n' roll">rock n' roll</a> children, not classical music. I dont care about how well you can pluck the strings on an electric guitar and how clean it sounds. Rock music is supposed to have a certain amount of rawness in it to begin with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I dont care about how well someone can play the guitar. I cant play the guitar or read music so, except for <a href="../../../n/u/-/Nu-metal.html" title="Nu-metal">nu-metal</a> guitaring, it all sounds alike to me. I can still appreciate a good guitar riff, but it needs something to back it up like a good beat or good lyrics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It matters about how good the music that someone makes. Having a virtuoso ability means about as much when it comes to making good music as being a technically skilled topiary gardener. Yngwies music aint that hot. It's mostly boring instrumentals where he shows off his pretenctious playing and the few songs with lyrics have dumb/cliche lyrics and a vocalist singing them that sounds like Yngwie himself or sounds like a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castrato.html" title="Castrato">castrato</a> singing it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Though to be quite fair, ide take Yngwie Malmsteen over <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">rap</a> anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just thought ide menction the actual music part to the Wikipedians. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArm_8860.html" title="User:Arm">Arm</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with you that Yngwie is pretentious, cheesy, and I've heard from friends of friends in the business that he's quite mean and annoying. I think it was Ty Tabor (of King's X fame) who was practicing in a rehearsal studio with his band next to Yngwie and <i>his</i> band one time in the early 90s. Yngwie wanders into Tabor's room (still playing, mind you, via wireless) and starts wailing to show how cool he is. Then he hands his guitar to Tabor, daring him to repeat what Yngwie just played. Tabor picks up the axe and fumbles with the scalloped fret board and super-light strings, finally saying something to the effect of "I can't, man." Yngwie lets out a haughty chuckle and walks back to his band, then proceeds to joke loudly about how lame Tabor is to the rest of his bandmates. Classic Yngwie - such a tool, yet he'll never know that he's anything less than a messiah.</p>
<p>Personality aside, though ... as well as cheesiness of his music ... I definitely respect Yngwie for his discipline. It's been very sad for me to listen to the decline of the solo as an integral part of a song. I think there's a synthesis that needs to take place in order to make some great strides in the rock arena; that is, a synthesis between chops and vibe, for lack of better terms. Chops are, after all, possibilities. Capabilities. If you don't have the chops, you're severely limited in terms of your sonic capabilities. That's why so much nu-metal guitarring sounds manufactured, flat, and unoriginal. What happened a lot in the 80s, I think, is people focused so much on chops that they forgot their purpose. That's why there's so much pretention, such a "look what I can do" attitude.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's <i>my</i> two cents. Cheers, <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 05:58, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>(Crossposted from my talk page, in case you aren't watching it:)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Whoa, dude. I didn't mean to argue with you. Haha, I was actually agreeing, or so I thought. My little anecdote was meant to illustrate how Yngwie is, in fact, a huge "ass." And I do agree that his cover of Mr. Crowley with Tim Owens was quite good, although his other music is quite cheesy. I fancy myself a musician, and I love metal, so I tend to ramble on about such things.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I offended you about nu-metal? I don't mean to categorically belittle it. I love System of a Down, Deftones, and a bunch of other supposed nu-metal acts. Anyway, apologies for any misunderstanding. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 17:52, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arm, the warning you removed from <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinegar.html" title="Vinegar">Vinegar</a> relating to it being used as an intoxicant was evidently placed there because of the speedy delete I requested for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vinegar_drunkness&amp;diff=11974905&amp;oldid=11971023" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vinegar_drunkness&amp;diff=11974905&amp;oldid=11971023" rel="nofollow">Vinegar drunkness</a>.

<dd>That is an interesting and complicated problem, but deletion won't solve anything. The problem is that question marks cannot be used in <a href="../../../u/r/l/URL_e6b3.html" title="URL">URLs</a>, so when you type in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_(television)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_(television)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_(television)</a> the software seems to cut the question mark and everything after it, and thus sends you to <a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark_43f1.html" title="Are You Afraid of the Dark">Are You Afraid of the Dark</a>, which redirects to <a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark__0953.html" title="Are You Afraid of the Dark?">Are You Afraid of the Dark?</a>. It is thus impossible to move anything to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_(television)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_(television)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_(television)</a> , because that is not a valid address as it contains an illegal character. Since question marks cannot be used in URLs, the Wikipedia software automatically replaces them with %3F, so to properly link to any of these pages you just need to make sure the address contains %3F rather than&#160;?.- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:43, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What on earth are you talking about? We already had <a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark__0953.html" title="Are You Afraid of the Dark?">Are You Afraid of the Dark?</a> as a disambig, and <a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark__%28novel%29_79e2.html" title="Are You Afraid of the Dark? (novel)">Are You Afraid of the Dark? (novel)</a>, and both of them worked fine; all I did was fix the TV series to match. Stop abusing me with profanity, and explain what the problem is, because these titles seem to work fine for everyone else. Your comment about <i>had to break the page again didn't you</i> is utterly nonsensical, because I had never edited the pages before a single editing session this morning, and I only came to them because of the request you posted on <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">WP:RfD</a>. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:42, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: We have quite a few page names that use a '?' in the title, and if your particular software interacts with the Wikipedia software in such a way that such titles don't work for you (they are fine for everyone else), trust me, we're not going to rename all such pages just so they work for you. Now if you could help us find out <i>why</i> you are having problems, that would be the best thing you can do right at this point. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:57, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Noel is right, the solution to this lies not with moving pages, but rather with fixing the software. The best idea is to contact the developers by filing a <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">bug report</a>, and then being patient until it is fixed.- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 13:03, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't believe that the Third Plateau is still around, much less Robert F. Golaszewski. I was actually the one whose actions led to a moderator being appointed. Anyhoo, yeah, I am working on a concept for a new type of matching service for the love-shy niche and am reading a book on patents for such ideas.

<p>"Controlled substances" in the United States are everything from herione to Ambien. If you are unlawfully using them, meaning using them without a prescription or off-label, and are caught even once, you can't own a gun.</p>
<p>As far as everything else goes, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/nics/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/nics/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/nics/index.htm</a></p>
<p>Summary: If you do <i>anything</i> stupid enough to get you accused and convicted of a crime punishable by over a year, no gun ownership, even if you aren't sentenced to a year.</p>
<p>Enjoy. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> 18:08, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you are found to be addicted to any controlled substance, then yes, you won't be able to purchase a firearm. The status of "addict" I presume would be decided by a court, which I know isn't perfect, but it has to fall on some 3rd party. If the act of using a substance is a crime punishable by over a year, then you will also be prohibited. I doubt getting busted with some pot is going to be a problem, but again, you would be risking being called an "addict." I'd say these regulations hit alcohol harder because it's much easier to be/become and alcoholic, it's much easier to get a DUI, and even a single DUI can cost you your concealed handgun permit (if your state offers one).</dd>

<dd>A while back, a friend of mine was charged with felony destruction of private property (senior prank) which was dropped due to a misdemeanor. However, his misdemeanor was still punishable by up to a year in prison (he was only given a large fine and community service). Only because of the legal definition of "a year" in VA was he able to stay off the Federal Prohibited Persons list, and is therefore able to purchase firearms. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> 21:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, so <b>yes</b>, if you are using any illegal substance, or if you are addicted to any controlled substance (Rx to Alcohol).
