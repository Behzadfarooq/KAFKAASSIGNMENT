<p>I have removed the following partisan quote from the main page for violating the POV rule. I'm leaving it on the talk page as an example of unsubstatiated argument and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> primer.</p>
<p><i>"- Significant event:</i> <i>* On 27 January 1973, the Armenians in the United States as well as around the world launched a brutal terrorism campaign against the Turks and the Turkish institutions to validate forcibly a mythical genocide believed only by themselves through blood-shed and violence. That day, an old Armenian man by the name Yanikian invited two Turkish diplomats from the Los Angeles Consulate to a luncheon in Santa Barbara. It turned out that the invitation was a dastardly ambush; he killed both diplomats brutally in the restaurant. For two decades this senseless terrorism claimed the lives of more than seventy Turkish diplomats (four in the U.S.) and their family members, and maimed and wounded several innocent by-standers in the carnage staged by the Armenians all over the world. The Armenian terrorists, mostly dropouts from Middle Eastern terrorism, recognize no boundary to their savage operations. They even carried the terror to the college campuses, ravishing the sanctified atmosphere of the higher-learning institutions. The American historians who refused to share the distorted Armenian version of history were targeted for harassment and threat. The Turkish History professor Stanford Shaw of U.C.L.A. was one of them, and on October 3, 1977, the Armenian bullies threw a bomb, and blew up the front portion of his house. He and his family had to leave the campus under a death threat."</i></p>
<p>The first sentence breaks sense and grammar rules to fit in a denial of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a>. The incidents related are a mixture of vagueness and puzzling specificity: "old man named Yanikian" at an unamed restaurant with unnamed diplomats in an incident which may have occured on 27 January 1973. The overuse of adjectives makes for melodramatic writing, undermining the believability of the narrative. Most of the incidents mentioned in the quote are supposed to have occurred in the U.S., so references would be available in English. If any incident can be substantiated with a neutral refence, then it could go back in the main article without adjectives and without flatly denying the Armenian genocide. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Silverfish_b292.html" title="User:DJ Silverfish">DJ Silverfish</a> 15:35, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

Murder Will Out?

District Attorney Regrets Not Allowing Genocide Testimony at Murder
Trial

By David D. Minner, judge of the Madera County Municipal Court, who
was the District Attorney of Santa Barbara County in the early 1970s.

Twenty-five years ago Gourgen Mkrtich Yanikian, a 78 year old Armenian
immigrant and long time Santa Barbara resident, started what he called
a "New kind of war" with assassination of two Turkish diplomats.

Yanikian's war began January 27, 1973, in a cottage at the Biltmore
Hotel, where he had lured a consul general and vice-consul of the
Republic of Turkey. The diplomats expected to receive gifts of art
treasures for their government, but instead Yanikian pulled a Luger
pistol from a hollowed-out book and emptied it at them. He called the
reception desk, said he killed "two evils", then sat calmly on the
patio awaiting arrest.

<dd>This article has been seriously criticized. First of, Shaw claim he stopped writing books because he was threatned, this is not so, Shaws stopped writing books when he was exposed having plagiated what he claimed being his 20 years research, from a Turkish "specialist" Uzun Jarsoglu(Shaw still openly deny the Armenian genocide, and comment, if what he claims was to be true, he would just not speak). Shaw and his Turkish wife Ezel Kural were the inniciators of the 70s Turkish government attempt to rewrite history. The article as well uses a work known as revisionist and consider it "balanced" from someone stationed at Istanbul trying to bring Armenians and Turks together by sharing responsabilities when the work itself isen't even seriously considered in the academic circle. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a> 00:42, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, let me explain to you about a few Wikipedia policies/rules regarding how "terrorism" is treated. At Wikipedia, we try to avoid controversial accusations whenever we can. For example, it would not be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> for us to label Hamas, PKK, IRA, Hezbollah, and Al-Qaeda as terrorist organizations. It is ok, however, to say that they are recognized as terrorist by a number of countries, but it's not ok to name-call.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Believe me Gokhan, I see definitely see <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> as terrorist, but it's just not acceptable to add my opinion to an article.

<p>First of all lets make one thing clear: ASALA as can be understood from its name is an organization aiming the "Liberation of Armenia" has nothing to do with the so-called genocide issue. The sole aim of ASALA was to create the imaginary big Armenia as depicted on their logo. The Armenian terrorist organization aiming the spread of Armenian genocide lie is JCAG as again can be understood from its name. About the Turkish homeland of Anatolia being a POV: Anatolia is the Turkish homeland since 1071 A.D., you don't know it learn it, can't get used to it (still!!!) get along with it. If you think the phrase can somehow to be considered a POV, please replace it with a NPOV version rather than deleting, because I see no POV in that. And most importantly, please stop deleting the list of assasinated Turkish diplomats and killed civilians by Armenians for it's withelding information.

<p>Well, you posted nothing but the regular Turkish falsifications. Saying "ASALA was not about the Genocide" is a new one, but belongs with the rest of them. Sorry, but the genocide was a central motivator of the ASALA activities, mentioned even in neutral websites such as tkb.org. The demand for Western Armenia is in fact intricately connected with the Genocide--since Turks used the Genocide to stop the lawful process of Western Armenia's independence, they shall return it back to Armenians (and that's what ASALA said as well).</p>
<p>By the way, aside from the fact that the homeland of Turks is Central Asia, just strictly speaking about the Ottoman Empire--the homeland of any empire is the area where the empire starts. So, the Western Anatolia and the Balkans are better qualified as the Ottoman homeland than Armenia. Armenia was added later, and was always the periphery of the empire, rather than the "center"--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 08:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The ASALA's goal was to inflict revenge on Turkish diplomats due to Turkey's non-recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This is stated in both the LoC's 1988 edition of "Turkey: A Country Study" as well as on the pro-Armenian website in the links section of this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I reverted the latest batch of edits that you added as they are not credible. Furthermore, the Santa Barbara attack by Gourgen Yanikian has nothing to do with the ASALA, it was a seperate attack. The ASALA didn't even operate in the United States as all, if not most of their attacks were carried out in Europe and the Middle East. Also, everything that you have added is uncited, uncredible, and not authoritative. Also, the statement of "the Turkish majority populated eastern Anatolia" is false. Even today, Turks did not constitute a solid majority in eastern Anatolia. Instead it is home to a majority Kurdish population (unless you wish to call them "Mountain Turks"). This, my friend, is a fact. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 12:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think there has been an error leading to deletion of my comment from the talk page, I'll just ignore it. Anyway, it was never mentioned that Yanikian was involved in ASALA, but the political situation leading to birth of ASALA can not be understood without examining and understanding its past. Sorry I forgot to cite my resources, I will. As for the Turkish majority populated eastern Anatolia" I was making comparison with the Armenian population more spesifically in the North-eastern Anatolia. But your comment "Turks did not constitute a solid majority in eastern Anatolia" is like saying "Americans do not constitute a solid majority in he US". A Turk is any Turkish citizen or resident in Turkey that considers him/her self to be a Turk regardless of his/her ethnic origin. However this kind of a description may be hard to understand for the racist ideology that divides everyone according to their ethnic or religious origins. I'm not the one to make that kind of a distinction.

<dd>That's ridiculous. In the United States, everybody is mixed. There are people living in our country from all walks of life and from practically every single country in the world. American society is anything but homogeneous. In Turkey, the situation is different as the majority of the population today are ethnic [Anatolian] Turks. This is true for the most part, until ones goes to eastern provinces like Van, Diyarbakır, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Ağrı, Batman, Şırnak, and Şanlıurfa where Kurds form the majority. There are also areas where groups such as Zazas, Georgians, Laz, and Hamshenis (who are Armenians themselves) constitute a majority. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 13:22, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your comments weren't deleted, at least not by me. I suppose Kagan the Genghiz in his constant fit of anger did it. His' were deleted since they had nothing to do with the topic of the page. As to your comments, Turkey is not America, Turks are an ethnicity, and stating that has nothing to do with racism--in fact suppressing other ethnicities (as the Turkish Constitution does) is. So, it would be misleading to the reader. And saying "majority Turkish population" is really irrelevant for the article. And we are not going to edit the name of the Armenian Genocide by "highly disputed" or whatever. It is the accepted name for the events in academia, and it should be used. As for the political situation that lead to ASALA--if we were to discuss it, we would have to go to the Armenian Genocide, not Yanikyan.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 13:20, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's the removed text:</p>
<p>The ASALA's most destructive attack was on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankara.html" title="Ankara">Ankara</a> at the <a href="../../../e/s/e/Esenboga_International_Airport_b876.html" title="Esenboga International Airport">Esenboga International Airport</a>, when its members targeted civilians for the first time. Two militants opened fire in a crowded passenger waiting room. One of shooters took more than 20 hostages while the second was apprehended by police. Altogether, nine people died and 82 were injured. The surviving militant Levon Ekmekjian condemned the ASALA in the aftermath of the attack and appealed to other members to leave and stop the violence. The Esenboga attack also precipitated a split in the group over tactics, between the Nationalists (<i>ASALA-Militant</i>) and the 'Popular Movement' (<i>ASALA-Mouvement Révolutionnaire</i>). Still, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, 1983, the ASALA carried out another devestating attack at the <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orly_Airport_7656.html" title="Orly Airport">Orly Airport</a> near <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. The attack gave the group a new nickname, the Orly Group. Afterwards, French forces promptly arrested those involved. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1986, the ASALA virtually ceased all attacks. Hagop Hagopian, one of the group's founders, was assassinated on a sidewalk in an affluent neighborhood in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, Greece on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_28.html" title="April 28">April 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. It is disputed whether Hagopian was assinated by the French secret services or Hovsep A., Vartan G., Garabed K., and Albert "Sultan-Minas", former ASALA members and close friends of Hagopian. His body was riddled by several shotgun rounds while he walking out with two women at 4:30 in the morning. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Tarakchian died of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> in 1980 and the group fell into inactivity. According to Turkish sources, the ASALA was repressed by a series of attacks by the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mill%C3%AE_%C4%B0stihbarat_Te%C5%9Fkil%C3%A2t%C4%B1_20a1.html" title="Millî İstihbarat Teşkilâtı">Turkish National Intelligence Organization</a> (<i>MIT</i>), some carried out by <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_%C3%87atl%C4%B1_65cd.html" title="Abdullah Çatlı">Abdullah Çatlı</a>, leader of the ultra-nationalist <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Wolves_f99c.html" title="Grey Wolves">Grey Wolves</a>, which worked in cooperation with the MIT and with <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladio.html" title="Gladio">Gladio</a> "stay-behind" NATO secret paramilitary organizations <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Throughout its history, the ASALA claimed the lives of 31 Turkish diplomats and embassy staff, including wives and children.</p>

<dd>There's no dispute of Hagopian's death. The French and Turkish authorities were left completely out of the loop as Hagopian had been constantly switching IDs and travelling from Greece to Yugoslavia. The closest suspects next to ASALA members were the Dashnaks who had been trying to track him for months. Its sounds gramatically wrong when you insert the French SS and then specifically mention the names of who did it. The assassins themselves admitted to the killings and they were not only friends to Hagopian but also his most trusted lieutenants. They carried out a series of other assassinations against former comrades-in-arms including at one time trying to kill <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Melkonian_5115.html" title="Monte Melkonian">Monte Melkonian</a> in Armenia.

<ul>
<li>1) <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artin_Penik_6270.html" title="Artin Penik">Artin Penik</a></li>
<li>2) Which states listed ASALA as a terrorist organization (According to reference, US did, as far as I know, France did too, so also Turkey and Azerbaijan)</li>
</ul>
<p>If ASALA is removed from their list, when was it removed?</p>
<ul>
<li>3) Other attacks, currently the article states only three attacks, ASALA attacked mostly embassies and consulates, those attacks (at least the ones claimed by ASALA) should be mentioned</li>
</ul>
<p>if we can find: It is stated that ASALA had 8 point manifesto, what were those eight points?</p>
<p>I am going to revert back, and remove 'Armenian SSR' part in the opening statement, remove PKK wikilink at the end. Let me also remove 'list of terrorist organisations' link.</p>
<p>ps. The 'neutral' reference link is dead, Armenian one takes too long (the connection times out whenever I try)</p>
<p>pps. I checked the pages on Pitman's book, where ASALA is mentioned (there are two such pages), we have the following sentence (I think the main page refers to this sentence):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unidentified Turkish government officials frequently have leaked reports to the news media accusing Armenia, Lebanon, and Syria of allowing Armenian terrorists to receive training and support within their borders.</dd>

<dd>Your current version is nonsense and is strongly bias and POV, whats your reason for removing the part about the Armenian Genocide? thats one of the main reasons this group was active and committing attacks, secondly removing this is really wrong, <i>In particular, the ceded territory would</i> to <i>The territory to be ceded would be th</i> since the paragraphs are enough. Artaxiad 23:58, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I did not remove any part about Armenian Genocide (if you are talking about 1.5 million, it wasn't me who removed it). I don't see why it's strongly biased and POV, can you please comment on including three things I mentioned above (also the other ones if you want to)? Also, about the 'ceded territory' sentence, I don't understand what the problem is. If you want to, we can add 'in particular' there, if that is the problem. I don't think removing 'in particular' made the article biased.</dd>

<p>Fedayee, I don't see why are you reverting the page. ASALA is a terrorist organization, according to definition of US State Department and even according to Armenians themselves <a href="http://www.netarmenie.com/informations/news/archives.php3?Annee=2001&amp;Mois=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.netarmenie.com/informations/news/archives.php3?Annee=2001&amp;Mois=4" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (read the first line, the rest I can translate if it's necessary).

<dd>Khoikhoi, my question was regarding category not regarding wording. According to your logic, I don't see why <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_%C3%87atl%C4%B1_65cd.html" title="Abdullah Çatlı">Abdullah Çatlı</a> should belong to terrorist category either. I will fix the problem immediately. However, this issue will be brought to attention of ArbCom as well, as one of the proposals. I don't see why <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASALA_768c.html" title="ASALA">ASALA</a> is different from <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaeda_48e2.html" title="Al Qaeda">Al Qaeda</a> with one being listed as terrorist category and others not. Fedayeen, your argument has no relevance to ArbCom Case. State Department considered ASALA as terrorist for the entire duration of its existence, not just for some of its time. Also, if "terrorist" category is not appropriate, I don't see why there is a category called terrorist at all. Artaxiad, yours as usual, simply ignored.

<dd>Go ahead report it. ASALA was considered as terrorist organization by the State Department, its leaders, including Monte Melkonian, were arrested and convicted on charges of terrorism in France and other European Countries for killing civilians in attacks. It's preposterous to exclude it from Terrorist category now, while some Palestinian, Chechen, etc. organization are in that category. I would love to hear why is that from ArbCom. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 02:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I did make my point clear. If there is a category called terrorism in Wikipedia, then ASALA definitely fits in it. If using using "terrorism" is against rules, then the category should not be there in first place. I am still waiting to get an explanation of that from Khoikhoi, who did not answer my question.

<dd>France is member of EU and EC, and as such, the laws, as well as responsibilities, are shared with all members of the European community. If one was convicted of terrorism in France, he is considered terrorist in the entire EC/EU. Meanwhile, there are other ASALA members who were convicted or tried on terrorism charges, such as Varujan Karapetian and Murad Topalian <a href="http://www.arf.am/English/ARFNews/1999/199910.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arf.am/English/ARFNews/1999/199910.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, between 1980-86, Armenian terrorism accounted for the second highest number of terrorist incidents in the United States.[FBI Analysis of Terrorist Incidents in the United States in 1986, p.53. U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Investigative Division, Terrorism Section.] According to the FBI, two Armenian groups were directly responsible for this terrorism: the left-wing “Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia” (ASALA) and the right-wing “Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide” (JCAG). Since 1973, Armenian terrorists have committed 239 acts of terrorism that have killed at least 70 and wounded 524 innocent people, mostly non-Turks. Armenian terrorists have taken 105 hostages, "executing" 12, one of them an American woman. The Armenian terrorist bombing campaign that accounted for at least 160 of the 239 attacks caused the vast majority of the deaths and injuries. In addition, the Armenian terrorist bombing campaign caused 160 incidents of property destruction, totaling several hundred million dollars in property damage in the United States, Europe, Middle East and Australia. Of the 239 terrorist attacks, 71 were conducted by Armenians from North America, and 30 occurred on American soil. Twenty-two terrorists from the Armenian American communities of North America were captured, tried, convicted, and incarcerated. The Federal authorities, led by then-Federal Agent and current ATF Marshall, Pete Elliot, used DNA evidence to link Topalian to weapons and explosives that were in turn linked to four major attacks by the nationalist, JCAG terror organization: (1) October 12, 1980, New York, Car bombing of the Turkish Center, Jewish American B’Nai Brith Center, and African American Center at the U.N Plaza; (2) June 3, 1981, Los Angeles, Bombing of the Orange County Convention Center in Anaheim, site of an Evangelical Convention and Turkish folkdance and music show; (3) November 20, 1981, Los Angeles, Bombing of the Turkish Consulate building in Beverly Hills; and, (4) October 22, 1982, Los Angeles, Attempted bombing of the offices of Philadelphia Honorary Turkish Consul General by four JCAG members recruited from the Armenian Youth Federation (AYF) (a fifth JCAG co-conspirator is arrested at Logan International Airport in Boston the same day). On June 12, 2005, NBC Dateline’s segment, “Time Bomb”, reported that Topalian acquired and stored weapons and explosives in a public storage facility near a childcare center, public school, gas station, and major highway near Cleveland. The explosives, dating back to the late 1970s, were deteriorating and highly volatile. Agent Elliot expressed that had the arsenal ignited and exploded, it would have killed at least 750 people, mostly children. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 18:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
