<p>This talk page, imo, should have been undeleted when <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_Llor%C3%A9ns-Sar_8de9.html" title="Armando Lloréns-Sar">the article</a> was undeleted.</p>
<p>Was there ever any decision about what <i>should</i> happen to I've seen claims that it's currently under study by the Foundation and claims that it's not. I've seen claims that it's under truce, and that it's not.</p>
<p>The article is currently a redirect to <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a>, which seems to be the worst of both worlds -- it acknowledges that Armando of Daily Kos is yet does not actually give any information about him.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've got a very very rough draft of an article in progress, so please help flesh it out. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoriSmith_8697.html" title="User:DoriSmith">Dori</a> 00:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was gonna revert to the last acceptable version of the article last night and post an AfD to find community consensus, but WP acted up and I haven't gotten around to doing it today. I agree, there should be a community decision over this, and individual editors shouldn't try to override this. To be clear, my sympathies in this case are more on Armando's than on the NRO's side, but that doesn't override truthfinding. The main issue I think is that the editors of an entry need to show that this made more than a minuscule splash in the non-blogging world. So far, I haven't found much. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:50, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My take on this is that it isn't about whether or not this one event "made more than a minuscule splash in the non-blogging world." I think it's about whether or not someone who's enough of a public figure to speak about politics on NPR and at Stanford should have a Wikipedia article (obviously, I think yes). Once that's determined, <i>then</i> it's a separate question as to whether or not it should include mention of this particular controversy. Let's take this one step at a time. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoriSmith_8697.html" title="User:DoriSmith">Dori</a> 02:57, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, also, if you were actually personally involved in this you might want to take a backseat in the editing process, or otherwise you're putting yourself in a situation where any of your edits can be reverted.

<p>It's a clear attack page which does not belong in Wikipedia. It was used to "out" the subject in real life, and threaten his livelihood. But DR does not address content.

<p><a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a>, there was never a consensus for a redirect, especially not in the 1st AfD. The word "merge" appears only once on the 1st AFD, the word redirect not at all. There is clearly no consensus for a contentless redirect as you just performed. Stop lying to suit your purposes, and stop deleting secondary-sourced information. If the community consensus of Merge and Redirect emerges (which is far from clear yet, I count 9 Merge, 12 Keep), it will be properly performed by an independent administrator. And stop accusing me of doing anti-consensus edits without proper evidence. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:29, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very well. however, plenty of sources, as indicated at the AfD, have used his name. The moves are not necessary, and having the page at his name is entirely permissable.

<dd>Is he better known as "Armando" or as "Armando L-S?" If A, the article should be at Armando (blogger).

<dl>
<dd>I think the crux of his expanded nobility comes from B. He's only known to Daily kos readers as "Armando," he's known as "Armando Llroens-Sar" or however you spell it to those same readers, as well as readers of <i>The New Republic</i>, listeners to certain NPR segments, and to <i>National Review</i> readers. If this article was being created without the "outing" controversy, i'd agree with you. Not here. Besides, there's plenty of precedent in other non-political areas - take a look at any pro-wrestling article. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:10, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The TNR article - the only secondary source for the name (blogs are not RS, everything else has been primary), refers to him repeatedly as "Armando." It refers repeatedly to Markos Moulitsas as "Moulitsas" and Jerome Armstrong as "Armstrong." In fact, it only writes 3 times, and all in one paragraph, compared to 8 Armandos spread across 4 paragraphs. Why would they do this? <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:17, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The NRO is an extension of the magazine. It's not a "blog" in the sense of what we know blogs to be, and I'm perfectly willing to abide by a <i>neutral</i> (i.e., an uninvolved party from RfC and not someone you or I dig up) third party's opinion on the matter. Stephen Sprueill, who posted the entry, is a regular columnist for the magazine, and it would be akin to eliminating something Buster Olney reported on his ESPN Insider blog because "it's a blog." ESPN, like <i>National Review</i>, are respected reliable sources. Meanwhile, TNR does use his name - it's on page 16 of the 26 June print edition sitting right in my lap - and other sources like NPR are NOT primary. In fact, I'm going to flip-flop a little bit and say that the law firm website may not, in fact, qualify as a <i>primary</i> source for his name, as it is a <i>secondary</i> source not provided by him, but rather his employers. I certainly have no interest in battling over whether his law firm's web site is a primary source for his name or not, but the point is that there's certainly an argument to be made. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here's the thing about compromise - you have to do it also. If I had his buisness card right here, would that be a secondary source because it was printed by the company and not Armando? TNR uses his name, like I said, 3 times in 1 paragraph, refering to him as Armando throughout the rest of the article unless they changed it for the in-print version. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:47, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They didn't, but it doesn't matter if they continued to call him "Armando," the point is that his name is public, published, and verified by a third party source. The rest is just window dressing in terms of the policy, which is what you're using as your rationale. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I argue above that the article should be at Armando (blogger). Above, you disagree. TNR agrees with me, refering to him numerous times as Armando. You believe that it is permissable (thought you have yet to take a position) on where the article should be.

<dd>Re wrestlers, from a recent debate on the subject (I suggest people here NOT get involved) "There is a large precedent for using wrestlers' real names as their wikipedia articles and, although Calaway is highly unlikely to gain wrestling acclaim under any other name and will likely be known as the undertaker to most people, this article is foremost about the person (hence the "shoot" information and discussion of his life outside of his character), and secondary about the character gimmick." Looking at the most offensively BLP violating version of this article (and noting, again the fact that wikipedia is biased to current events taking up far, far too much space - witness <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_David_Josephson_bc33.html" title="Brian David Josephson">Brian David Josephson</a>, who is a world-renound, nobel-prize winning physicist who also recently began embarassing himself recently about crazy psychics - 70% psychic, 30% physics!), the article was, by word count 118/30, 80% about blogging 20% about being exposed/personal details
<dl>
<dd>I still see no BLP-violating version in the history, however, at least concerning the facts within the article. The only part you continually claim fails BLP is his name, from what I've observed, and plenty of sources exist to fulfill the requirement. If I'm wrong, please tell me. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC) --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We differ on the degree of BLP violation. The MOST EGGREIOUS version, in my opinion, is still only 20% revealing his name, 80% blogger. The only think I believe violates BLP is stuff that was not printed by TNR. Anything printed by TNR does not violate BLP. If you can cite TNR for your information, I'm fine with it. TNR says that ARMANDO is known as , not that is known as Armando. They call him by ARMANDO over and over, and very rarely. I suggest you read fully what I write before responding - your faliure to address my "the bulk of the article is about Armando (blogger)" demonstrates that you are not doing so. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:47, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Do we truly believe that information about Armando's job title, clients and his activities are competently verifiable, or do people just really want it in there because it meshes with their worldview? I'll say that I feel that it is innapropriate of the encyclopedia to expose people who took active steps to not be exposed - and doubt it not, we were the verifing exposers here (the genesis of the NRO article were diffs in wikipedia combined with the malicious anonymous email by the individual inserting those diffs, along with armandoatdailykos' hamhanded attempts to get rid of said informations public perview). I think it tarnishes our reputation, and the only reason that the push is still on is that political POV warriors are damaging the encyclopedia, yet again. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 22:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Generally unknown" or not, it was a matter of public knowledge and record before it was added here, Armando almost certainly drew attention to it, didn't really care as much when he put his name out there on NPR, and even if NONE of that occurred, and NRO still broke a story about who he was, it would meet the inclusions standards now. Mentioning it does not violate <i>any</i> standards on living people whatsoever, as it is extremely well-sourced and does not pose a threat to his livelihood, employment, safety, or anything else. It's out there, and we would be lax (and it could very well become a non-political POV issue) if we leave it out of here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:46, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jeff, please figure out what the discussion is about before jumping in. Try reading the context of the discussion and figuring out what it's about first, and then find something relevant to say. I was talking about Silensor's whitewash, not whether this article should exist. It obviously shouldn't, because attack articles and articles designed to harrass are speedy-able. It's an embarrassment to the project that people would argue to keep an article designed to threaten the subject's livelihood. But that wasn't what Silensor removed from the article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 01:54, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm quite aware what this is about, actually. If you can come up with any argument as to why a line of information that was published in two magazines with readership in the hundreds of thousands, countless other websites, and on NPR is somehow going to threaten his livelihood, I'll be glad to retract my statements on this. You need to take a look at what constitutes an attack page, as well as re-read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, specifically <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Public_figures" title="WP:BLP">here</a>.

<dd>More to the point, he clearly wasn't too concerned that his law firm could find out. Maybe the Stanford conference and the NPR appearance didn't make waves in the world at large, but the likelihood that someone in your firm reads this is much higher, and if you're worried about your job (btw, how many law partners are?) you take more precautions to protect your anonimity. Like, pick a handle that's not your first name for starters. Besides, what actual evidence of on-the-job harassment do we have other than A's own "Help, help, I'm being harassed!"? Last time I checked he was still at it at SwordsCrossed (same combative style) and announcements of his firing aren't forthcoming either. To me this looks like Armando used a little strategic maneuver to discredit his opponents <s>and Guettarda fell for it hook, line and sinker</s>. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 02:14, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To answer your question, his sigline has changed as of late if it indeed says he'll be back in December. I think the DKos blogging program changes sigs automatically and doesn't do so by when it's posted (unlike, say, wiki software which will convert the four tildes to the signature of the moment). It could be worth noting if we can find a quick cache to verify the change. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:20, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

However, the reference in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> to primary sources is a not even a full guideline (<i>Material from primary sources should <b>generally</b> not be used.</i> — <b>emphasis</b> added), and the examples seem to refer to public records which might be difficult to find, rather than such sources as conference proceedings.

<dd>How silly to think I'd edit war with the intent to get someone fired during an RfA. I have a vested interest in this article, as all articles, reflecting what's known and what's verifiable. Whether you like it or not, a) who he works for and b) who he has served are both important parts of the story of his semi-retirement from blogging and the flap surrounding it. More to the point, the information is verifiable, notable, and meets every available standard, contrary to what's continually asserted. To not include this information is a POV issue. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considered by him, sure. Of course, as BLP, which you claim to be familiar with, states: "If an allegation or incident is notable, relevant, and well-documented by reliable published sources, it belongs in the article — even if it's negative and the subject dislikes all mention of it." Is the information you keep removing notable? Yes. Relevant? Yes. Well documented by reliable published sources? Yes. So it meets the criteria, so "it belongs in the article," even though it could be considered "negative" and "the subject dislikes all mention of it." If it's NOT in here, the information is still public - it's a non-issue, and our addition should not affect anything, it does no harm, as it's been widely disseminated.

<dd>If I understand <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a>'s point, the relevant information is that he works for law firm X in Puerto Rico? What makes this notable? The fact that it's a fact? The law firm? The blogger? The clients he or the firm defends? Why would the latter be notable? Does he defend mobsters? Drug dealers? Big corporations? These may be unseemly, but it's all legal, and certainly within the confines of ethical legal practice. Why would this be any more notable than other piece of trivia for what I consider to be a pretty low-level "celebrity". I personally don't care much either way, but in this instance I think the "borderline clause" brought up by Guettarda clearly applies. --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 20:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not even borderline is the point. It's POV pushing. Why is it relevant? Because the firm works for various corporate clients, and these are the same types that Armando rails against in his blogging. That's what made this an issue, and why it made two major publications. If he worked at Greenpeace or something, it wouldn't make a difference. Instead, the "it'll harm his career" excuse is trotted out even though it's widely public knowledge. I'm not sure why this is an issue unless it's a POV situation - the wiki guidelines are extremely clear on this. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:01, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK let me get this straight: If you're a moderately successful blogger and have railed against spending on certain kinds of weapons systems, then if your daytime employer gets DARPA funding to support your computer science research, advertising that fact is fair game for a WP article? --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 21:13, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it's become widely distributed knowledge, yes. If it hasn't been reported anywhere, of course not, and I'd definitely be on Hipocrite's and Guettarda's side on this if it wasn't reported at all. But it's hard to justify leaving it out when it's relevant to his semi-retirement, cited as part of the reason by TNR and NRO, and the information has been available prior to this "outing" flap. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:16, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't see the name of the law firm is relevant to his retirement. He didn't retire because he worked at that particular law firm. He retired because he didn't like being so publicly visible in a way that could threaten the relationship to his employer. If you say "it was his fault"; maybe. However, with expenditure of enough work, anybody can be outed in similar ways. Even the hypothetical guy whose employer gets darpa funding; what difference does the amount of work required to make the info public matter?</dd>
<dd>As I see it, the only thing that justifies putting it in is the fact that it's a fact <s>(or perhaps as vindictiveness)</s>. I'm just pointing out that I think the borderline clause applies.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 21:38, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>PS. I think most contributors here are acting in good faith-- the motivation is "the fact that it's a fact" argument.

<dd>The justification is because it's a fact and because it's descriptive of what he does in the real world and blogging world.

<dd>The "fact that it's a fact" is however, insufficient reason for inclusion. There are an infinite number of facts.</dd>
<dd>You seem to be saying that it's relevant to point out the verifiable fact the individual A. "rails" against corporations while working for a law firm that represents them legally? OK I don't read dKos regularly, so I don't know for a fact that he "railed" against corporations (from my reading of dKos, I do know he supported W Clark, "railed" against the US invasion of Iraq, and thought theories of electoral fraud in 2004 were on the fringe, but I don't have a complete picture of what things he actually "railed" against.) I still believe this is setting a questionable criterion publicizing non-notable facts about a relatively minor individual. non-notable, because the facts show no violation of any law or legal ethical principle, he is not running for office, he is not advocating action against corporations, he is not as best I can tell financially benefitting from any of this. Whatever principle you propose, "do no harm" is also policy which has been applied by Jimbo in broadly similar circumstances on WP.

<dd>In the instance I mentioned (which I will be happy to supply you by Email) the article and all references to this individual (a relatively minor entrepreneur, with a relatively minor public presence and relatively minor publications) on various talk pages were deleted as per the individual's own request on a talk page. There were no legal threats made (as best I could tell). Many of the pages were deleted by Wales himself.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 19:16, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whether Armando wants them deleted is irrelevant to this discussion per WP:BLP. To define <i>The New Republic</i> and <i>National Review</i> as "relatively minor" is scraping the bottom, and I see nothing in Jimbo's contribution history or deletion logs showing that he's as much as seen this article. Obviously, if the Foundation decides otherwise, then it'll be dealt with right now, but I see nothing convincing any caused harm here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Per your request, I won't divulge the information you gave me, but the difference was that this person's article went through an AfD, and the consensus was to delete. If that occurs with this article, then there's not much else to say about it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:43, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It actually went through several AfD's. It was only finally deleted when the individual in question requested its deletion (requested in a verifiable manner). Note also that at least one talk page was blanked (at least one year) before the final AfD by Wales. Actually, I (mildly) complained to Wales on that action, seeing it as a possible form of censorship.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 20:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>well, i'm saying that, regardless of what Jimbo did (and he's in charge, but he really shouldn't have), it still went through the community, and people still disagreed with it. If the consensus is that the article goes, that's one issue, but it doesn't mean we have to censor ourselves in the meantime. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:08, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are some points in the article that are mysterious to me. I am not familiar with the Daily Kos web-site.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the columnists there called "front-page diarists", or was that term invented for this article? If the latter, it should be clarified. I am led to understand from the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> article that users can write "diaries", which are akin to personal blogs, but I am confused as to what a front page diary is. Is a "front page diarist" one whose diary entries are automatically featured on the front page?</li>
<li>The reference to Mr. Moulistas' "book writing hiatus" is unclear to the uninitiated. What precisely is meant by it? Did Mr. Moulistas leave the Daily Kos site on a sabbatical when writing his book (Which book, by the way, Crashing the Gates? It should be referenced if so.) leaving Armando in charge, or was he (Markos) still associated with the site?</li>
</ol>

<dd><i>Editor</i> signals a different kind of involvement, yes, as the terms are used differently in journalistic practice. If you checked the edit history you will note that I haven't tried to edit the TPM language in, as it doesn't meet my criteria for inclusion.

<dd>Dicty, front-page diarists are the four or five members that Kos selects each year to be regular contributors. There are certain days e.g. weekends or when he's out of town when they have unrestricted access to the front page; at other times he promotes them himself. Anyone else has to get their diary "noticed" by others -- via the vote function, diary rescue, etc. -- before they have a chance to be promoted. (This includes politicians like Jimmy Carter or Nancy Pelosi.) It's very like a contributing editor position, but that is the term of art at DK. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 02:18, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just made significant edits to the article, assuuming the piece will not be deleted and that reference to my full name will be included.</p>
<p>I leave the reference to my name.</p>
<p>I link to discussions of my outing by NRO which discusses in detail the underlying issues although the crucial and initial role of Wikipedia is not mentioned. I refrain from mentioning Wikipedia's role in this affair in deference to the project.</p>
<p>I believe the piece now is as fair as it can be given the insistence on including my name. I have removed the salacious, gossipy links (which are clearly inappropriate for an encyclopedoa entry) and instead included James Joyner's balanced account, which came after extensive communications with Steven Spruiell and myself on the issue. It is utterly superior to the TNR link, which discusses Yearly Kos in the main, and me only in passing. Joyner's article is about me and my outing.--Armandoatdailykos 11:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On my editss - point NOT taken.</p>
<p>"While Wikipedia discourages people from writing new articles about themselves or expanding existing ones significantly, subjects of articles remain welcome to edit articles to correct inaccuracies or to remove inaccurate or unsourced material."</p>
<p>I corrected significant inaccuracies and edited the piece to reflect the alleged rationale for the article and inclusion of my name and my withdrawal from blogging. The links to TNR do not discuss the issue of my outing and is inaccurate in many respects about it.</p>
<p>James Joyner, a conservative blogger, who spoke to both me and NRO, and who does not agree with me on the issue, wrote about the issue of me and my outing, conflicts of interest, etc.</p>
<p>No reasonable person can doubt it is the superior link. Frankly, it would be absurd to argue otherwise UNLESS your desire was to have anrticle that discussed the GOSSIP of my circumstances rather than the substance of what occurred in sober rational fashion.--Armandoatdailykos 16:04, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I STRONGLY object. I find it hard to understand how you can make this comment given my desire that my name be excluded in toto.</p>
<p>Armando the Blogger, the subject of this piece, is NOT notable because of my real name. I think including my name is frankly, an affront, but it seems that Wikipedia does not abide by its own guidelines.</p>
<p>What is your basis for making this edit? Because it is confirmed is a reason for putting it in the opening sentence? Why? What kind of logic is that?</p>
<p>I am reverting.--Armandoatdailykos 15:51, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I did noy see any change.--Armandoatdailykos 15:58, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Somewhat ironically, to not make that change would be in violation of guidelines. It's your point of view that you're not notable because of the events surrounding you as well as your blogging, and we adhere to a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> here. Furthermore, again, there's a guideline involving <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">writing about yourself</a> that you might be interested in. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ironically, I would be very interested to see the guideline that you think supports your assertion.</p>
<p>As to my writing about myself, again you need to better familiarize yourself with the Wikipedia guidelines. They permit subjects to correct inaccurate and unfairly presented information. That is exactly what I did.</p>
<p>With due respect Jeff, this is now the fourth or fifth time you have misstated Wikipedia guidelines regarding this article. On each occasion, you have misstated the Wikipedia guidelines to my detriment.</p>
<p>At this point, you are NOT a neutral observer, if for no other reason, I have embarrassed you in this discussion. I am the subject of this article so my input should at least be heard.</p>
<p>Do you not think that recusal by you at this point would be advisable? You are clearly now acting as a partisan against me and my wishes. You simply are not a neutral observer.--Armandoatdailykos 16:09, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And Jeff, you may want to refamiliarize yourself with the definition of autobiography. This is NOT one. Or rather, if it is, then the article should be deleted because I do not want it published.--Armandoatdailykos 16:12, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And nothing presented has been a) incorrect, or b) unfairly presented. You may dislike the material that's there, but it's not unfairly presented or in error. If some of it is, we're still waiting for the evidence. I have yet to misstate any guidelines, although many have here during this discussion to the detriment of the article and to WP's guidelines.</dd>
<dd>As for your request that I recuse myself as I'm "not a neutral observer," nonsense. I'm as neutral an observer as you, Hipocrite, and anyone else coming in here, and I await any further input from third parties via the RfC to work this out if need be. I certainly won't be bullied around by you. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Excuse me, if you believe Hipocrite should recuse himself then make your argument. As a partisan against me, it is for you to advocate for such action. I am arging that you should recuse because of your patent bias against me. For example, the errors were myriad. And yet you say there were none. Your errors on Wiki guidelines have been numerous in this discussion as well.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think ANYONE should recuse themselves. If there WERE errors, then please, point them out so we can keep them out of what i hope will become a stable version. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:12, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But to provide one example of your error here - the article reported that I am a regular commenter on numerous media outlets on politics. This is false in all particulars. Rather than argue the particualrs with persons like you, I edited the article to make it accurate by stating WITH SPECIFICITY every public appearance I made. I also specified the places where Armando the Blogger was identified as Armando Llorens with ABSOLUTE specificity. I find it remarkable disingenuous and par for the course of this whole charade that after falling ovr yourself insisting how clear it was that I had identified myself publically you NOW object to my editing the article to specifiy EXACTLY when this occurred and when it did not. You object to precision, accuracy and specificity in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Funny, it seems like we agree on this. I allege you've been identified publically numerous times, and you provide specific examples. Sounds like good teamwork, certainly more than I've gotten elsewhere thus far. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:12, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
