<p>I'm not sure about US usage, and I know Wikipedia isn't a dictionary, but I always thought "military" was an adjective not a noun. The page seems to describe "army" or "military organisation". <a href="../../../m/s/w/User%7EMswake_21bb.html" title="User:Mswake">Mswake</a> 02:22 Jul 30, 2002 (PDT)</p>
<p>Hmmmm, I'm not certain either. If someone want's to move it, so be it.</p>
<p>The ending isn't very good right now. When I'm more motivated, I'll come back and flesh it out. Anyone want to give it a crack? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobdobbs1723_0a85.html" title="User:Bobdobbs1723">Dobbs</a> 20:56 Sep 16, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>English makes verbs out of nouns and nouns out of adjectives all the time. It's quite common to speak of the armed forces as "the military", but I suppose "armed forces" probably is better. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>
<p>Yes, military <i>is</i> a noun. For example, "The military engineered a <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</a></i>." --<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> 20:58, Mar 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>A few things.</p>
<p>Armed force is the use of force when one is armed, strictly speaking. I find the association a bit strained. I think army, or military organization may be better, but I can live with this. But do redirects (as from Military) stay forever? I think this is important, because all the links at the bottom (i.e. Military Science, Military History, Military tactics, Military technology and equipment and Military academy, Military incompetence, military fiat) all have military in them, after all.....</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Armed force" is a noun as well as a verb; "The armed forces of the</dd>
<dd>United Kingdom". Synonym of "Armed service".</dd>
<dd>Yes, I believe redirects stay until manually removed - <a href="../../../k/h/e/User%7EKhendon_2ad2.html" title="User:Khendon">Khendon</a> 14:11 Sep 26, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think that came out right. I meant to say that it is premissible to say "He used armed force against his wife's lover." without having anything to do with armed forces. It just doesn't sound quite like the correct word, especially if someone was doing a search of the Wikipedia to find information.<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobdobbs1723_0a85.html" title="User:Bobdobbs1723">Dobbs</a> 14:43 Sep 26, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the edit to remove what some may consider to be United States bias may be a bit premature. I used an example - (A citizen army (also known as a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>, or <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a> in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>)) because I know the name of the national guard without looking it up. Is it the Home Guard in Britain? What about Germany, Bundesweir (?)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, that was an honest mistake. I cut it out intending to put it</dd>
<dd>in a list of a few examples a little further down, but then forgot. The</dd>
<dd>British equivalent is the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Army_c362.html" title="Territorial Army">Territorial Army</a>, but it isn't</dd>
<dd>primarily a skeleton force in the way you describe. (Nor is its main role</dd>
<dd>home defense, by the way - it is organised to provide support to the</dd>
<dd>Regular Army. Conventional home defense is officially considered so</dd>
<dd>remote a possibility that it's not worth preparing for. I mention</dd>

<dd>No problem. The current National Guard system isn't quite a skeleton as well. It is currently formed of long term veterans (many from the Gulf war), who are can be better than their enlisted counterparts (due to having been in a real war). But the basic idea remains to provide a balance between thrift and usefulness. And like the British, we don't expect it to defend the country from invasion either! &lt;GRIN&gt; <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobdobbs1723_0a85.html" title="User:Bobdobbs1723">Dobbs</a> 14:43 Sep 26, 2002 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The point of specifing the existence of these guard organizations (much more well trained and organized than what a militia implies), is that their formation (I think it was first by the Swiss, but I have to check) was the tool used by national governments in the mid to late 1900's to form mass armies for combat in WWI. Without the balance between economic and military needs that national guard organizations provide, WWI could not of been fought on the scale it was, or provide practice for truly huge WWII formations. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobdobbs1723_0a85.html" title="User:Bobdobbs1723">Dobbs</a> 13:52 Sep 26, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Most militaries are divided into an army, a navy, and an air force."</p>
<p>This is incorrect, but I see where <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadrunner_b57c.html" title="User:Roadrunner">User:Roadrunner</a> is trying to go. No landlocked countries have a navy, and most coastal countries don't either. A few customs patrol boats don't really constitute a Navy in the sense of this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>No landlocked countries have a navy</i>" Basically this is correct, but <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolivia.html" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, which is a landlocked country, maintains a nominal navy, mainly because it used to have a coastline and lost it to Chile. So they keap a boat or two in that large lake (I forget how to spell it) and call it their navy.
<dl>
<dd>Zaire also has a navy see <a href="http://www.1upinfo.com/country-guide-study/zaire/zaire191.html" class="external free" title="http://www.1upinfo.com/country-guide-study/zaire/zaire191.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.1upinfo.com/country-guide-study/zaire/zaire191.html</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The same goes with the army / air force distinction. The larger militaries have separate forces, but most militaries (police armies, actually) are just the guys with guns in the country, no matter what those guns are attached to, people or aircraft.</p>
<p>And with the advent of Goldwater-Nichols (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_armed_forces_907c.html" title="United States armed forces">United States armed forces</a>), the United States (the largest military in terms of force projection, and lethality, but not troops) may have separate services, but are commanded as a combined arms force. So 'divided' is in terms of training and support, not doctrine or command - which I would argue is much more important as a distinction. This also applies to NATO, as was shown in the combined arms doctrine employed in the first use of the basics of AirLand battle in the Second Gulf War in 1991 against Iraq.</p>
<p>So most militaries (in terms of number of troops) have separate services. But most militaries have (in terms of number of countries) a single army that may or may not operate aircraft. Finally most militaries (in terms of force projection) have a single military with specialists in air, naval, ground, and space systems. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobdobbs1723_0a85.html" title="User:Bobdobbs1723">Dobbs</a> 02:50 Sep 30, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it wrong to say that it would be better to spend money towards improving lives instead of ending them? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBensaccount_5cd4.html" title="User:Bensaccount">Bensaccount</a> 00:25, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't say that it's "wrong," but it does express a particular point of view that a lot of people would consider an oversimplification. I do happen to agree with you that the world's money (which is really a metaphor for the use of the world's human skill &amp; energy) would be much better spent elsewhere, but the purpose of armed forces is more complicated than just "ending lives," as you imply, although at the bottom line, that is what they do. Nominally, the main purpose of a country's maintaining an armed force is for defense against other countries which have them, and that puts the entire world in a great catch-22 since no one has yet managed to convince everyone simultaneously to forswear violence, even though it is now somewhat possible with spy satellites and other means (arguably, the United Nations' weapons inspections) to be sure of compliance. That probably won't happen anytime soon largely due to smaller nations' fear of economic subjugation by larger nations, where if they find themselves in a cycle of what amounts to slave labor to developed countries, they could, in theory, fight for greater equality. Unless, of course, the biggest nation of them all outdoes itself by keeping up an army ridiculously more advanced than anyone else's so that it can stay in control. Back and forth. And that's a biased oversimplification too, albeit longer. hmm. Anyway, I feel that your statement expresses unneeded bias because it reduces what is probably the world's most complicated, ages-old problem to a simple economic binary choice: spend money improving lives or ending them. It hides the forest with trees. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAratuk_a7c2.html" title="User:Aratuk">Aratuk</a> 13:08, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes it is wrong. Many individuals, rulers and nations as well as companies derive many benefits and great profit from the military. Doing away with it, even if possible, would be detrimental to them.

<p>I would like to find a list of noteable Military victories/defeats, things that helped reshape military thought, or were the catalyst of a war's outcome. Lessons learned, etc.</p>
<p>However, the first ones I know of are Brienne (Notable Defeat, WW2), Pickett's Charge (Noteable Defeat, US CivWar), Custer's Last Stand (which place to put it?)</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just change it to notable battles. Or something that reflects <i>learning through battles</i>. I think a special place should be made for those that demonstrated a latter epiphany.

<p>So that mean the Army of the UK is not a Armed Force? For the UK is not a nation-state, tis a multi-nation state (the four nations), and quite a number of countries today are not 'nation-states'. Could change it to: "Armed forces are the military forces of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>." or something. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurek_118c.html" title="User:Kurek">Kurek</a></p>

<p>i've asked on the appropriate pages but never got an answer. I have a question on rank on homework. the geneva convention outlines commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers and "men". compared to the united states army ranks, which ones fall into the three categories? i've got listed that both privates (E-1 % E-2) and private first class are "men". the corporal and sargeant ranks are NCOs and the officer ranks are commissioned officers. is this correct? also, is it universal for paygrades to automatically fit into one of the three categories?</p>

<p>I think the Benefits &amp; costs section would provide a very good start point to a full article on Defence Economics, Military Economics, or the Economics of Armed Conflict. I did a search and don't see anything on this (I expected to find something under military or warfare). --MCG|<a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMCG_6354.html" title="User talk:MCG"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 30 Aug 06</p>
