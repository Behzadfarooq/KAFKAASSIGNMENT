<p>I would like to see a citation for this statement: "<i>As with various other ethnic minorities who lived in the Soviet Union during Stalin's Great Purge, millions of innocent Armenians were executed and deported.</i></p>
<p>The Purge itself may have been responsible for the deaths of several hundred thousand people across the Soviet Union, but the idea that Stalin engaged in political murder on a scale of "millions" in the case of Armenians is absurd.</p>
<p>Soviet agricultural policy in the late 1920s and early 1930s certainly played a role in widespread famine throught the former USSR, but "executed" is quite a rhetorical stretch for what was essentially boneheaded policy and a Soviet bureaucracy that was slow to react to mass starvation. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorymike_ae6a.html" title="User:Historymike">historymike</a> 00:19, 1 Aug 2006 (UTC)</p>

The following is a list of the province names, some of which need to be changed I think. The transliteration scheme is way too complicated and not what is used as a matter of course in Armenia. I have put the old and complicated name in (parenthesis) and believe they should only be shown in parenthesis where the technical transliteration, and not common is of interest.

<p>Armenia Belongs to the Southern Caucus region not the middle east. It appears you have forgotten it also belonged to the former Soviet Union for some time. So one cannot say with certainty that Armenia is just "another middle eastern country." By the way this tone your taking contains a certain racists undertone.</p>

<p>I know there are disagreements between many people on whether or not Armenia is a European country. Until we resolve this solution, do we need this template.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent revert of my edit</span></h2>
<p>I thought that my edits nature was clear enough to not need to justify it(the edit in itself was minor). But it seems that it wasn't since it was reverted. I changed the range of figure of those having perished, to hundreds of thousands, because it is a less precis figure and is agreed by both parties involved. The Turkish government figures of Armenians that died is well under a million, so it needed to be presented, unless the figure of victims was less precise as to include both position. I also made it hyperlink to present the entry regarding Armenian casulties. I also changed the term killed for perished, because again, this term is enough to not creat a possible later revert of changes by those that deny the Armenian genocide. Not all were directly killed, so perished is a more appopriate term. And finally, my last edit regarding the Turkish government, was because I sensed a POV, as to present that dispite the evidences presented the Turkish government deny the event... this part is a taking of position. And even thought I know the genocide happened, doesn't change the fact that the way that sentence was written was POV. I hope this explaination is enought so that I don't end up with another revert, as I am not really interested to revert back such a minor edit. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a> 01:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You reduce the figures from 1.5-to-one million dead, into hunderds of thousands — that is <u>not</u> a minor edit (!). If you wish to cite Turkish figures for the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>, you can do so in parentheses. Second: <code>the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> government claims that these events amounted to 'genocide',</code> is <u>not</u> a minor edit, either (again). At any event, <a href="http://www.turkishembassy.org/governmentpolitics/issuesarmenian.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.turkishembassy.org/governmentpolitics/issuesarmenian.htm" rel="nofollow">Embassy of the Republic of Turkey, Washington, DC</a> claims that "the Armenian deaths do not constitute genocide."

<dd>First of, hundreds of thousands is not reducing the number of victims. I linked that part to another entry which present the range of casulties. The reason why I edited it that way was because those range presented 1-1.5 million, were presented as absolute fact. I rather changed that to something that would not have required both positions to be presented, and you'll understand that once Turks start editing that part and the whole thing become a revert war. Second of, true that was my mistake(that the Turkish government recognize the genocide), I forgot the "not" word there, which changed the meaning of the phrase, but you could have edited that part out by adding it instead of reverting the entire thing out. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a> 06:24, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've noticed that the amount of information on the genocide on this page has been gradually growing over time, and obviously attracting more attention and disputes. I would hate to see an {{npov}} on this page, and so I believe that information on the genocide should be kept to a minimum here. The paragraph comparing it to other genocides especially seems out of place. I think that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;oldid=11793751" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;oldid=11793751" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> better represents what the paragraph should look like. You may consider just using the text from there, maybe expanding it just a little, since it seems to be much less POV that the current one. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAramgutang_2d19.html" title="User:Aramgutang">Aram</a><b><a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAramgutang_2b17.html" title="User talk:Aramgutang">գուտանգ</a></b><a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 12:21, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it is required to say that Armenians say this, it is misleading. I don't even think that Armenians have a position that really differ from the "official" Academic position that would require to devide it. What is termed as the Armenian genocide, is claimed to be a state sponsered destruction. This is not agreed by everyone, but this was why the term "generally" is used there. On the other hand, the Turkish position, or the Turkish government position, is different enough from what might be termed as "official" position, to be separated and included. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 03:03, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The best source here is Soviet language statistical data from 1989, it is produced by asking the Soviet citicens. It says that of 4 623 232 Armenians, 352 136 had Russian as a first language, and 2 178 212 had Russian as a second language. That gives a percentage of monolingual Armenians in the Soviet Union at appr. 45 %, approximately 46 % bilingual Armenians with Armenian as a first language, and appr. 6 % Armenians speaking only Russian. The data, quoted from Soviet GOS publications, are available online at <a href="http://www.hum.uit.no/a/trond/s89.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hum.uit.no/a/trond/s89.html" rel="nofollow">my website</a>.

<p>The "increasing" adjective for "emigration" was apparently incorrectly assumed by Sdrawkcab in his edit on 21:36, October 19, 2005 (his edit available at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;diff=25951753&amp;oldid=25652403" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;diff=25951753&amp;oldid=25652403" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;diff=25951753&amp;oldid=25652403</a>).

<dd>That's rubbish. There are Armenian Genocide monuments in Iran, Syria, as well as Lebanon. Most countries in that region are aware of what the Ottoman Turkish government did, but do not make it an issue for obvious reasons. As for the Far East Asian countries, I'm not quite sure about them. "Some" states in the USA? Try 30 plus. Either way, this dicussion would be more relevant on the Armenian Genocide page rather than on here.</dd>

<dd>83.108.45.186, the article *does* present both sides of the story. Majority of scholars admit the Genocide, and Turkey denies it. That is the accurate state of positions on the issue of the Genocide, and that's what Wikipedia should convey. Making it sound as if both sides are equal presents a skewed view and does disservice to wikipedia. There are no "lots" of historians who deny the Genocide, only a miniscule portion of the scholarly community does so (and they have questionable connections with the Turkish government). Actually I can probably count them (the ones "outside" Turkey) on one hand--McCarthy, Lewis, Shaw, and lately Lewy, who by the way doesn't deny it but says "the evidence is not as strong as for the Holocaust." On the other hand, there are 126 Genocide scholars alone who admit it, and hundreds of other historians doing the same. To present an accurate picture, if you include McCarthy's name, we would have to include the names of many of these scholars, or perhaps Pulitzer prize winner Samantha Power--there is simply no way to do it an article on Armenia--it's probably unpractical even on the "Armenian Genocide" article.</dd>
<dd>As for many countries not recognizing the Genocide, they don't say "it didn't happen," they just don't discuss the issue (for obvious political reasons). So far only Turkey (and maybe Azerbaijan) actually denies it, making it a tiny minority. And the other user was right, the vast majority of US states recognize the Genocide (I think it's 37 already).--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 09:18, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mount Ararat</span></h2>
<p>My comment is regarding the following statement&#160;:"Mount Ararat, regarded by the Armenians as a symbol of their land, is the highest mountain in the region and used to be part of Armenia until around 1915, when it fell to the Turks". I think that the last part of this sentence is erroneous. Mount Ararat was situated in lands of the Ottoman Empire, it was not part of Armenia, for example in 1750, 1850 or 1905. I realize that there was a short-lived independant Armenian republic for 2-3 years after the genocide, but I'm not sure that this is enough to claim that Mount Ararat was "part of Armenia until around 1915."</p>
<dl>
<dd>70.83.83.197, there is nothing erroneous about that statement. Mt. Ararat was in the Russian section of Armenia up until 1918 (as part of the province of Surmalu), and then under the independent Republic of Armenia until the treaty of Kars (1921) gave the area to Turkey. So, it was not part of Turkey before then. Now, "Armenia" has always been the name given to the Armenian Highland even after it fell under Ottoman and Persian rules. That's how Europeans called the area, and that's even how Ottomans called it up until early 20th century. Even now, I am holding a current World Book Atlas, and eastern part of Turkey is called "Armenia." So, Mt. Ararat definitely was in Armenia.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 09:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Tigranthegrreat: I realize that that area has been referred to as Armenia in defferent maps. Just as certain areas (including areas containing Mount Ararat) have been referred to as Kurdistan in those same maps. My question is: Was there ever a political entity called Armenia prior to 1915? For example, in 1905, Was there an Armenian head of state in that area, was there an armenian currency, was there diplomatic relations with other countries at the time. The answer is no. I realize that Armenian folklore views that land as "Armenia" and that Europeans and Ottomans realized that this was an area historically associated with Armenians, but I would not say that Mount Ararat was part of Armenia until 1915. I would rather say that Mount Ararat was part of the Ottoman Empire (Turkey did not exist at the time), in a land historically associated with Armenians. Get back to me.
<dl>
<dd>70.83.83.197, before 1920 Ararat was never part of Turkey or Ottoman Empire. Along with the area around Igdir, it was part of Yerevan Khannate in the Persian Empire up until 1828. Then, along with the Khannate, it came under Russian control. The area then was incorporated into the "Armenian Region" which later was renamed to Yerevan Province. Armenian writer Khachatur Abovyan who was in fact eyewitnessed and wrote about the conquest of Eastern Armenia (including Yerevan Khannate) by Russia, got to the top of Ararat after the conquest, which was a famous event and probably would be impossible or very dangerous if the mountain was under Ottoman control at the time. Ararat remained part of Armenian Region/Yerevan Prince (within russian Empire) until 1917, then part of the Armenian Republic. It was given to Turks (along with Igdir) in the Kars treaty.</dd>
<dd>I never saw a map referring to Ararat as being part of Kurdistan. The maps depicting Sevres Treaty of 1920, for example, show Kurdistan to be below lake Van, and Armenia to be above lake Van. I have a 1993 World Book Encyclopedia Atlas, and it shows exactly the same (with Armenia referring to the eastern part of Turkey). The same has been true for centuries, with Europeans and Ottomans referring to the area as Armenia. So, it is accurate to say that it is part of Armenia, it is also accurate to say that it was part of Russian Empire, Caucasia, Middle East, planet Earth, Solar System. The article, however, is about Armenia, and the most appropriate choice is the one closest geographically and semantically to the main topic of the article, which is Armenia.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 11:51, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To the anonymous user who is trying to add McCarthy.</span></h2>
<p>83.108.45.186, I explained on the talk page why adding McCarthy is inappropriate, and I will repost my explanation below. If you want to add McCarthy, we will have to add the hundreds or thousands of scholars (the vast majority of them in fact) who say that the Genocide happened. Maybe we can do that in the "Armenian Genocide" article, but not in an article about Armenia, where only a paragraph talks about the genocide. If you want to discuss the evidence of the Genocide, go to "Armenian Genocide" article. Neutral means presenting an accurate picture of the scholarship. If it's 99% vs. 1 %, then that's what an article has to convey. Here is my prior post.</p>
<p>83.108.45.186, the article *does* present both sides of the story. Majority of scholars admit the Genocide, and Turkey denies it. That is the accurate state of positions on the issue of the Genocide, and that's what Wikipedia should convey. Making it sound as if both sides are equal presents a skewed view and does disservice to wikipedia. There are no "lots" of historians who deny the Genocide, only a miniscule portion of the scholarly community does so (and they have questionable connections with the Turkish government). Actually I can probably count them (the ones "outside" Turkey) on one hand--McCarthy, Lewis, Shaw, and lately Lewy, who by the way doesn't deny it but says "the evidence is not as strong as for the Holocaust." On the other hand, there are 126 Genocide scholars alone who admit it, and hundreds of other historians doing the same. To present an accurate picture, if you include McCarthy's name, we would have to include the names of many of these scholars, or perhaps Pulitzer prize winner Samantha Power--there is simply no way to do it an article on Armenia--it's probably unpractical even on the "Armenian Genocide" article. --<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 11:22, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Province spelling</span></h2>
<p>I don't know why the provinces have been spelled the way they have, since nobody in Armenia spells them that way. The pretty standard transliteration is used by all the major guidebooks as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aragatsotn (Արագածոտնի մարզ)</li>
<li>Ararat (Արարատի մարզ)</li>
<li>Armavir (Արմավիրի մարզ)</li>
<li>Gegharkunik (Գեղարքունիքի մարզ)</li>
<li>Kotayk (Կոտայքի մարզ)</li>
<li>Lori (Լոռու մարզ)</li>
<li>Shirak (Շիրակի մարզ)</li>
<li>Syunik (Սյունիքի մարզ)</li>
<li>Tavush (Տավուշի մարզ)</li>
<li>Vayots Dzor (Վայոց Ձորի մարզ)</li>
<li>Yerevan (Երևան)</li>
</ol>
<p>So the only changes are removing the apostrophes and the double rr in Lori. If there is no explanation for that usage, and no complaints, I will change the pages to reflect this spelling, since for sure nobody is googling <i>Geghark'unik' Marz</i> --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 23:28, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2492 BC</span></h2>
<p>The 2492 date was added by user 195.250.64.76 on 1/17, and I guess because there was no supporting source, Khoikhoi removed it (which is the right thing to do:) ). I re-added the info because it is a date well known among Armenians as the year and day when, according to an ancient Armenian tradition, Hayk defeated Bel, which served as the "founding date" of Armenia. The ancient Armenian calendar used the date as its starting point, August 11 was the Armenian New Year, it is mentioned in the earliest Armenian sources (Anania Shirakatsi etc). It is stated in the "Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia" as well: "... ancient Armenian Calendar (the starting date was 2492 BC, when Patriarch Hayk killed Bel)", v. 4, p. 220, 1978, Yerevan. Note that this was published way before the collapse of USSR and the "nationalist" revival of 1988, at a time when local scholarship was under strict Soviet control to oppress any expression of dangerous "nationalism." The point is not whether the date is accurate historically, the point is it is regarded as the date of the battle according to tradition, which is what the article states, so the info itself is accurate.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 00:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I also re-added the "southern Armenia" phrase added by user 195.250.64.76 on 1/17, with some modifications necessary to avoid POV. The fact that eastern Turkey is historic Armenia is well established and has been well known for centuries among Westerners and even Turks. Here is one example, from the "Armenia" article in World Book Encyclopedia: <i><b>"Present-day Armenia and much of what is now eastern Turkey make up historic Armenia, the original homeland of the Armenian people."</b></i> v. 1, 1994. Therefore, it's hardly POV. It's also relevant, since an unacquainted reader might wonder "what does lake Van have to do with Armenia?" and the addition clarifies the link.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 00:45, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! Please excuse my cheek, but I thought this site the best starting point for searching for Armenians with historical knowledge. Armenian medieval chronicler Zenob of Glak is AFAIK not available on-line, or even in English! There is a passage in his chronicle about the wars of the Parthian empire; he mentions a Greek king Demetrius (most likely Seleucid king <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demetrius_II_of_Syria_5f91.html" title="Demetrius II of Syria">Demetrius II of Syria</a>) who was kept in Media where he was given land. Now there is some dispute as for whether this king in fact was an Indian king Demetrius. Is there anybody who has got his work and is willing to translate it to me, or could else assist me as for the context? I would be very grateful for help indeed!

<p>That is a very misleading and possibly slanderous sentence on Hastert. Vanity Fair is the only primary source, not the plural "prominent media outlets", and is a controversial and politicized magazine that is generally hostile to Hastert's Republican Party. A secondary TV source <a href="http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_216190603.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_216190603.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> doing a story on the Vanity Fair article noted that President Clinton (a Democrat) and his Secretary of State M. Albright were also pressuring Hastert hard at the time to drop the vote. A search of the web doesn't turn up this story on news sites, just on Democrat (the political opposition party to Hastert's) and Pro-Armenian websites. Also the charge made in the source was an allegation, not a revelation, and the date of the accusation was 2005, not 2006. Thus I have edited the 2 sentences accordingly. My opinion is that the charge is simply false political propaganda and both sentences should be completely removed, but I will refrain and let others decide if they reach the same conclusion about removal.</p>

<p>Please add a link of my none comercial project to the "News website" section. Its a news aggregator engin which use new technologies (authomated scripts) to agregate news from armenian news sources in the one spot. You can read about the project <a href="http://www.armtown.com/websitenews/en/" class="external text" title="http://www.armtown.com/websitenews/en/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyFlyer_93a1.html" title="User:SkyFlyer">Serge</a></p>

<dd>The article <i>nor</i> the talk page is the place for self-promotion... —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 20:28, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Then either delete all the links not related to the government or I will consider this act as discrimination against armtown.com project. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyFlyer_93a1.html" title="User:SkyFlyer">Serge</a></p>

<dd>I'll delete them when I have the time. Probably tomorrow. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 22:17, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The links need to be separated into Government and Other. All the links in other must be about ROA (such as CIA factbook) not Armenia in general. I will do so today.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 22:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, I think only useful links should stay. <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> is a featured article and look how many external links it has. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 22:35, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I created two sub-sections, one for government sites and one for sites that deal with topics exclusively related to ROA not Armenia in general.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 14:17, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am unhappy with the description of the Armenian Apostolic Church as 'very ritualistic and conservative' On the contrary despite constant references to tradition, it has been capable of innovation and adaptation. Cases in point are the adoption of organ accompaniment, women members of church choirs, a relatively open policy to the admission of other Christians to eucharistic communion, and a high profile in the oecumenical movement. This list is not exhaustive. Non-chalcedonian should be replaced by pre-chalcedonian in accordance with predominant contemporary academic usage</p>
