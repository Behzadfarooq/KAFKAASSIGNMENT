<p>Okay so what's going on with the New Orleans Mardi Gras contribution? It seems to be a bit "clickish" very much resembling the Mardi Gras click sites around the web.</p>
<p>We did everything by the book referring to the talk page which had NO, ZERO,&#160;!NADA info concerning contributions that had been made, plans for the future or anything, period. We made a very legitimate contribution that was deleted without any explanation or discussion as ya'll like to call it here on Wikipedia. I also noticed that nola.com's link was removed, and if anyone has claims to promoting Mardi Gras in this city , it should be them. Further more half of the people making contributions to this section don't even live in this city but are only doing so to further promote their weak at best sites. Admin wherever you may be I implore you to get a grasp of this section of Wikipedia as it seems there is a bit of dictatorship going on which in essence is killing the whole spirit of what Wikipedia should be. I understand ya'll all have a great interest in Mardi Gras whether it is finical or other wise but to blantly try to push out new sites who have ligament contributions just sums up the clickish cut throat nature of some in the Mardi Gras industry.</p>
<p>It is mighty funny that the "Mardi Gras" contribution has massive amounts of discussion pertaing to contributions on it's talk page but "Mardi Gras New Orleans" had none. I bet that was deleted too? So let me be the first to open the discussion on whether the following is acceptable to this contribution or not.</p>
<p>Ceramic Mardi Gras Mask Ceramic Mardi Gras Masks are unique and original pieces of art work from New Orleans. The Fancy Ceramic Mardi Gras Masks are usually poured, sculpted, and handpainted by many native artists in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ceramic Mardi Gras masks are usually designed to be displayed as decorations and are not generally worn as face mask. They are almost as old as Mardi Gras itself and although not part of a costume, they have been handed out at balls and some of the earlier works signed "Sally New Orleans" are some of the most sought after collectibles on the web.</p>
<p>Of course this will be cleaned up to contain links to other Wikipedia reference contributions but I think you should get the picture of the direction we are trying to go with this contribution, which was so blantly deleted.</p>
<p>I wonder if the user who deleted nola.coms contribution got a message from the admin as well? I somehow doubt it.</p>
<p>We also made a contribution for "Mardi Gras 2007" which was original and not yet contributed in anyway which contained links to the "Mardi Gras New Orleans" contributions and this was deleted as well. The click has been busy. So ADMIN wherever you may be and correct me if I am wrong but I think one of the contributors to this section has found their way into the admin area, although a conflict of interest, please keep an open mind when reading our comments but this has been an ongoing problem with the Mardi Gras "click" for some time. It is mighty funny that we made another contributions to an unrelated Mardi Gras item and it has not been deleted, bumped, etc, etc. Hmmmm...why does it have to be so conserveral when it comes to Mardi Gras. I can only suspect that the "MG click" has had a hand in it.</p>
<p>This is exactly the sort of thing that gives New Orleans Mardi Gras a bad name.</p>

<dd>Thanks. I'll think about it, on the other hand I'm trying to get my workshop going again and Wiki is bit distracting and much too addictive. I've been temporarily disabled for eight months, and my workshop was totally disorganized by the cellar being torn up and drains replaced (indirectly the cause of my broken ankle).

<p>wow. i understand that the sentance I "added" was not crucial and really does not change the content. But what is this?! has the community not gotten smaller? was it not caused by the automobile? have I not sourced the statement as asked? is it not a fact? is it not information? does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not? if so it should be noted that I simply re-added the information after it was removed. was not the removal frivilous and unwarranted? what is the problem? why insist on the absence of this statement? it is unjustifiable. it is negligible. I am re adding the information as it is: A)factual, B) sourced, and C) informative. I assume that since there is no reason to remove it again (or in the first place) that you and all other Wiki Nazis will relax. If you are concerned with useless edits please see the edit fom the 26th. I know it was carried out by the great infallable Mindmatrix but imho that was the first useless change.--<a href="../../../o/l/s/User%7EOlsdude_2ba4.html" title="User:Olsdude">Matt D</a> 01:49, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well I guess if I hadn't insulted you you would have just ignored me wholesale. I formaly appologize for calling you a wiki nazi. however if you want to cast off that title permenantly you should aknowledge my side of this disscussion instead of re reverting my edits. Did not everything I just said make perfect sense? i would like you to explain how it didn't if possible. --<a href="../../../o/l/s/User%7EOlsdude_2ba4.html" title="User:Olsdude">Matt D</a> 01:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>no? you got nothing? can't think of anything? you stand now having commited completly unjustifyable actions? having trouble with the fact that I want an explanation? can't find a pre-written wikipedia message to puke up at me? I wopnder if right now you are thinking "why does he care so much?" but I'm thinking the same thing about you. I guess a major thing that should be considered here is that I SOURCED THE STATEMENT!!! THERE IS NO REASON TO DELETE IT!!!! EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS!!!</dd>

<dd>Based on the article you recently created, and the tone of your posts - I would suggest you take a break from Wiki and calm down. I do not wish to continue this dialog.

<ul>
<li>has the community not gotten smaller?</li>
<li>was it not caused by the automobile?</li>
<li>have I not sourced the statement as asked?</li>
<li>is it not a fact?</li>
<li>is it not information?</li>
<li>does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was?</li>

<li>is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>All that I'm asking is for you to explain why it is better to not have the statement than to have it. As far as I knew wikipedia is intended to contain the sum of all human knowledge. As someone who lives near Foresters Falls I find that this information answers a pertinant question left open by the article (Why is foresters falls so small if it once had lumber mills and such?) I know that you said you don't want to continue this dialogue but I hope that you can understand that my frustration comes from the fact that you have, so far, not explained yourself. from my point of view it seems that you made the edit on a whim and refuse to acknowledge the possibility that it may have been a bit unwarranted. I found the information in a book on local history, I have listed the book as a source as asked. What additional criteria need to be met? please tell me. If I were to refrase the sentance? Would that be better? In fact if you could tell me what criteria was used to determine that it should be removed that would be fine. Because I'm sure that this sentance is no worse (certainly not because it doesn't detract from the page in the first place) than any other statement on any other page. Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement? Just because? Please answer this letter. Please do not throw another stock statement at me. Please do not respond to one statement I made in this letter and ignore any points you don't care to address. I would like you to meet me point for point and justify your actions. Please don't block me for daring to question administrators. Please don't interpret anything I have said here as a personal attack and ignore my entire post in favour of telling me not to post personal attacks. Please don't treat me like an ant under your feet who deserves no recognition.</p>
<p>I will be in contact.--<a href="../../../o/l/s/User%7EOlsdude_2ba4.html" title="User:Olsdude">Matt D</a> 15:48, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am starting to get confused. Perhaps you could just tell me whatever it is that you tell yourself to justify not responding to me. If you had a reasonable answer it would be best to just give it. I'll repost the questions above incase you're unclear on what I would like answers too.</dd>

<ul>
<li>has the community not gotten smaller?</li>
<li>was it not caused by the automobile?</li>
<li>have I not sourced the statement as asked?</li>
<li>is it not a fact?</li>
<li>is it not information?</li>
<li>does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was?</li>
<li>is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present?</li>
<li>is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>and I'll just go ahead and add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why it is better to not have the statement than to have it?</li>
<li>Does this information not answers a pertinant question left open by the article?</li>
<li>If I were to refrase the sentance would that be better?</li>
<li>What criteria was used to determine that it should be removed?</li>
<li>Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll also go ahead and post this on the disscussion board for Forsters Falls aswell.</p>
<p>If you could try to treat me like a person and just respond to this post that would be great. Wouldn't you want to get a response? and if you can not, in any way, justify the edit perhaps you should consider the possibility that it was infact not justified and as such should be reverted. maybe? maybe any human can make mistakes?
