<li>See, you used the word "problem" here, and that's what I'm getting at. Who says that this so-called "nice guy syndrome" is a <i>problem</i>? A few years ago I realized I was a nice guy (or "geek," as you call it), but I decided NOT to change, even though that decision will cause me to have less success in romance. I view being nice as a positive attribute for its benefits other than romance, but there are people like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_DeAngelo_10f5.html" title="David DeAngelo">David DeAngelo</a> who believe "niceness" is a bad attribute to have. This, hopefully, illustrates the NPOV issue I have with this article; it is written in a tone that is very negative towards the concept when not everyone would agree with that negativity. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintin3265_8d7f.html" title="User:Quintin3265">Quintin3265</a> 00:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's too bad you didn't sign your name with the four tildes, as it seems that you really are a nice person. Bear in mind that this article is entitled "Nice Guy Syndrome" and not "nice-guy-ness". There are plenty of other guys out there who are romantically well-endowed who are not necessarily jerks. If you look through the archives there are many women who don't even respect "nice guys". Women are a lot more complex than meets the eye, and it's not necessarily that they prefer jerks. And I hope that even if you have less success that you have at least some. I sympathise, but I am a "nice guy" trying to maintain a NPOV.

<li>This is not the point I am trying to argue. I am trying to point out that this article is a load of BS, to put it bluntly. The "external links" section is just spam, and things were just randomly inserted into the article. There is no verifiable research on this topic, at all. There is not <b>one single reputable citation</b>! I simply do not understand how this article violates every one of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policies.html" title="Policies">WP:List of policies</a> and manages to repeatedly fail votes for deletion. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintin3265_8d7f.html" title="User:Quintin3265">Quintin3265</a> 01:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Added the cartoon. If you sympathise with the 'nice guy' in it you probably are one. Note that this refers to 'Nice Guys' who are passive-agressive, not to nice people who are altruistic and kind for its own sake rather than for the sake of getting laid. --sebzeppelin 00:33, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>there's actually two POV in the cartoon, respective of the two characters</p>
<p>As the anonymous person says (please sign using the four tildes in future), there are two POV in the cartoon. However I realise that my naming of the link was not NPOV and have amended it accordingly. Just because an external link is not NPOV does not mean it shouldn't be linked to - where there is conflict sites supporting both POV should be linked to as specified in article 4 of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#What_should_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External links">what should be linked to</a>--sebzeppelin 22:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note to 128.174,113.187: please do not remove these tags without also addressing the concerns behind them. They are NOT just there to promote an afd!

<p>the tags are duplicates and as stated in the archived comments, are solely there to circumvent failed afd. ". As a result, I've resorted to simply adding every applicable tag that lowers the value of this article. Why not help? If we put enough "citation needed" tags where they properly belong, or add cleanup templates, and so on, eventually there might be enough votes to delete the page. --Quintin3265 15:53, 19 June 2006 (UTC)"</p>

<li>I'm not sure what you're getting at by quoting this. The tags are still valid, regardless of whether they boost the case for this article's deletion. You can't remove tags if they are applicable. Nobody has yet provided any evidence that a single one of the tags I added is incorrect, so I will readd these tags repeatedly until either the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> is violated, or someone provides a legitimate, argument <b>based on the text of the article</b> why the tags are not valid. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintin3265_8d7f.html" title="User:Quintin3265">Quintin3265</a> 00:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>you said it yourself, you dont have a valid reason for adding the extranous tags. the only purpose they serve is to clutter the article and perhaps push the article to another afd. the reasoning behind the tags are already in the other ones.</p>

I'm the one who originally added the tags. Here's why:</p>
<p>Fact-fiction: as I said earlier, there is no hard evidence at all in favor of this "syndrome". It does not exist in the medical literature, it has no actual survey data backing it, just pseudonymous posts on message boards. The label "syndrome" doesn't even come from the so-called "nice guys" themselves, but from people who dislike them. Really, this isn't much more than a pattern inferred from various flame wars.</p>
<p>Importance: You can argue, of course, that the mere presence of this argument frequently on the net is grounds for inclusion. In that case, somebody has to find links to actual boards or groups where this was discussed, and cite that as proof.</p>
<p>Jargon: Look how many sweeping generalizations about men and women this article makes. NOT ONE, repeat, not ONE, has survey data backing it. "Women may like...men prefer..." these are just ideas pulled out of someone's ass.</p>
<p>The tags should be kept until (and IF) these concerns are addressed. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyronen_7385.html" title="User:Tyronen">Tyronen</a> 17:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i dont dispute most of your points, thats why i left two of the more general tags intact. the rest, as i stated above, are redudant and as one person commented, only there to help afd. i dont think the tags are meant to be used to circumvent the normal afd process. and ive never seen an article with more than two (maybe once, three) tags</p>
<p>Why aren't people signing with the four tildes? Anyway, that's not what I came to say. The thing is <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyronen_7385.html" title="User:Tyronen">Tyronen</a>, if you look at Nice_guy_syndrome#Sociobiology and Nice_guy_syndrome#Disputed_existence, there are people who are trying to make this a legitamite article. I've seen documentaries on studies (not on the "syndrome", but on human male/female sexuality) that have shown links between a woman's physiology and psychology. (It's too bad I didn't take notes at the time). Surely we can do something with this article. It is a fact that some guys suffer from extreme shyness. Which gives me an idea, can't we delete and put a redirect page to <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love-shyness.html" title="Love-shyness">Love-shyness</a> or something? <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDessydes_c384.html" title="User:Dessydes">Dessydes</a> 18:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I disagree. This article should not redirect to <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love-shyness.html" title="Love-shyness">Love-shyness</a> because there is no correlation between guys who are "nice" and guys who are "shy." There are plenty of guys who are nice and outgoing, and plenty of guys who are shy and mean. This article should simply be deleted, with no redirect. There is nothing we can report on here that has any legitimate source. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintin3265_8d7f.html" title="User:Quintin3265">Quintin3265</a> 21:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

You are right about the nice and outgoing, but these are not the people being discussed in the article, it's about guys who believe they can't get anywhere because of their niceness. If you look at <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love-shyness.html" title="Love-shyness">Love-shyness</a>, and this talk page (or even the article), it addresses the issue with sources and all. Besides, you want this article deleted so badly, here's a way to please everyone. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDessydes_c384.html" title="User:Dessydes">Dessydes</a> 02:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintin3265_8d7f.html" title="User:Quintin3265">Quintin3265</a>. A love-shy man is destinctly different from a "nice guy". "Nice guys" can easily form friendships with women, while love-shy men have problems forming any sort of relationship with anyone. This article should be deleted/dramatically edited, it's just vindictive ranting. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrotrance_f775.html" title="User:Afrotrance">Afrotrance</a> 12:04, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>thats not true at all. from the article "According to his definition, published in Shyness &amp; Love: Causes, Consequences, and Treatments, love-shy people find it difficult to be assertive in informal situations involving potential romantic or sexual partners." so unless he is bisexual, that does not preclude him from forming relationships with men.</p>
