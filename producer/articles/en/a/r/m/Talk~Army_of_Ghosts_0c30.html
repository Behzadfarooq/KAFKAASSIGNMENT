<p>I guess this episode happens in 2007: but can't see any other signals for dating. Has anyone any ideas?</p>
<p>I'd agree, I think it's almost a given that any stories in "Rose's time" are considered 2007 - and Yvonne did say "that was thing you saw shooting down the Sycorax at Christmas". As she didn't specify a specific Christmas, it's fair to assume she was talking about the "last" one - which we know was 2006 in the storyline. <a href="../../../t/e/h/User%7ETeh_B_1661.html" title="User:Teh B">The_B</a> 22:41, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm only just getting into Stargate: SG1 but I'm prtty sure there was a reference in this episode. Will someone more expert than I please confirm.</p>
<p>When the Doctor was led into the big tech room there was a large spaceship which he called something that sounded like "A Jaffa Sunglider" there were also Sarcoffigi (spelling... I know) present. Now aside from Jaffaa (jaffah, whatever) sounding suspiciously like the SG1 characters I'm sure there was a similar scene in SG1 where Jack et al visited Area 51 where all the otherworldly tech was being stored and reverse engineered... I'm sure a door opened and a spaceship was shown within that lead to a main character declaring a very similar sounding line to the one the Doctor uttered...</p>
<p>Am I completely mad or did anyone else pick this up?</p>
<p>AWD</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought that too, but the sarcophagus is more likely a reference to Pyramids of Mars.Anon</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes but the Jaffa reference with it? AWD</p>

<dd>The sarcophagus is definitely a <i>Pyramids of Mars</i> reference — Davies says so on the commentary. It was even in the script, apparently. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 16:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are rumblings of Captain Jack being in this, since this episode will essentially show us what Torchwood is for the benefit of the future series, it stands to reason that Captain Jacks involvmet with Torchwood may be explained in this episode.. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesRandom_38e5.html" title="User:JamesRandom">James Random</a> 16:34, 27 June 2006 (UTC) Blurt to me!</p>

<dd>To be fair, I doubt it - apparently he's already said it won't be explained at first how he even got out of the future in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torchwood.html" title="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>, so it's more likely to be established in Torchwood. However, it has already been said that in Torchwood, something has happened to Jack, so he needs to find the Doctor. Personally I don't think that will be explained this episode either, if only as it will probably take away too much which could be used in the Torchwood plots. <a href="../../../t/e/h/User%7ETeh_B_1661.html" title="User:Teh B">The_B</a> 19:30, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In previous interviews, John Barrowman has stated that Captain Jack would not be in Season 2 of Doctor Who - but will most likely be making an appearance in Season 3. A quick search on YouTube for 'John Barrowman' will provide plenty of evidence for people that require it. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECybogoblin_8035.html" title="User:Cybogoblin">Cybogoblin</a> 19:40, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently the latest DWM (as reported on Outpost Gallifrey's news page) has more cast members listed as part of "Block Three", which the news page says that it (i.e., Shaun Lyon) believes to be the "Rise of the Cybermen" two-parter, "Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday". I think there was some similar "Block Three" casting in the last issue. Would it be appropriate to add some of this casting to this page (with an appropriate caveat), or should we wait till we have more solid confirmation of which episodes the actors will appear in? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 16:41, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Outpost Gallifrey is now reporting Roger Lloyd-Pack and Yvonne Hartman will be appearing in "Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday", playing the same characters they play in the "Rise of the Cybermen" two-parter.

<dd>The latest seems to be that Yvonne Hartman is in Army/Doomsday but <i>not</i> in Rise/Steel (and that page has been adjusted).

<ul>
<li>Well - the Daleks are actually in this, it seems fairly obvious. What isn't obvious is that there's a black Dalek in it too, not just all Gold ones. Dunno what purpose he serves, But I suppose he's some sort of leader to replace the emperor in their alternate reality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>After running the image through photoshop myself and looking for all the telltale signs of tricker, I have managed to find none. The most noteworthy aspects of this image are: Firstly the lighting brolly to the left of the image - it, like the Cyberman beside the dalek, is mildly reflecting the light from the dalek's earbulbs. Secondly, that the way the light is reflected of the dalek itself suggests that the colour of this dalek's head is a glossy black and not gold. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesRandom_38e5.html" title="User:JamesRandom">James Random</a></li>

<dd>The ending of <i>Fear Her</i> isn't a cliffhanger, it just ends on some foreshadowing. Rose and the Doctor are in no immediate danger, after all. Furthermore, none of the action in <i>Fear Her</i> seems to be relevant to what's to come. They could easily have inserted more episodes between this one and the finale, which should make it pretty obvious that it's not part of it. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 19:29, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where's that line from?

I am not sure how much of a spoiler this is, however, considering that Billie Piper's exit has been widely reported in the media.

<p>Unless someone has a solid source for the Daleks beyond fan rumor, it shouldn't go in until we see the first one. Nor should Eccleston's return, Jackie's TARDIS trip (Which we already humiliatingly screwed up in Love &amp; Monsters), Mickey or Pete's return, or, really anything.</p>

<dd>Fine, I must be some complete dumbass then, because I didn't hear any dalek extermination effect. I tend to agree with the point about not feverishly reporting every fannish piece of speculation about upcoming episodes - there are other places for that sort of thing. Personally, however, I don't tend to feel particularly "humilated" if someone else puts in some rumour which turns out to be dead wrong - as someone mentioned on David Baddiel's Radio 4 program this week (in context of wikipedia getting something wrong) - this isn't really the "Information Super-Highway", more like the global toilet wall!

<li>If you look, you'll note that I didn't excise the Daleks, except insofar as there was certainty. There is something that looks like it might be an extermination effect, and the Doctor shouldering a something. But this is not sufficient evidence to proclaim the Dalek's appearance, proclaim the voice appearance, or, really, to do much more than say "There is something that looks like a Dalek extermination for a split-second in the trailer." There's just not reliable evidence past that. 24.136.38.121 15:36, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is a big difference between saying "the Daleks are returning" and "it looks like some Dalek tech is being used". There are any number of explanations why something that looks like a Dalek exterminator is seen in the trailer. Maybe the tech comes from Torchwood, who got it from a Dalek. Maybe the Mill got lazy and just reused the Dalek effect. Or maybe, yes maybe, the Daleks actually <i>will</i> appear. At this stage, anything beyond "it looks like a Dalek exterminator" is just speculation. We didn't see a Dalek. No credible source has confirmed that there will be any Daleks. And for heaven's sake, it's less than a week 'til the episode airs, so what's the point of plonking in some speculation (which may or may not turn out to be right) when very soon we'll know for sure?

<dd>Or it appears in Torchwood. Or in the Christmas special. Or they just wanted to release a new Dalek figure - Dapol released a number of Dalek colorings that never appeared in the series.

<p>I have had several ideas and theories about this forth-coming episode, purely based on the "trailer" at the end of the "Fear Her" episode.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that Torchwood is involved, and there is an invasion of sorts. This may or may not be connected to the sphere that we see. In any case, I was rather taken by the concept of the worlds crossing over, and I was reminded of several things including the video game series, "Half Life".</p>
<p>I believe that "our" world and the parallel universe that The Doctor and Rose visited in "Rise of the Cybermen" are merging into one.</p>
<p>The "ghosts" maybe in fact dead or missing people from the other parallel universe. This is evidenced by the return of the Cybermen (with the Cyrus logos), and Mickey. As for the Daleks.. well, maybe they invaded the parallel and are using technology along with Torchwoods in our worlds to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>I mentioned the "Half Life" series as in that, scientists from our world created a "rift" that caused portions of our world to be merged with Xen, the alien planet, and visa versa. I'll smile if The Doctor mentions the "anti-spectrometer".</p>
<p>- Daniel W. Blackwell</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I believe that the Daleks must be parallell versions of this Universes daleks. Firstly because Bad Wold wiped out the second lot and secondly because they have a black dalek as their leader in place of the Emperor. It is possible that, whilst all host of daleks were falling through time, that one Dalek ship fell through the same gap in the universe that the TARDIS fell through in Rise of the Cybermen.</li>

<p><br />
To conclude further with a theory that I was unable to post here yesterday, I can give my explanation to why it's called "Army of Ghosts" and to perhaps why the Bermuda Triangle was mentioned.</p>
<p>As we know, the Triangle makes ships and aircraft disappear, usually to another time or place. My idea is that the "ghosts" that we see within the trailer is actually the universe, or that mysterious sphere, is causing the universe the "balance out".</p>
<p>Remember something to what Mickey said at the end of the two alternate Earth (Cybermen) episodes? "This will balance it out because they lost their Mickey".</p>
<p>So, in theory, if we call our world "X" and the Earth that The Doctor visited with the Cybermen in it "Y".. whatever is causing the "ghosts" to appear, is making anyone who has dead or has been lost from either world to appear within the other. The Balancing.</p>
<p>Say for instance you had a friend within this world, "X", who died of cancer or some other disease.. within the other parallel Earth, he or she might be alive and well. The "ghosts" that we see, are those coming across.</p>
<p>I also had the notion that from watching the trailer for this, that any/some/all "seals" upon any form of Imprisonment were removed. Don't ask me why I thought of that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You're forgetting that the ghosts appear because the Cybermen are using this as a front for their invasion. Also, I believe that the sphere is some form of craft, possibly with the dalek or a cyberman inside it. Though the possibility remains that it is a giant Magnatron that's pulling in the universe through the dividing fault lines of our universe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>- Daniel W. Blackwell</p>
<p>Actually the Bermuda Triangle doesn't make planes and ships vanish into other universes at all, the real answer is sadly much more boring. There's a small volcano beneath the triangle itself, when this erupts is causes a bed of bubbles on the surface of the sea, any ship trapped in the bed of bubbles loses boyancy and is sucked under. As for the planes, well the WW2 fighter pilot simply lost his way because some of the land formations look the same from various angles. Once the pilot figured out he and his wing was lost, he had a panic attack and ended up flying around for hours until they ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea. As for the planes that followed it, well these were all Sunderland aircraft that were used for refuelling and filled to the brim will fuel and were known for their effortless propensity to just blow up without notice. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesRandom_38e5.html" title="User:JamesRandom">James Random</a> 09:10, 27 June 2006 (UTC)&lt;&gt;Spank my bum and call me Nancy</p>

The title suggests it and if the season follows the same structure as last year, it would make sense. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 9:36 (BST) 16 Sep 05</p>

<dd>This story is the second of this season to feature the Cybermen and possibly also the daleks. The first story to feature the Cybermen were the episodes <i>Rise of the Cybermen</i> and <i>Age of Steel</i> - Whilst the title of this first two-part episode does suggest cyberman involvement, I believe that it is actually referring to ghosts inthe sense that loved ones reappear in the episode and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) is said to be visited by the ghost of Den Watts.... 212.219.119.130 13:47, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The reason I say this is because at the end of Age of Steel, we see a shooting star streak away from Earth. Now, since the Lumic unit was the only remaining unit not taken out when Mickey deactivated the Emotional Inhibitors, it stands to reason that a little tumble from a Zepplin might not have killed him and he may have managed to escape in some sort of craft. Which is why I asked if we'd see the cyber controller again. Not necessarily *as* lumic, since the nature of the Cybermen dictates that in the absence of a controller they'd simply select the next superior unit to be the controller. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesRandom_38e5.html" title="User:JamesRandom">James Random</a>&gt;&lt; <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesRandom_581b.html" title="User talk:JamesRandom">Come on I was right about the Daleks, this'd be a encore</a></li>

<dd>"James Random", it's not a question of "I told you so". No-one's trying to deny your claims just for devilment. It's just that wikipedia demands stronger evidence than logical inference, no matter how valid it might be. If, for example, I discovered a wonderful new proof of Fermat's Last Theorem which was absolutely unassailably true, could I post it on wikipedia? No. I'd have to get it published first in a reputable journal, and <i>then</i> it could be included here, even if my proof was right. Wikipedia isn't the place for "Original Research".</dd>

Those two Daleks in the first photo look like a couple of Dalek toys in a Torchwood type toyset. The other photo seems more conclusive then the first. But that's just how I see it.</p>
<p><br />
That picture of the Dalek and Cyberman is from the Radio Times photo shoot, not an episode. Lonemagpie 18:14, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I realize that. I'm just saying the first photo doesn't appear to be proof of anything and if the two were taken for degrees of proof amongst the two photos, the second appears to be more 'proof worthy' then the first photo although the second photo still isn't conclusive proof of anything given that as you said it's a publicity still. I'm not arguing for or against the Daleks being in this episode.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a still of a black Dalek and a bronze Dalek from the story in TV Times... Lonemagpie 21:42, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To back up what I said earlier, you can see that the base of the fourth dalek is different then the other three when they first emerge and that when all the CGI Daleks land, you can see the top of the one behind the Black Dalek and it really looks like the ark. But we'll know on Saturday for sure. I'm certainly not denying that it's four daleks plus one ark in the next episode it's just that it seems to be three daleks and an arc in Army of Ghosts.</dd>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>Khaosworks, I was just wondering why you moved the trivia about Freema Agyeman being touted as new companion (which, by the way, appears to be <i><b>confirmed</b></i> by an embargoed press release from the BBC for tomorrow!) to <i>Doomsday</i>? I know it's a bit of a spoiler, but doesn't it belong here? David 17:50, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe cos she's playing a different character as the new companion, not Adeola from this story...Lonemagpie 18:52, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>She still comes and goes (as Adeola) in this episode, not <i>Doomsday</i>, though. David 19:04, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>I did not want to put Agyeman's confirmation as companion in this episode because it was a spoiler, and we should try to avoid spoilers for future episodes ("past" references are okay). I tried several permutations, but it boiled down to the fact that the Sun note was there simply to set up either the fact that the Sun was wrong (which, as it turns out, it wasn't), or to do the reveal that Agyeman's the new companion. My view was that I, at least, couldn't construct it in such a way that preserved the Sun note and actually made it relevant without being inaccurate or spoilerish. So I moved it. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 01:27, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If it was a spoiler before (and it wasn't really, because most seem to have assumed that the Sun had got it wrong), I disagree that it is now given that she's been officially announced as Martha. The only spoiler left is that her character dies in this episode, and anyone who doesn't want the episode to be spoiled shouldn't be reading the article. David 08:49, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not the fact that she dies that's the spoiler. We don't have to note that she dies; it's apparent from the synopsis. The problem is that the Sun note was there originally to first talk about speculation that she was going to be the new companion, then after that it was used to say that ho ho, the Sun was wrong since Adeola died. We can't say that the Sun was wrong anymore because of the current announcement, and I don't think that a person who is expecting to be spoiled about the episode expects to be spoiled about Rose leaving and Martha Jones coming in, so Martha Jones shouldn't be in there. So what's left? A bare note that the Sun said this about Freema Agyeman being the new companion standing on its own is left devoid of context, because the original relevance: the Sun being wrong, is no longer operative. Again, I tried constructing it in a way that wasn't irrelevant, out-of-place, inaccurate or spoilerish and I could not do so, which is why I shifted it to <i>Doomsday</i> where, once it's apparent Rose leaves, Martha coming in is not that spoilery anymore. If anyone can come up with a construction that avoids all these problems, please do. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 09:02, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: the very minor grammar change, from "Dalek Supremes" to "Daleks Supreme" - the Supreme part of the name suggests there's only one (either at a time, or in total) - if so, it should just say:</p>

<p>If however there have been multiple Black Daleks at the same time, the plural should stand.</p>

<p>Is it the same "void" as in the Troughton-era story <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mind_Robber_8691.html" title="The Mind Robber">The Mind Robber</a></i>? It seems to be similarly brilliant white, and its description seems to match. For that matter, Troughton's Doctor was incredibly apprehensive about his respective "void". We know how Davies loves throwing in random continuity references that nobody sane will pick up on (heck, "Rels"?). Is this one of them? Though it's hard to be certain, it seems like a solid possibility. Does it, therefore, warrant pointing out? --71.139.18.66 09:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It could be the same, but it's entirely speculative and there's no evidence that it was RTD's intention, so it shouldn't go into the article. We don't see inside the Void so we can't say it's white. —<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_a4bc.html" title="User:Whouk">Wh</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_Esperanza_7be7.html" title="User:Whouk/Esperanza"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_a4bc.html" title="User:Whouk">uk</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWhouk_b2f7.html" title="User talk:Whouk">talk</a>)</small> 10:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We sort of do, in that when the wall is "opened up" it becomes a glowing white void. When the wall "wraps" around it at the end of Doomsday, sealing the hole, the glowing whiteness is sealed away behind a dull white wall. Still, yes, it could be clearer.

Plus -- if you recall -- the Doctor's reaction at the beginning of Rise of the Cybermen, what he describes of what he expects outside, is essentially the same as in The Mind Robber. All things considered, it seems safe to assume that they intend this Void as the same Void from the original series. --71.139.23.128 22:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
