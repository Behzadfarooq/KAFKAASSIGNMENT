<p>The <b>Army Council</b> was a term first used in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a> to describe an institution which cordinated the views of all levels of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Model_Army_f4c0.html" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a>. During the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interregnum_%28England%29_4ea1.html" title="Interregnum (England)">Interregnum</a> it metamorphosed into the <b>(Army) Council of Officers</b>. The term <b>Army Council</b> was revived in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> with the institutional changes made in that year to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a>.</p>
<p><a name="1647"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Council_6542.html" title="Edit section: 1647">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1647</span></h2>
<p>Having won the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_English_Civil_War_84bf.html" title="First English Civil War">First English Civil War</a>, the soldiers of the New Model Army (Army) became very discontented with the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Parliament_c902.html" title="Long Parliament">Long Parliament</a>, for several reasons. Firstly, they had not been paid regularly and on the end of hostilities, the conservative MPs in Parliament wanted to either disband the Army or send them to fight in Ireland without receiving their back pay. Secondly, since most Parliamentarians wanted to restore the King without major democratic reforms or religious freedom, many soldiers asked why they had risked their lives in the first place â€” a sentiment that was strongly expressed by their elected representatives.</p>
<p>Two representatives, called Agitators, were elected from each regiment. The Agitators with two Army Offices from each regiments and the Generals formed a new body called the <i>Army Council</i> which after a rendezvous (meeting) near <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newmarket.html" title="Newmarket">Newmarket</a> on Friday <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">4 June</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a> issued "<i>A Solemne Engagement of the Army, under the Command of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax</i>" to Parliament on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a> making their concerns known and also the constitution of the Army Council so that Parliament would understand that the discontent was Army wide and had the support of offices and other ranks. This Engagement was read out to the Army at a general Army rendezvous on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a>.</p>
<p>Having come under the influence of London radicals called the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levellers.html" title="Levellers">Levellers</a>, the troops of the Army proposed a revolutionary new constitution named the <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agreement_of_the_People_2e81.html" title="Agreement of the People">Agreement of the People</a>, which called for almost universal male suffrage, reform of electoral boundaries, power to rest with the Parliament which was to be elected every two years (not the King), religious freedom and an end to imprisonment for debt.</p>
<p>Increasingly concerned at the failure to pay their wages and by political maneuverings by King <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I of England</a> and by some in Parliament, the army marched slowly towards <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> over the next few months. In late October and early November at the <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putney_Debates_7482.html" title="Putney Debates">Putney Debates</a> the Army debated two different proposals. The first the <i>Agreement of the People</i> and the other "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Heads_of_the_Proposals_444c.html" title="The Heads of the Proposals">The Heads of the Proposals</a>", put forward by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ireton_007a.html" title="Henry Ireton">Henry Ireton</a>, (son-in-law of <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>) for the Army Council. It was a constitutional manifesto which included the preservation of property rights and maintaining the privileges of the gentry. At the Putney Debates it was agreed to hold three further rendezvous.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putney_Debates_7482.html" title="Putney Debates">Putney Debates</a> the Army commanders Sir <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fairfax_59cc.html" title="Thomas Fairfax">Thomas Fairfax</a> and Cromwell were worried at the strength of support which the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levellers.html" title="Levellers">Levellers</a> had in the Army. So they decided to impose <i>The Heads of the Proposals</i> as the army's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifesto.html" title="Manifesto">manifesto</a> instead of the Levellers the <i>Agreement of the People</i></p>
<p>To do this they demanded that every soldier sign a declaration of loyalty, to Fairfax the commander-in-chief and the Army Council, which signified that they accepted <i>The Heads of the Proposals</i> as the Army's manifesto. Many of the men were willing to sign, even if they had Leveller sympathies, because Cromwell and Fairfax promised that Parliament would pay them the back pay which they were owed. But if they did not sign, it was suggested, then the army could not present a united front to Parliament and payment could be delayed and that some regiments might be dispanded with no back pay at all. The declaration was a politically astute move because the soldiers were now bound to the Army Council and not the King or Parliament.</p>
<p>At the first rendezvous was the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corkbush_Field_rendezvous_f637.html" title="Corkbush Field rendezvous">Corkbush Field rendezvous</a>, the senior officers in the army known as the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandee.html" title="Grandee">Grandees</a> gained the agreement of most regiments to accept the Army Council's <i>The Heads of the Proposals</i> instead of the <i>Agreement of the People</i> as the Army's manifesto. A mutiny by a minority of regiments was suppressed by Cromwell who had Private <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Arnold_9024.html" title="Richard Arnold">Richard Arnold</a>, tried for mutiny and shot on the spot as an example. At the two other rendezvous at Ruislip Heath and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingston_upon_Thames_7668.html" title="Kingston upon Thames">Kingston</a> the other regiments were ordered to show support for Fairfax which they all agreed to do.</p>
<p>Over the following years the Army Council changed in constituency. The elected agitators were removed and the Council became a <b>(Army) Council of Officers</b>, the remained an important institution in the ruling establishment of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Commonwealth_61de.html" title="English Commonwealth">English Commonwealth</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protectorate_1120.html" title="The Protectorate">the Protectorate</a> during the Interregnum. For example in at the start of the Protectorate, ten days after the dissolution of the <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rump_Parliament_d8e6.html" title="Rump Parliament">Rump Parliament</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/5/1653.html" title="1653">1653</a>, Cromwell told the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_State_%28England%29_bdb0.html" title="Council of State (England)">Council of State</a> that it no longer existed and together with the <i>Council of Officers</i>, instituted a new Council of State.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Council_6542.html" title="Edit section: 1904">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1904</span></h2>
<p>The disastrous campaigns of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimean_War_40b1.html" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a> led to the consolidation of all administrative duties in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1855.html" title="1855">1855</a> under the Secretary of State for War, a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet</a> post. He was not, however, solely responsible for the Army; the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander-in-Chief_of_the_Forces_20d2.html" title="Commander-in-Chief of the Forces">Commander-in-Chief</a> (C-in-C) held a virtually equal level of responsibility. This was reduced in theory by the reforms introduced by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Cardwell%2C_1st_Viscount_Cardwell_993b.html" title="Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell">Edward Cardwell</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, which subordinated the C-in-C to the Secretary for War. In practice, however, a huge amount of influence was retained by the exceedingly conservative C-in-C Field Marshal <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Cambridge_7ef7.html" title="Prince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge">Prince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge</a>, who held the post between <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>. His resistance to reform caused military efficiency to lag well behind Britain's rivals, a problem which became painfully obvious during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Boer_War_db66.html" title="Second Boer War">Boer War</a>.</p>
<p>The situation was only remedied in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> when the post of Commander-in-Chief was abolished and replaced with that of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_the_General_Staff_e011.html" title="Chief of the General Staff">Chief of the General Staff</a>. An Army Council was created along similar lines to the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Admiralty_1bba.html" title="Board of Admiralty">Board of Admiralty</a>, chaired by the Secretary of State for War, and an <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_General_Staff_0770.html" title="Imperial General Staff">Imperial General Staff</a> was established to coordinate Army administration.</p>
