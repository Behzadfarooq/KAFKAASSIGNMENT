<p>In regards to Arthur John Haughey, the move was done correctly. The redirect should now be deleted - articles should not be redirected to users, ever. The CSD notice should stay there so that an administrator knows to do housekeeping. The content of the page has already been moved where it belongs, so nothing is lost by doing this. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriona_934d.html" title="User:Triona">Stephanie Daugherty (Triona)</a> - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETriona_5b3e.html" title="User talk:Triona">Talk</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Comment</a> - 05:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was "ILikeDemocracy." Guy's been doing a strange mix of good edits and nonsense. I gently warned him about an attack page he did and he kept insisting that this person was really bad. OK, fine, says I. Just don't go trumpeting it on an international stage. Ah, the fun of Wikipedia. &#160;:) - Lucky 6.9 06:43, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, I had just reverted Triona's edits and got corrected, and apologized back so I was confused as to who was saying what to whom. It's too late - time for bed.

<p>I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what I did wrong. Eg in the case of CN Tower - if you looked at the link, it did contain information useful to the end user (pictures, reviews, a map, so forth). I don't see why it was wrong as it added value? (and sorry if I am posting in the right place, still figuring it out)</p>
<p>Heh - just saw the last entry on the talk page and assumed it was to me&#160;:) I'm just saying that - I'm no driveby (and so here I am), and all the links I did add had useful information (there were quite a few TO landmarks I left alone). Eg Toronto Zoo - you can compare the listing here and on the linked to page, and I thought the pictures+reviews would make it useful to an end user. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.224.163.124 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.224.163.124.html" title="User talk:207.224.163.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.224.163.124_0093.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.224.163.124">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I randomly checked several of your edits, and they were not acceptable. It appears that the only intention of your edits <b>(and there were lots of them)</b> were to drive traffic to a web site.

<dd>Thanks. I get the problem periodically, sometimes if I switch to IE to make the edit, instead of FireFox, the edit will work, but not always. The problem will only effect a certain articles, and other edits work fine, and even if I try maybe 15 minutes later, it will still fail. A few hours later it will be ok again. In this case, even wqile I was getting the problem, I could see other users making changes ok. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 03:25, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really don;t know what to do, anything where I can give a reason for reverting I revert, but (even though I was born there) I don't know enough about London to know when facts are being twisted. Some of the changes to postal codes and street names could be correct or vandalism and I have no clue. I have no idea what his goal is, whether it's just very sloppy editing, lack of knowledge or a twisted sense of humour. The best thing you can do is revert every edit that you can give a reason for, and put a warning on his page each time.

<p>Hi Armadillo, cute photograph of an Armadillo. You asked: who is the person's name I put at the end of my articles on <a href="../../../y/d/a/Yda_Addis_42b8.html" title="Yda Addis">Yda Addis</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Shea_Addis_1886.html" title="Alfred Shea Addis">Alfred Shea Addis</a>? That person is me, Marian Ecker. I have been researching Yda Addis about 7 years. I have written a book on her, the book is not yet published. But the LA Times is doing an article on Yda Addis and will most likely be in next Sunday's edition. The reason I sign my name is that both Addis's have simply vanished from history. There is no mention of either one in any canonized main stream research. However, Yda Addis will be anthologized in an upcoming scholarly literary volume next year. So, I put my name in order to give more authenticity to the article. Otherwise, I could have found an old photograph, made up a wild story about a person who never existed and submitted an article to wikipedia. How would anyone ever know if it were a real person who lived, or just a fiction in itself, but when I signed my name to the article, then the burden of proof is upon my shoulders and not that of wikipedia. Best regards, Marian Ecker. Template:~~</p>
<p>Hi Armadillo, thank you for wonderful comments. I've worked so long and so hard on Yda Addis, but I hardley ever even get a commnet. Thank you again. Marian</p>

<p>Why have you kept deleting the information i put up regarding the 1975 movie Bim. It is not vandalism or stolen copyrighted text and definatly not nonsense.

<dd>Because the last time you posted it, you copied word for word the information in IMdb.com - that is a copyright violation - so it was deleted very quickly. (Note that I do not delete anything, I just mark items as being problems, an administrator deletes it) Yesterday you added a link to it for the second time, and I deleted it a second time, since the article did not exist. You have now created the article again, and I have not looked at it in detail, but it's not acceptable as is, and it is possible someone will delete it. If it stays it will have to be cleaned up and rewritten and no claims of why the film is important enough to list, it is not in Wiki format and has at least one spelling error. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 16:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do you determine whether or not it is important enough and to whom do I tell this to?

<dd>It's not a matter of you telling someone the article is important, but of writing the article in such a way that enough information is included that the article shows the importance. For example if I created Tom Clancey (assumming i did not exist) and all it said was <i>Tom Clancey is an author and wrote good books</i> it would be "speedy deleted", if I include the list of books and the ISBN numbers, a link to his publisher and his web site, and more complete information, it will not get a "speedy delete" --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 16:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You mentioned that these articles should be speedied because "text is marked as copyright". I think the copyright lines in the two articles refer to the records themselves, not to the articles.

<p>Hi ArmadilloFromHell, I think you would do well as an <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">administrator</a> here on Wikipedia. 2 months of editing is usually not long enough to get "elected" (almost nobody succeeds before 3 months), so I'm just asking you to think about it for now. If you are interested, you can participate in <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> -- it would help you learn some idiosyncratic criteria some "voters" require of candidates (such as edit summary usage, edit counts in certain namespaces, etc.), and how candidates are expected to behave during the RFA (no canvassing for support, don't harass opposers). There is more information on the RFA process at <a href="../../../g/r/f/WP%7EGRFA_5f5a.html" title="WP:GRFA">WP:GRFA</a>, and information on what administrators do at <a href="../../../a/r/l/WP%7EARL_22a6.html" title="WP:ARL">WP:ARL</a>. Overall your contributions look great; I'm happy to nominate you whenever you're ready.

<p>As I was writing this message, I was just blocked by KillerChihuahua?!? on my talk page, but had made no edits since I last messaged you. There should be no reason for this. Since I am blocked, I am unable to reply. How wise of that murderer.</p>
<p>Back to my letter... Your note: "Someone using this IP address posted a message on my user talk page. If you cannot have the courtesy to follow the instuctions and put messages at the bottonm, you will not get a reply. --ArmadilloFromHell 19:30, 25 October 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Brief comment:</p>
<ul>
<li>You spelled “instuctions” and “bottonm” incorrectly.</li>
<li>I write with respect and precision; I expect the mannerism to be mutual.</li>
<li>Hell is a bad word</li>
</ul>
<p>In Reply: That was I who posted a message on your user talk page. If you cannot have the decency of moving my message to the bottom as you would prefer, instead of deleting it, then I shall do it myself.</p>
<p>This was my previous unanswered, polite and honest yet very serious and direct message:</p>
<p>"You have posted a logo on my user talk page, without any explanation. Your message was in error. I have read what constitutes vandalism and have not made repeated vandalization of articles. Reply with an explanation, and remove your logo immediately. Thank you."</p>
<p>I have followed your preference of "notices at the end," and expect you as a perceived helpful admin to reply to my messages under this category of "Logo," and not on the university's IP address. Regardless of your ability to follow instructions, I will respond, as I am responsible and keen in following up on my actions. It is your duty and obligation to do so as well.</p>
<p>I am, however, disappointed in your lack of assistance. I use Wikipedia all the time as a finite yet useful resource, and have never had such annoyance as Logos advertising nonsense on the talk page I am currently using until I leave the library. As you may observe at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Central_Intelligence_Agency&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Central_Intelligence_Agency&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Central_Intelligence_Agency&amp;action=history</a>, I have not vandalized after it was reverted. What I did do is to NOT write on the main page but to put {NPOV}} &amp; {bias}} which is justified. But stupid Colin Keigher reverted it back: (See) 04:05, 24 October 2006 67.2.148.181 (Talk) (Revert back to the last version by Colin Keigher) without any reason.</p>
<p>In other news, you may address me as Liberty. How would you wish to be address Mrs./Mr. AfH? Would AfH be prefer or AFH or afh, etc.?</p>
<p>I represent Freedom and the individual will who are not Killers or from Hell. I am your friend—do not make me your enemy! We are the good people.</p>
<p>I also have questions that are off-topic for you and would hope you, as an admin, would have an answer. I want to make my name, Liberty, a certain color. Will you direct me to the page where I may learn how? I am also interested in the Manual of Style for Wiki. Where am I to locate this? How do I revert an article back to previous versions? How do I find what time it is on Wikipedia? What time zone does Wikipedia use? How do I keep the pathetic US flag [[Image:Template:Country flag alias United States|22x20px|Template:Country alias United States]] without having to type all that? Where is the “minor edit box”? Furthermore, if I have future question regarding wikipedia, who do I contact?</p>
<p>Any questions, request for clarification/explanations, opinions, and rebuttals may be directed here, and I will promptly reply.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p><b>Liberty</b></p>

<dd>I am not going to spend any time answering all the above for several reason. An anon IP address can reprenet several people, so who knows who is doing what, one person can complait he never vandalzied nothing while another disrupts Wiki. I know I make spelling errors and invert letters, it is a disability I have, that is why I do not write too much or create many articles, instead I specialize in vandal trapping. In your case, I am happy to have had you blocked, I can only wish it was permanently, You are a prime example of the problem with IP addresses, you are a person with knowledge about Wiki, who comes to create problems and troll and fight. If you had been forced to have a name instead of an IP, you could have been given a permanent block. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 03:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>and you hate it too right .. it's good magazine i've download it and it's about games .. or you are too old to play . --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharif_aly_e700.html" title="User:Sharif aly">sharif aly</a> 09:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never said I hated it - all I said is that you violated the rules by removing the tag from it (that another editor put on), and that you recreated a previously deleted article. I could not hate the magazine since I know nothing about it, and your article says nothing about it - so I still know nothing - and that is why the article will be deleted. I'm very very old, and maybe you are too young to edit here. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 09:14, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you check your talk page, you will note that when this was moved (by another user) to a subpage of your user page, it was noted that is not appropriate for an article.

<dd>What about the links to the same site put in under the IP address, I think there are around 12 of them still in articles?

<dd>OK, I'll believe it this time, usually I'm a little doubtfull. There was one last month that claimed to be 9 years old, but based on the edits, highly doubtfull. Funny, though I'm just changing something she messed up a bit, but I was not going to warn here on it, just looks like sloppy removal of a line when inserting another line in. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 02:40, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I suppose that might be correct, but when someone keeps messing them up despite multiple warnings and advice, I really don't feel I have to do that.

<dd>I'd like to see it spelled out too. He obviously didn't understand either the hangon tag or why his articles were getting tagged, so clearly communication was the key in that case.

<p>Yes, both are named John Raymond Broadbent. The younger one died last Friday and it was that which prompted me to register and add him to the encyclopaeia. I am lost with all the symbols so any/all help is appreciated. The earlier listing for the older one had some errors of fact in it - I guess because someone had added detail from the younger to the older (eg, only the younger has a DSO though both have a CBE).
