<dd>So what happened to the AI/V&#160;? (that page does not seem to have any archive once an admin clears items from the list). Alec is back switching "asthma" to the redirected term of "asthma attack" and now querying whether diabetes is a disease or not on multiple pages. Also unenecyclopaedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asthma&amp;diff=89512629&amp;oldid=89104807" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asthma&amp;diff=89512629&amp;oldid=89104807" rel="nofollow">"What asthma is not"</a> section added to asthma. I'm coming to conclusion whilst has knowledge on the topics, is just trolling and being disruptive. I've posted a fresh item to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, see <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Disruptive_actions_of_Alec_U.K." title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#Disruptive actions of Alec U.K.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 21:24, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, for a while I had some pity on him, as a possibly disabled person who was trying to do his best. I have now concluded that it's a big game to see what he can get away with. I noticed within a few minutes that he was back, and have reverted a few obviously bad edits. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 00:22, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, buddy, I hope you have "thick skin" because I think you were a quarter-hour too early on your speedy deletion tag. I wasn't finished typing everything in when you stopped by.</p>
<p>Also, what do you think of moving it to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_cancellation.html" title="Project cancellation">Project cancellation</a>? --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:38, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, I agree, but in fact I removed the speedy tag about 30 seconds before you posted your message. The whole point of speedy tags is speedy, I generally post speedy tags within less than a minute of creation, it's not possible to tag articles for <b>maybe delete</b> and then come back 15 minutes later to see of they got better. Rule #1, is create your article in a userpage sandbox, and don't post until it's ready for primetime. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 15:45, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the tag removal, and regarding <i>at least 75% of projects are cancelled LOL</i> I intend to cite <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_McConnell_1c01.html" title="Steve McConnell">Steve McConnell</a>'s book which reports research statistics supporting a 50 to 55% figure. But maybe his sources were counting projects which actually got started. I'm in the stages of proposing a project right now. If they change their mind before I start work, was it "cancelled"?&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:43, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm counting projects that I actually worked on and got paid for. e.g.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>a six month project where the non-tech guy who provided me with support left the week the project was finished, and no one ever installed my system into production, and the owner of the company (who whined evry time I invoiced him)) a year later was not aware that he paid me for nothing.</li>
<li>an IBM software development project where 20 people worked for nine months, and the project was cancelled, because another IBM lab had been working on exactly the same project</li>
<li>a three month employee resource application that solved problems the branch had been having for two years, cancelled because the main office decide they could do it better (and of course they did not)</li>
<li>an application to automate and convert text documents to web pages, cancelled because the manager was technically dense and could not understand that it could be automated,a dn save tens of thousands of dollars, and decided to do the whole thing manually. etc. etc. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 15:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be a co-author of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_cancellation.html" title="Project cancellation">Project cancellation</a>, then. Anyway, when I do my next round of edits I'll let you know; your feedback will be valuable. ^_^ --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, actaully I have a very full and productive life. Now let me ask you, why would you take the trouble to create an account just to vandal a school page with a flag representing one of the most evil creations the world has know.

<p>Hello, Excuse me but I am trying to accomplish something that doesnt fall under the degree of vandalism, and I believe you would appreaciate it when I do complete the transfer of data that i am trying to accomplish without being interrupted by warning spammers.</p>
<p>The Invalid image was obviously not placed on purpose, rather than continuing to threaten me, try being resourceful and helping.

<dd>Sorry, but when your changes have been reverted several times, and you have been told not to change the picture wihtout reaching consensuse, and you post a link to a non-permitted image, it's vandalism.

<dd>So I gather. Voyeur that I am, I tried to look at the image, but when I found it was gone, I reverted the changes.

<dd>No, it was not there and not a flesh picture - but in another article and it very looked wrong - I checked the history and it and it had already been reverted once - so I reverted again there.

<dd>Yep, I was watching that whole dialogue. I wish there was a rule that newwbies can't issued welcome messages (or for some else I've been watching, be on the helpers list). You have a whole bunch of new people who will now go ask him for help, and he is clueless. Asking to be an admin after two days of warnings shows a complete lasck of understanding of what goes on here. There is a slight possibility the whole thing is just a game for him and he knows exactly what he is doing - the use of the IP address indicates that - playing sockpuppet and making an error to leave evidences. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 04:32, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ArmadilloFromHell, welcome to the WikiProject Fire Service!

<li>I am happy to rework anything; If it steps on either of the other two known related WikiProjects, we should works with their members as well. I am also looking to rework the templates I created for tagging pages, member pages, and stubs. Take a look at what I made and feel free to edit them or offer suggestions/alternatives. This all just started today but I think I have a good start. Thanks! --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaysleeper47_cafe.html" title="User:Daysleeper47">Daysleeper47</a> 21:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Apparently, you wrote this to me:</p>
<p>You recent creation of this article contained a list of books on Amazon with affiliate IDs attached. This is blatant spam, and misuse of WikiPedia.</p>
<p>Please stop. If you continue spamming you will be blocked from editing. --ArmadilloFromHellGateBridge 08:26, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here is my reply:</p>
<p>This is not true. If you check, the ref= indicates that the referral has been from images from Amazon. All I did was to go to Amazon.com without signing in, search for the book and then browse by clicking on links through that search. I tried to make it a point not to include my referral id by not signing in. I did not spam!!!! (I hope you read this, whoever you are!!!!)--Rwphan 08:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, I am not knowledgeable enough to know which part of the link to remove the referral. But rest assured, it is not a referral id for anyone to earn any money clicking on those links. At least I did not create them intentionally. Thanks for listening/reading.--Rwphan 08:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I edited the message on your talk page to exclude the warning part. Nevertheless, IMO, you should not be adding links to Amazon in Wikipedia. It is still link spam. The correct thing is to list the books with it's title and ISBN number. e.g.</dd>

<p>Hey, I am a fair user of Wikipedia for about 1 1/2 on both the English and the Bosnian Wikipedias. I am bureaucrat on the Bosnian Wikinews. So, I am not someone out of nowhere trying to put out my POV. I have neither vandalized nor plan on doing so. I am writing you in regards to the List of Serb war criminals. I'll be honest I see nothing wrong with the article. Let it be known that Serbians caused a lot of aggression and autocracies upon Bosnian civilians. Don't worry I am not writing this as if I have my own unresolved problems concerning the Bosnian War. First, the article is neutral. The people have been indicted by the ICYT and most are criminals (let is be decided by the court). The list of ICTY is a good one but is tedious to read. Seriously, looking at it al Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Albanians, Montenegrins, etc. are put on the same list. (if you notice only several Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) are there and only 3-4 have been sentenced). Therefore, it would be much easier to read and search for a list like that. The Serbian users are saying that the category is enough, since they know that reader of wiki and the beginning User will never look at the category or know how to search for something like that. Also, one cannot access the category without specifically clicking on it, meaning that there is not link in the article itself to lead to the category. This is their POV. We all have our own POV's and bias, but seriously no one on that page has given a decent reason.

<dd>But you miss the whole point, I'm not getting involved in the the politics or the validity or anthing that you talk about. It's really very simple. I saw a number of articles posted they were in my opinion deserving of a db-bio tag, as not asserting notability. E,g it's like creating an article that says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Hitler</b> was a tyrant who massacred a lot of people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have never heard of hitler, that article would get a db-bio as it says nothing. Later I happened to notice the List - which was related. All the warnings I've given are for violation of procedure vandalizing and vote stacking- nothing I have said states the pros or cons of anything you say. If you have a point, the way to make it is <b>not</b> by vandalzing and breaking the rules. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#DD2222"><b>Hell</b></font><font color="#AAAAAA"><b>GateBridge</b></font></a> 20:40, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that "motherfucker" needs to be kept. Per <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfanity_526b.html" title="Wikipedia:Profanity">Wikipedia:Profanity</a>, "Words and images that might be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by other Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not." It is not relevant or informative to say that MoFo is short for "one who has an odd relationship with one's mother". If I didn't already know that MoFo stood for motherfucker, I'd have to search through the article history to see what on earth that even meant. 140.247.243.220 04:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm working on a project to remove user pages from template categories, there is a common error that if people add templates in a certain way, they copy the category of the template into the user page, and the user page then shows up incorrectly in template categories. See Note #2 in <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloProcess_9f49.html" title="User:ArmadilloProcess">User:ArmadilloProcess</a> which is copied from the comments in most template categories. So I removed and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_user_templates_e38c.html" title="Category:Jewish user templates">Category:Jewish user templates</a> from your user page. It appears that I need to also remove some additional formatting caused by the two spaces.

<p>Thank you for adding the tags to the Din Din Aviv article, I wasn't sure exactly how to set them up. As for the vandal count uh, I didn't have a special tool, I saw your page and was just messing around, you know, figuring that the weirdest way to vandalise your page would be to raise the vandal count by one. so, if the last guy did two, maybe you should add another one... By the way, speaking of vandalism, where can I find more info about helping fight vandalism?

<p>Hi. It's not super important but you have the woodworking userbox twice. By the way, why does your page get vandalised so often? Three times in the past day?!

<dd>Yes, I bookmarked it when I bumped into it. I haven't had a food one since I was a kid in England. I can cook, but I've never done pastry. My daughter tried making them for me once to no sucess - so maybe I'll try again. As far as linking the other two (which I never heard of), I think a See also section on each one might be good.

<p>IFE should be in the firefighting and fire categories even if one of those cateogories comes within the other. I don't think five categories is excessive for one article. I thought the idea of the categories is to show articles in as many places as possible. You could remove it from Fire, but not firefighting, as the IFE provides qualifications for civilians and fire officers alike, so I think it should definitely feature in that category.

<p>I would take action myself but since I appear to be part of the conflict I think perhaps I should ask someone familiar.

The account was created only an hour ago and almost immediately began putting up articles for deletion, including some of mine (and on those the user has made what appears to be personal attacks). The user also seems to be behaving just the same way as the former user did, (stalking my edits?) and has recently posted copyright work (which has just been deleted). I think this could be a sockpuppet, but since I am not sure and since I also don't want to get into a serious confrontation or a serious bout of bad faith, I'd rather you look it over since I believe you have a little familiarity with this situation.

You are wrong. The initial warning was vandalism as I was not guilty of vandalism. therefore I was right to delete it. You are vandalising my page.--Roccobattaglia 21:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think you would be wise to check that my initial edit was in fact vandalism. It seems that you are harrassing me for no good reason.--Roccobattaglia 21:28, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note, these above warnings were not issued in the approved sequence, you can't issue a <b>test</b> warning immediately followed by a <b>test4</b> and tell someone they will be blocked, that in itself is another form of vandalism. Erasing talk page messages without discussion is a no-no, if you believe you have received a warning incorrectly, then discuss it with the person who issued the warning, and ask them to remove the warning, serially erasing warning messages seems like an attempt to hide the evidence and issuing warning messages to other editors in retalation is not a good idea.
