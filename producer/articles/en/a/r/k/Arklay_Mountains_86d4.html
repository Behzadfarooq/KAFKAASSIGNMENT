<p>The Arklay Mountains are situated northwest of Raccoon City, and are a popular hiking and camping destination frequented regularly by Raccoon's nature-loving populace. Most of the Arklay region is unused and is almost completely covered with heavy <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetation.html" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a>.</p>
<p>The Arklay Mountains are classified as <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temperate_hardwood_forest.html" title="Temperate hardwood forest">temperate hardwood forest</a>, with the region being dominated by <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_trees.html" title="Pine trees">Pine trees</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple_trees.html" title="Maple trees">Maple trees</a>, <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oak_trees.html" title="Oak trees">Oak trees</a> and other native plant life such as Raccoon City's signature colored herbs. The herbs were first discovered in the Arklay region and are often used for <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicinal.html" title="Medicinal">medicinal</a> purposes both locally and abroad. The Arklay Mountains are well known throughout the medical community, with the <i>Green,</i> <i>Blue,</i> and <i>Red</i> herbs having revolutionized the healthcare industry and garnered massive profits for pharmaceutical companies (including, but not limited to, the <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbrella_Corporation_a587.html" title="Umbrella Corporation">Umbrella Corporation</a>). Each herb has its own unique medicinal value and, being completely natural, have no known side effects associated with their use. They can be mixed together and converted into capsule or powder form to achieve different curative effects. The herbs can be found in many areas of Raccoon City, including several of the city's key public buildings, such as the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Raccoon_Police_Department_e7bb.html" title="Raccoon Police Department">Raccoon Police Department</a> precinct. The citizens of Raccoon City have also been known to keep the herbs in their houses and places of employment for decoration or use.</p>
<p>Although never officially proven, it is theorised that the coloured herbs have a naturally occurring immunity or, at the very least, a strong resistance to both the "T" and "G" viral strains. This belief stems from certain instances in which other forms of plantlife have succumbed to the mutagenic properties of the T-Virus after infection or exposure. Not only this, but when the herbs are mixed correctly, the creation of powerful "Anti-Virus" medication is possible. These capsules, while unable to cure a carrier host of infection, can halt viral growth entirely for moderate periods of time. If in large quantities and consumed constantly, an infected host can effectively suppress the T-Virus indefinitely.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Edit section: Green Herbs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Green Herbs</span></h3>
<p>The Green Herb first originated in the Arklay Mountains. It grows in and around Raccoon City and much of the Arklay Forest. It is used to heal injuries ranging from minor to severe in nature, and can be combined with other herbs to amplify the desired effect. The Green Herb is by far the most commonly encountered variation of the species. The capsule form of the Green Herb can neutralize various poisons and venoms with effects identical to that of its relative, the Blue Herb.</p>

<p>The Blue Herb also originated in the Arklay Mountains, and is used to cure minor poisonous infections (such as those caused by plant life, insects or venomous snakes). When the Blue Herb is combined with the Green Herb, it will both heal the wound and cure poisonous infections. The capsule form of the Blue Herb can heal wounds with effects identical to the Green Herb. Although the Blue Herb has the ability to purge most types of venom and poison from the body, it has proven completely ineffective against the <a href="../../../t/-/v/T-Virus_f7f5.html" title="T-Virus">T-Virus</a>. Note: The Blue Herb is unable to combat the poisonous properties of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Resident_Evil_characters_afcc.html#Alexander_Ashford" title="List of minor Resident Evil characters">Alexander Ashford</a> or "Nosferatu". This is possibly due to the poisonous spores released by said individual being the original by-product of an unforseen viral mutation resulting from Ashford's infection by the <a href="../../../t/-/v/T-Veronica_Virus_e761.html" title="T-Veronica Virus">T-Veronica Virus</a>.</p>

<p>The Red Herb, like its relatives, also originated in the Arklay Mountains. However, unlike its counterparts, the Red Herb has absolutely no curative effect of its own and generally cannot be used by itself, but can be combined with the Green Herb to amplify its effects. The capsule form of the Red Herb can be used as a <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemostat.html" title="Hemostat">hemostat</a> to stop severe bleeding. Note: While mixing Red and Blue herbs is usually not possible, this can be done in order to produce "Recovery" capsules in the <i>Outbreak</i> series.</p>

<p>The Ecliptic Express was a first-class locomotive, designed to transport its passengers in absolute luxury and comfort. The train and its crew were well-equipped to handle this task with the Ecliptic Express bearing all the hallmarks of its elite status, such as:</p>

This clandestine method of operation had proven successful for Umbrella in past instances as their private township, located on <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheena_Island_a64d.html" title="Sheena Island">Sheena Island</a>, was modelled in much the same way.</p>

<p>On July 23, 1998 the R.P.D.'s S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team was sent to investigate several bizarre, cannibalistic murders that had recently occurred in the north-western Arklay Mountains region. While monitoring the area from above, the team's helicopter suffered an engine failure mid-flight, forcing Bravo Team to make an emergency landing in a densely covered area of Raccoon Forest. Bravo Team's medic and rookie operative, <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Chambers_e5be.html" title="Rebecca Chambers">Rebecca Chambers</a>, and former <a href="../../../u/s/m/USMC_2798.html" title="USMC">USMC</a> 2nd Lieutenant-turned-fugitive, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Coen_ec68.html" title="Billy Coen">Billy Coen</a>, crossed paths aboard the derelict Ecliptic Express (attacked earlier that evening by the vengeful <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Marcus_b30a.html" title="James Marcus">James Marcus</a>) and grudgingly decide to form an alliance in order to survive the onslaught of freakish creatures attacking them. The pair eventually find themselves at the locomotive's previous destination, the abandoned Management Training Facility, which had been undergoing evaluation by Umbrella's security and research teams for re-opening at a later date. Inside, the two witness horrible truths about the Umbrella Corporation's shadowy past, whilst attempting to escape the infected Umbrella personnel wandering the facility and the rampaging James Marcus hunting them at every turn.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Edit section: The Abandoned Hospital">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Abandoned Hospital</span></h3>
<p>In addition to their concealed facilities deep within the Arklay Forest, the <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbrella_Corporation_a587.html" title="Umbrella Corporation">Umbrella Corporation</a> supervised the illegal secret testing of experimental medicines and products on patients in a local hospital situated at the edge of the forest. Disguised as "Drugs, Inc.," the Umbrella Corporation supplied this hospital with experimental products whilst managing to completely avoid involvement or detection by having the hospital's staff and its administrator, Albert Lester, carry out its nefarious acts. Al's wife, Dorothy, was suffering from a debilitating terminal illness, and he was desperate to find something capable of curing her, even if the chances of success were remote. When Drugs, Inc. proposed testing of its products (including the <a href="../../../t/-/v/T-Virus_f7f5.html" title="T-Virus">T-Virus</a>) on the hospital's patients, Al eagerly agreed to assist them in their efforts. Several patients, including Dorothy, were injected with the T-Virus and monitored closely by Al. Initially, the T-Virus cured Dorothy of her illness, but after several days of observation, it became apparent that Dorothy was no longer herself, having succumbed to the effects of the T-Virus in much the same way as all people do.</p>
<p><br />
For an unknown period of time, the hospital covered its crimes by telling the families of the research victims that their loved ones had died as a result of illness, or during surgery. After many of these cover-ups had occurred, the families and friends of the victims began protesting and rallying at the gates of the hospital, demanding answers and accusing the hospital's staff of negligent malpractice. Eventually a journalist named Kurt from local newspaper, <i>The Daily Raccoon</i>, decided to investigate the situation. Researching the hospital's staff and its supplier, Drugs, Inc., Kurt was unable to find any detailed information regarding the company or its products. Attempting to question the hospital's staff in an official sense, Kurt became frustrated with the administrator's stonewalling tactics and lack of any solid evidence as to what was transpiring behind the hospital's closed doors.</p>
<p>After an unknown period of time, Kurt's failure to locate any real leads or information regarding the true nature of Drugs, Inc. and the hospital's wrong doings lead him to act on instinct and break into the facility in an attempt to gather drug samples or some other sort of credible information. This move would prove fatal for Kurt, as he was killed by the infected Dorothy that night. The R.P.D. had already begun investigating the illegal drug imports into the hospital when the incident occurred, and Kurt's death forced the investigating team into action. When the police warned the administrator and his staff that they would be pressing charges, Umbrella decided to utilize their contacts within Raccoon's political and law enforcement community. Police Chief <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Resident_Evil_characters_afcc.html#Brian_Irons" title="List of minor Resident Evil characters">Brian Irons</a> had the official investigation dropped and saw to it that Kurt's death and the illegal drug imports were quietly forgotten. The investigating unit had suspicions of Umbrella's involvement in the incident and pleaded with Chief Irons to have Umbrella's local activities looked into, not knowing Irons was actually on Umbrella's payroll. Of course, the Chief denied this opportunity, citing a lack of any evidence as his reason for doing so. Deciding not to risk another incident, the Umbrella Corporation had the hospital closed down and the remaining staff dispersed elsewhere to avoid any further media scrutiny.</p>
<p>After the hospital was closed, Al continued to care for Dorothy in the basement's intensive care unit, building a cabin close to the hospital so that he'd always be close to her. Although Dorothy was brain-dead, he simply couldn't find the will to let go of his beloved. For over five years Al continued his futile efforts to revive Dorothy without incident or the outside world's knowledge. Eventually, a decorative plant inside the basement somehow became infected with the T-Virus and, much to Al's fascination, began growing at an incredible rate. The plant consumed Dorothy and infected Al, gifting him with superhuman strength and making him almost impervious to attack due to his now rapidly healing body. In some sense, at least in Al's fragile mind, the plant "became" Dorothy. He began to tend to and care for it, bringing it small animals, such as birds and dogs, to nourish it. Eventually, Al witnessed "Dorothy's" rapid growth when it managed to catch a human and, excited by the effect the victim had on the plant's overall development, decided to start luring hikers and campers into the hospital's abandoned walls as fresh victims for "Dorothy". It can be assumed that many of the reports regarding missing hikers and campers issued before the events of the 'mansion incident' were the result of Al's twisted desire to keep "Dorothy" alive by any means necessary.</p>
<p>It is unclear just how long Al carried out his sick mission, but by the time the survivors of <i><a href="../../../f/i/l/Resident_Evil_Outbreak%7E_File_2_2c9d.html" title="Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2">Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2</a></i> were lured into its bowels, the hospital had been completely infested by "Dorothy", which was now nearly a hundred feet tall, and had the building on the verge of total collapse. After finding research notes left by a team of ill-fated botanists, who fell victim to Al and "Dorothy" not long before the arrival of the survivors, they were able to find the plant's Achilles-heel and destroy it, taking Al, Dorothy's corpse, the entire derelict hospital, and any evidence of Umbrella's involvement along with it.</p>

<p>Raccoon Dam is situated in the Arklay Mountains. The dam provides the bulk of Raccoon City's water supply and connects with the Circular river as well as Victory Lake. During the investigation conducted by the S.T.A.R.S. unit, Bravo Team's <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Chambers_e5be.html" title="Rebecca Chambers">Rebecca Chambers</a> and fugitive <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Coen_ec68.html" title="Billy Coen">Billy Coen</a> sought refuge in the dam during the viral outbreak in the Arklay Mountains on July 23, 1998.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Edit section: Mendez River">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mendez River</span></h4>
<p>The Mendez River flows from the western Arklay Mountains region, connecting to the outskirts of Raccoon City via its shipping docks. Not long before the outbreak, a 39-year-old man was found dead on the banks of the Mendez, having been attacked and severely mutilated not long before his discovery. An unidentified man was found wandering the vicinity close to the body, covered in blood and unresponsive. The R.P.D. arrested the man and transferred him to the precinct for questioning.</p>
<p><a name="Victory_Lake" id="Victory_Lake"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Edit section: Victory Lake">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Victory Lake</span></h4>
<p>Victory Lake is a popular tourist destination and holiday spot for Raccoon City's nature-loving citizens. In S.D. Perry's novel, during the <a href="../../../t/-/v/T-Virus_f7f5.html" title="T-Virus">T-Virus</a> outbreak in the Arklay Mountains, the mutilated corpses of Deanne Rusch and Christopher Smith were discovered on the lake's shoreline. The attackers were described only as mysterious monsters that had been witnessed in the area several days earlier.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Edit section: Circular River">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Circular River</span></h4>
<p>The Circular River flows through both the northern and southern regions surrounding Raccoon City. Aside from the river's geography, very little else is known in regards to its background and history.</p>
<p><a name="Marble_River" id="Marble_River"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Edit section: Marble River">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marble River</span></h4>
<p>The Marble River flows from the Arklay Forest region and runs through Raccoon City's Cidar District. In May 1998, a deceased woman in her early 20's was discovered close to the Marble River. It is believed that this was the first victim to spark the public's concern regarding a vicious cult operating in the Arklay Forest and the ensuing investigation involving the S.T.A.R.S. unit.</p>
<p><a name="Aimes_River" id="Aimes_River"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklay_Mountains_86d4.html" title="Edit section: Aimes River">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aimes River</span></h4>
<p>The Aimes River is located near several major hiking and camping paths surrounding the Arklay Mountains. Various small streams break away from the Aimes, leading those planning on staying in close proximity to its banks sometimes lost much deeper within the Arklay Forest. Many of the distress calls made by hikers and campers new to the Arklay region are a result of the Aimes River's complex structure. Because the Aimes River was so difficult to supervise, it had long been the favoured dumping ground for illegal chemical and drug companies operating within its vicinity. On October 31st, 1996, the body of a man was discovered floating in the Aimes River by campers. The coroner determined that the man had been dead for at least six months prior to his discovery and was so badly decayed that identification was impossible. A high level of various illegal and unidentified drugs were found in the man's body, leading the R.P.D. to suspect the man had been drugged and murdered, but with no apparent motive. The subsequent police investigation that followed was later dropped after it failed to yield any results.</p>
