<dd>I agree with Kchisho, and recently saw fit to change the article to express that Arkham is an Insane Asylum, and thus the paragraph about non-insane residents being kept there is misleading and unneccesary. It doesn't matter whether or not it says "the majority." Quite simply, the villains there are the insane ones, and the villains that aren't, Catwoman, Penguin, Rupert Thorne and other mafia types, go to Blackgate. Because of them, one cannot say that all Batman's villains are in Arkham, and because of JLA foes like Dr. Destiny and Jason Woodrue/Floronic Man, one cannot say that the villains there are all Batman's! There is something to be said that maybe Croc and Mr. Freeze aren't quite as insane as they are too-difficult-to-contain, but this notion is already expressed in the entry.--<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESignor_Giuseppe_0c0f.html" title="User:Signor Giuseppe">Signor Giuseppe</a> 04:58, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But there really was a trend during the eighties for the majority of Batman's villains to end up in Arkham regardless of whether they belonged there. Perhaps the situation has since improved - in which case, perhaps a sentence could be added saying so - but the statement is not incorrect. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_A_a8ca.html" title="User:Paul A">Paul A</a> 01:19, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's true, but lots of trends in Batman comics (say, all of the 1950s) have little to do with current Gotham City, and are best overlooked. If the notion of sane criminals in Arkham is essential to this entry, then why not add it right after we talk about the special needs patients? Something like "Additionally, there was a trend in some 1980s Batman comics to have all Gotham criminals contained in Arkham." I'd like to ask for proof that a non-insane, non special-needs Batman villain was kept in Arkham, but it's not exactly fair to make a fellow dig through his stack of back issues just for a Wikipedia entry.--<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESignor_Giuseppe_0c0f.html" title="User:Signor Giuseppe">Signor Giuseppe</a> 02:39, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recently created a section simply called "Graphic Novels," the title of which was, quite reasonably I'd say, changed to "Graphic Novels featuring Arkham Asylum." I fear, however, that this opens the floodgates to a lot of graphic novels that don't belong here, such as <i>Batman: Nosferatu</i> or <i>Harley Quinn</i> or hundreds of others. In this case, I think that a simple "Graphic Novels" might be better, the implication being that this in an entry for "Arkham Asylum" and here are some graphic novels with that name. Then, users looking for information of the books I mentioned might find it elsewhere, at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harley_Quinn_f479.html" title="Harley Quinn">Harley Quinn</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nosferatu.html" title="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>.--<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESignor_Giuseppe_0c0f.html" title="User:Signor Giuseppe">Signor Giuseppe</a> 05:09, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But if the section is just for graphic novels named <i>Arkham Asylum</i>, it would only have one graphic novel in it, because <i>Arkham Asylum: Hell on Earth</i> is named <i>Arkham Asylum: Hell on Earth</i> (and should probably be at Arkham Asylum: Hell on Earth instead of at <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkham_Asylum_f9b6.html" title="Arkham Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>. Come to think of it, <i>Arkham Asylum</i> should probably be at Arkham Asylum (graphic novel) instead of at <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkham_Asylum_f9b6.html" title="Arkham Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>). --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_A_a8ca.html" title="User:Paul A">Paul A</a> 01:44, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that "Hell on Earth" is merely the subtitle, and that both of these books are notable for taking place entirely within Arkham Asylum, rather than just having it be the place from which the villain escapes for his caper. Making two new Wikipedia entries is not the answer. The entry is well constructed as it is: Here's what the institution is, here's what's happened there, here's who lives there, and here's it's official, recorded history. The section heading is a fine description of the books that are there, but I think simply "Graphic Novels" would be more restrictive against the many books that feature Arkham in their pages.--<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESignor_Giuseppe_0c0f.html" title="User:Signor Giuseppe">Signor Giuseppe</a> 02:39, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to this page the asylum didn't appear in comic form until 40 years later. Given that , and the fact that its credited as someone else's creation, I find this story suspect.

<dd>It explains why it was named Arkham. So long as the story is true I think it should be returned to the article. Another question I have is: isn't the name "Arkham Asylum" actually used explicitly by Lovecraft in some of his stories?

<dd>In "The Thing on the Doorstep", by Lovecraft, the first paragraph makes reference to "Arkham Sanitarium". Although this is not necessarily a mental hospital, the last page or so of the story makes it clear that in fact "Arkham Sanitarium" is an "asylum" where one of the characters is incarcerated for madness and then murdered. Obviously I am more of a Lovecraft fan than a Batman fan; how do other editors feel about more directly crediting Lovecraft with the name of this place? --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinasaur_7224.html" title="User:Chinasaur">Chinasaur</a> 05:43, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is good reason to suspect Lovecraft "beheld" Danvers State Mental Hospital at least once -- in 1922, while transitioning out of his macabre and Dream-Cycle periods and into his mature Cthluhu Mythos cycle. That year Lovecraft traveled from Providence to Gloucester to visit his eventual wife, Sonia Haft Greene. His path almost certainly took him through Danvers along Route One, over which the asylum looms. Any traveler along that road has seen the building -- it's unmistakable, and undeniably eerie -- you can't miss it.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Gloucester, Lovecraft was inspired by Sonia Haft Greene to begin a new sequence of stories. See reference below. --User:Session Nine 013:47, 09 OCT 2006</p>

<p>Would it be possible for someone more proficient than I to move or delete the above mentioned section of the article? I wasn't entirely sure what to do, but I think it was meant to be placed on this page and got posted to the article instead.</p>
<p>Agreed. Moved. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a> 17:54, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Today the Asylum has no definite location though its in the suburbs,most likely or mansion as “mercy house”, but in recent incarnation it is in the “narrows” in Batman begins movie, narrows is apparent as slums or low cost apartments. The asylum was once on a island on the Batman animated series I think, which I liked. I would like to relocate again to a more permanent location and preserve the asylum for future stories. Writers who want to use Arkham Asylum to any extent recommend using the rural area of Gotham city, as was it the Asylum first built as for the preservation this Wikipedia page of Arkham asylum is preserving the History greatly already.
