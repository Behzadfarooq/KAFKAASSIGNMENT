<p>The <b>Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane</b> is a fictional <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatric_hospital.html" title="Psychiatric hospital">psychiatric hospital</a> that appears in the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a>. It is located near <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>, and is where those of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>'s foes considered to be legally insane are incarcerated (other foes are incarcerated at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackgate_Penitentiary_3213.html" title="Blackgate Penitentiary">Blackgate Penitentiary</a>). Inspired by the works of <a href="../../../h/2E/p/H.P._Lovecraft_03a6.html" title="H.P. Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>, the asylum was created by <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_O%27Neil_3c18.html" title="Dennis O'Neil">Dennis O'Neil</a>, and first appeared in <i>Batman</i> #258 (October 1974); much of its <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back-story.html" title="Back-story">back-story</a> was created by <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Wein_4159.html" title="Len Wein">Len Wein</a> during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Arkham Asylum does not have a good record, at least with regard to the high profile cases; escapes are frequent (on at least one occasion, an <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder.html" title="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive-compulsive</a> multiple murderer was signed out of Arkham into the care of an <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_8_%28comics%29.html" title="Section 8 (comics)">incontinent, alcoholic vagrant</a>, on the grounds that he "looked like a responsible citizen"), and those who are 'cured' and released tend to re-offend. Furthermore, several staff members, including at least one director, have ended up as residents, notably <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Harleen_Quinzel_4a70.html" title="Dr. Harleen Quinzel">Dr. Harleen Quinzel</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock-Up_%28comics%29_0946.html" title="Lock-Up (comics)">Lyle Bolton</a> and, in some incarnations, Drs. <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Crane_0094.html" title="Jonathan Crane">Jonathan Crane</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Strange_d5de.html" title="Hugo Strange">Hugo Strange</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, prisoners with unusual medical conditions that prevent them from staying in a regular prison are housed there. For example, <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Freeze_bbb2.html" title="Mr. Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a> is not technically insane, but he requires a strongly refrigerated environment to stay alive, which only Arkham can provide.</p>

<p>In the world of the Batman stories, the Asylum is named after Elizabeth Arkham, founder Amadeus Arkham's mother. Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham's mother, having suffered from <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_illness.html" title="Mental illness">mental illness</a> most of her life, committed <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. (It is later revealed that she was actually <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanized</a> by her son, an act his mind repressed.) Amadeus Arkham decided, then, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not go untreated and suffer as his mother had. Prior to the period of the hospital's remodeling, Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28comics%29.html" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a>, where he and his wife, Constance, and daughter, Harriet, had been living for quite some time.</p>
<p>Upon telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Arkham received a call from the police notifying him Martin "Mad Dog" Hawkins — a patient referred to Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital — had escaped from prison, and sought his considered opinion on his state of mind.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">raped</a> and mutilated bodies of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room, Hawkins having carved his nickname on Harriet's body.</p>
<p>Despite this family tragedy, the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane officially opened that November. One of its first patients was Martin Hawkins, whom Arkham insisted on personally treating. On April 1, 1922, after treating Hawkins for six months, Arkham strapped him to the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_therapy.html" title="Shock therapy">electroshock</a> couch and purposely <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_shock.html" title="Electric shock">electrocuted</a> him. The death was treated as an accident but contributed to Arkham's gradual descent into madness, which he began to believe was his birthright. Eventually, Arkham was institutionalized in his own hospital, where he eventually died.</p>

<p>Arkham Asylum was named in honour of the fictional city of <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkham.html" title="Arkham">Arkham, Massachusetts</a>, one of the settings of <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._P._Lovecraft_a712.html" title="H. P. Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s horror stories. In fact, when the asylum first appeared, it was actually in the city of Arkham; its Gotham location, and the consequent alternative explanation of the name, were later <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retcons</a>. Lovecraft's Arkham Sanitarium may have been inspired by the Danvers State Insane Asylum (aka the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danvers_State_Hospital_3a88.html" title="Danvers State Hospital">Danvers State Hospital</a>) in <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danvers%2C_Massachusetts_10c5.html" title="Danvers, Massachusetts">Danvers, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>Arkham is similar to several real life mental hospitals. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward%27s_Island_7278.html" title="Ward's Island">Ward's Island</a> in the East River was the home of the New York City Asylum for the Insane, opened around 1863, and the nearby <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roosevelt_Island_249d.html" title="Roosevelt Island">Roosevelt Island</a> once had several mental institutions and prisons including the New York City Lunatic Asylum.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkham_Asylum_f9b6.html" title="Edit section: Publication history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Publication history</span></h2>
<p>Arkham Asylum first appeared in 1974, in <i>Batman</i> #258 by <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_O%27Neil_3c18.html" title="Dennis O'Neil">Dennis O'Neil</a>. In this story, it was named as "Arkham Hospital" (although it was already clear what kind of hospital it was); "Arkham Asylum" first appeared in another O'Neil story the following year, but it was not until 1979 that "Arkham Asylum" completely replaced "Arkham Hospital" (and the occasional "Arkham Sanatarium") as the institution's name. By 1979, too, the move to have the asylum closer to Gotham had begun; that was completed in 1980, when <i>Batman</i> #326 by <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Wein_4159.html" title="Len Wein">Len Wein</a> described the Asylum's location "deep in the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburbs</a> of Gotham City". (Perhaps for this reason <i>Batman</i> #326 is listed in some histories as the first appearance of Arkham Asylum.) It was also Wein who, in 1985's <i>Who's Who</i> #1, created its current back-story.</p>
<p>Arkham Asylum has been demolished or destroyed several times in its history, notably during the events of <i>Batman: The Last Arkham</i> (see below). It was also seriously damaged at the beginning of the <i><a href="../../../k/n/i/Knightfall.html" title="Knightfall">Knightfall</a></i> storyline, when <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bane_%28comics%29.html" title="Bane (comics)">Bane</a> used stolen munitions to blow up the facility and release all the inmates. After these events, the asylum was relocated to a large mansion known as "mercy house", where it remains to this day. At the beginning of the <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Man%27s_Land_%28comics%29_ddf2.html" title="No Man's Land (comics)">No Man's Land</a></i> storyline, the asylum was closed down and all its inmates set free (a timer was used to open the doors two minutes before the city was sealed). This was ochrestrated by the administrator himself, who had the choice of releasing the inmates or watching them all starve or kill each other. On the middle of the story, it is revealed that Batman has established a hidden base within the subbasement of the asylum during the <i>Prodigal</i> storyline known as "Northwest <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batcave.html" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
During the <i>No Man's Land</i>, Arkham was taken over by the Joker and Harley Quinn. With the sole exception of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Riddler_e2d1.html" title="The Riddler">the Riddler</a>, the inmates elected to remain in the cut-off Gotham City.</p>

<p>Originally, Arkham Asylum was used only to house genuinely insane characters - the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">Joker</a> and <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-Face_e8c6.html" title="Two-Face">Two-Face</a> were inmates from its very first appearance - but over the course of the 1980s a trend was established of having the majority of Batman's <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supervillain.html" title="Supervillain">supervillain</a> opponents end up at Arkham, whether or not they were actually insane. This is likely due to some of the facility's high-tech features that make it more efficient to hold a villain such as <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayface.html" title="Clayface">Clayface</a> there than in another prison. Nearly all of Batman's villains have spent some time in Arkham.</p>
<p>Other DC Universe publications that feature Arkham Asylum and its inmates include <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp_Thing_e627.html" title="Swamp Thing">Swamp Thing</a></i> (wherein Jason Woodrue -- The <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floronic_Man_d41b.html" title="Floronic Man">Floronic Man</a> -- is detained) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sandman_%28DC_Comics_Vertigo%29_e6c2.html" title="The Sandman (DC Comics/Vertigo)">The Sandman</a></i> by <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Gaiman_bd49.html" title="Neil Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>, wherein John Dee (<a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Destiny_9c5c.html" title="Doctor Destiny">Doctor Destiny</a>) escapes to wreak havoc on both the 'real' and 'dream' worlds.</p>
<p>Arkham has also been featured in varying capacities in a number of high profile DC miniseries events, such as <i><a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_Crisis_%28comics%29_305a.html" title="Identity Crisis (comics)">Identity Crisis</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_of_Vengeance_6336.html" title="Day of Vengeance">Day of Vengeance</a>,</i> and <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_On_Infinite_Earths_558e.html" title="Crisis On Infinite Earths">Crisis On Infinite Earths</a></i>.</p>

<p>This six-issue <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniseries.html" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a> and the subsequent trade paperback provided an intricate and multi-layered look at Arkham Asylum from several points of view: the director (Dr. Jeremiah Arkham), a psychiatrist (Dr. Anne Carver), the guards (particularly one Aaron Cash), and the inmates (with particular focus on heretofore unknown residents "Jane Doe", "Junkyard Dog", "Doodlebug", "Lunkhead", "Death Rattle", and, perhaps most memorably, "<a href="../../../h/u/m/Humpty_Dumpty_%28comics%29_4c7e.html" title="Humpty Dumpty (comics)">Humpty Dumpty</a>"). The driving force is the recent incarceration of a ruthless investor, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_White_%28comics%29_ed78.html" title="Great White (comics)">Warren "The Great White Shark" White</a>, as well as the demonic element suggested by the title.

<p>Originally a four-issue storyline that kicked off the <i>Shadow of the Bat</i> series. In it, the old Arkham Asylum is destroyed, to be replaced by a new and more modern facility. The story introduces Jeremiah Arkham, the asylum's director, and nephew of Amadeus Arkham; and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a> <a href="../../../z/s/a/Zsasz.html" title="Zsasz">Victor Zsasz</a>. These two have, in an uneasy partnership, captured Batman and are holding him prisoner in Arkham, attempting to see what makes him tick.</p>
<p>This story makes a few passing references to the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashback_%28literary_technique%29.html" title="Flashback (literary technique)">flashback</a> events of <i>Arkham Asylum</i>, such as Amadeus Arkham taping over the mirror, and his journal is shown early in the story. Jeremiah also mentions his relative's descent into madness. This would seem to indicate that at least some of the events in the <i>Arkham Asylum</i> graphic novel did occur in the main continuity.</p>
<p>An episode of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i> titled "Dreams of Darkness", also about Batman in Arkham, seems to have been a very loose adaptation of this storyline, replacing Zsasz with the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarecrow_%28comics%29.html" title="Scarecrow (comics)">Scarecrow</a>, and replacing Jeremiah Arkham with a more nondescript administrator, who is portrayed as clueless and naive rather than sinister.</p>

<p>Arkham has appeared beyond the pages of the comics in numerous guises and designs. Its appearances include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Forever_1d7b.html" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a></i>: Arkham was seen at the end of the film, and designed as a tall, spiraling castle-like structure, with narrow hallways lined with brightly-lit glass bricks. The Riddler was incarcerated in a large padded cell. The psychologist seen was named Dr. Burton, a reference to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Burton_a41c.html" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a>. There was a more in-depth sequence involving Two-Face escaping from Arkham at the beginning of the film, but it was cut for time reasons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_and_Robin_%281997_film%29_a5ad.html" title="Batman and Robin (1997 film)">Batman and Robin</a></i>: Arkham appeared a number of times in this film. It first appeared when Mr. Freeze was taken there midway through the film, and later at the end when both he and Poison Ivy were shown as cellmates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i>: Arkham played a much larger role than a simple jail in this film, with Jonathan Crane (also known as the Scarecrow) being either the administrator or at least a high ranking doctor at the Asylum, and using it to conduct cruel experiments with his fear gas, using his own patients as <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea_pig.html" title="Guinea pig">guinea pigs</a>. He also used the pipes under the Asylum to empty his toxin into the Gotham water supply. One notable change in this version of Arkham from the comics was the location. While the location has varied in the comics, it is generally located some distance outside of Gotham City, often in a rural or forested location. However, <i>Batman Begins</i> has it in the middle of Gotham City, located in the <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slum.html" title="Slum">slum</a> region known as the Narrows.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i>: Arkham has appeared frequently in the series. It is depicted as generally dark and gloomy, and the cells are similar to those in the comics, being primarily closed via glass doors. Much of the rest of the asylum resembles a prison more than a mental hospital, however; in one episode, it is explained that all criminals apprehended by the Batman are sent to Arkham rather than jail (although it is shown that the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin_%28comics%29.html" title="Penguin (comics)">Penguin</a> goes to Stonegate, a regular jail). In the series, neither Jeremiah or Amadeus Arkham are shown or mentioned, but the episode "Dreams in Darkness" features a character who is obviously modeled on Jeremiah, but toned down to a more compassionate persona.</li>
