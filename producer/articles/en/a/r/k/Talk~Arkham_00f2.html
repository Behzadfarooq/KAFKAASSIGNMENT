<p><i>The real-life model for Arkham seems to be, in fact, Salem [Massachusetts]</i></p>
<p>Several Lovecraft scholars have claimed to the contrary that Providence, Rhode Island, was the model for Arkham (and that Brown was the model for Miskatonic University). I believe that S.T. Joshi is among them. If you Google "arkham providence" you will pull a list including literally dozens of websites also claiming that Providence was the model for Arkham (although none cite the source of this allegation). That said, I cannot immediately provide a specific attributable citation supporting Providence, but the Salem statement given above is — if not false — inaccurate and misleading. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 22:50, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>When I first came across this article, it cited <b>no sources</b> to substantiate any of the claims it made. Since then, I've made great strides in providing <b><a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a></b> for the information given. With regard to the location of Arkham, I did include a footnote giving different views on this matter. It is also worth nothing that in the "Arkham" entry in <i>The H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia</i>, Joshi and Schultz came to <i>no</i> firm conclusions about the place that Arkham is based upon (though the footnote in the article does quote from Lovecraft who infers that Arkham is based on Salem).<br />
<br />
As far as "google searches" are concerned (and speaking solely for myself!), I would give the results about as much weight as I would a bag of wet field mice (though the sack of waterlogged rodents could probably make a stronger case as far as I'm concerned). Yes, I'm being flippant (don't take me too seriously). I suppose the point I'm making is that the internet, as it stands now, is not the respository of human knowledge that it purports itself to be (or would like to be seen as). After all, it's only been around for a little more than a decade, whereas published books, journals, etc. have been around since the dawn of recorded history (wow that's <i>deep</i>). Hence, there is far more critically- and peer-reviewed <i>published</i> material out there (i.e., physical books) than there is on the net. That's not to say there are not reliable sources on the internet (for example, some of S. T. Joshi's writings are on the net). The upshot is that not everything on the net can be trusted (especially if the source fails to cite <b><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable sources</a></b> or comes from an unaccredited author). And there are also tautological problems—namely, misinformation propagated from site to site so that an <i>alleged</i> fact generates a lot of hits. I would recommend finding a published source (professional publishers are usually very careful about what they put into print—their reputation is on the line after all) that supports your point of view; that way, no one can accuse you of violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. (A good source on Lovecraftiana would probably be Joshi's massive biography on H. P. Lovecraft: <i>H. P. Lovecraft: A Life</i>, West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press; 2004; ISBN 0-940884-88.)<br />

<li>When I read the article, the text was slightly different. Check the history of the article for details. What I added was, specifically, a cite from August Derleth that pointed to Salem as model for Arkham. As you may imagine, Derleth's opinions have a high weight when speaking about Lovecraft. Anyway, I will describe where to find the cite so that you can judge whether or not it may be true. To put things into context, Derleth is explaining why he chose <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkham_House_e191.html" title="Arkham House">"Arkham House"</a> as the name for his publishing house:<br />
<br />
"There was never any question about the name of our publishing house. ‘Arkham House’ suggested itself at once, since it was Lovecraft’s own well-known, widely-used place-name for legend-haunted Salem, Massachusetts, in his remarkable fiction; it seemed to us that this was fitting and that Lovecraft himself would have approved it enthusiastically".<br />
<br />
I really don't know where you may find this cite published. However, it may be read at Arkham House's homepage, in the section about the house itself[<a href="http://www.arkhamhouse.com/about.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arkhamhouse.com/about.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].<br />
<br />
Now, whether or not to give it credit is a different story. Personally, I think that reading it in the homepage of the publishing house founded by Derleth makes it believable.<br />
<br />
PS: I have found a small note giving references for the cites on the page:<br />
Twenty Years of Arkham House© 1959 by August Derleth<br />
Thirty Years of Arkham House © 1970 by August Derleth<br />
<br />
If you can have access to these books, the aforementioned cite should be in one of these two. Maybe the best way will be to check "Sixty Years of Arkham House", by S.T. Joshi, which reprints August Derleth’s essay on the first thirty years of Arkham House. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0870541765</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesDexterWard_2ccf.html" title="User:CharlesDexterWard">Charles Dexter Ward</a> 01:58, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Update</b>. I added your citation to the Reference section. Thank you! Since Arkham House is an established publisher, I think its web site (especially since it talks about itself) is virtually irrefutable. Moreover, it <i>cites references</i> about itself, so don't think we have to worry too much about reliability in this case. (And since you listed those citations in your comments, that should cover the bases quite nicely in case someone wants to go look it up.)<br />
<br />
<b>BTW</b>, You may wonder why I moved your quote to the Notes section. My rationale is that <i>trivial</i> information (let me be careful here!--when I say <i>trivial</i>, I do not mean <i>unimportant</i>; I simply mean information that would be of little interest to the <i>casual</i> reader) belongs there so that it does not impede the natural flow of the article. In the interest of <i>getting to the point</i>, I think (IMHO) that it is important to strip away as much of the <i>minor</i> details as possible and get to the main points. The <i>average</i> reader, with only a passing interest in the subject, probably has never heard of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_Derleth_58b2.html" title="August Derleth">August Derleth</a> anyway, so his comments would carry little weight (on the other hand, he is mentioned in the introduction!). However, to a Lovecraft fan, these <i>trivial</i> pieces of information are like gold nuggests (or easter eggs?); hence, their inclusion in a separate notes section is a good place for this sort of stuff.<br />
<br />
<b>Also</b>, some of my comments about the net may have sounded somewhat <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gruff" class="extiw" title="wikt:gruff">gruff</a>. I don't want to completely exclude the internet as a source of information; in fact, Wikipedia does allow—and even recognize—web sites to be reliable sources, provided of course their information is credible.<br />

<ul>
<li>Don't worry about being bold, it is the only way to progress efficiently, IMHO. When some text is first inserted, as it was the case, it may seem that the best place to put it is in the meat of the article, due to it being an important part of information <i>in that context</i>. When someone comes and reads the new content, the context he perceives is different, and probably more accurate. So any changes made with good intentions and reasons are usually welcome. I agree with you and think the article is now more readable. Keep up the good work. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesDexterWard_2ccf.html" title="User:CharlesDexterWard">Charles Dexter Ward</a> 14:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
