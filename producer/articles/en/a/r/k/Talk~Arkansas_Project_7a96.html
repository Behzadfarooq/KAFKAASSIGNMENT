<p>While the malevolent intentions and existence of the "Arkansas Project" are proven and established, they are still a tough pill to swallow for a lot of Clinton-haters (and there are many). Granted that, the langugage in this article (unrestrained use of the word "attack") compromises the integrity of the information presented.

<dd>Excuse me for asking what might seem like an impertenent question, but if the use of the word "attack" is accurate in describing the Arkansas Project, how is that NPOV? Just because the facts happen to match one side of an argument does not mean that the facts are NPOV... it just means the other side of the argument is out of step with the facts.

<p>If there was an actual "Arkansas Project" there should be better evidence than a Washignton Post article based on anonymous sources like, <i>"well-placed sources have told The Post that..."</i> and <i>"[s]everal sources at the Spectator, all of whom asked for anonymity, said..."</i> Even the silly title sounds like a government operation.

<p>In Washington it is not uncommon for the power structure to give the appearance of "adversarial" and "deeply divided" government, usually during election cycles. While at the same time the "opponents" are always in 100% agreement on important issues like invading Iraq or Sen. John Ashcroft-R losing his re-election to a dead man. When the Senate held confirmaton hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, all of his supporters and opponents refrained from mentioning the Official Report on the investigation of Vincent Foster's death that Kavanaugh conducted. The anonymous sourced "Arkansas Project" is approved for discussion but other topics are like a big stinking fish in the living room of a Washington cocktail party.

<p>It is wrong to disparage people using anonymous sources and David Brock.

<blockquote>
<p>The first public indication of a falling-out between Scaife and the Spectator followed the 1997 publication of "The Strange Death of Vincent Foster: An Investigation." This book, by <b>Christopher Ruddy</b>, a <b>reporter Scaife</b> had hired to write for his Pennsylvania newspaper, <b>sought to poke holes in the official investigations of Foster's death</b>. The <b>Spectator's review of the book, by John Corry, a former New York Times reporter, described Ruddy as "a very heavy breather" whose book contained "very few direct quotes, but a great many insinuations</b>." Soon after Corry's review was published in late November 1997, Reed Irvine of Accuracy in Media – a conservative critic who has received about $2 million from Scaife since 1977 – reported in his newsletter that <b>Scaife had called Tyrrell to say he was cutting him off</b>.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifeside050299.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifeside050299.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

It is incorrect to call the Washington Post owned <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_%28magazine%29.html" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate (magazine)</a> a conservative publication. The Slate Wikipedia article states, <i>"Slate's focus and editorial slant is politically liberal, as seen in choice of columnists, choice of and position on topics, and featured cartoon: Doonesbury. During the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign, a significant majority of staff and contributors supported Democratic challenger John Kerry."</i> Therefore both liberals and conservatives have called David Brock "a liar." Brock is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</p>
<p>You have failed to produce a single <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that Ruddy was specifically involved in the "Arkansas Project" conspiracy. Lots of people worked for Mr. Scaife and the Pittsburgh Tribune published many articles critical of President Clinton but that does not mean everyone at the newspaper was in on the "Arkansas Project" conspiracy. You have not proven that Ruddy was on the boat with Mr. Larry and Emmett Tyrrell. David Brock's, biased Media Matters is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Brock is a self-discredited source and well-known for not telling the truth. I don't think everyone would agree that Anita Hill was "a bit nutty and a bit slutty," just because David Brock famously wrote that in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_Spectator_feae.html" title="The American Spectator">The American Spectator</a>.</p>
<p>Better sources than David Brock are required to make disparaging comments about living persons like Anita Hill and Christopher Ruddy. This article needs to be cleaned up and references to David Brock should be removed. Thomist 22:20, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

He claims it is not a "conspiracy theory," but refers to the Arkansas Project as an "unproven conspiracy theory" about Scaife. According to CNN, "If it's a conspiracy, it's a pretty open one.

<p>Dear C56C:</p>
<p>You are just plain wrong to suggest I am a defender of "Christopher Ruddy's work as fact." There are a number of serious errors in his reporting and I know what they are better than you. I am more a critic than a supporter of Mr. Ruddy's reporting on Vincent Foster. At the same time, Mr. Ruddy did not get everything wrong and much of what he reported is supported by the official record. We agree that he was employed by Mr. Scaife who owned the Pittsburgh Tribune Review. But it is a huge leap to claim that just by being employed by Mr. Scaife, Mr. Ruddy was automatically involved in your conspiracy theory. Even the Washington Post's anonymous sources and the questionable David Brock do not say that Ruddy was part of the alleged "Arkansas Project."</p>
<p>Lots of people worked for Mr. Scaife and many people still do. How do you know which people were involved in this conspiracy? Is the Arkansas Project still ongoing? If not, when did it end? You have not provided a single <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> to show Mr. Ruddy was part of the "Arkansas Project" Conspiracy Theory.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As the sources demonstrate above, a critique of Ruddy's conspiracy book caused the end of funding to the Spectator</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Scaife</b> ended his support for the magazine last year after it ran a scathing review of a book by journalist <b>Christopher Ruddy</b>, a Scaife favorite who has worked for the Pittsburgh newspaper owned by the billionaire. Ruddy has written conspiracy-laden articles suggesting White House aide <b>Vincent W. Foster</b> and Commerce Secretary <b>Ron Brown</b> were murdered.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife092998.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife092998.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, you have unjustly linked anyone who received funds from Mr. Scaife to this "Arkansas Project" article, including Reed Irvine and anyone else that you choose without providing any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> other than people had some association with Mr. Scaife.

<p>Dear C56C:</p>
<p>Please stick to the facts. Name calling and personal attacks are impolite. Insinuations are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> evidence.</p>
<p>You have failed to provide a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that shows Joseph Farah, Reed Irvine, Christopher Ruddy, James Dale Davidson and others were part of this "Arkansas Project" Conspiracy Theory. You have implied people were guilty of a conspiracy because they either worked for Mr. Scaife or for organizations that received some funding. Many people worked for Mr. Scaife and many organizations were funded by Mr. Scaife. What evidence is there that people indirectly associated with Scaife were all part of the Arkansas Project conspiracy? That people and organizations were linked to Mr. Scaife <b>is not</b> the issue here. This article lacks <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> evidence that Mr. Ruddy, Mr. Davidson, Mr. Irvine, Mr. Farah, and others were all part of the "Arkansas Project" Conspiracy Theory.</p>
<p>Provide some official record, document, or cancelled check for the "Arkansas Project," any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, besides innuendo, anonymous sources, and David Brock.</p>
<p>Please understand that it is unkind to vilify people with insinuations. Thomist 02:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All that material is sourced. Your POV campaign ends at this article. As for your claim this is a conspiracy theory, according to CNN, "If it's a conspiracy, it's a pretty open one. Scaife's tax-exempt foundations disclose their grants on the Web. Among them: $2.4 million over several years to American Spectator to pay for anti-Clinton reporting, even a private eye to dig up dirt. And millions more went to other anti-Clinton groups."<a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/27/scaife.profile/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/27/scaife.profile/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="../../../c/5/6/User%7EC56C_d20d.html" title="User:C56C">C56C</a> 02:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The NY Times article of April 15, 1998 and the CNN article of April 1998 both state that the <i>American Spectator</i> had an "Arkansas Project" and that Richard Scaife gave the <i>Spectator</i> a couple of million dollars. These articles limit the project to the <i>Spectator</i> and they do not claim that Ruddy, Irvine, Davidson, Farah or others were part of the "Arkansas Project."</p>
<p>Wikipedia standards for articles about living persons demand more evidence than the insinuation that all people opposed to President Clinton that also had any association with Richard Scaife were therefore part of the "Arkansas Project" conspiracy.</p>
<p>Without some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> evidence that everyone associated with Mr. Scaife was part of the "Arkansas Project" the article needs to be changed. David Brock claimed the puppet master Scaife was so powerful he influenced Jay Leno's monologues and <i>Saturday Night Live</i> skits. David Brock is not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> evidence that everyone from Reed Irvine to Jay Leno was part of Richard Scaife's vast right wing conspiracy. Thomist 12:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are denying something that isn't in there. The article doesn't claim Ruddy was part of it.

<dl>
<dd>As you noted above Ruddy was not directly part of the Arkansas Project, but he was paid by Scaife to "investigate" the Clintons.

This statement is false, "It [the vast right-wing conspiracy article] does not say that." Please read the entire article, all of it, to the bottom.</p>
<p>At least we agree that Ruddy was not part of the Arkansas Project. No <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> has shown Ruddy was part of a Arkansas Project conspiracy.

Dear C56C:</p>
<p>Please answer my questions. How are the two conspiracies different? Was Irvine involved in one or both? Thomist 22:02, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You took my words out of context. Read the sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first public indication of a falling-out between Scaife and the Spectator followed the 1997 publication of "The Strange Death of Vincent Foster: An Investigation." This book, by <b>Christopher Ruddy</b>, a <b>reporter Scaife</b> had hired to write for his Pennsylvania newspaper, <b>sought to poke holes in the official investigations of Foster's death</b>. The <b>Spectator's review of the book, by John Corry, a former New York Times reporter, described Ruddy as "a very heavy breather" whose book contained "very few direct quotes, but a great many insinuations</b>." Soon after Corry's review was published in late November 1997, Reed Irvine of Accuracy in Media – a conservative critic who has received about $2 million from Scaife since 1977 – reported in his newsletter that <b>Scaife had called Tyrrell to say he was cutting him off</b>.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifeside050299.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifeside050299.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>

<p>But NONE of those articles actually state that Ruddy was part of the Arkansas project. One states that Ruddy was working for Scaife BEFORE the Arkansas Project, which begs the question, at what point did Ruddy join the Arkansas Project?
