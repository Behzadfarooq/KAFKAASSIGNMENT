<p>The <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village.html" title="Village">village</a> of <b>Arkona, Ontario</b> is located near the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambton_County%2C_Ontario_a2ff.html" title="Lambton County, Ontario">Lambton</a>-<a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesex_County%2C_Ontario_4975.html" title="Middlesex County, Ontario">Middlesex</a> county line, along Former Kings Highway 79 (Now Lambton CR 79). The town is located near the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Ausable_River_9917.html" title="Ausable River">Ausable River</a> in the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambton_Shores%2C_Ontario_e040.html" title="Lambton Shores, Ontario">Lambton Shores, Ontario</a>, roughly half-way between <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thedford%2C_Ontario_c995.html" title="Thedford, Ontario">Thedford, Ontario</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watford%2C_Ontario_c4bd.html" title="Watford, Ontario">Watford, Ontario</a>. The site of the village is at the base of the Wyoming Moraine which formed along the shores of ancient Lake Arkona during the retreat of the <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin_Glacier_e9e1.html" title="Wisconsin Glacier">Wisconsin Glacier</a> some 16, 000 years ago. Rich deposits of fossils were revealed following a major earthquake some ten thousand years ago when a huge gorge at nearby Hungry Hollow formed. Human habitation dates back even before this tectonic realignment, for evidence of Paleo hunting camps has been found just a kilometre south of Arkona dating back some 11, 000 years. Subsequent migrations of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaic.html" title="Archaic">Archaic</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodland.html" title="Woodland">Woodland</a> peoples moved into the area as the climate and vegetation changed. Evidence of this long-standing habitation is frequently discovered in the fields surrounding the current village. The first known permanent settler of European background was Asa Townsend and his wife (whose name is not now known) who settled on the banks of the Ausable River to the east of present-day Arkona in 1821. <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asa_Townsend_28c5.html" title="Asa Townsend">Asa Townsend</a> and his son were still in the vicinty as late as 1851. In 1833 the Townsends were joined by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_%28Smith%29_Utter_7ed8.html" title="Harriet (Smith) Utter">Harriet (Smith) Utter</a> and her husband, Henry, who settled on a farm in the recently surveyed Warwick Township, across the township line from Bosanquet. The Utters were subsequently joined by members of the Smith and Eastman families and a settlement gradually grew up that straddled the Warwick-Bosanquet Township line. The village was surveyed in 1851 and known variously as Bosanquet Corners, Eastman Corners and Smithfield. In 1857 it was rennamed '<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkona.html" title="Arkona">Arkona</a>' after the rugged cape on the Baltic Island of <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugen.html" title="Rugen">Rugen</a>, a named suggested by resident cabinet maker Ephraim Brower and possibly by the incumbent postmaster Levi Schooley. The village continued to grow and develop so that by the 1870s, with hopes of attracting a railway, the community incorporated in June 1876. While its population surpassed 700 the failure to attract a railway led to a population decline and the loss of its first known newspaper the <i>East Lambton Advocate</i> which moved to the nearby railway village of Watford. (Hopes of securing a rail link continued to surface at least as late as 1911 when one resident wrote, "They are talking of a railroad for Arkona [which] they think is sure to come but [we] will see when it gets here."). Even without the railway, however, Arkona remained an important service centre for the surrounding rural farming district and boasted many important industries such as a basket factory, woolen mill, apple evaporater, and a series of mills. Various businesses continued to service the local area including numerous stores and other enterprises. The advent of the automobile lessened local dependence on the village and its services, and led to gradual yet dramatic changes to Arkona's makeup, especially in the post-World War II era. Its school closed in 1973 and all village students then attended Bosanquet Township Central School. Since the 1880s the village has maintained a population hovering around 500. Two mainstays are Arkona's Bapitst Church (begun in 1840) and Arkona United Church, the successor to Arkona's Episcopal and Wesleyan Methodist Churches, both of which began in the 1850s (the Wesleyan <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Church_51da.html" title="Methodist Church">Methodist Church</a> building, started in 1862, is still the home of the United Church congregation). Similarly the community is served by the Plymouth Brethern chapel, Elim Hall. Despite the changes and loss of many local enterprises, the community still boasts a dental office, optometrists, a medical clinic, a grocery store, gas station, and several retail outlets. Various fruit orchards continue to attract many to the community for fresh fruit. Rock Glen Falls and Conservation Area, located just north of the village, continues to attract tourists to the area, and was the site of the Rock Glen Power Company's generator and dam on the Ausable from 1907 to 1926 when it was taken over by Ontario Hydro and the dam was subsequently destroyed. Villagers celebrated the centennial of their community's incorporation in July 1976, with some two thousand people in attendance. A smaller celebration marked the 125 anniversary in 2001, although earlier that year the municipality had been amalgamated with Bosanquet Township (including the communities of <a href="../../../i/p/p/Ipperwash.html" title="Ipperwash">Ipperwash</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Franks%2C_Ontario_d89b.html" title="Port Franks, Ontario">Port Franks, Ontario</a>), the Town of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest.html" title="Forest">Forest</a> and Villages of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thedford.html" title="Thedford">Thedford</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Bend_7a70.html" title="Grand Bend">Grand Bend</a> to form the new entity of Lambton Shores.
