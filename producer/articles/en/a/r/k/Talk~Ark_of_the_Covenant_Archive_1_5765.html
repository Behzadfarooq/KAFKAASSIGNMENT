<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>Why are writings from the Quran are included? The Ark is Jewish! Islam has nothing to do with it. I'll keep deleting it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So was Jesus old boy, but if you deleted him I'm sure a couple of christians might get a bit miffed, or if you have issues because it is Jewish should we therefore not delete the references about the bible as well? In all seriousness, the ownership of the Ark isn't in question, but this section shows that it was referenced in other religeous texts. Please don't forget this article also mentions it was in Indiana Jones and in a computer game, and I for one believe the Quran references are far more valid. Please give a valid reason for removing this part of the article or people like myself will keep putting it back, discourse is by far an away the best option, and removes the need for this continual petty reverting.

<p>That's because the Ark is a Jewish symbol. If so, maybe I need to include things against Muhammad at his page? Truth is truth. I have to say that putting Islam where it has nothing to do with the subject is a politization of this site. The same will be said if I'll write revisionist interpretation of the Quran, however, that would not be accepted. Any way, the Quran is not clear on this subject. And if you want to appease Muslims that's not the way. And if you are a Muslim - remove it if you have any sensitivity to other's national symbols. Because Islam has nothing to do with the Ark. And about Indiana Jones - I won't bother answering this claim. You know very well what's the difference between the two.</p>
<p>P.S. The Ark is mentioned far more than twice in the books of Prophets. It is mentioned at Samuel, Kings I, Kings II and much more places. Who is the one who wrote it? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 192.115.29.209 (<a href="../../../1/9/2/User_talk%7E192.115.29.209.html" title="User talk:192.115.29.209">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.115.29.209_d688.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.115.29.209">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Truth is truth indeed. And the truth is that whether you like it or not, the Ark is relevant to Islam. It doesn't matter whether or not the Quran is correct regarding the Ark. It's not about "appeasing" anyone. --RLent 20:48, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't get it. If the Ark is mentioned in the Quran, why can this fact not be mentioned on Wikipedia? It was validly sourced to the verse in the Quran where it is mentioned, and I think it should be restored to the article, along with the note that some Muslims, notwithstanding the Quran quote, do not recognise it. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Using inflammatory terms like appeasement, and asking about someone's religious beliefs will not further your argument with me. I will ask you one question, is the Ark mentioned or recognised in the Qur'an? It's in the article now, and will remain there until this is discussed and we have consensus, one way or the other.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old discussions</span></h2>
<p>Somewhere I heard that four Rabbis from Jerusalem made a trip to Ethiopia, recoevered the ark, took it on a plane back to Jerusalem while standing up and still carrying it, and that it resides there now. I'm not sure WHERE I heard this however. Maybe a history channel special.</p>
<hr />
<p>&gt; In recent years Western historians were allowed to view the Ark, and they learned that it did not match at all any previous description of the Biblical ark. It is now generally acknowledged...</p>
<p>Graham Hancock explains the problem with this "fact". I have zero expertise on the topic, but some people seem to adopt the "syllogism": "Some of what Hancock writes is crackpottery, therefor all of it is." Many of Hancock's suggestions (e.g. that Falasha-Israel split predates the Captivity) seem very well-founded. -- James <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesdowallen_78a3.html" title="User:Jamesdowallen">User:jamesdowallen</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Hmmm... this entire article bugs me because of its tone. The sentence "When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar and destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found. The absence of the ark from the second temple was one of the points in which it was inferior to the first temple." seems very biased. Does someone who feels they can tackle this topic clean it up re <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>? I feel a bit out of my depth here. -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManning_Bartlett_95ec.html" title="User:Manning Bartlett">ManningBartlett</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Yeah, but what do we expect from a 19th-century Bible dictionary? The original article author keyed in tremendous volumes of information from that book, which doesn't seem like an entirely bad thing to have done (I commend him on his labor). Us WikiPedians just need to go over the stuff and reproject it through a lens of (attempted) objectivity. As a lifelong atheist, I personally would find it extremely valuable to have a non-religious resource for many of the names/places/dates and folklore of the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. --Branden</p>

<p>I've looked for a bit of time now and can't find a single instance of the "c" in <i>Ark of the covenant</i> lowercased. It may be my Christian upbringing but I always thought of the covenant of God to be <i>the</i> Covenant. Unless somebody loudly protests, I will change the order of things and place this article at <a href="../../../a/r/k/Ark_of_the_Covenant_ce22.html" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>. This is probably a good example of an exception to the capitalization rule (covenant <i>is</i> a common word, but used in this context it has a <i>very</i> specific meaning that shouldn't be confused with any old covenant). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"different account"</span></h2>
<p>I take issue with the sentence "In Deut. x. 1-5 a different account of the making of the Ark is given." The statement in this passage that Moses made the ark could be interpreted to mean that Moses directed its construction, but the wording of this entry implies that there is an objective contradiction among these two accounts.</p>
<p><a name="Are_capacitor_speculations_common.3F" id="Are_capacitor_speculations_common.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Are capacitor speculations common?</span></h2>
<p>Appears that a very slow edit war has waged at times as some have taken exception to the statement that speculations that the ark acted as a capacitor are common among engineers. My initial feeling was to want to ask, "Wait, your wording suggests that a lot of electrical engineers spend time speculating about this; I seriously doubt most of them care." Apparently others have taken the wording that way as well, as the wording has been changed back and forth.</p>
<p>However, the question was answered in the comment to an edit by <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimon_avaro_23aa.html" title="User:Cimon avaro">User:Cimon avaro</a> on 15:33, 17 Sep 2003 "The speculations are far from rare. Several of my teachers have mentioned them, and I have seen them in numerous books and magazines. And despite that, I think its crock." Apparently these kinds of speculations are in fact common in the field. So I guess the wording should stand.</p>
<p>I'm just putting this in here to document the discussion for when it comes up again; hopefully people will look to the talk page first. Reddi seems to be doing a good job of keeping this accurate.</p>

<dd>Can we get a diagram of the ark showing why someone might think it is a capacitor or has some sort of electrical purpose? - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 13:49, Jun 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a note about my edit, and - I believe - a clarification of Cimon avaro's statement. Yes it is not uncommon for persons studying physics or electrical engineering to do this as a somewhat "different" example calculation. The results of that calculation, however, are to dismiss the idea outright. If the Ark was constructed as described, its capacitance is not much different to any other metal-clad box of similar dimensions, which is to say tiny. Ask yourself if you've ever heard of someone being spontaneously electrocuted by carrying a metal box around in dry weather. There are numerous other problems with this section, but given that this isn't an article about electrical engineering, that will do for now. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 16:15, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I recall is was covered in badger skins and not in silk. My memory could be failing me though, but it certainly wasn't being rubbed by silk. I also seem to remember it being under several layers of cloth. At anyrate, the poles that were used to carry it were gold plated to I think, so the priests would have been touching them, and they were touching the gold plated Ark.....</dd>

<p>In the Babylonians section of this article it states that western historians were allowed to view the ark at St. Mary of Zion in Axum Ethiopia. To my understanding, any one who attempts to view the ark, except the guardian, will more than likly be shot on sight. It is heavily guarded at all times. If anyone has any proof of western historians being allowed to view the ark I would love to see it.</p>

<p>As I often find in articles imported from other sources such as the 1911 Encyclopedia, there are significant problems with this article. Although it's difficult to find factual errors, the language, is both archaic, and representative of how a Christian theologian would write. The translations of the verses are also the same. As a Jew, it would be glaringly obvious that these were quotes from a Christian source rather a Jewish source. <a href="../../../e/z/r/User%7EEzra_Wax_0323.html" title="User:Ezra Wax">Ezra Wax</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ark Drawing</span></h2>
<p>The drawing of the ark is factually incorrect. The poles were on the short side, and the drawing is not really to scale. The cherubim had their wings forming a canopy that had a space of ten tefachim (about 40 inches) under it. Also, Jewish drawings generally refrain from adding details that are not explicitly mentioned in the sources, so the nice stepped border on the box wouldn't be there. <a href="../../../e/z/r/User%7EEzra_Wax_0323.html" title="User:Ezra Wax">Ezra Wax</a></p>

<p>To my way of thinking, this whole article needs to be rewritten and considerably shortened. Many things are stated as fact when clearly they are fiction. The whole section on capacitors looks like twaddle of a high order.

<dd>This isn't "pseudoscience". It's an engineering topic. I've tried to keep this article NPOV (balance and non-partisan) and accurate (eg., verifiable).

<dd>I also care about the principle that Wikipedia does not include original research. If this is your big idea, it doesn't belong here, no matter how many references you have. Let somebody else put it in, if it is really significant.

<p>This isn't my big idea; it facts. The full vetting does belong here. <b>If wikipedia ignores reputable references, then the goal of wikipedia is in peril</b>; also, <i>citing fringe sources and ignoring mainstream sources is not a NPOV</i>. The above information is significant. I am not the only person who wants to put it in (see the above comments; also early edits kept the information in). I will readd the referenced material at a later time, though. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 18:23, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Exodus 25:11–15 says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems gold-plated poles inserted through gold rings which touch the gold plating would conduct a charge quite well, am I right? How did Tesla and his devotees explain the surprising lack of electrocuted ark-carriers? —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 16:33, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The pole are "overlain" with gold. This <i>decorative</i> covering may have had places to hold on to it without this danger, but that is a guess on my part.</dd>
<dd>The easier and simpliest explianation would be that the holders were not grounded out. There were many rules and regulations to handling the Ark and in the ark-bearers dress. Much like a bird on a wire, the ark-carriers were insulated from the dangers (ex., the sandels sole may have insulated them from the ground; or, the clothes themselves insulated them). People that didn't follow the prescribed dress and customs were "struck down" (one of isrealities didn't follow the rules (I would suppose he was ground out) when the Ark was "charged" and was subsequently killed ("<i>struck down</i>"); I'll come back with the exact passages of this). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 18:23, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it didn't make any sense to me. I don't know why the writer singled out the NIV; it reads basically exactly the same as the KJV and the NASB. Sounds like there's some minority opinion that that verse ambiguously means that God wrote the second tablets as well as the first, but I was taught in Sunday School (and verse 27 agrees with) the idea that Moses wrote the second tablets, rather than God. Perhaps the common Jewish understanding is that God wrote the second tablets as well and its a difference of differing Christian and Jewish interpretations of verse 28, but that has nothing to do with the NIV. (It amazes me how people commonly want to say that the idea they disagree with, like leaving out the Apocrypha, or Isaiah 7:14 meaning a virgin birth, or whatever, originated with some particular English translation like the KJV or the NIV, when usually the idea, though possibly wrong, predated the English translation by centuries and the complainant is really just revealing that they don't know much about the English translation they are speaking of.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>actually, the Hebrew word for virgin is betula, while the sentence says alma. maybe I got the names of the books wrong, because these English names are very confusing, but the other 2 possibilities were either in Aramaic, and for what I could understand irrelevant, or in Hebrew and irrelevant. what is apocrypha? as to who wrote the second tablets, I always learned in my Jewish school that it was Moshe ("moses"). the entries about the bible and new testament should be separated. imagine if I wrote a book and insisted it gets included with the quran, is anybody going to take it seriously? so why can Christians write books and make it the convention that those are part of the bible? it doesn't make sense, and is scientifically wrong. 18:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, after study I am now almost sure it was a Radioactive source inside the structure. If one searches Google one will find some interesting articles. And yes, indeed the 'Glowing' faces of the Saints were , imo, caused by the Radioactive isotope within this structure. Of course I can not prove it, just as all the content, speculations, etc. of this whole big article can be not be proven ... .&#160;:D Marminnetje {03:40, 3 November 2005 (UTC)}</p>

<dd>Broken, even with Wayback. However, I've seen the show. It did describe the Ark as a capacitor. Speculatively, of course, and mentioning no sources. Tesla may or may not have been mentioned, but I strongly doubt the idea was original. I enjoyed the programme, but that's a long way from wanting to see it recapped in an encyclopedia article.</dd>
<dd>Says, and I quote, "1445BC The description of the “Ark of the Covenant” in Exodus 25:10-22, reads like an electrical device, Nikola Tesla mentions this in "A fairy tale of electricity", published September 9, 1915. Other biblical accounts imply effects from the Ark correspond with exposure to high power electromagnetic fields, and the 1981 film ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ popularise this artefact." In short, adds nothing to the Tesla source, and pulls in a rollicking action romp by George Lucas that has nothing to do with it.</dd>
<dd>Broken, but Wayback knows it: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041129084658/www.webcom.com/hermit/special/sass.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20041129084658/www.webcom.com/hermit/special/sass.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>Yup, that does talk about sparks killing snakes and scorpions and burning thorns. But it doesn't connect it to electricity, or any other theory on what the Ark supposedly was. Can Wikipedia make the connection? No. If it could, I could just as well follow it up with theories about how an Ark using electrical discharges would have been very impractical for killing vermin or burning wood, compared to, say, a torch, but all that is beside the point. You'd need a source that uses this particular text to claim the Ark was a capacitor, not just quote this sentence suggestively.</dd>

<p>These sources are all way overblown, and so is the text. You can confidently say that Tesla made the claim that the Ark was a capacitor, and Däniken had some funky ideas too. But honestly, that's it. All the rest is speculation. In particular, Wikipedia should not engage in Bible interpretation.</p>
<p>Wikipedia <i>cannot</i> gather bits and pieces from various sources to bolster the claim that the Ark was a capacitor. That's <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, even if Tesla or Däniken or whoever else had the idea before, and even if a television show elaborated it some more. There is an important difference between <i>citing</i> sources and <i>using</i> them.</p>
<p>I will grant you that the Tesla idea seems widespread enough (one way or another) to mention in passing. But the information as it "should be included" overdoes it severely, as all the rest is derivative or worse. 83.133.127.89 19:42, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>1st ... this isn't a "teslaian" idea ... it's an objective analysis of various people (historical and contempory) about the "Ark's operation" (be that electrical or non-electrical). There are also sources that are noteworthy (other than Tesla). All the citations rest on analysis of the text and the own individual's knowledge of the subject.</p>
<p>2nd Wikipedia <i>should</i> state the facts (eg. you "bits and pieces") from sources to express the '<i>known and common claim</i> that Ark _may have_ been electrical.</p>
<p>3rd it's not <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> when you state the other researchers (eg., Ginzberg, Tesla, Däniken, etc., ...) had the idea before. In fact, as you state, the television show elaborated it. The difference between <i><a href="../../../w/o/r/Works_cited.html" title="Works cited">citing</a></i> sources and <i>using</i> them ... is if there '<b>is "new" idea, and this is not the case'</b>.</p>
<p>4th The "picking apart" seem IMHO to be a poor and biased job ... the article <b>should provide an account of the controversy</b> and of the different authorities or sources (which the citations did). Such an account also helps ensure the article’s neutral point of view.</p>
<ul>
<li>THe TLC-Ark link is broken due TLC channel's reformating ... and the presentation was in a shockwave format (that's why the Wayback machine doens't have a copy). It did describe the Ark as a capacitor. Speculatively? It provided a easy graph on the concept ... and though it mentioned no sources itself, it can be a source. Tesla <i>was not</i> mentioned in the show (but an image of Tesla's Colorado Lab could be seen in the shockwave presentation; you'd have had to look closely during the opening @ the background and seen several of the old pictures of Tesla's experiments), and the idea is not "original" though. It is IRRELEVANT, though, if you enjoyed the programme inreguards to the idea being recapped in an encyclopedia article. As the idea should be in an encyclopedia of the Ark ... as it deals directly with the subject!</li>
<li>Burger citation adds _another_ '<i>qualified electrical engineer's</i> analysis to that of others.</li>
<li>Sassoon citation states that it may have a <b>been a machine</b> (which was called "the Ark" in the bible, but may not or may have been the exact one decribed) that produced manna (as in the <i>"magical" sense</i> (note that at the turn of the 19th century electricity was still seen as "magical")). AND ... add another consideration of a subject (... ie., it is _one more analysis as to the operation_, irrespective of that operation ...).</li>
<li>Usenet post citation .... this states that is a _known subject_ and a "common" question and <i>not "original" research</i> ...</li>
<li>The Ginzberg citations talks about the ark's construction ... and also "<b>talks about <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spark.html" title="Spark">sparks</a> killing snakes and scorpions and burning thorns". What do you mean that it "doesn't connect it to electricity"? What other kind of sparks are there?! "Spark" <i>usually</i> refers to a momentary electrostatic discharge across a spark gap ... can Wikipedia state that there were "sparks"?</b> Yes. As, not only is there alot of other sources that do, the holy scriptures do .... and you could follow it up with other theories (such as the ark was spitting out airborne embers from a normal fire ... BUT _without citations_, that's be original research) .... also that would be besides the point that the holy scriptures stated that was putting out sparks. There are other sources that uses this and other text for claiming the Ark was a electrical device (the whole "capacitor" thing is debateable (a simplistic formulation) ... it may have, more likely, been a <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavity_resonator.html" title="Cavity resonator">cavity resonator</a> (taking in account of the construction of the Ark)).</li>
<li>The Fairy Tale of Electricity is the a <i>distinctive</i> reference that is relevant and it establishes that Tesla made this analysis.</li>
<li>The Courson citation (which you conviently ignored) talks about the Ark as a electrical device and that the priests garments resemble anti-electrostatic uniforms.</li>
<li>Exodus28 Skeptic's Annotated Bible citation gives the text in the holy scripture of the Courson citation.</li>
<li>The Leviticus 10]:1 citation is that Aaron's sons are killed ... the "<i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma.html" title="Plasma">fire</a></i>" went out and devoured them and they died and Aaron held his peace.</li>
<li>Beaver citation (another site that you "conviently" ignore) is a scholastic researcher of ancient Templarism to enable dicerning the fantasy from fact. He is another that brings up the concept that the Ark was a electrical device.</li>

<dd>the correct logical way to go about something is to invent a theory, and then prove it. not to invent a theory, assume its correct and use it as proven scientific fact. when you can't prove a theory to be correct then it is meaningless. it carries no weight. therefore, since the previous facts have not been proven false, the assumption is they are correct, since at the time they were proven as true. if you want to prove them wrong you must disprove the evidence these facts are based on, which is the testimony of an entire nation who saw miracles that could not be natural, not even with todays technology. prove there testimony is false, that all those events that happened over a period of decades had in fact not taken place, and you disprove the bible. any thing less than that cannot change the bibles status as proven fact. these theories about the possibility of the arc being an electric device are based on the assumption the bible is false, therefore do not belong in an encyclopedia which dealse with fact. however, these theories are about electrical features the arc may have had and as such are worthy theories. theories that try to explain how things happened based on the assumption that proven fact is false, don't belong. 20:10, 17 January 2007</dd>

<ul>
<li>The Badillo citation talks about <i>an</i> analysis of the Ark ... but you misconstrue why it was included ... it was not about the ark being a electrical device .... only that the ark had been investigated (for stated bibilical or other purposes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia <i>should</i> state the facts from various sources to express the known claims that the Ark <b>may have</b> been a electrical device. Doing so is not <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, OTHERS have had the idea before aand investigated the possiblities, and even a television show elaborated on it. <b>This is what is called "source-based research," and is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.</b>. This is not "original Bible interpretation" ... it is a "sourced interpertation". 16:29, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Domain of legend</span></h2>
<p>--Gerard von Hebel 22:23, 5 November 2005 (UTC) I am not too happy with this sentence "When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the Ark entered the domain of legend". Since it can be argued that it has always been there. The Biblical references to the Ark are all made in contexts of which the historicity is doubtfull to say the least.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A critic might say that the refered abilities of the Ark might be exaggerated. However, simply because something might be said to be greater than it really is doesn't mean it didn't exist at all. The exaggeration only grows when the original object is missing. The same is true here. Regardless of whether the Ark posessed said powers or no, there's no reason to doubt it's existance, or the existance of the temple in which it resided, or the people who utilized the previously mentioned objects. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaceFalcon2001_2983.html" title="User:SpaceFalcon2001">SF2K1</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>and why is it doubtfull? because you assume that the bible is wrong. so the question is if the bible is true. you want it to be false therefore you assume it is false and everything else, including so-called "evidence" againsed it is based on that assumption.</dd>
