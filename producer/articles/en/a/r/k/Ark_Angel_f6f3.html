<p>The story begins at a security conference in London, where a lecturer named Max Webber is telling the audience about a group of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-terrorism.html" title="Eco-terrorism">eco-terrorists</a> called Force Three. He considers them to be the most dangerous pervertions in the world, and this draws the attention of <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a> heads Mrs. Jones and Alan Blunt, who are in the crowd. When he leaves, he receives a cell phone call, and it becomes apparent that he has been paid a large amount of money to give this lecture. The voice on the phone warns Webber to be careful, since he is now an enemy of Force Three. As Webber hangs up the phone, it explodes, instantly killing him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alex Rider is about to be released from St. Dominic's Hospital, still recovering from the bullet wound he suffered at the end of Scorpia, the previous book. The bullet, which was aimed at his heart, nearly killed him, but he stepped a fraction of an inch off the pavement, so the bullet hit an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artery.html" title="Artery">artery</a>, ricocheted off a rib, and exited through his left arm. Even so, he was in the hospital for eleven days. Mrs. Jones has informed him Scorpia is no longer a threat to him, and he is enthusiastic about finally going home. However, he cannot sleep that night, and goes to the reception area for a walk. He sees four members of Force Three walk in, who demand to see Paul Drevin, the boy in the room neighbouring Alex. The receptionist tells them his room number, and then Alex witnesses the leader murder the Irish night-watchman. Alex devises an elaborate plan to take out the terrorists (whom he has named Combat Jacket, Spectacles, Steel Watch, and Silver Tooth) knocking out Silver Tooth with a <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defibrillator.html" title="Defibrillator">defibrillator</a>, Spectacles with an <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen_cylinder.html" title="Oxygen cylinder">oxygen cylinder</a>, Combat Jacket with a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine_ball.html" title="Medicine ball">medicine ball</a>, and finally tricking Steel Watch into being magnetized toward an <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_resonance_imaging.html" title="Magnetic resonance imaging">MRI machine</a>. But before Alex can call the police, a fifth man, the driver, knocks Alex out. When Alex comes to, he is being held hostage by Force Three, who still think he is Paul. He meets Kaspar, the leader, whose shaved head is tattooed like a globe. Kaspar explains that Nikolei Drevin, Paul's eccentric billionaire father, is an enemy of Force Three. Drevin is funding the construction of the world's first space hotel, Ark Angel. In doing so, however, he has made four bird species extinct. Kaspar is about to cut off Alex's finger when Alex manages to convince Kaspar he is not Paul. However, Kaspar decides to kill Alex anyway, leaving him to die after setting fire to an apartment.</p>
<p>Alex manages to escape through a window, using tightrope walking techniques he learned from his uncle, Ian Rider. He debriefs MI6, then is released from the hospital. At home, Nikolei Drevin calls to express his gratitude towards Alex. He invites Alex to stay at his house. Drevin also mentions he will take Alex to watch a construction stage of Ark Angel being launched. Alex accepts. He gets to know Paul, who is apparently a disappointment in his father's eyes. Paul has <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> and doesn't get to meet other children due to his father. Alex had been told by MI6 that Drevin was a wonderful man, but he soon finds out otherwise.</p>
<p>Alex participates in a kart race with Drevin. He sees that Drevin is an extremely competitive man, as he puts Alex's life in danger several times during the race. Drevin is bitter after losing, but forgets the race soon after when he takes Alex to see a soccer match between the team Drevin owns, Stratford East, and Alex's favorite team, Chelsea. The match ends with a brutal missed <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penalty_kick.html" title="Penalty kick">penalty kick</a> by Adam Wright, Stratford's captain, and Chelsea winning 2-1. At the end of the match, Drevin is furious, and to Alex's horror, he notices Force Three in the crowd. Sensing something horrible, he rushes down to the locker room, where members of Force Three are presenting Wright with a medallion, claiming to be rewarding him for his work for the team. Before Alex can do anything, though, Steel Watch has a gun pointing at his neck, taking him to a van. Alex manages to escape by using the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finger_%28gesture%29.html" title="Finger (gesture)">middle finger</a> to convince a drunken Stratford fan to punch him. Alex ducks and the fist hits Steel Watch instead, allowing Alex to escape. But it is too late for Adam Wright, as the medallion he received was made of <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesium.html" title="Caesium">caesium</a>, which causes it to explode when Wright turns on the shower. Force Three claims responsibility for another murder. Alex goes with Drevin to an island near <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbados.html" title="Barbados">Barbados</a> called Flamingo Bay (which Drevin owns and has a house on) to watch the rocket launch.</p>
<p>However, when he passes through U.S. customs, Alex is shocked to discover his <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passport.html" title="Passport">passport</a> has expired, forcing him to stay at <a href="../../../j/f/k/JFK_International_Airport_8448.html" title="JFK International Airport">JFK International Airport</a> for the night. But when Drevin leaves, the passport officer, Ed Shulsky, instead takes Alex to a secret <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> base, where he is debriefed about the true Nikolei Drevin.</p>
<p>Joe Byrne, the deputy director of the CIA and whom Alex met three books previously, in <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeleton_Key_%28novel%29_8e64.html" title="Skeleton Key (novel)">Skeleton Key</a>, tells Alex that Drevin is considered to them to be the biggest criminal in the world. He got rich following the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakup_of_the_Soviet_Union_a102.html" title="Breakup of the Soviet Union">breakup of the Soviet Union</a> through buying oil and other assets. Drevin used his KGB background to take a loan of eighty million dollars from the Russian Mafia, who agreed, but did not have the money, so they turned to the Japanese <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakuza.html" title="Yakuza">yakuza</a> for help. The <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triads.html" title="Triads">triads</a> also got involved, and Drevin soon becomes rich after buying Novgerol, a major oil company. He payed off the mafiya, yakuza and triads, and murdered anyone who got in his way. Alex learns that Drevin's money is now behind almost every "dirty deal" done in Europe involving terrorism, drugs, prostitution, and so on. The CIA plans to arrest Drevin in one week, but they need Alex's help to make sure Drevin does not escape. He informs Alex that one agent is already inside Drevin's organization, and MI6's Smithers gives Alex an <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> which doubles as a radio, an <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inhaler.html" title="Inhaler">inhaler</a> doubling as a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenade</a>, and mosquito repellent which actually attracts mosquitos and most other insects. Smithers also states he has another exploding I-pod which he'd love to give Alex called an I-x-plod however <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Blunt_bb05.html" title="Alan Blunt">Alan Blunt</a> said no. Alex reluctantly agrees to go to Flamingo Bay, where he meets Drevin's head of security, Magnus Payne, who seems vaguely familiar.</p>
<p>However, Alex's cover is quickly blown when Magnus tells Drevin Alex is an MI6 agent. Drevin instructs Magnus to kill Alex. The next day, Drevin encourages Alex to go <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wreck_diving.html" title="Wreck diving">wreck diving</a>. He goes with a guard named Kolo, who locks Alex in an old ship and leaves him to die. Alex is about to die, running out of air, when suddenly Tamara Knight, who had pretended to be Drevin's travelling secretary, shows up with Alex's fake inhaler. Alex uses it to free himself from the ship, and he finds out Tamara is the undercover agent Joe Byrne mentioned. Alex uses the mosquito attractor to distract the guards, and he and Tamara try to alert Byrne's backup team on Barbados. However, Tamara accidentally hits a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trip_wire.html" title="Trip wire">trip wire</a>, and just as Alex sees Force Three being greeted by Magnus, the pair are caught by Drevin. Tamara is shot in the shoulder and placed in a jail, and Drevin takes Alex to a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hangar.html" title="Hangar">hangar</a>.</p>
<p>There, Drevin tells Alex everything. He tells him he knows of the CIA's investigation, and knows he cannot destroy it, as the investigation is based in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pentagon_612d.html" title="The Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>. He also mentions Ark Angel is millions of dollars over budget, and will likely never be finished, and is sucking his wealth dry. He tells Alex that he is placing a bomb on the observation module of Ark Angel, which, along with homing devices, will make the four-hundred-ton space station fall directly on the Pentagon, completely destroying any evidence against Drevin along with the entire city of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. Then he tells Alex of his most brilliant plan: Force Three. Alex realizes Force Three has been merely invented by Drevin to create an enemy. Drevin was going to stage a kidnapping of Paul, and use his finger to prove it wasn't him. Drevin will blame the destruction of Washington on Force Three, and will conclusively prove it by having the four fake terrorists attempt to ambush Flamingo Bay. He will show their bodies as proof of his innocence. When Silver Tooth asks how Drevin will fake it, Drevin replies "Who said I was going to fake it?" Magnus kills the four fake terrorists with an <a href="../../../u/z/i/Uzi.html" title="Uzi">uzi</a>, shortly before revealing his true identity: Kaspar. Drevin then says that Alex and Tamara's bodies will appear to have been hit in crossfire. He places Alex in the prison with Tamara.</p>
<p>Alex tells Tamara of Drevin's maniacally evil plan, and Tamara gives him shoelaces made of <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tungsten.html" title="Tungsten">tungsten</a> to break through the cell. Dressed in a guard's uniform, Alex makes his way down to the house, where he is shocked to see Paul. Paul was told that Alex was an enemy, but Alex cannot convince him that his father is evil, so he knocks him out with an elbow to the temple. Alex steals a <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_kite.html" title="Power kite">power kite</a> and attempts to fly to Barbados. Three speedboats pursue him, and Alex uses the power kite to knock out one of the men with a machine gun, consequently killing the driver. He uses the speedboat to crash into the other speedboat, and then Ed Shulsky blows up the third boat with a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoulder-launched_missile_weapon.html" title="Shoulder-launched missile weapon">rocket launcher</a>. But just as Alex is about to tell the CIA about Drevin's plan, the rocket is launched.</p>
<p>When he manages to tell Shulsky, the CIA agent tells Alex to stay put while the agents get past Drevin's men and free Tamara. Shulsky tells Alex all they need to do is find the rocket's self destruct button, and the mission will be accomplished. However, Alex disobeys orders and heads towards Drevin's house. Drevin finds him there, about to leave, holding a pistol. He attempts to shoot Alex, but Alex dives out of the way and Drevin instead hits Paul twice. This allows Alex to escape. Drevin, assuming Paul is dead, runs out of bullets and heads for his <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaplane.html" title="Seaplane">seaplane</a> to escape. The CIA agents arrive, back from an easy fight, and attend to Paul. Alex points out to them that he attached two canoes to the seaplane's floats. When Drevin attempts to kill Alex with the plane's machine guns, the canoes cause him to fly too low, and Drevin's plane crashes into the forest and explodes, killing him instantly. Alex thinks the mission is done, but Shulsky tells him that Drevin was the only one capable of pressing the self-destruct button, and the CIA needs Alex's help.</p>
<p>The only way to stop the bomb is to move it from its designated spot. If it is moved, Ark Angel will simply explode, without further consequence. After the launch, Drevin had planned to send an <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orangutan.html" title="Orangutan">orangutan</a> into space to test weightlessness effects on a human body. Alex is the only one able to fit into the ape's capsule, and so he is told he must go into space and move the bomb. Professor Joo-Chan Sing, Drevin's head of the Ark Angel project, is interrogated and swears he knows nothing, but Alex suspects he is still hiding something. But he helps Alex on the basics of space, and the effects that may happen. After a brief crash course, Alex is sent into space. He floats into the observation module, but is shocked to find Kaspar there as well, holding a steak knife from the space hotel's kitchen. Alex manages to disarm him, but Kaspar begins to strangle Alex. Desperate, Alex opens a window facing the Sun, which blinds Kaspar. As he puts his hands up to protect himself, Alex kicks him into the floating knife, which penetrates the back of his head and kills him. Alex then closes the window, places the bomb in the toilet, and goes back in the <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soyuz.html" title="Soyuz">Soyuz</a> module. Before leaving Ark Angel, he has a glimpse at Earth, realizing this is his only opportunity to ever do so. Ark Angel explodes just as Alex is returning to Earth. Alex lands off the coast of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>

<p>Critical reception for the book was mixed, with some critics hailing it as the greatest in the series, but others describing it as the most childish, due to the theme of space travel. Many fans complained that it was a step back for the series after the emotionally involving Scorpia.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
