<p>The <b>Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts</b> (ASMSA) is a two-year, public residential high school located in <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Springs%2C_Arkansas_3156.html" title="Hot Springs, Arkansas">Hot Springs</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. It is a part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Arkansas_116b.html" title="University of Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> administrative system, as well as being a member of the <a href="../../../n/c/s/NCSSSMST_3b49.html" title="NCSSSMST">NCSSSMST</a>. The school was originally known as <b>The Arkansas School for Mathematics and Sciences</b>, (abbreviated <b>ASMS</b>).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_School_for_Mathematics%2C_Sciences%2C_and_the_Arts_6ac9.html" title="Edit section: School Description">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">School Description</span></h2>
<p>Academically, the school is modeled on the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_School_of_Science_and_Mathematics_797b.html" title="North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics">North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics</a>. Studies focus on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanities.html" title="Humanities">humanities</a>, the largest department at the school. All courses are taught at the Honors level or above. ASMSA also offers a number of <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_Program_866e.html" title="Advanced Placement Program">AP</a>-level courses and courses that go beyond the AP level, especially in mathematics. Unlike other state-wide math and science high schools, it has an arts program, which was recently added by the state legislature. However, no real funding has been given to back this initiative, so the arts program at the moment is little more than a formality. As it recruits students from all of Arkansas, ASMSA can be described as a statewide <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet_school.html" title="Magnet school">magnet school</a>.</p>
<p>The school was founded in the early 1990s with backing from Governor <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. The charter class enrolled as juniors in 1993 and graduated in 1995.</p>
<p>Prospective students apply during the spring of their sophomore year. Applicants submit application forms, grade transcripts, <a href="../../../s/a/t/SAT_684e.html" title="SAT">SAT</a> or <a href="../../../a/c/t/ACT_%28examination%29_5ba9.html" title="ACT (examination)">ACT</a> results, and three letters of recommendation. Generally, students can only enter the school as a rising junior, although there have been cases where a student from another state magnet school transferred to ASMSA. Additionally, some students will repeat their junior year of high school at ASMSA because they didn't apply in time to be admitted with their regular class.</p>
<p>Students who attend ASMSA live in dormitories away from their homes, much like college students. The dormitories are not <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-ed.html" title="Co-ed">co-ed</a>, and there is no co-mingling outside of designated co-ed areas. The students are supervised by full-time Residential Mentors. The school itself is located in the former St. Joseph's Catholic Hospital in the historic district of Hot Springs, and it is surrounded on three sides by the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Springs_National_Park_208a.html" title="Hot Springs National Park">Hot Springs National Park</a>. The school's mascot is the dolphin.</p>
<p>Teachers have at least a master's degree in their field, though many have a Ph.D. Notable professors at the school include <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Don_Baker_3ba5.html" title="Dr. Don Baker">Dr. Don Baker</a>, who was a Foreign Service Officer of the United States Department of State. Mrs. Melanie Nichols, who has served on several AP committees and has given many speeches at seminars for math teachers, was a mathematics teacher at the school before becoming Dean of Academic Affairs in 2006. Also, former state senator Charlie Cole Chaffin was a chemistry teacher at the school.</p>
<p>Several former and current professors at the school also instruct during the summers at the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_Governor%27s_School_773d.html" title="Arkansas Governor's School">Arkansas Governor's School</a>.</p>

<p>ASMSA students have a number of projects and activities that fill their time . One of the school's trademarks is participation in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_Science_and_Engineering_Fair_4f87.html" title="Intel Science and Engineering Fair">Intel Science and Engineering Fair</a>. Every student selects a research topic at the start of their spring semester as a junior, and they will continue to research this project for the next fourteen months through a class titled Fundamentals in Research Methods. This project culminates in Science Fair week, generally in the last half of March. ASMSA competes as its own region in the state competition because of the quantity of projects it produces every year - often a hundred or more. Projects often culminate with substantial monetary awards, governmental recognition, and publication. Other academic endeavors include Culture Fair, where every foreign language and World Studies student produces a study of some cultural aspect of their chosen culture, and Dolphinstock, where the American Studies classes and many students perform acts, speeches, and music, all about something that happened during the 1960's and '70's.Students also take part in Element Day and Fall Math Project.</p>
