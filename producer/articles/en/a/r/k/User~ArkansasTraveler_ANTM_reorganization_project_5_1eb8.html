<p>Acclaimed by Tyra Banks as the "bling" season in which the winner will undergo a <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella.html" title="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>-like transformation, the fifth cycle of America's Next Top Model started in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, the same location in which Cycle Four commenced. The judging panel ensemble was altered - <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janice_Dickinson_1d2b.html" title="Janice Dickinson">Janice Dickinson</a> was replaced by one of the most recognizable models of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twiggy.html" title="Twiggy">Twiggy</a>.</p>
<p>In the first week, the thirteen finalists competed in a superhero-themed photoshoot in which each contestant was suspended in the air to take a 'fierce' photograph. Ashley Black was eliminated in this episode because, though her photograph was not among the weakest in the group, Tyra and the judging panel felt that she was not a model and was trying to get by as a pretty girl. The following episode was the infamous makeover show, in which Cassandra Whitehead, a beauty pageant competitor from <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> who was very attached to her long brown hair, was given the most dramatic makeover. Tyra had doubts about whether Cassandra was more dedicated to pageants or modeling, so she decided to test Cassandra's resolve by giving her a very short blond hairdo similar to <a href="../../../m/i/a/Mia_Farrow_6682.html" title="Mia Farrow">Mia Farrow</a>'s character in <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemary%27s_Baby_61d5.html" title="Rosemary's Baby">Rosemary's Baby</a>. Despite much consternation, Cassandra went through with the makeover and shone in the next shoot, in which each contestant partnered with another contestant of her choice, and the two were photographed separately in the same couture-inspired outfit. This week, Ebony Taylor, the youngest contestant of the bunch, was eliminated because of her poor performance in the shoot. In the next episode, the girls posed as fashion victims being chased by the fashion police. During the shoot, when Cassandra was told that her hair would have to be cut shorter, she refused this assignment and left the show, being the first contestant ever to eliminate herself from America's Next Top Model. In panel, the judges placed Kim Stolz, this season's only openly-gay contestant, and Sarah Rhoades, who had become close friends with Kim during the competition, in the bottom two. Sarah was eliminated due to a poor photo as well as lack of self-confidence. <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janice_Dickinson_1d2b.html" title="Janice Dickinson">Janice Dickinson</a>, a former panel judge, photographed the remaining contestants in the following plastic surgery-themed photo shoot. Each contestant was photographed as if they had undergone a surgical beauty enhancement procedure, such as a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botox.html" title="Botox">Botox</a> injection, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implants.html" title="Breast implants">breast implants</a>, or <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_reduction.html" title="Breast reduction">breast reduction</a>. The plus-sized model, Diane Hernandez, was eliminated due to her lack of confidence and awareness of her body.</p>
<p>The next episode's challenge was three-fold: each contestant had to complete a commercial shoot, photo shoot, and press interview, all advertising Secret deodorant, in thirty minutes total. Unbeknownst to the contestants during the shoot, the judges revealed at panel that the girl with the strongest photograph in this round would have her picture run as an actual advertisement for Secret deodorant in print media. Nicole Linkletter's photo was selected by the panel for this honor. Coryn Woitel was eliminated at this judging session because, despite her strong photograph, she could not overcome her melancholy demeanor. In episode seven, the remaining contestants shot advertisements for <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Fusion_b78e.html" title="Ford Fusion">Ford Fusion</a> dressed as Vargas "pin-up" girls. Kyle Kavanagh was eliminated in this round as the judges felt that she failed to be expressive in her face and use the potential she had to stand out in photo shoots. For the following week's episode, the final six contestants shot with some special guests - <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>'s <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Boyz_cd4b.html" title="Wild Boyz">Wild Boyz</a>. Though Nicole and Jayla failed to impress the judges with their photographs and were called forward as the bottom two, Tyra shocked the contestants by announcing that both girls would have to pack their bags - because everyone would be going to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. This was the first episode in Top Model history in which no contestant was eliminated.</p>
<p>Soon after the final six arrived in London, they competed in a risqué photo shoot in which all six girls at once posed in a <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> phone booth wearing only panties, galoshes and a newspaper, as if hiding from <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paparazzi.html" title="Paparazzi">paparazzi</a>. At judging, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_D%27Amato_0574.html" title="Lisa D'Amato">Lisa D'Amato</a>, arguably the contestant with the most outrageous personality, was eliminated despite taking a strong photograph. In the following episode, the five remaining contestants posed as modern interpretations of classical art in an advertisement for Quench body lotion by <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olay.html" title="Olay">Olay</a>. Kim Stolz, who posed as the Venus in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandro_Botticelli_612d.html" title="Sandro Botticelli">Botticelli</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Birth_of_Venus_75c6.html" title="The Birth of Venus">The Birth of Venus</a>, was subsequently eliminated due to a lack of consistency during the competition, though she displayed much progress in her modeling capabilities as the show progressed. In the next episode, the final four contestants - Jayla Rubinelli, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Linkletter_24d2.html" title="Nicole Linkletter">Nicole Linkletter</a>, Bre Scullark, and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nik_Pace_8d5c.html" title="Nik Pace">Nik Pace</a>, were photographed in a <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a>-inspired shoot, reflecting the <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> influence on British fashion in recent years. At panel, Jayla was eliminated because, though she had initially been among the strongest competitors, she had taken a series of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediocre.html" title="Mediocre">mediocre</a> photographs and had blended into the background of the last shoot.</p>
<p>In the season finale, Bre, Nik, and Nicole shot a <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covergirl.html" title="Covergirl">Covergirl</a> commercial and photoshoot. While Nik's strong performance was an improvement from her previous showing in the Secret shoot, both Bre and Nicole struggled. At elimination, Nik was chosen first to continue on in the final round, and then Nicole was chosen over Bre, making the latter girl the eleventh girl to get sent home. Nik and Nicole then shot a cover for <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elle_Girl_5c52.html" title="Elle Girl">Elle Girl</a> magazine with <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyra_Banks_3978.html" title="Tyra Banks">Tyra Banks</a> photographed by world-renowned <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilles_Bensimon_43c6.html" title="Gilles Bensimon">Gilles Bensimon</a>, under the stipulation that the winner's cover would be published in the February 2006 issue. They then competed in the final runway competition, walking in a show also starring previous Top Model winners <a href="../../../e/v/a/Eva_Pigford_6195.html" title="Eva Pigford">Eva Pigford</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/i/Naima_Mora_12c4.html" title="Naima Mora">Naima Mora</a>. Also present in the show were a medley of other Top Model contestants, both from Cycle 5 and from previous cycles, including Diane Hernandez, Coryn Woitel, Lisa D'Amato, Bre Scullark, Lluvy Gomez, and Brittany Brower. At the final elimination panel, the judges favored Nicole's final performance over Nik's, both in the final runway challenge and throughout the competitions, and subsequently Nicole was selected to be the fifth winner of America's Next Top Model.</p>
