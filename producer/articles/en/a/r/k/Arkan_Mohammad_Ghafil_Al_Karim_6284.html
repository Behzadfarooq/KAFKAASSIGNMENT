<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>The allegations against Al Karim in the "Summary of Evidence" presented to his Tribunal were:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>The detainee traveled to Kabul sometime in later 2001.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee was identified as an Iraqi national affiliated with <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaida_b47f.html" title="Al Qaida">al Qaida</a>.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee resided at a guesthouse near <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, frequented by people training at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.</i></li>
<li><i><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Farouq_49ca.html" title="Al Farouq">Al Farouq</a> is best known as a basic training facility for <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihadist.html" title="Jihadist">jihadists</a>. Training at this facility was conducted in four phases: small arms firing; physical conditioning, map reading, topography, and explosive devices.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee received military training in the Iraqi army.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee trained with the following weapons: <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK 47</a> rifle, 7.62 mm PK machine gun and mortars - 82mm, 120mm, and 160mm.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee acknowledges that in 1999 he fought on the front lines against the <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghan_Northern_Alliance_c51d.html" title="Afghan Northern Alliance">Northern Alliance</a> with the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> near Mir Bachel Kawt.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee was imprisoned by Northern Alliance and subsequently transferred to United States authority.</i></li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkan_Mohammad_Ghafil_Al_Karim_6284.html" title="Edit section: testimony">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">testimony</span></h3>
<p>Al Karim said he deserted from the Iraqi Army in 1994. He had fled first to <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a> for a year, and then moved to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, where he had to work without official papers. He had worked in a shoe factory. But had left that area when the factory was raided by Iranian immigration officials. He had fled to a city that was near the Afghan border. When immigration officials captured him and a group of Afghan refugees he felt it was safer to represent himself as another Afghan, rather than as an Iraqi. Thus he was deported to Afghanistan in 1999.</p>
<p>Al Karim said he was arrested by Arabs associated with the Taliban on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, because they believed he was an American spy. He said that he was denounced by an associate named <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahim_Jenko_dc61.html" title="Abdul Rahim Jenko">Abdul Rahim Jenko</a> who owed him money for a loan to buy shoes. Al Karim was in a Taliban prison from <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> until the prison was taken over by coalition forces, and he was transferred to US custody. Al Karim said that Jenko, too, had been transferred to American custody when the Taliban prison was captured, and had also been transferred to Guantanamo.</p>

<p>Al Karin called two witnesses: <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Zahir_fcaa.html" title="Abdul Zahir">Abdul Zahir</a> and Janko. Both witnesses testified that they had known Al Karim in Kabul, and that he had been arrested by the Taliban because they suspected he was an American spy.</p>
<p>Zahir testified that he and Al Karim had stayed at Abdul Habib Iraqi's <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guesthouse.html" title="Guesthouse">guesthouse</a>.</p>
<p>Janko testified that Al Karim was the only person who had been kind to him when he came to Kabul, as a refugee, and that Al Karim had bought him a pair of shoes. When asked why the Taliban tortured him into denouncing Al Karin he said he didn't really know why, except that they were suspicious of anything different.</p>

<p>Al Karim's Personal Representative submitted three newspaper articles he had found on the internet, that supported Al Karim's story that he was imprisoned as an American spy. Those articles were entitled:</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>Al Karim chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.<sup id="_ref-ArbArkanMohammadGhafilAlKarim_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArbArkanMohammadGhafilAlKarim" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
