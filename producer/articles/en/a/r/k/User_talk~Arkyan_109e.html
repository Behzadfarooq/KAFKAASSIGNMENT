<p>Hi! I've been working a bit on the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paran%C3%A1_River_6788.html" title="Paraná River">Paraná River</a> article and noticed your picture. If you took it yourself, as I assume it was, could you upload it to the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="commons:">Wikimedia Commons</a>, with a license that lets everybody use it? That way the picture would be usable from all Wikipedias and other projects. Of course, if you have other pictures, and the time and the <i>ganas</i> to do so, could you upload them also?

<p>Arkyan: The following is a quote from your own User page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The reason I cannot side with the inclusionists is because while I agree that "Wiki is not paper", I do not think that this equates to "Anything factual stays". Just because a useless article does not consume significant resources does not make it useful. A bar needs to be set and maintained for what ought to stay in order that Wikipedia does not degrade into a mishmash of useless articles and lose its value as a repository of useful, factual, and free information."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After reading your above quoted statement, I am at a loss as to why you deleted my request for deletion of the article <a href="../../../1/_/e/1_E2_K_2168.html" title="1 E2 K">1 E2 K</a>.</p>
<p>I just finished looking at the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Category%7EOrders_of_magnitude_880d.html" title="Category:Orders of magnitude">Category:Orders of magnitude</a> which has 10 articles devoted to various types of "order of magnitude" and also has 8 sub-categories that contain a total of 230 additional articles devoted to yet other types of "order of magnitude" . That makes a total of 240 articles devoted to what (in my opinion) constitutes a "mishmash of useless article" that you profess not to like. Can you give me one useful aspect of any of those articles?</p>
<p>I know that if A is ten times larger than B, that A is one order of magnitude larger than B ... or if A is 100 times larger than B, that A is two orders of magnitude larger than B ...etc., etc.</p>
<p>I see no purpose in having 240 articles devoted to telling me that same thing if A and B happens to be temperature ... or pressure ... or volume ... or mass ...ad nauseum! As far as I am concerned, the whole category should be deleted.</p>
<p>I am not going to revert your editing out my request but I would be interested in learning why you think these 240 silly articles are worth having in Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbeychok_616b.html" title="User:Mbeychok">mbeychok</a> 03:02, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arkyan, my feelings weren't hurt and you didn't step on my toes. But I still want to know why anyone would think that a request for deletion would be voted down.

<p>Well, first of all, because politically, there is little-to-no difference between a CDP and an unincorporated community. The difference really only shows in census results. Also, an actual unincorporated community often extends beyond the official CDP boundaries, or it may be much smaller.</p>
<p>Regarding your so-called "objective" definition, where you basically said that Pinal County is just not part of the metro area (I strongly challenge such an assertion, as Queen Creek clearly extends into Pinal County, as does Mesa, and AJ is entirely in Pinal County and at the same time is undeniably contigious with the rest of the metropolitan area), my definition is even more objective -- the areas that are included are those which are part of the contiguous corridor of "urban development" (that is, land that was "urban" according to over 25% of census respondents from the area) which includes most of the city of Phoenix. This excludes Buckeye, if I recall correctly, although that might not be the case in the next census. Also, you added all places in both counties, regardless of the fact that some are rural and are miles from any urban development (for this reason, Aguila could probably be removed). --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 07:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_films_with_disabled_protagonists_3fc2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of films with disabled protagonists">articles for deletion</a> discussion of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_with_disabled_protagonists.html" title="List of films with disabled protagonists">List of films with disabled protagonists</a> you commented that "A list of films about disabilities or that otherwise deal with the subject of disabilities as a primary plot point would be fine, but a list of movies with disabled protagonists by itself is arbitrary and indiscriminate." My understanding is that the "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagonist.html" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a>" of a film is by definition the person the film is about. The list itself may need clean-up, but I would expect that a list of films with disabled protagonists would in fact be a list of films that are about disabled people, and by extension, about disability in some sense. As <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">User:ArnoldReinhold</a> points out later in the discussion, either the disability will be a major plot point, or the way the character deals with his or her disability will be a major element of the story.

<p>I am glad to see people noticing my work! I try to get at least one new AZ county done a week, and currently, I am working on <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yuma_County%2C_Arizona_bee6.html" title="Yuma County, Arizona">Yuma County</a>. I originally did the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maricopa_County%2C_Arizona_7016.html" title="Maricopa County, Arizona">Maricopa county</a> map because I thought it could be updated (especially with how fast Maricopa county is growing, the map I made will be out of date before too long)</p>
<p>But you're right. It is proving to be a chore, so any help is greatly appreciated! I just thought that all the cities, towns and unincorporated places in Arizona deserved to have the same treatment as the cities in Maricopa county. Plus, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counties_in_Arizona_fb95.html" title="List of counties in Arizona">Arizona</a> was a good place to start, having only 15 counties, it would be fairly easy to get the whole state done. I fear for when someone takes on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counties_in_Texas_0dce.html" title="List of counties in Texas">Texas</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counties_in_Georgia_e4b8.html" title="List of counties in Georgia">Georgia</a>.</p>

<dd>I've been admittedly kind of lazy lately with this project, and so didn't complete all of the infoboxes for La Paz county. I do try and include the CDPs wherever possible, since it would reduce the number of maps that would otherwise be represented with just a red dot. I would have rather been able to include boundaries for all unincorporated areas, but I guess they are inherently abstract. I am curious to know why, if the Census Bureau recognizes so many other unincorporated areas as CDPs and provides data for them such as area, they don't bother representing them on their maps. Oh well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was thinking that for the next iterations of these maps that data for national and state parks as well as other miscellaneous large lots of land should be included along with Indian reservations, but I am not quite prepared for that at this time. I'd rather wait and see if the maps currently done will withstand the test of time and editing by the Wikipedia collective consciousness. In regards to if I am going to spread out to other states, I am not sure at this time if I want to take it all on. I picked Arizona because I live here and it was fairly easy, and it took me three months off and on to just get half of the state done. Due to the time constraints of living and working, it might end up being a project spanning years before it ever reached complete coverage of the U.S. Also, the meaningfulness of showing just counties for some cities and urban areas might not be that great (New York City, for example, is spread over five counties). With that in mind, I think I might just try and take on mapping and infoboxing cities and towns in larger urban areas only and see if anyone else is interested in following suit and providing their own great input like you have.</dd>

<p>Hello, Can you recreate the article: Clay Target Center in the same way you created Ben Avery Shooting Facility: <a href="http://www.azgfd.gov/ctc" class="external free" title="http://www.azgfd.gov/ctc" rel="nofollow">http://www.azgfd.gov/ctc</a></p>

<p>No problem. Right now MBHiii sees both of us as being opposed to him. He isn't going to listen to what we say. Let him win his "see also" battle on Dixie Mafia... it isn't really a big thing (most people pay no attention to the see also link anyway). That will help him relax. Then he can go off to some other article, and have some other editor criticize his edits. Hopefully he will begin to learn.

<p>Radiant! did not do this well. If there is a swathe of arguments and debates, it is <b>No Consensus</b>. That is how AfD works. Radiant!, however, abused his admin powers. The <b>keep</b>ists voted on the policies of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">encyclopedic status of the article in its current state</a>. What Radiant! put as his closure was badly disguised opinion, a fact that can only be reinforced by the fact he nominated the remaining list articles for deletion directly beforehand, therefore suggesting he had planned his closure. He also went up to me and said "they're unencyclopedic" directly beforehand, furthering my last point. In short, Radiant!'s conclusion was what would have been his vote had the AfD been running and he did a terrible job of disguising his opinionated conclusion. This also suggests that he did not take a proper look at the <b>Delete</b> votes as they were grounded in the teachings of the <b>Essay</b> Listcruft and what the article was like before any cleanup. The <b>Keep</b> votes were grouned in <b>policy</b> and were made by those who took the tiome to recognise improvement rather than judge the book by its cover.

<dd>So, if I understand you correctly, you think that the pages referenced in the article don't help to satisfy the notability criterion, because they are "trivial" references? If so, then I think that these are the true kinds of differences that can arise in an AfD, because different people interpret that policy guideline differently. Like I stated before, I thank you for your input on the matter. I personally think that the references are non-trivial, but that's just personal opinion. One thing that has soured me about the AfD process is I think most of the people don't understand the policies well enough, and just make a blind vote. I would like to thank you for the way you put your input in actually following your interpretation of the actual policy. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:33, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the comments. I've been editing Wikipedia for a number of years now, and admittedly, when the article was nominated for deletion, that version of the article was inappropriate. When I created the article, I didn't understand the policies as well as I do now. I've mentioned this before, but I really do think that the article meets notability guidelines. I've read all the way through <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> several times now since the nomination of this article. Knowing what I know now, I think that I would still create the article. Like I've said before, if someone thinks I'm being biased in any way, I am very open to constructive criticism. I am very much trying to keep to Wikipedia policy here. I think there are several other events in his life, that if I were trying to create a memorial, I would mention, but they aren't able to be sourced in a <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:Attributable</a> manner.

<dd>Thanks for the note, and I appreciate the attention you're giving this.</dd>
<dd>I'm aware of that part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a> and, indeed, almost quoted it in my last DRV comment, but decided to truncate it for space. (I have a tendency towards verbosity.) But while, as you rightly point out, "consensus" does not mean "unanamity", it also doesn't mean "majority rules," nor even "supermajority rules." My feeling is that while unanimity is not required, what <b><i>is</i></b> required is an evaluation by the administrators of the quality of the arguments made instead of simply an evaluation of the numeric state of the "votes", no matter what quantitative standard is utilized. My feeling is that even if all the comments were in favor of doing one thing, if one commenter made a strong and valid argument in favor of the other course, and that argument had a significant chance of being accepted by a sizable portion of the community, then the administrators really should give that argument the benefit of the doubt and rule that while the specific slice of the community that showed up to vote was in favor of one action, there was a good chance that the debate didn't accurately represent the consensus of the community, as opposed to the consensus of the people who commented.</dd>
<dd>I suppose this is my own fault, as I think I've been somewhat taken in by the claims made that Wikipedia operates on a community-consensual basis, when really, from what I can see, that isn't quite true at all. Instead while its official ideology is community-consensual, in practical action it runs on a supermajoritarian model based on the comments of statistical insignificant subgroups of the whole. That's interesting too, I suppose, but not <b><i>quite</i></b> as intriguing as the community-consensual model.</dd>
<dd>At the very least, I have the answer to the question I kept asking inthe AfD debate, but to which I never received a reply: How is community consensus determined? It turns out that it really isn't, in my view. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Fitzgerald_498b.html" title="User:Ed Fitzgerald">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Fitzgerald_cae3.html" title="User talk:Ed Fitzgerald">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ed_Fitzgerald_2fe5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ed Fitzgerald">cont</a>)</small> 00:37, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm going to talk to <a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cuchullain</a> about it, but if that doesn't work I'm likely to take this to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 11:29, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
