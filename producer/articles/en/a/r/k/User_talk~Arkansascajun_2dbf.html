<p>someone keeps deleting the link for my skoolie group <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/schoolbusconversionuts" class="external free" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/schoolbusconversionuts" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/schoolbusconversionuts</a> . it is undisputably the ORIGINAL,LARGEST and most active internet skoolie forum. it is also undisputable that the term SKOOLIE was coined on that forum. thats all i put in the links description. apparantly it is bieng deleted by skoolie.net because thats who always supplants mine. so i have done likewise. skoolienet was formed years after schoolbusconversionuts by members who saw the money making possibilities of our group and ripped off our (then public) membership list and started thier forum to sell webmaster services. another group, skoolieconversions was formed by our trusted moderator who ripped off our, by then private, membership list and started his own group to sell conversion books. in view of these facts i think it only correct that we are placed first in the links on this subject and that COPY CAT forums be excluded. as of this date the vandalism continues. someone repeatedly removes my group link. but i see they don't edit BUSNUTS ONLINE which is NOT A SKOOLIE FORUM. busnuts online is a COACH CONVERSION forum.they are the very reason i started schoolbusconversionuts. for years they wouldn't even talk to anyone with a skoolie in an effort to protect thier overvalued coaches.for years they would perpetuate falsehoods about skoolies such as you can't get them insured or campgrounds won't let them in etc. all proven to be false by our membership. this was done to protect the value of thier expensive coaches because skoolies are so much more affordable while offering the same quality. vonslatt.com is a PERSONAL page which is listed in the open directory personal pages which jake vonslatt also administers. there is a concerted effort to suppress schoolbusconversionuts because all other forums are oriented to making money for thier owners. our is not. i sell nothing. our only reason for existing is to help people build skoolies for FREE. since we are the largest and most active skoolie group it is essential they suppress us because we hurt thier business. if you doubt any of what i say then you only have to search our messages for the authors name to see that they are members who have belonged to our group since BEFORE they even owned a skoolie. who we helped to secure thier skoolies as well as build them. that goes for the founders of ALL other skoolie forums. the truth is in our message archives for all to see.</p>

<p>Greetings Arkansascajun, Per Wikipedia guidelines concerning external links, you should not link to a site that you maintain. Since you maintain the Yahoo group, you should not add it yourself. In addition, guidelines state that links to sites that require sign-in are to be avoided. Your site should not be linked to since it is not even viewable to non-members. I hope this clears things up for you.</p>
<p>I think you should also note that I saw a school bus conversion at Burning Man in 1995 that had a license plate that read "SKOOLIE", presumably because "SCHOOLIE" is 8 letters and wouldn't fit. So your claim that you were the first person to use the term on a yahoo group that was only formed in 2001 is impossible. <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.127.231.6.html" title="User:65.127.231.6">65.127.231.6</a> 06:52, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i have to challenge what you think you saw. you saw a license that said SCOOLIE not SKOOLIE.i also challenge you to find any ealier use of the term skoolie on the internet than on our group. i will make our group openly viewable and have someone else place the link.</p>
<p>School buses have been plentiful at Burning Man for years, hundreds of them; Do you really think that you were the first person on the whole planet to spell it with a K, just because you can't find a reference to it on the Internet prior to your group in 2001? I have no problem with you claiming you have the largest skoolie Yahoo group, but you certainly were not the first person to use the term "Skoolie." <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.127.231.6.html" title="User:65.127.231.6">65.127.231.6</a> 09:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Forget it, it isn't worth the trouble. Add whatever you want to the article. <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.127.231.6.html" title="User:65.127.231.6">65.127.231.6</a> 09:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC) thanks i appreciate your benevolence. but just for the record. the commonly used term for schoolbus conversions used prior to our use was SCOOLIE. i coined SKOOLIE because when i googled SCOOLIE i got a bunch of porn sites about school girls with no panties on. in deference to you i removed that claim from our link.however i would really like you to find some earlier reference using SKOOLIE as the descriptor for a converted school bus. i would be the first to dessiminate that info. after all SOMEONE was the first person on the planet to use it. no?</p>
