	    <p>The <b>Arica School</b> (also known as the <b>Arica Institute</b>, which is its incorporated educational organization, or simply as <b>Arica</b>) is a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_potential_movement.html" title="Human potential movement">human potential movement</a> group founded in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> by <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolivia.html" title="Bolivia">Bolivian</a>-born philosopher Oscar Ichazo (born in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>). It is named for the city of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arica.html" title="Arica">Arica</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>, where Ichazo once lived and where he led an intensive months-long training in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> before settling in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> where the Arica Institute (incorporated in 1971) has since been headquartered.</p>
<p>The Arica Institute’s origins began in 1956, when groups of people formed in major cities in South America to study the mystical insights, original philosophical theories and the in-depth understanding of the human psyche that Ichazo was proposing. For fourteen years these different groups studied, processed and experienced the knowledge he was teaching. In 1968, lectures about the theory of Protoanalysis and the doctrine of the Fixations were presented to the public at the Institute of Applied Psychology in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_Chile_7e29.html" title="Santiago Chile">Santiago</a>, Chile.</p>
<p>Oscar Ichazo is the originator of the theory known as Protoanalysis, which is based upon the metaphysical questions: <i>What is humankind?; What is the Supreme Good of humanity?;</i> and <i>What is the Truth that gives meaning and value to human life?</i> A single aspect of his theory, commonly referred to as the “Enneagram of Personality” has been seized upon by popular culture, and though largely misinterpreted, has spawned hundreds of books by enthusiasts in dozens of languages.</p>
<p>Ichazo is considered by many to be the modern "father" of the <a href="../../../e/n/n/Enneagram.html" title="Enneagram">Enneagram</a> (which he and the Arica Institute also call the "Enneagon") as a means to understand mechanical ego mechanisms which grow out of psychological trauma suffered at an early age in specific areas of the human psyche that encompass the sense of well being (Conservation Instinct), the sense of relations with others (Relations Instinct) and the sense of adapting to our environment (Adaptation Instinct). The purpose of this understanding is to allow the recognition of repetitive, mechanistic thinking and the suffering these mechanisms attempt to protect us from but actually tend to perpetuate. The Enneagram authors entirely misunderstood this and related it to "personality types" which can be used in various ways to make decisions regarding one's life and relationships. This was because, as they view it, Ichazo had done little to popularize his understanding of the Enneagram to an audience outside of Arica School. The original branch of this popular use of the Enneagram for "personality types" traces back to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudio_Naranjo_65e8.html" title="Claudio Naranjo">Claudio Naranjo</a> who studied with Ichazo in Chile but who was asked to leave before the intensive 1971 training had finished and who has consequently been estranged from Arica ever since. Aricans (as Ichazo's followers are often called) consider Naranjo's understanding of the Enneagram to be limited and somewhat inaccurate, although Naranjo's ideas about the Enneagram - and those of people to whom he taught the Enneagram, such as prolific author Helen Palmer - have been more influential in popularizing familiarity of the Enneagram symbol than have any available works by Ichazo.</p>
<p>The Enneagram / Enneagon, however, is just one component of the Arica system. The Arica School can be considered, as <i><a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramparts_Magazine_465d.html" title="Ramparts Magazine">Ramparts</a></i> magazine put it in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> in a positive article, as "a body of techniques for cosmic consciousness-raising and an ideology to relate to the world in an awakened way." In creating Arica's system and methodology, also known as <i>Protoanalysis</i>, it is popularly believed that Ichazo took inspiration from the teachings of <a href="../../../g/2E/i/G.I._Gurdjieff_ccd1.html" title="G.I. Gurdjieff">G.I. Gurdjieff</a> on consciousness, but Ichazo has gone to great lengths to dispel that belief as untrue. Elements of the Arica work are similar to and consistent with methodologies and concepts from traditions that include <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufism.html" title="Sufism">Sufism</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_Buddhism_3b98.html" title="Tibetan Buddhism">Tibetan Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen.html" title="Zen">Zen</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> and the <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a>. A large part of Arica is the study of Classical Philosophy as compared to "modern" philosophy. Ichazo has pointedly asserted his understanding of the Enneagram / Enneagon originated with reading Classical Philosophy and <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plotinus.html" title="Plotinus">Plotinus</a>' <a href="../../../e/n/n/Enneads.html" title="Enneads">Enneads</a> and not as any consequence of any writing or work of <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurdjieff.html" title="Gurdjieff">Gurdjieff</a>.</p>
<p>The tools that the Arica Institute teaches, are called the “Protoanalytical Theory, System and Method.” Protoanalysis is the analysis of the complete human being, from the lowest aspects of the human process, progressing systematically to the Higher States of Consciousness where enlightenment can be attained. The Arica Institute provides a clearly defined map of the human psyche as a guide for discovering the basis of a person’s ego process enabling individuals to transcend this process into the Higher State of Consciousness that is found in and available to every person. This State of being is seen as our True Essential Self, experienced as an internal state of great happiness, Light and liberation.</p>
<p>The Arica Institute is a School of Knowledge that presents a contemporary method for the clarification of the human process into states of enlightenment and true liberation. According to Ichazo’s Protoanalytical Theory, when the mind is stabilized through perspective, understanding and self-observation, meditations can be employed to transcend everyday experiences into the Higher States of Mind where enlightenment and real freedom can, according to Aricans, be attained.</p>
<p>The Arica Institute offers group and individual trainings in the teachings of the Arica School through sponsorships in a number of countries, or directly from the school.</p>
