<p>i am removing a palestinian POV here, "Some would say that the city is named after Ariel Sharon who was, at the time, a great proponent of Israeli settlements", that information has no validation and it is wrong. In Ariel's homepage it clearly says it was named because it's another name for Jerusalem. Whoever wrote it might be over the name of Ariel Sharon is not fermilier with Israel, the name giving proccess and did not find that information anywhere accept in his or her own mind, which is not what Wikipedia is about.</p>
<p>"Smaria" is not the internationally recognized name for the area. Only pro-Israeli people call it that. The UN resolutions(as well as <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_def6.html" title="Geneva Convention">Geneva Convention</a> law) clearly state that it is illegally-occupied land, and that it is illegal to transfer your civillian population to such land. The sources are the Resolutions themselevs plus checking under the various Geneva codes. If anything YOU need to cite your sources to justify that Ariel is legal, and also that the term "Samaria" is used by more than just Jewish people to refer to present-day areas.</p>

Ariel is not an "illegal Israeli" settlement since the Israeli government views it as a legitimate residential area under Israeli law as are most other Israeli settlements in the 'disputed territories', but you can argue that most see it as an "illegal" settlement under the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Geneva_Convention_ea40.html" title="Fourth Geneva Convention">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>, though that is controverisal as well.

<p>Do modern-day people refer to northern Iraq as "Assyria"? Does anybody in present-day Lebanon call that country "Phoenicia"&#160;? Does anybody in France refer to their country as "Gaul"? Do Palestinians refer to the northern West Bank as "Samaria" or the southern West Bank as "Judaea"? And at the end of the day whether you accept it or not the UN and every nation on Earth including Israel regards the West Bank as being a Palestinian territory under Israeli control, and not part of Isarel proper. Therefore archaic non-Palestinian terms should not be used. -- 155.232.250.51</p>
<p>So you are saying that whatever American Indians call their land, it is irrelevant?</p>
<p>'At the end of the day', NPOV means that we try to bring as much information to the article as possible, not write, or rather leave out, history the way one side sees it. I don't ask you to believe the bible, but you should accept that it was around long before 'Palestine'. Again, if you can provide a Palestinian or Arabic term for the 'West Bank', than it would be legitimate as well. Until now, no one has added it to the article. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 20:13, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

The West Bank has really only existed as an entity since 1948. Prior to that the West Bank was part of Palestine. I sincerely doubt that your "Judaea and Samaria" correspond exactly to what is now the West Bank. Also the name "Palestine" and its earlier terms such as "Filistin" can be traced abck to at least 5 thousand years ago. The Bible dates from less than 3 thousand years ago. Even then the land is called "the land of Canaan" . Earlier it says that "Abraham lived in the land of the Philistines". Regardless of this the name "Samaria" is in modern-times used by the occupiers of occupied land, while the Palestinian people refer to the corresponding area as "the northern West Bank". When Hitler invaded Poland and changed everything to German names under the occupation, most countries, as well as the League of Nations, still used the sovereign Polish names, rather than the Nazi-approved names. Similarly while Israel may control the West Bank, even the Knesset does not regard the West Bank as part of Israel proper and thus the Palestinian terms should be used, and these do not to the best of my knowledge include "Judaea" and "Samaria" . ____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><b>thats bulshit</b>. If you are going to try and find reasons to attack everything that seem to be israeli, atleast make it <b>reasonable</b> and <b>true</b>.</p>
<p><b>1 -</b> There is no place in the "torah", or the book of "genesis" in it, that says "Abraham lived in the land of the Philistines". the Philistines were an ancient greek nation that came from the sea and conquered the southern coast of israel around the same time the israelites started to conquer jodea and samaria. The term "Philistine" didn't exist in the time abraham lived and not even in the time the "torah" was written.</p>
<p><b>2 -</b> Philistine, the land of the ancient greek nation the Philistines, did not include jodea or samaria. Philistine was along the southern coast, between the cities Ashdod and Gaza, modern south-central Israel and the Gaza strip. By the way, thats where i live&#160;:)</p>
<p><b>3 -</b> Palastine isn't used for 5,000 years to describe israel(the philistines which gave their lands that name only came to israel around 3,000 years ago), Palastine is used for less than 2,000 years. Palastine is the english pronunciation philistine(or "paleshet" in its original form), and it was set as a diffrent word from philistine after 1948 to differentiate the palestinians from the anceint greek nation the philistines(or "plishtim" in its original form). Prior to 1948, there was no such thing as a palestinian nation, they took the name from the british mandate's name. The name of israel in the beginning was "land of cna'an", since the nations that lived in israel were the cna'anians. After the israelites conquered cna'an, the name of the land was known as Israel. Near Israel, on the southern coast, there was the land of palastine(or philistine today). The philistines were Israel's arch enemies throughout ancient israel's history. The babylon empire conquered Israel and Philistine and the Philsitine nation was destroyed. After that the Greek empire conquered israel, and they named the land "Jodea". After them came the Romans, they also called the land "Jodea". After the jewish revolt against the romans failed around 70AD, Jodea was destroyed and canceled. Instead, the Romans gave the land a new name, Philistine, over the name of the Philistines. That was done in order to humiliate the jews, by giving their land the name of their arch-enemies. Ever since, Philstine or Palastine is the name that is used to describe this land. It has no connection to the modern palestinians. And it does not rull out regions' names such as jodea and samaria.</p>
<p><b>4 -</b> Jodea and Samaria are 2 terms that were used worldwide even before the roman empire. The Jodean mountains, the Joidan desert and the Samarian mountains are called like this by the entire world. That includes the palestinians. The "west bank" doesn't conflict with the terms Jodea or samaria, they are natural regions inside the west bank. The fact that the names for those areas are driven from hebrew doesn't make it pro-israeli. Like it or not, the israelites are the original owners of those lands, and most places in the west bank, including mountains, regions and cities, are hebrew names.</p>
<p><b>5 -</b> I assume u haven't spent a day in your life there, and therefore, you are under the impression that all palestinians are filled with blind hatred like yourself, and thats too bad, because you make them look bad. The palestinians do refer to those areas as samaria and jodea, and they don't try to hide that information or say it was names given by israel. Those names were used throughout history by the Israelites, the Babylon empire, the Greeks, the Roman empire, the Arabian empire, the Ottoman empire and the british mandate. Its written in maps everywhere. Therefore, saying that because those areas belong to the palestines since 1993 the names are incurrect, is stupid(to remind you, before the oslo agreements in 1993, that area belonged to Israel only. The west bank was conquered by Jordon in 1948 and was conquered from Jordon by Israel in 1967 in the six days war). Those names were there long before the palestinians and they are used by the palestinians and the rest of the world, including the UN, which shows "Jodea" and "Samaria" in the west bank maps. Like you said, we should write what the world calls it, and not what a minority calls it. Even if the palestinians were to call it diffrently, it should still not be accepable because that term was there before them and is still used and known worldwide. Saying the words "Jodea" and "Samaria" are pro-israeli is like saying the words "Jordon" or "Jerusalem" are pro-israeli since they are hebrew names.</p>
<p><b>6 -</b> There is no other "Palestinian term" for the jodean mountains and the samarian mountains, only the arabic pronunciation of it. In daily talk palestinians and israelis usually don't say region's names. The region's names are ancient names for those areas, and in daily talk we usually use modern terms . both palestinians and israelis will say "northen west bank". inside israel too, i won't say "upper galilee" i would say "northen israel", i won't say "tsin desert" i would say "southern israel", i won't say "cna'an mountain" i would say "city of tsfat" i won't say "dan" i would say "central israel" and so on and so on. but don't confuse daily talk with official information. using modern areas' names doesn't cancel out any of the real names such as galilee, samaria, jodea,tsin, pa'aran and so on, and it is used often in the news, papers, speeches and maps.</p>
<p>i hope now you relize how senseless your arguments were.</p>
<p>please read about the ancient greek nation the philstines, so you will understand there is no connection between them and the palestinians, there is no historical connection between the modern palestinians and the land of israel or philstine, and that philistine was a coastal land and was not consisted of the jodean and samarian mountains that are the modern west bank.</p>

<p>How nice, using terms like "bullshit" to make your point. Before making offensive comments like that, as well as your racist revisionism claims, I suggest you read the wikipedia policy and terms pages. You claim that there is no connection between the Palestinains and Philistines, and in a way you're right..the Palestinians are a "mongrel" race, a mixture of Israelite, Canaanite, Philistine, Persian, Arabic etc. However what is certain is that there is no connection between the Israelites and modern "Israelis" who are a European, gentile race.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the name "Filistin" was used by Egyptians, Persians etc long before any of the above-mentioned people appeared. Also, during the Exodus, it mentions the Israelites taking the long way around out of the Sinai Peninsula to avoid making contact with the Philistines. It is also a fact that certain cities, eg Gaza. were founded thousands of years before any "Israelite" appeared. While this does not necessarily mean that it was then a Philistine city, it does prove that the land had like-minded people (ie not Zionist elitists) who already ahd established terms and names for places and regions that has nothing to do with your false claims. The names "Judaea" and "Samaria" are also pointless and rather sad today, because the actual Judaeans and Samarians have long since vanished from the land of Canaan/Israel/Palestine/whatever and thus the name should be named after or by its current inhabitants(ie the Palestinians). - 155.232.250.35 --</p>

<p>Who is hiding? And surely calling Palestinians "Arabs" is POV? After all Arabia is to the south of Palestine. Just because somebody speaks Arabic, it doesn't make them an Arab. In much the same way as if someone speaks English it doesn't make them a descendant of the medieval Anglo-Saxons. And "Arab" isn't a religion. If by your ignorance, you mean "Muslim", then you should know that there are many non-Muslim Arabs, and in fact the largest Muslim community in the world is in Indonesia, not the Middle East. The generic "Arab" term to try and sustain the myth that all Middle Eastern people is homogenous, and thus the Palestinians are no different to Syrians, Egyptians, Lebanese, Arabians, Tunisians etc was created by western propagandists to try and convince people that since the Palestinians have no culture of their own, they thus shouldn't be entitled to their own state. Furthermore, it is a fact that I'm sure you would agree with, that prior to the creation Of Israel in 1948, the vast majority of the people living in the state weare Palestinians. While you may not accept that they (or rather their ancestors) have been there since prehistory, you must admit that they had at least for sevral centuries been the vast majority people in the land. Likewise the vast majority of Jewish people who ebcame the "Iraelis" arrived in Israel/Palestine only after the second World War. From this perspective the Palestinians are the indigenous people. Likewise many Sephardic, Fallajah people do not like being referred to as "Jews" since the term "Jew" is widely used and understood to refer exclusively to the white Ashkenazi people who are the post-1945 arrivals, while the darker skinned "Jews" who have lived in the state for at least several centuries mostly spoke Arabic and identified themselves not with the Ashkenazi, but with the Palestinians(Muslim, Christian, and otherwise) before the creation of the state of Israel.......John Miller</p>
<p>I have yet to meet a 'Sephardic' Jew that resists this title. While there is evidence of an Arab majority, even in 1922, there is no evidence that seventy years earlier, this was true. And Arab is the widely used term since many Arabs (not all, and I don't say 'most' either since there is no proof) living in Israel/West Bank are immigrants/descendants of Syrian, Egyptian, and other surrounding areas who flocked to the area when the Jews started arriving in the 19th century. Again, this is not the proper forum for this argument. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 22:36, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who was referring to 'indigenous' as vandalism? I was referring, and explained it multiple times, that vanadalism is entering POV and deleting comments. POV, since, as I already said (you don't even acknoledge this), the proper forum for this 'indigenous' discussion belongs on the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinians.html" title="Palestinians">Palestinians</a> page, not here. Perhaps indigenous is a proper term used to describe the homogenous native peoples of America, Australia, Africa, etc... It is a fact that there were Jews here in 1948, it is also a fact that while there was already an 'Arab' majority in 1922, if we go back a few dozen years, this was not the case. Another fact that you should be aware of, the current Palestinians, prior to '48, viewed the term 'Palestinian' as derogatroy and did not view themselves as Palestinians, since the Jews were called Palestinian as well.</dd>

<p>Since this is a controversial article (I've already been accused of POV here...), I will just say here that the article should probably be moved to Ariel (city), without capital C. This is according to Wikipedia naming conventions. On a side note, why is Ariel (City) NPOV and Ariel, Israel POV if it is Israel who gave Ariel the status of a city, even though generally towns with such a small population are not given such a status? -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 19:43, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Support</b> move to (city). According to <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a>, there really is no standard size. At the end of 2005, Ariel had 17 800 residents, certainly not a metropolis, but not a rural hamlet either. 'Ariel, Israel' is a fact since it is Israeli, BUT the legitimacy of the city is disputed by opponents of any Jewish residency in the West Bank, so they'd probably prefer 'Ariel, illegal settlement'.--<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 21:04, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Ariel, Israel" is not allowed because it suggests that the land Ariel sits on is part of Israel and such political comment is not allowed in titles. A name matching Wikipedia naming conventions is "Ariel (city)". Using a capital C looks odd. I'd actually prefer "Ariel (West Bank)" but I'm unwilling to devote time fighting for it. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 23:43, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The move has been made, since no objections were raised. On the other hand, I don't support Ariel (West Bank), because most of the world knows West Bank to be a Palestinian territory, which means it could be assumed that Ariel is a Palestinian city. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 07:19, 10 March 2006 (UTC</p>

<dd>Hello Robin, a settlement is most definitely not a city, but any city is a settlement by geographic definitions. A settlement in geography is no more than a populated place. Ariel is a geographic entity so this definition is important. Settlements are often referred to as communities, however a community unlike a settlement is not at all place specific. Thus, while all settlements are communities, <i>a community is not a settlement</i>. Just another catchy and equally true title you may want to consider.

<ul>
<li>First of all Ariel is built on land that Israel took by force in the 1967 war and continues to occupy illegally until this day. For reference go look at the tens of UN Resolutions clearly stating that fact and the countless international conventions, including the Geneva Convention, which clearly state that the acquisition of territory by war is illegimate, inadmissible, and contravenes all notions of international law and respect.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, when pointing out the location of Ariel in the first sentence, in order to make the article accessible to the widest audience possible, it is preposterous to use ancient villages that existed thousands of years ago and only mentioned in texts that people of a certain faith believe in. The whole world believes in geography and what their eyes show them. We have satellites today that give us the precise location of towns and villages. Use references to existing landmarks or latitude and longitude, not the ancient town of I don't know what. There are hundreds of millions of Buddhists in the world that don't necessarily believe what is written in your bible. Wikipeida is not a bible. It is an encyclopedia.</li>

<dd>Fair second claim, present day referential landmarks should definitely be placed before historical places.

<dl>
<dd>As for your first claim, it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The mountain ridge that Ariel is located on was not conquered by force from a defending army and no natives were forced off this land. Ariel specifically is situated on land that was uninhabited before the first pioneers set up their tents. The Palestinians ridiculed these pioneers because they themselves called the area 'mountain of death' since nothing grew on it except for rocks and weeds. While some parts are 'state-owned' meaning they had been occupied by the Jordanian government, other parts of it were actually purchased with cash from Palestinians. Even today, there are parts that are still outside the immediate boundaries of the city since it is private Palestinian land. Ariel is not on illegal land. If you have an issue with the entire West Bank or Israeli settlements go to those articles. If you have <b>specific references to international law</b> that states that Ariel is illegal, please provide them. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 07:21, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
