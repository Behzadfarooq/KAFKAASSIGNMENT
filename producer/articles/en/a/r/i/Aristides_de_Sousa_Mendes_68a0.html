<p><b>Aristides de Sousa Mendes</b> was born in Cabanas de Viriato, in the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viseu_%28district%29.html" title="Viseu (district)">district of Viseu</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beira%2C_Portugal_8bf3.html" title="Beira, Portugal">Beira region</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>. His family had aristocratic origins. His father had been a judge on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_35ae.html" title="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a>, and Sousa Mendes’ twin brother César would become Foreign Minister in 1932–33 under the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Oliveira_Salazar_8ee9.html" title="António de Oliveira Salazar">António de Oliveira Salazar</a> regime.</p>
<p>Sousa Mendes studied law at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Coimbra_b01f.html" title="University of Coimbra">University of Coimbra</a>, together with his twin, and both obtained their law degrees in 1908. In 1910, he married his childhood sweetheart, Angelina; they eventually had 14 children, born in the various countries where he served. Shortly after his marriage, he began the diplomatic career that would take him and his family around the world. In his early career, he served in <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanzibar.html" title="Zanzibar">Zanzibar</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> before being assigned to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp%2C_Belgium_d3f5.html" title="Antwerp, Belgium">Antwerp, Belgium</a> in 1931. After almost 10 years of dedicated service in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, Sousa Mendes was assigned to the consulate of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux.html" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristides_de_Sousa_Mendes_68a0.html" title="Edit section: His acts as Diplomat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">His acts as Diplomat</span></h2>
<p>The consul was still in Bordeaux at the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the invasion of France by the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> army of <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salazar.html" title="Salazar">Salazar</a> managed to maintain Portugal's neutrality in the war, but his own personal opinions favoured Hitler. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">November 11</a>, 1939, he issued orders that consuls were not to issue Portuguese visas to "foreigners of indefinite or contested nationality; the stateless; or Jews expelled from their countries of origin". This order was followed only six months later by one stating that "under no circumstances" were visas to be issued without prior case-by-case approval from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>.</p>
<p>The Jewish Virtual Library biography of Sousa Mendes records the consul's response as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Within days of the new orders, Sousa Mendes was taken to task for having granted a visa to a Viennese refugee, Professor Arnold Wizrntzer. Called to task by his superiors, Sousa Mendes answered: "He informed me that, were he unable to leave France that very day, he would be interned in a concentration [read, detention] camp, leaving his wife and minor son stranded. I considered it a duly of elementary humanity to prevent such an extremity."<sup id="_ref-jvl_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jvl" title="">[1]</a></sup></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus it was in a deliberate act of disobedience that Sousa Mendes issued an estimated 30,000 visas to Jews and other persecuted minorities: political dissidents, army officers from occupied countries, and priests and nuns. These visas were not all to individuals, but sometimes to families; in at least one case, the visa covered a family of nine people.<sup id="_ref-silva_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-silva" title="">[2]</a></sup> Sousa Mendes was inspired to this act in part through his friendship with <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> Chaim (Haim) Kruger<sup id="_ref-denver_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-denver" title="">[3]</a></sup>, who had fled to France from Antwerp.</p>
<p>The earliest of these visas were issued in the months between the 1939 and mid-1940 decrees, a period during which he attempted to protect his family by sending all but two sons home to Portugal and sending constant telegrams to Lisbon with coded requests for approval of the visas, in order to preserve his post while obeying his conscience. The majority of the visas, however, were issued after a harrowing three-day crisis of conscience in mid-June, 1940, shortly after Franco changed the status of Spain from "neutral" to "non-belligerent," <sup id="_ref-jvl_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jvl" title="">[1]</a></sup>, which suggested time was running out for Portugal to follow its ally and neighbor. The consul offered a visa to his friend the rabbi, who responded, "I can't accept a visa for us and leave my people behind."<sup id="_ref-gp_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gp" title="">[4]</a></sup> The distraught consul took to his bed in confusion from June 14th to the 16th. From his crisis, Sousa Mendes emerged on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a>, 1940, determined to obey what he called a "divine power" and grant visas to everyone in need, at whatever cost to himself.</p>
<p><a name="June_17-July_8:_The_French-Portuguese_Exodus" id="June_17-July_8:_The_French-Portuguese_Exodus"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristides_de_Sousa_Mendes_68a0.html" title="Edit section: June 17-July 8: The French-Portuguese Exodus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">June 17-July 8: The French-Portuguese Exodus</span></h2>
<p>Working feverishly with Rabbi Kruger, the two remaining Sousa Mendes sons and their mother, and a few refugees, the consul formed an assembly line that processed visas all through that day and well into the night. They made whatever changes were necessary to the usual procedure: the consul signing with just his surname, not registering the visas or collecting fees, and stamping visas on pieces of paper. The sense of urgency was heightened even more when <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshal_Henri_Petain_d6d2.html" title="Marshal Henri Petain">Marshal Henri Petain</a> announced that day that France would sign a peace agreement with Germany. The assembly line kept working all through the following day. A delegate of the House of Habsburg, after having to wait his turn in the seemingly endless line, left with 19 visas for the imperial family of the Archduke, who later returned in person to obtain an additional stack of visas for Austrian refugees.</p>
<p>On into June 19, the assembly line marched on through stacks and stacks of visas, even as the city was bombed by German planes. At this point, Sousa Mendes rushed to the consulate at <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonne.html" title="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, near the Spanish border where his visas were being honored for the crowds rushing out of the country. Finding that consulate overwhelmed, he took over responsibility from his subordinate there, Consul Machado, and set up a second assembly line to process thousands more exit documents. (Machado reported this behavior to Portugal's ambassador to Spain, Teotonio Pereira, who favored Germany and worried that accepting those unacceptable to Hitler would ruin Portugal's relationship with Franco; Pereira promptly set out for the French border.) He went on to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hendaye.html" title="Hendaye">Hendaye</a> to assist there, thus narrowly missing two cablegrams from Lisbon on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a> to Bordeaux and Bayonne ordering him to stop even as France's armistice with Germany became official. In an article for a religious magazine in 1996, his son John Paul Abranches told the story:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As his diplomatic car reached the French border town of Hendaye, my father encountered a large group of stranded refugees for whom he had previously issued visas. Those people had been turned away because the Portuguese government had phoned the guards, commanding, "Do not honor Mendes's signature on visas."</i></dd>
<dd><i>Ordering his driver to slow down, Father waved the group to follow him to a border checkpoint that had no telephones. In the official black limousine with its diplomatic license tags, Father led those refugees across the border toward freedom.</i><sup id="_ref-gp_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gp" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>He traveled to the border at <a href="../../../i/r/u/Irun.html" title="Irun">Irun</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, where he personally raised the gate to allow disputed passages into Spain to occur. It was at this point that Ambassador Pereira arrived at Irun, declared Sousa Mendes mentally incompetent and invalidated all further visas.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[5]</a></sup> An <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> story the next day reported that some 10,000 persons attempting to cross over into Spain were excluded because authorities no longer granted recognition to their visas.<sup id="_ref-jvl_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jvl" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As Sousa Mendes continued the flow of visas, Salazar sent a telegram on June 24 recalling him to Portugal, an order he received upon returning to Bordeaux on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a> but followed only slowly, not arriving in Portugal until <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a>. Along the way he issued Portuguese passports to refugees now trapped in occupied France, saving them by preventing their deportation to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camps.html" title="Concentration camps">concentration camps</a>.<sup id="_ref-jvl_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jvl" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristides_de_Sousa_Mendes_68a0.html" title="Edit section: Dishonor and disgrace">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dishonor and disgrace</span></h2>
<p>He saved an enormous number of lives, but lost his career for it. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, Salazar lost political trust in Sousa Mendes and forced the diplomat to quit his career, subsequently ordering as well that no one in Portugal show him any charity.<sup id="_ref-rw3131_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rw3131" title="">[6]</a></sup> He found he also could not resume his law career, as he was prevented from registration, and he was made to surrender his foreign-issue driver's license.<sup id="_ref-gp_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gp" title="">[4]</a></sup>Just before the war's end in 1945, he suffered a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a> that left him at least partially paralyzed. In his later years, the formerly much-honored diplomat was abandoned by most of his colleagues and friends and often blamed by some of his close family members.<sup id="_ref-felipe_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-felipe" title="">[7]</a></sup>Aided by a local Jewish refugee agency — which had begun to feed the family and pay their rent upon discovering the situation — the children moved to other countries one by one in search of opportunities they were now denied in Portugal, though all accounts by them indicate they never blamed their father or regretted his decision. His wife, Angelina, died in 1948. Stripped of his pension, he died in poverty on April 3, 1954, still in disgrace with his government.</p>
<p>This ill-treatment by his government for acts considered heroic in other countries was not unique to Sousa Mendes. Others similarly dishonored include <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiune_Sugihara_87de.html" title="Chiune Sugihara">Chiune Sugihara</a>, the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> consul in <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kaunas.html" title="Kaunas">Kaunas</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>; <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Lutz_07fc.html" title="Carl Lutz">Carl Lutz</a>, the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> Vice-Consul in <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>; and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Gr%C3%BCninger_43e9.html" title="Paul Grüninger">Paul Grüninger</a>, chief of police in the Swiss canton of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canton_of_St._Gallen_42c3.html" title="Canton of St. Gallen">Sankt-Gallen (Saint-Gall)</a>. Ironically, the actions that caused Salazar to dismiss his diplomatic representative brought considerable praise to him and to Portugal, seen internationally as a haven of hospitality for refugee Jews; the magazine <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_magazine.html" title="Life magazine">Life</a></i> called Salazar "the greatest Portuguese since <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_the_Navigator_a1f5.html" title="Henry the Navigator">Henry the Navigator</a>" (July 29, 1940).<sup id="_ref-gp_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gp" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-felipe_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-felipe" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jvl_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jvl" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Family members seeking to clear his name sought to have his story published in magazines and began to contact Jewish visa recipients living in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> Sousa Mendes was honored at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yad_Vashem_56e6.html" title="Yad Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> memorial to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> as one of the "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Righteous_Among_The_Nations_f94b.html" title="Righteous Among The Nations">Righteous Among The Nations</a>," one of the first steps in the long journey. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, inspired by the election of a civilian president in Portugal, his son John Paul Abranches began to circulate a petition to the Portuguese president within his adopted country, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. As journalists began to tell the story, it came to the attention of two members of the California delegation of the U.S. <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Representatives_5c56.html" title="House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese-American_363d.html" title="Portuguese-American">Portuguese-American</a> Rep. <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Coelho_4df4.html" title="Tony Coelho">Tony Coelho</a> and Rep. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Waxman_d3f4.html" title="Henry Waxman">Henry Waxman</a>, who had a family member saved by Sousa Mendes' signature. These two men introduced a resolution in Congress to recognize his humanitarian actions, a resolution that was passed in 1987.</p>
<p>Also in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, the Portuguese Republic began to rehabilitate Sousa Mendes' memory and granted a posthumous Order of Liberty medal, one of that country's highest honors, although the consul's diplomatic honors still were not restored. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assembleia_da_Rep%C3%BAblica_56ba.html" title="Assembleia da República">Portuguese parliament</a> officially dismissed all charges, restoring him to the diplomatic corps by unanimous vote and honoring him with a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing_ovation.html" title="Standing ovation">standing ovation</a>. He also was issued the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_of_Merit_33aa.html" title="Cross of Merit">Cross of Merit</a> for his actions in Bordeaux. In December of that year, the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, Edward Rowell presented copies of the congressional resolution from the previous year to Dr. Pedro Nuno de Sousa Mendes, one of the sons who had helped in the assembly line at Bordeaux, and to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidents_of_Portugal_fd71.html" title="Presidents of Portugal">President</a> <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/M%C3%A1rio_Soares_d1aa.html" title="Mário Soares">Mário Soares</a> at the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pal%C3%A1cio_de_Bel%C3%A9m_4699.html" title="Palácio de Belém">Palácio de Belém</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> former President Soares dedicated a bust of Sousa Mendes in Bordeaux, along with a commemorative plaque at 14 quai Louis-XVIII, the address at which the consulate at Bordeaux had been housed. <sup id="_ref-juste_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-juste" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>A commemorative stamp was issued in Portugal, 1995; image can be find at <a href="http://www.caleida.pt/filatelia/aleph/ficha?emi_00_01+7747" class="external free" title="http://www.caleida.pt/filatelia/aleph/ficha?emi_00_01+7747" rel="nofollow">http://www.caleida.pt/filatelia/aleph/ficha?emi_00_01+7747</a></p>

<p>The mansion that Sousa Mendes had to abandon and sell in the poverty of his final years was left for decades to rot and decay, and at one time was to be razed and replaced by a hotel. However, with <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reparation_%28legal%29.html" title="Reparation (legal)">reparations</a> funds given by the Portuguese government to Sousa Mendes' heirs in 2000, the family decided to create the Aristides de Sousa Mendes Foundation (Fundação Aristides de Sousa Mendes, in Portuguese). With assistance from government officials, the foundation purchased the family home in order to develop a museum in his honor.<sup id="_ref-soroptimist_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-soroptimist" title="">[9]</a></sup> The house was classified as a Portuguese National Monument on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a>, 2005. The two events at UNESCO raised a 6,000 <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">euro</a> donation for the foundation; even so, the foundation's president said in 2006 that the organization was finding it difficult to raise sufficient additional funds for the renovation.<sup id="_ref-difficult_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-difficult" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
