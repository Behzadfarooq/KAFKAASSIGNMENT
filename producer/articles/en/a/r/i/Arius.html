<p><b>Arius</b> (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html" title="Anno Domini">AD</a> ca <a href="../../../2/5/0/250.html" title="250">250</a>/<a href="../../../2/5/6/256.html" title="256">256</a> - <a href="../../../3/3/6/336.html" title="336">336</a>, of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>) was an early <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> theologian, who taught that the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_God_bcd3.html" title="Son of God">Son of God</a> was not eternal, and was subordinate to <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">God the Father</a> (a view known generally as <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arianism</a>). Although he attracted considerable support at the time (and since), Arius's views were declared <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heretical</a> at the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Council_of_Nicaea_a44c.html" title="First Council of Nicaea">Council of Nicaea</a>, leading to the formation of the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a>. Arius who was a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyter.html" title="Presbyter">presbyter</a> of the church district of Baucalis in Alexandria, Egypt. Our knowledge of Arius’s doctrine of Christ comes from many teachings, sermons, and letters, including fragments of his Tralia, or ‘banquet’, a popular medley of prose and verse, which Athanasius (Arius's enemy, see below) preserved in his polemical writings. Arius popularized his theology by crafting it into the style of ballads sung in port cities through the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Reconstructing the life and teachings of Arius can be problematic and controversial. None of Arius's writings is extant; many were destroyed by his opponents. Indeed, our only record of his teaching is found in writings of those who opposed him and denounced him as a heretic - sources which are obviously far from dispassionate. Yet these, as the only surviving references to him, are all the scholars have. These few remaining works credited to him are Epiphanius's recordings of his letter to Alexander of Alexandria, Theodoret's recording of his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia, and Athanasius's recording of fragments of <i>Thalia</i>, a popularized work combining prose and verse.</p>

<p>He was possibly of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libya.html" title="Libya">Libyan</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber_people.html" title="Berber people">Berber</a> descent. His father's name is given as Ammonius. Arius was a student at the exegetical school in Antioch, where he studied under the school's founder <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucian_of_Antioch_8e84.html" title="Lucian of Antioch">Saint Lucian</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> He was made presbyter of the district of Baucalis in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in <a href="../../../3/1/3/313.html" title="313">313</a>. Although the character of Arius has been severely assailed by his opponents, Arius appears to have been a man of personal ascetic character, pure morals, and decided convictions. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_H._Carroll_955c.html" title="Warren H. Carroll">Warren H. Carroll</a> (paraphrasing <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphanius_of_Salamis_c0a7.html" title="Epiphanius of Salamis">Epiphanius of Salamis</a>, an opponent of Arius) describes him as “tall and lean, of distinguished appearance and polished address.

Men were impressed by his aura of intellectual superiority.”<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arius.html" title="Edit section: Arius starts a controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arius starts a controversy</span></h2>
<p>The historian <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates_Scholasticus_7d60.html" title="Socrates Scholasticus">Socrates Scholasticus</a> reports that Arius first became controversial under the bishop Achillas of Alexandria, when he made the following syllogism: "‘If,’ said he, ‘the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he had his substance from nothing.’" (Thus his actions were not the result of any jealousy on account of his unsuccessful candidacy for the patriarchate of Alexandria in rivalry with Alexander.)</p>
<p>It is believed that Arius's doctrines were influenced by the teachings of <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucian_of_Antioch_8e84.html" title="Lucian of Antioch">Lucian of Antioch</a>, a celebrated Christian teacher and martyr for the faith. In a letter to Bishop <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_of_Constantinople_d16b.html" title="Alexander of Constantinople">Alexander</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_of_Alexandria_0de5.html" title="Alexander of Alexandria">Alexander of Alexandria</a> wrote that Arius derived his theology from Lucian. The express purpose of his letter is to complain of the doctrines Arius was then diffusing but his charge of heresy against Arius is vague and unsupported by other authorities, and Alexander's language, like that of most controversialists in those days, is vituperative. Moreover, Lucian is not stated, even by Alexander himself, to have fallen into the heresy afterwards promulgated by Arius, but is accused <i>ad invidiam</i> of heretical tendencies.</p>
<p>The patriarch of Alexandria was the subject of adverse criticism for his slow reaction against Arius. Like his predecessor Dionysius, he has been charged with vacillation. Yet it is difficult to see how he could have acted otherwise than he did. The question that Arius raised had been left unsettled two generations previously, or, if in any sense it could be said to have been settled, it had been settled in favour of the opponents of the <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoousion.html" title="Homoousion">homoousion</a></i>. Therefore Alexander allowed the controversy to continue until he felt that it had become dangerous to the peace of the Church. Then he called a council of bishops and sought their advice. Once they decided against Arius, Alexander delayed no longer. He deposed Arius from his office, and excommunicated both him and his supporters.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arius.html" title="Edit section: Arius's doctrines">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arius's doctrines</span></h2>
<p>In explaining his actions against Arius, Alexander of Alexandria wrote a letter to Alexander of Constantinople and <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius_of_Nicomedia_ddc4.html" title="Eusebius of Nicomedia">Eusebius</a> of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicomedia.html" title="Nicomedia">Nicomedia</a> (where the emperor was then residing), detailing the errors into which he believed Arius had fallen. According to Alexander, Arius taught:</p>
<p>According to Millard Erickson, “the first of Arius’s assumptions was the absoluteness of God. By this is meant in part the singularity of God. He is the one and only, single and incomparable.” If it were true that Christ was God, then in Arius’s view, this would be dividing God into parts. Being both a monotheist (of a very strict form), and a believer that God is a simple Being (not made up of “parts”), Arius felt justified in asserting that logically, and ontologically, God was one Being, and only one Person.</p>
<p>Theologically, Arius’s view of creation shares strong parallels to both neo-Platonism and Gnosticism. Christ is seen as “governing the material universe on behalf of a still distant High God.” In Arius’s understanding of God’s “absoluteness”, he taught that God did not create matter directly, but via the Logos, this giving Christ the unique status as the only being created directly by God, yet subject to the Father. Gnosticism, in nearly all of its forms, always taught some form of dualism, that matter is inherently evil, and the spirit was inherently good. They taught that there had to be a process through which God created that world, because God is good, matter is evil, and good cannot create evil. This distinct view of transcendence is one of the foundational presuppositions of Arius’s thought.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"That God was not always the Father, but that there was a period when he was not the Father; that the Word of God was not from eternity, but was made out of nothing; for that the ever-existing God (‘the I AM’—the eternal One) made him who did not previously exist, out of nothing; wherefore there was a time when he did not exist, inasmuch as the Son is a creature and a work. That he is neither like the Father as it regards his essence, nor is by nature either the Father’s true Word, or true Wisdom, but indeed one of his works and creatures, being erroneously called Word and Wisdom, since he was himself made of God’s own Word and the Wisdom which is in God, whereby God both made all things and him also. Wherefore he is as to his nature mutable and susceptible of change, as all other rational creatures are: hence the Word is alien to and other than the essence of God; and the Father is inexplicable by the Son, and invisible to him, for neither does the Word perfectly and accurately know the Father, neither can he distinctly see him. The Son knows not the nature of his own essence: for he was made on our account, in order that God might create us by him, as by an instrument; nor would he ever have existed, unless God had wished to create us."</dd>
</dl>
<p>He states something similar in Thalia:</p>

<dd>“God has not always been Father; there was a moment when he was alone, and was not yet Father: later he became so. The Son is not from eternity; he came from nothing.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arius.html" title="Edit section: Arius's concept of Christ">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arius's concept of Christ</span></h3>
<p>This question of the exact relationship between the Father and the Son, a part of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christology</a>, had been raised some 50 years before Arius, when <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Samosata_1183.html" title="Paul of Samosata">Paul of Samosata</a> was deposed in AD <a href="../../../2/6/9/269.html" title="269">269</a> for his agreement with those who had used the word <a href="../../../o/u/s/Ousios.html" title="Ousios">homoousios</a> (Greek for same substance) to express the relation of the Father and the Son. The expression was at that time thought to have a <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabellianism.html" title="Sabellianism">Sabellian</a> tendency, though, as events showed, this was on account of its scope not having been satisfactorily defined. In the discussion which followed, <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysius_of_Alexandria_091d.html" title="Dionysius of Alexandria">Dionysius</a>, Patriarch of Alexandria, had used much the same language as Arius did later, and correspondence survives in which <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Dionysius_c595.html" title="Pope Dionysius">Pope Dionysius</a> blames his brother of Alexandria for using such language. Dionysius of Alexandria responded with an explanation, which posterity has been inclined to interpret as vacillating. So far as the earlier controversy could be said to have been decided, it was decided in favor of the opinions later championed by Arius. But this settlement was so unsatisfactory that the question would have been reopened sooner or later, especially in an atmosphere so intellectual as that of Alexandria. For the synod of Antioch which condemned Paul of Samosata had expressed its disapproval of the word <i>homoousios</i> in one sense, and Patriarch Alexander undertook its defense in another.</p>
<p>Arius formulated the following doctrines about <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>that the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logos.html" title="Logos">Logos</a> and the Father were not of the same essence (<i>ousia</i>);</li>
<li>that the Son was a created being (<i>ktisma</i> or <i>poiema</i>); and</li>
<li>that though He was the creator of the worlds, and must therefore have existed before them and before all time, there was a "time" [although Arius refused to use words meaning time, such as <i>chronos</i> or <i>aion</i>] when He did not exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>An early hymn that has being attributed to Arius clearly states his unique Christology:</p>
<p>'<b>The uncreated God has made the Son</b> A beginning of things created, And by adoption has God made the Son Into an advancement of Himself. Yet the Son’s substance is Removed from the substance of the Father: The Son is not equal to the Father, Nor does he share in the same substance. God is the all wise Father, And the Son is the teacher of His mysteries. The members of the Holy Trinity Share unequal glories.'</p>
<p>Likewise Arius states:</p>
<p><i>There was [a time] when God was alone, and was not yet Father, and afterward he became Father. The Son was not always. For, all things coming into being from not being, and all things created and made having begun to be, this logos or God also came into being from things not existing; and there was [a time] when he was not, and he was not before he was begotten, but he also had a beginning of being created.</i></p>
<p><br />
The subsequent controversy shows that Arius' avoidance of the words <i>chronos</i> and <i>aion</i> was adroit; when defending himself he clearly argued that there was a time when the Son did not exist. Moreover, he asserted that the Logos had a beginning. By way of contrast, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a> had taught that the relation of the Son to the Father had no beginning and that, to use Dorner's words (<i>Person of Christ</i>, ii. 115), "the generation of the Son is an eternally completed, and yet an eternally continued, act" – or in other words, the Father has, from all eternity, been communicating His Being to the Son, and is doing so still. However, Arius seems to have further support in his view as his is purely intellectual, whereas those claiming the eternity of the "begotten" (i.e. created, made, or produced) Son need textual revelation to back their belief, which they have not been able to gather.</p>
<p>Arius was obviously perplexed by this doctrine, for he complains of it in his letter to the Nicomedian Eusebius, who, like himself, had studied under Lucian. It is to be regretted that so much stress should have been laid in the controversy on words, but this is understood under the influence of Greek philosophical thought, with concepts such as "substance" that are alien to the Jewish religious experience of the Divine. Arius also contended that the Son was unchangeable (<i>atreptos</i>). But what he thus gave with the one hand he appears to have taken away with the other. For so far as we can understand his language on a subject which Athanasius seems to have admitted that it was beyond his power thoroughly to comprehend - he taught that the Logos was changeable in Essence, but not in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Will (philosophy)">Will</a>. The best authorities consider that he was driven to this concession by the force of circumstances. He was doubtless confirmed in his attitude by his fear of falling into Sabellianism. Bishop <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonius_I_of_Constantinople_44db.html" title="Macedonius I of Constantinople">Macedonius</a>, who had to a certain extent imbibed the opinions of Arius, certainly regarded the Son and the Spirit in much the same way that the Gnostic teachers regarded their aeons. Arius undoubtedly drew some support from the writings of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a>, who had made use of expressions which favored Arius's statement that the Logos was of a different substance to the Father, and that He owed His existence to the Father's will. But the speculations of Origen were then, as well as currently, considered as pioneer work in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>, often hazarded to stimulate further inquiry rather than to enable men to dispense with it. This explains why in this, as well as other controversies, the authority of Origen is so frequently invoked by both sides.</p>

<p>The Christian church had by this time become so powerful a force in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> world that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_of_the_Roman_Empire_864f.html" title="Constantine I of the Roman Empire">Constantine</a> found himself unable to keep aloof from the controversy. He therefore sent <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hosius_of_C%C3%B3rdoba_5c96.html" title="Hosius of Córdoba">Hosius, bishop of Córdoba</a>-the one who reportedly instructed him in the faith just before his march to Rome--to investigate and to put an end, if possible, to the controversy, armed with an open letter from the Emperor: "Wherefore let each one of you, showing consideration for the other, listen to the impartial exhortation of your fellow-servant." But as it continued to rage, Constantine took an unprecedented step: he called a council of delegates, summoned from all parts of the empire, to resolve this issue (possibly at Hosius' recommendation<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>).</p>
<p>All of the secular dioceses into which the empire had been divided, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Britain_2a7f.html" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a> only excepted, sent one or more representatives to the council, the majority of the bishops coming from the East. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Sylvester_I_141f.html" title="Pope Sylvester I">Pope Sylvester I</a>, himself too aged to be present, sent two presbyters as his delegates. Attending the conference, there was the already mentioned Eusebius of Nicomedia, and Alexander, patriarch of Alexandria. There was also the historian, <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius_of_Caesarea_fb99.html" title="Eusebius of Caesarea">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, as well as the young Athanasius, who was to eventually spend most of his life battling Arianism.</p>
<p>This was the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Council_of_Nicaea_a44c.html" title="First Council of Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>, which met in <a href="../../../3/2/5/325.html" title="325">325</a>, near Constantinople. Some twenty-two of the bishops at the council, led by Eusebius of Nicomedia, came as supporters of Arius. But when some of the passages from Arius' writings were read aloud, they are reported to have been denounced as blasphemous by most of the council participants.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Under the influence of Emperor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine.html" title="Constantine">Constantine</a>, the assembled bishops agreed upon a creed. This creed, which is known as the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_creed.html" title="Nicene creed">Nicene creed</a> specifically included the word homoousios--“consubstantial,” or “one in being,”-- which was incompatible with the beliefs of Arius.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> On June 19, 325, both council and emperor issued a circular letter to the churches in and around Alexandria. Arius and two unyielding supporters (Theonas, and Secundus <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>) were deposed and exiled to Illyricum, while three other bishops, who had also been supportive of Arius, namely Eusebius of Nicomedia, Theognis of Nicaea, and Maris of Chalcedon, were unwilling signatories of the document, but affixed their signatures in deference to the emperor. However, Constantine found some reason to suspect the sincerity of Eusebius of Nicomedia, as well as that of Theognis and Maris, for he soon after included them in the sentence pronounced on Arius. Eusebius of Caesarea defended himself in a letter as having objected to the changes in the creed which he had originally presented, but finally accepted them in the interests of peace (Theod. H. E. i. 12).</p>

<p>That the apparent public unanimity of the council (Secundus and Theonas of Lower Egypt being the only dissenters) masked a considerable amount of divergent opinion is indisputable. Doubts over the use of a term which had been previously denounced as Sabellian weighed on the minds of many. Eusebius of Caesarea has been charged by many later writers as having embraced Arianism. But his moderate attitude throughout the following period suggests that his objections to the decision, which he allowed his love of peace to overrule, owed more to the dread of possible consequences than to the decision in itself. And his allusion to the proceedings at Nicaea in the letter just mentioned shows that his apprehensions were not altogether unreasonable. For he remarks how the final consensus emerged after considerable discussion that the term <i>homoousion</i> was not intended to indicate that the Son formed an actual portion of the Father - which would have been Sabellianism pure and simple, a fear which fed much of the dissension to the adoption of the creed. On the other hand, Athanasius was convinced that unless the essence of the Son was definitely understood to be the same as that of the Father, it would inevitably follow that the Son would at best be no more than the highest of a series of Gnostic aeons.</p>
<p>The homoousian party's victory at Nicaea was short-lived, however. The controversy recommenced as soon as the decrees were promulgated. When Alexander died at Alexandria in <a href="../../../3/2/7/327.html" title="327">327</a>, the election of Athanasius in his place was secured despite his not meeting the age requirement for a bishop. Soon after, Eusebius of Nicomedia was reinstated in his see, after having written a diplomatic letter to the emperor. Arius, who had taken refuge in Palestine, was also soon permitted to return, after reformulating his Christology in an effort to mute the ideas his opponents found most objectionable. It was not long before the Nicomedian Eusebius regained his influence with the emperor, which led to a complete reversal of the position of the contending parties. <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustathius_of_Antioch_ffd8.html" title="Eustathius of Antioch">Eustathius of Antioch</a>, one of the staunchest supporters of Athanasius, was deposed. If <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodoret.html" title="Theodoret">Theodoret</a> is to be trusted, one of his accusers, when seized by a serious illness, retracted her accusation in a sensational manner. But <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates_Scholasticus_7d60.html" title="Socrates Scholasticus">Socrates Scholasticus</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/z/Sozomen.html" title="Sozomen">Sozomen</a> are reticent about the nature of the charges, and only tell us that Eustathius had been unfortunate enough to get involved in a controversy with Eusebius of Caesarea. Marcellus of Ancyra was the next victim, a friend and champion of Athanasius, found it impossible to defend the Nicene decisions without falling into Sabellianism; he was deposed in <a href="../../../3/3/6/336.html" title="336">336</a>. In the meantime, Eusebius of Nicomedia turned against obdurate Athanasius. Following Arius' restoration to the emperor's favor, the emperor commanded Athanasius to readmit Arius to communion. Athanasius refused - leading to accusations of treason against the emperor.</p>
<p>Athanasius was exiled to <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trier.html" title="Trier">Trier</a>, and Alexander of Constantinople was ordered to receive Arius back into communion. Alexander dared not disobey the command, but he was opposed to Arius' reinstatement. He requested the prayers of his fellow Nicene Christians that either he or Arius might be removed from the world before the latter was admitted to communion. The prayer was, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Wace_f727.html" title="Henry Wace">Henry Wace</a> notes, a strange one. Meanwhile, Arius was summoned before the emperor and found to be suitably compliant. And yet, the very day before he was to be set out from Constantinople to Alexandria, Arius is reported to have died suddenly. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates_Scholasticus_7d60.html" title="Socrates Scholasticus">Socrates Scholasticus</a> describes his death thus:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was then Saturday, and . . . going out of the imperial palace, attended by a crowd of Eusebian [Eusebius of Nicomedia is meant] partisans like guards, he [Arius] paraded proudly through the midst of the city, attracting the notice of all the people. As he approached the place called Constantine's Forum, where the column of porphyry is erected, a terror arising from the remorse of conscience seized Arius, and with the terror a violent relaxation of the bowels: he therefore enquired whether there was a convenient place near, and being directed to the back of Constantine's Forum, he hastened thither. Soon after a faintness came over him, and together with the evacuations his bowels protruded, followed by a copious hemorrhage, and the descent of the smaller intestines: moreover portions of his spleen and liver were brought off in the effusion of blood, so that he almost immediately died. The scene of this catastrophe still is shown at Constantinople, as I have said, behind the shambles in the colonnade: and by persons going by pointing the finger at the place, there is a perpetual remembrance preserved of this extraordinary kind of death.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Arius' death has been interpreted as <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracle.html" title="Miracle">miraculous</a> in answer to Athanasius' prayer, as the result of poisoning or as mere coincidence.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
