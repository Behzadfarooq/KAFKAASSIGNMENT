<p>I see this: "Among the few remaining works credited to him are his letter to Alexander of Alexandria, his letter to Eusebius, and Thalia, a popularized work combining prose and verse." Do we have a link to the Thalia? Someone present a link to it because I haven't been able to find it (other than commentary by Athanasius et al on it, which is not the same). If this is not true, and we do not have copies of the Thalia, then this needs to be changed. 24.247.157.122 23:41, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that the statement might be misleading to some who reading: "Among the few REMAINING works credited to him" suppose that the original manuscripts remain. This is not true. (However, are there ANY original manuscripts of ANY ante-nicene Father?) The works only "remain" as copies which many researchers and historians consider as "preserving" then. For example Harnak says: "The fragments of the Thalia and the two letters of Arius which have <b>been preserved</b> are amongst the most important sources". But when he says that he is not talking about manuscripts written by Arius but about copies of these texts that are found in various dialogs and criticisms. This is a bit like the words of Celsus. We can reconstruct a great deal of his anti-Christian writings by editing them from the work <i>Contra Celsus</i>. In the case of Arius, much of the commentary by Athanasius is considered skewed and biased. However, one substantial section is considered by most historians to be an honest and relatively complete quote. That commentary is the source of what remains of the Thalia. The letters of Arius are also quoted by others and are considered genuine. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_64_f296.html" title="User:Anon 64">Anon 64</a> 02:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that does not seem simpler. It is wordier. But the more important question is, "Is it more accurate?" (we could work on wordiness later). It doesn't seem to be more accurate according to historians. They do not describe it as the "rendition" of anyone. They believe that the non-fragmentary parts are accurate transcriptions or recordings of Arius' writing.</dd>

<dd>It appears to me that nearly every one of the concerns you have raised deal with the problem that there are no original manuscripts and that all we know of Arius springs from the writings of his adversaries. This is the point of the caveat section called "Historical Sources". If this section is not sufficiently strong enough or worded correctly, perhaps that is where you should focus your attention. This will produce a much cleaner article than quoting a source and then denying that source immediately every time we want to say something about Arius. However, you must keep even that caveat clear of POV. It is ok to say, for example: All of our information about Arius is suspect because it comes from the writings of his opponents." but you should also provide the other side of the coin: "Most historians believe that some of his works, particularly his letters and fragments of Thalia have been reported correctly and these are the sources that this biography relies upon". This lets the reader know both sides and decide how they want to take it.</dd>

<dd>I am curious -- do you agree that with the next comment that this article inherits too much anti-Arius bias from the sources? Or do you think that it is, as someone else has said "Too Anti-Catholic"? Frankly, I do not see it as either anti-arius or anti-catholic, but it is a little bit pro-arius. If you are curious about my POV, I think both Arius and his opponents were wrong. I also think Arius was not the originator of his ideas but was, instead, the first vocal, eloquent and somewhat systematic expounder upon the concepts. Hope that helps you see that I do not carry the "orthodox" biases that you have imagined of me. I just want wikipedia to be a good encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_64_f296.html" title="User:Anon 64">Anon 64</a> 13:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Seems to me this page needs a little balance. I think this article inherits too much anti-Arius bias from the sources.

<dd>Well, as the person who wrote the original article, I invite you to make the necessary changes to make this article more NPOV.

<p>Is it me or does it seem like people keep copying and pasting/plagiarising from excessively dry and boring copy in some text books? Is there something wrong with writing copy that is original and fresh, while accurate? 24.247.157.122 00:33, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Additionally; someone keeps copying and pasting third party material (Carroll), one point of view in this hot debate; we have access to original materials, why are we posting some third party's original material when we have access to the same original texts as these 'scholars'? 24.247.157.122 05:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think you might be new here, so I am including some references to Wikipedia policies. If you do not like these policies you should seek to change them</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is nothing wrong with quoting a source like Carroll. Wikipedia expressly forbids original research by policy. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> states: "Articles may not contain any unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas; or any new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas that serves to advance a position." For that reason we must use other sources for information. This is appropriate and when we use other sources we must cite them per <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. To you this may be plagiarism but that is how it is on Wikipedia. But you are free to cite better sources!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore this is not a hot "debate" either. You are simply removing content without justification. You have not debated. You have not offered any reason for your changes. You are just reverting. Repeatedly deleting content without justification is very little more than vandalism <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAN_11b1.html" title="WP:VAN">WP:VAN</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, concerns of plagiarism are NOT Valid for edits. A concern about copyright might be (it would depend upon whether copyright was actually violated). See <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a>. A concern that the content is incorrect would be valid. Maybe you feel that somehow the words you are deleting are wrong. Then describe what is wrong with them and show your case. A concern about non-neutral point of view is also valid. Not sure how you can have a neutral point of view since we have NO INFORMATION about Arius except that which comes from his enemies, but if you have such a complaint then make it and SHOW YOUR SOURCES. Your information must be verifiable per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and from reliable published sources per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The policy on Wikipedia is that if there is a problem with point of view, both views are given space to provide balance. See <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. If your concern is about the style of writing, well I have already pointed out that the style is a bit dense and needs re-working, but that should not be at the cost of DELETING information. 64.178.145.150 13:41, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. I was the one who put the quotes from Carroll. I was reading the book at that time and I thought they might be useful for Wikipedia. I'm not a historian; I didn't really think there was anything specially significant about the quotes; the book just happened to be the one I was reading. From what I read in the guidelines, sources for Wikipedia are generally secondary. But if you have primary sources, that would also be cool.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENino_Gonzales_a8be.html" title="User:Nino Gonzales">Nino Gonzales</a> 03:25, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is bias? Bias is Theodosius telling his followers to destroy the Library of Alexandria; we wonder why the texts are so sparse from that time and why it is such a revelation when we find a text buried in the sand... Bias is that z-factor that throws what would otherwise be the case off. In this case bias is a large number of partisans who do not like history or for that matter reality and would like to rewrite it- just as Theodosius managed to rewrite it. 24.247.157.122 01:38, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just as in the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> page, cases of '[all]Christians believe in the Trinity' has been replaced with 'most Christians believe in the Trinity' because doing otherwise presents a de-facto picture of Christianity that is misleading.

<p>Ok. you claim that the historical bias is presented as "de-facto". Can you show the bias and can you show the correct, objective view? What sources will you use that demonstrate the correct view? As an aside, please note that some critics of this article have said that it is too "Pro-catholic".

<p>I think that the article in general terms is above the regular ones about this incredible man. Certainly lacks some important points as quoting Gibbon (Rome Decline and Fall) which balances pretty well the image of this great man, which by the chord has been so infamated,think to add a little information.Emmanuel</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree with Gwimpey and am drafting my own rewrite. Wikipedia should not judge between religious doctrines; it should present them as fairly as possible. This article states (1) that Arius originated the teachings in question (Arius and later Arians claimed otherwise) (2) that Arius taught 'heresy' 'errors' etc. (Arius and later Arians would consider these good, or at worst mediocre, doctrine) (3) Nicaea was 'necessary in itself and satisfactory in the end' (including the anathemas?). (4) It declares Athanasius 'right' and refers to his 'triumphant vindication'. (5) It reserves different language for the political and theological troubles facing Arian vs. Nicean groups. (Arius as 'heretic' and Marcellus as 'victim'). (6) It celebrates and glorifies the poisoning of Arius. Wikipedia should not call for the murder of religious dissidents.</p>
<p>I suggest dividing this article in two; one half would discuss Arius and the other half would discuss (old) Arianism, from Lucian onwards. - Jacob Haller</p>
<hr />
<p>The Catholic religion itself suffices many examples for the call of the murder of religious dissidents, and who can deny that is exactly the history of Catholicism? Catholicism was born in blood, its words are written in blood, and its true history is a Tsunami of blood, and anyone who discovers this self evident truth is often branded a "heretic" whom, according to Catholic doctrine, it is lawful to murder. I tell you plainly, Christ is going to destroy it - not man - because it makes war with the Lamb of God, and hides the truth, and just as God destroyed Israel for perverting His name, so too will He destroy Catholicism for perverting his Son's name.</p>
<p>Jesus warned Simon Peter that Satan desired to have him, but that he prayed for him. It is as certain as death itself.</p>
<p>The whole book of Revelation is written about the destruction of Catholicism and its blatant heresies to the Word of God, such as making "tradition" equal to the Word of God. The Jews did the exact same thing and Jesus bitterly condemned them saying, "By your tradition you nullify the commandment of God." So I suppose now that I too am a "heretic" whom it is lawful to murder. Satan is rather ingenious in granting the license of iniquity in the name of God and Jesus. The Plagues are coming, and if what I have said is not the truth, then it doesn't matter. If what I said is the truth, then nothing else matters. You have been officially warned. Make of it what you will, but don't blame me. If the Catholics must employ the "sword of just defense" (actually a Calvinist quote), then I say those who live by the sword must be killed by the sword, but it isn't man wielding this sword, but Jesus who has returned to establish the Kingdom of God on Earth.</p>
<p>Let the Satanists and his decievers beware, for your day of judgement comes, and there isn't a god in the Universe that is going to save you from the Great and Terrible day of the Lord.</p>
<p>Again, if what I have said is not the truth, then it doesn't matter and Catholicism will continue building the "New World Order" with the Pope ruling earth as the Vicar of God (another official Catholic Doctrine). If what I said is the truth, then nothing but an exodus from the perversions of Catholcism will save the converts of St. Peter, for John the Revelator said:</p>
<p>"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Revelation 18:4</p>
<p>We have the advantage of a point of view that the Prophets did not have. They were prophesying from their present time looking forward into the future as to what must come to pass for the Kingdom of God to be established on Earth. We have the vantage point of now looking back, and can, from that point of reference, determine where we are. [written on 11:45, 9 Jan 2005 by anon IP 207.144.224.193]</p>

<p>Why was this section so hastily removed: Disclaimer - Any modern history of Arius life must be taken with some grain of salt. As all written record of Arius has been destroyed over the past millenia by his opponents in the Catholic Church, who deem him heretical, and most current histories preserved of him have been preserved through the Catholic Church, indirect analysis of texts seems to present the best view to that time. Scholars are already aware of a number of historical forgeries created in the Early Catholic Church's period of dissent to support their theological position. Analyzing texts then with a keen awareness of the authors of those texts, and with a grain of salt that the texts may have been modified, can help in historically reconstructing a picture of Arius and his world.</p>

<p>I will give a brief and simple summary of Arius' doctrine. His basic concept is that Christ was not a God of supernatural origins but a man. A man, however, so spirtually perfect that God "adopted" him as his son. Thus he is the son of God through his total commitment to a spiritual life embodied by such virtues as; love, peace, charity...and UNCONDITIONAL FORGIVENESS (A quality which few self-proclaimed Christians on this discussion page seem to possess).

<p>In the opening paragraph of the article I recently replaced "...which some Christian sects regard as a heresy" with "...which most Christian churches regard as a heresy", which I believe to be a more accurate statement.</p>
<p>This statement has recently been changed to "...which Roman Catholic descended Christian churches regard as a heresy". Why? Arius' views are also rejected by the Greek Orthodox church, so the modified text seems unnecessarily restrictive. (And to regard the Greek Orthodox church as a "Roman Catholic descended" is problematic.) -- <a href="../../../o/z/1/User%7EOz1cz_d3ca.html" title="User:Oz1cz">oz1cz</a> 11:26, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The problem is that when we start saying ambiguous terms like 'most' people have edit wars about the erelative numbers; first question, what constitutes a Christian Church? Second, now that you have arbitrarily determined the definition of a Christian Church, have you polled that dataset to see what the results are? Either question is ambiguous and loaded. The idea is that everything descended from the formalized Church that Emperor Constantine I endorsed has been affected. Also, note that the Eastern Orthodox church does not agree with the Roman Catholic church in the sense that they do not have a common Easter, another of the Nicaean tenets. 69.51.152.226 17:10, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
First, I agree that "most" is often a difficult word to prove. However, in this case there is little doubt that it is a correct term. One billion Catholics easily qualify as "most Christians". Although, admittedly, not as "most Christian <i>Churches</i>".</p>
<p>Secondly, the "Church that Emperor Constantine I endorsed" is not the same as the Roman Catholic church. The schism between the Roman Catholic church and the Greek Orthodox church did not occur until several centuries after Constantine I. This means that the text as it stands can be interpreted to mean that the Greek Orthodox church is not opposed to Arianism.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the fact that Greek Orthodox Easter falls on another date than the Roman Catholic Easter is a result of the Gregorian calendar reform and has <i>nothing</i> to do with the attitude of the churches towards Arianism.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the very least, the wording should include the Greek Orthodox church, and I would suggest words along these lines: "...which mainstream Christian churches regard as a heresy" or "...which churches descended from the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches regard as a heresy". (The expression "Roman Catholic descended Christian churches" is also a rather unwieldy expression; but that's another point.) --<a href="../../../o/z/1/User%7EOz1cz_d3ca.html" title="User:Oz1cz">Oz1cz</a> 18:23, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about just adding a new section listing all the branches of Christianity that specifically reject Arian beliefs? I'm a Lutheran and I know our creed and history, but not many others do... I think it would be helpful for most of my fellow pew-sitters if they came upon this article they would see not just "most Christians" nor "Roman Catholic descended Christian churches" (because frankly most still wouldn't know if Lutherans qualify in either of those statements), but an official list where it says that Lutherans as well as many other branches do reject this notion... followed by a list of all the branches that accept it. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 21:40, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For some reason this article attracts a lot of anti-Catholic attention. In any case, from about the 4th century until the 19th (at latest), no avowedly Christian group agreed with Arius' definition of Christ -- one of the few things all Christian groups <i>did</i> agree on. However, in recent times a number of sects -- Jehovah Witnesses, Mormons, &amp; perhaps Unitarians -- have since adopted a Christology that is identical to what Arius is believed to have professed. (I find it facinating that the difficulties of forcing ancient Greek scientific concepts onto theology is still an unresolved issue today.&#160;;-) -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:37, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi David, I am also Lutheran. I never had any problem reciting and believing the Nicene Creed, but maybe I never understood it the way Arius's enemies understood it. If my pastor had said to me, "The creed means that Jesus isn't the son of God, he's more like the twin brother of God, and if anyone says otherwise we'll run him out of town and burn his books" then I would not have agreed with the Nicene Creed. Jesus made it very clear that he is the son of God, not the brother. --WillJ 70.168.185.11 04:22, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a Roman Catholic, I have questioned the Churches Doctrine of the Trinity for most of my life and have always been criticized and threatened with excommunication. Last year, I wrote a ten page letter and had it printed over ten weeks as a paid advertisement criticizing the brlief the Jesus was divine and that his mother, Mary, was the mother of God.</p>
<p>I have researched Scripture and I am currently working on twenty-five letters which appear Monday Through Friday beginning five weeks before Good Friday and ending on Good Friday. The letters will appear daily as a paid advertisement. I fully expect that the Priests of the Church will attempt to inform their parishioners that they are not to read the letters.</p>
<p>One of the issues that is covered in the letters is the position of Arius with which I fully agree. In addition, the letter will also include the excommunication of Nestorius for criticizing the dogma calling Mary the mother of God.</p>

<p>Proper use of ellipses is not "misquot[ing]" Socrates. (In fact, the quoted <i>translation</i> makes use of ellipses before my emendation.) I edited the comment about "a terror arising from the remorse of conscience" because Socrates could not possibly have known Arius' psychological state; Socrates' comment is clearly an unsupported attack on the character of Arius and does not belong in a neutral article concerning him.

<dd>I agree that proper use of ellipses is reasonable in quotes. But the word "proper" is important in that sentence. One should not remove content to eliminate meaning but rather to focus on the point and purpose. Sometimes, quotes may contain unrelated material that comes in commentary, or there may be an introductory phrase that is separated from the main passage by a section that is not particularly related. Other than that though, ellipses are not "proper".</dd>

<dd>I agree that Socrates probably did not know this, but I do not agree that he could not possibly know. We do not know what Socrates knew or did not know.

However, (Neutrality) does not require that we must decide this. We must only report what Socrates said. We let the reader decide.

<p>I agree that there POV issues with sections of this article, and a re-write (or at least some pretty big revision) doesn't seem like the worst idea. However, I disagree about the use of the words "heresy" and "orthodox." When used by themselves, with no qualification, then yes, POV. But I feel that both are perfectly acceptable when defined and given context; e.g., "arianism was declared to be heresy by the council of Nicaea." Personally, I find it harder to give that sort of context to "orthodoxy" without sounding clunky, but would not object to that use of the word if I saw it. Just my own 2 cents. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 22:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a>, and also: what's so bad being a heretic? Heresy is worse in the minds of those selfdeclared "orthodoxes", than in the mind of those labeled "heretics". (Excepting possible persecutions from Sir Righteous, of course). <a href="../../../r/u/r/User%7ERursus_4815.html" title="User:Rursus">Rursus</a> 23:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To call something orthodox is literally to call it correct teaching, or to call it true, and to call something unorthodox, let alone heretical, is therefore to call it un-true. AFAIK, wikipedia policy in theological debates is to present the beliefs and history of each side, and not to say that one side was right or that the other sides were wrong. Declaring someone orthodox or heretical is POV. Jacob Haller 00:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll agree with you on "heretical", but not on "orthodox". While "heretic" and its variations tend to carry negative connotations (akin to the more modern "cultist"), "orthodox" simply has come to mean mainstream or standard. This is especially true in theology and religion where people both casually and academically refer to "orthodox Christianity" (small "o"). "Unorthodox" in common speech simply refers to an unusual, or non-standard, manner or action. So, you have my support that "heretic"/"heresy" is POV, "orthodox" is a perfectly acceptable and oft-used expression for the mainstream. However, I will even qualify my agreement on "heretic" by saying when used by, particularly Arian's critics, the word is appropriate so long as the context is clear. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 16:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
