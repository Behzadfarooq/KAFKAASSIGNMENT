<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariobarzan.html" title="Edit section: Family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family</span></h2>
<p>Ariobarzan, known as Ariobarzanes-II (Old Persian: Ariyabrdna-II) and also as Artabazus II, was a descendant of <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharnabazus.html" title="Pharnabazus">Pharnabazus</a>, who was the son of an Iranian nobleman. In 387 BC, Pharnabazus was a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satrap.html" title="Satrap">Satrap</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> of Hellespontine Phrygia in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, (the northwest of present-day <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>). It should be noted that Pharnabazus cultivated the friendship of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> and, about 366 BC, led an unsuccessful revolt of the satraps of western Anatolia against the Achamenian King <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artaxerxes_II_6615.html" title="Artaxerxes II">Artaxerxes II</a> (reigned 404-359 BC). Pharnabazus, however, maintained his friendship with the King, greatly complied with his commands, and preserved his position as a satrap until he died in 360 BC.</p>
<p>Out of the marriage of Pharnabazus and lady Apamea, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariobarzanes_I_of_Cius_6730.html" title="Ariobarzanes I of Cius">Ariobarzanes I of Cius</a> was born, who later also became a satrap. Ariobarzanes I was betrayed by his son, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithridates_I_of_Cius_bdcc.html" title="Mithridates I of Cius">Mithridates I of Cius</a>, and was crucified in 362 or 363 BC. Then, his half-brother, Artabazus, succeeded him. Artabazus (389-325 BC) was also an Iranian nobleman who had a respectable position in the court of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darius_III_Codomannus_0f19.html" title="Darius III Codomannus">Darius III Codomannus</a> or D3C (reigned 336-330 BC), the last king of <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaemenid_Dynasty_b0db.html" title="Achaemenid Dynasty">Achaemenid Dynasty</a>. Ario Barzan was the son of this Artabazus.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariobarzan.html" title="Edit section: Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life</span></h2>
<p>Though the exact birth-date of Ario Barzan is unknown, it is speculated that he was born around 368 BC. Any research work on the early life of Ario Barzan is a very complicated task and requires time and space. However, it is well documented that Ario Barzanwas the satrap of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persis.html" title="Persis">Persis</a> (the southern province of <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fars.html" title="Fars">Fars</a> in present-day <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>) in 335 BC. For many researchers it is surprising that D3C had appointed a satrap for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persepolis.html" title="Persepolis">Persepolis</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persis.html" title="Persis">Persis</a>. It seems that previously, this office did not exist, and it is possible that <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darius_III_bf77.html" title="Darius III">Darius III</a>, who had come to power in a period of some social problems in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, needed a reliable man at home while he was away, fighting against the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonians_5139.html" title="Ancient Macedonians">Ancient Macedonians</a> at <a href="../../../i/s/s/Issus.html" title="Issus">Issus</a> (an ancient town close to present-day <a href="../../../i/s/k/%C4%B0skenderun_1be4.html" title="İskenderun">İskenderun</a> in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>) in 333 BC, and at <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaugamela.html" title="Gaugamela">Gaugamela</a> (a flat plain near ancient town of Tel-Gomel east of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosul.html" title="Mosul">Mosul</a> in northern part of present-day <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>) in 331 BC. If this is correct, Ario Barzan must have been a close relative or a personal friend of King Darius. It is also speculated that the only reason for his appointment as the satrap of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persis.html" title="Persis">Persis</a> was due to the fact that he was a very strong supporter of Darius.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariobarzan.html" title="Edit section: Battles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battles</span></h2>
<p>As many <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historians.html" title="Historians">historians</a> documented, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranians</a> fought bravely at <a href="../../../i/s/s/Issus.html" title="Issus">Issus</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaugamela.html" title="Gaugamela">Gaugamela</a>, but were unable to prevent <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a> victories, and Alexander proceeded to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susa.html" title="Susa">Susa</a> in 331 BC. A <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Road_8dbb.html" title="Royal Road">Royal Road</a> connected <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susa.html" title="Susa">Susa</a> (the first Iranian federal capital city in <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elam.html" title="Elam">Elam</a>) with the more eastern capitals of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persepolis.html" title="Persepolis">Persepolis</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasargadae.html" title="Pasargadae">Pasargadae</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persis.html" title="Persis">Persis</a>, and that was the road for Alexander to take. Meanwhile, King Darius was building a new army at <a href="../../../e/c/b/Ecbatana.html" title="Ecbatana">Ecbatana</a> (western province of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamadan.html" title="Hamadan">Hamadan</a> in present-day <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>). It was obvious that Alexander wanted to reach the treasures of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persepolis.html" title="Persepolis">Persepolis</a> before Darius could defend them. Ario Barzan had to prevent the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a> attack on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persis.html" title="Persis">Persis</a>, and had two advantages: in the first place, he commanded people who were defending their homes and were very motivated; in the second place, he knew the terrain and the topography of the place. There were only a few possible roads through the <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagros.html" title="Zagros">Zagros</a> Mountains, which were at the time, in January 330, covered with snow and ice. And Ario Barzan knew how to exploit this.</p>
<p>When Alexander invaded an unknown country, he usually divided his forces to diminish the risks and facilitate the food supply. Ario Barzan must have learned from his spies that in the area of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masjed_Soleyman_0071.html" title="Masjed Soleyman">Masjed Soleyman</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a> army had been split into two parts. Alexander's general, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parmenion.html" title="Parmenion">Parmenion</a>, took one half along the Royal Road, and Alexander himself took the route towards Persis. Ario Barzan knew where he could trap his main opponent: in the Persian Gate (in Persian: Darvaazeh Fars), northeast of modern <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasuj.html" title="Yasuj">Yasuj</a> (the capital of <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohkiluyeh_and_Buyer_Ahmad_Province_869c.html" title="Kohkiluyeh and Buyer Ahmad Province">Kohkiluyeh and Buyer Ahmad Province</a> in present-day <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>).<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> And if Ario Barzan could have defeated Alexander in that Gate, he could turn to the south and attack Parmenion as well.</p>
<p>Alexander first massacred a mountain tribe named Uxians, and believed that after this deed, everyone would flee.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>Indeed, at the so-called Susian Gate, west of Yasuj, no one appeared to block the road. Believing that he would not encounter any problems in the Persian Gate either, Alexander forgot to send scouts into the pass and walked into Ario Barzan's trap with his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>The satrap had occupied a position near the little village that is now known as Cheshmeh Chenar. When one approaches this place from the west, the valley, called Tang'e Meyran, is initially very wide, so the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> marched at some speed. But Ariobarzan knew what he was doing. After an hour's walk, the valley becomes narrower, and curves to the east-southeast, where the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> were blinded by the morning sun. Immediately after they had crossed an icy brook, they would had to turn to the left, where Ario Barzan was ready to strike against an army that was standing on slippery ground, pushed forward by its rearguard, and under attack from all hilltops.</p>

<p>Some sources mention that Ario Barzan had built a wall across the canyon, but he probably did not have to. The Persian Gate was only a couple of meters wide. However this may be, at some point, the first group of Macedonian invaders must have realized that they could no longer advance, understood that they were ambushed, and hesitated. This was the moment Ario Barzan had been waiting for. One signal was sufficient to convert the valley into a killing zone. From the northern slope, the Iranians rained down boulders and stones on the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a>, who were smashed away not individually, but -as <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quintus_Curtius_Rufus_46c5.html" title="Quintus Curtius Rufus">Quintus Curtius Rufus</a> says- by entire platoons. From the southern slope, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> archers and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catapult.html" title="Catapult">catapults</a> launched their projectiles. The <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> panicked, tried to return, but were unable to do so, because their rear guard was still advancing. It must have taken some time before Alexander's men were in full retreat.</p>
<p>Ario Barzan knew that the battle was not over yet. It was likely that Alexander would try again next day, or would try to take another road. This, however, would be dangerous. From <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasuj.html" title="Yasuj">Yasuj</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> could go to the north, to Gabae (which is now called <a href="../../../i/s/f/Isfahan_Province_dce8.html" title="Isfahan Province">Isfahan</a> or Espahan, a central province in present-day <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>)), where they would trap themselves between the army of Darius in <a href="../../../e/c/b/Ecbatana.html" title="Ecbatana">Ecbatana</a> and that of Ario Barzan in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persis.html" title="Persis">Persis</a>. Alternatively, they could go to the south and join <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parmenion.html" title="Parmenion">Parmenion</a>, trapping themselves between Ario Barzan's army and another Iranian army existed there. Given these facts, the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a> had some reason to believe that their success could change the course of the war. Alexander could not move to the north or south, but would have to retreat or try for a second time. It is documented that Alexander considered all options and finally he decided to send a message to Ario Barzan offering him a position as a Field Marshal of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> army if Ario Barzan would surrender. Ario Barzan refused and declared that he would fight to death to protect <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> and his countrymen.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariobarzan.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>After 48 days of fighting, an <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian</a> tribal chief, regrettably, betrayed his homeland and guided Alexander through the mountains to the rear of Ario Barzan's lines. That was how Alexander managed to defeat the Iranians and subjugate the <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaemenid_Empire_8fe1.html" title="Achaemenid Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>. It is reported that shortly after Alexander reached the rear of Ario Barzan's lines, the Iranian hero also became under attack from the north (by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philotas.html" title="Philotas">Philotas</a>), and from the west (by <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craterus.html" title="Craterus">Craterus</a>). Many Iranians were massacred. Ario Barzan and his loyal army battled bravely against the invaders, but in the end returned to Persepolis, where the garrison commander refused to let him in, hoping to negotiate favorable terms with the Macedonian conquerors.</p>
<p>Alexander then reached the Palaces of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persepolis.html" title="Persepolis">Persepolis</a>, and appointed a man named Phrasaortes as successor of ARB. Four months later, the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> burned the historical Palaces of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persepolis.html" title="Persepolis">Persepolis</a> down.</p>
