<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianne.html" title="Edit section: Development Goals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Development Goals</span></h2>
<p>Arianne has been in development since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> and has evolved from a tiny application written in pseudo-C++ to a powerful, expandable, and simple server framework running on the <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_platform.html" title="Java platform">Java platform</a> and a portable client framework written in bare C to allow total <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portability.html" title="Portability">portability</a> of Arianne's clients. Arianne's server is totally client <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a>. Since the beginning, the key concept at the heart of Arianne's <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_engineering.html" title="Software engineering">development</a> has been <a href="../../../k/i/s/KISS_principle_ef68.html" title="KISS principle">KISS</a>: Keep it simple, stupid!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianne.html" title="Edit section: Open Source philosophy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Open Source philosophy</span></h2>
<p>Arianne has always been an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> project, written and released under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU">GNU</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Public_License_ea2c.html" title="General Public License">General Public License</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianne.html" title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The name came from <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariadne.html" title="Ariadne">Ariadne</a>, a <a href="../../../g/o/d/Goddess.html" title="Goddess">goddess</a> of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>; Arianna and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>; Arianne). Ariadne was the daughter of King <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minos.html" title="Minos">Minos</a> of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>. She was in love with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theseus.html" title="Theseus">Theseus</a>, an Athenian hero who killed the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minotaur.html" title="Minotaur">Minotaur</a> (half human, half bull creature). However, Theseus left her alone on the island of <a href="../../../n/a/x/Naxos%2C_Greece_0613.html" title="Naxos, Greece">Naxos</a>, where she later married <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> (the god of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wine.html" title="Wine">wine</a>). "Ari" means intelligent and "adnis" means pure (virginal); hence, the daughters of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Romans</a> and Greeks were often called by this name.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianne.html" title="Edit section: The beginning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The beginning</span></h3>
<p>It all began when Miguel read a post on Linuxgames asking "What I'd like to see in an RPG". Miguel saw the post and, unaware of pre-existing <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">RPGs</a> for <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> such as <a href="../../../n/e/t/NetHack_36fc.html" title="NetHack">NetHack</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossfire_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Crossfire (computer game)">Crossfire</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altima.html" title="Altima">Altima</a>, decided to fill the gap he thought was there.</p>
<p>So, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_27.html" title="July 27">July 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, someone posted what they would have like to have seen in such a game:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Something in line with your thoughts is my concept of a sort of Sim Fantasy game setting for an RPG. That is, a great deal of effort is done to create a fantasy world that runs logically in a simulated sort of way, from politics to economics to monster populations, and then let the player interact with that. You decide you want to become King of Generia? Perform services for a lord until he knights you, then work your way up the noble ranks by marriage, heroism, warfare or deceit. Or become a necromancer, build up a huge undead army and attack the kingdom, making yourself ruler when they are defeated. A game that simulated the sort of thing you see in a generic fantasy world is what I'm thinking of here, not an exact medaevil life sim. Incursions of dragons, adventurers stirring up the goblins in the hills with their attacks, an ancient evil awakened by careless nomads in the desert, you name it, it could happen.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>If you wanted to get really ambitious, the entire world might be random. Use a world creator, run a crude form of Civilization on it until you hit the right tech level, expand upon the basic parameters from the Civ simulation to create the individual lands, peoples, and nations. Populate it with random NPCs, run the world for 100 years or so to give it a bit of history, and bingo. The advantage of this approach is that the game would be infinitely playable. The obvious disadvantage is that it would be hard to get anything like a coherent story out of the game without some pretty sophisticated story mechanics in place.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Think if it as "Rogue" on a much larger scale. Heh.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Miguel replied asking for more details and became very interested in the idea. Around one month later the project page was setup and Miguel started looking for help from the community:</p>

First version of Arianne</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A short declaration from that time of what Arianne should be:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>What is Arianne? Arianne is an RPG project that will have the next set of features:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Infinite World</i></li>
<li><i>Online gameplay</i></li>
<li><i>Permanent world</i></li>
<li><i>Non-hardcoded RPG engine</i></li>
<li><i>Open development model of items</i></li>
<li><i>Portable</i></li>
<li><i>The most important part of the game is the offline one.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ideas to add to project:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Depending on the path of the player or NPC, it will do or be able to do some actions insteads of others, and as a result there will never be two identical games.</i></li>
<li><i>Every NPC will have a story, ascendants, a set of goals and a personality, so there are no two exact NPCs.</i></li>
<li><i>Items are added to the program using an interpreted language that eases its load and that makes it independent of the operating system where the server runs.</i></li>
<li><i>Game will is ruled by laws, economical relations between states, political relations, weather, geography and so on.</i></li>
<li><i>To advance on experience points you don't need to kill, but to role-play.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>At the time this was written, Java, Python, and <a href="../../../x/m/l/XML_3501.html" title="XML">XML</a> either were unknown to the developers or were not very popular in general.</p>
<p>The official start day of the project was <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_8.html" title="September 8">September 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. On this day, an entirely new <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_page.html" title="Web page">web page</a> was released.</p>
<p>During that year, Arianne evolved anarchically and fast into a small working offline game where the player was able to move around a piece of terrain of around the size of three screens. The great achievement at this stage was portability as the game was runnable on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>, Linux, and <a href="../../../b/e/o/BeOS_b04d.html" title="BeOS">BeOS</a> thanks to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer_ec5d.html" title="Simple DirectMedia Layer">SDL</a>.</p>

Arianne in 2000</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the year <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Arianne reached version 0.3.0, the first version to feature a real <a href="../../../c/l/i/Client-server.html" title="Client-server">client-server</a> framework. Everything was hard-coded and it was extremely difficult to either add new features or fix existing ones. However, the framework stayed that way up to version 0.3.9.</p>
<p>A BeOS version was released, making Arianne one of the first BeOS open source games.</p>
<p>Around this time, the website was rebuilt using <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midgard_%28software%29.html" title="Midgard (software)">Midgard</a>, a content management system.</p>
<p>The real achievements of this release were the creation of a core of developers such as Ulrich Eckhardt, Masahiro Minami and Dan Brown and the fact that the client was now running on Linux, Windows, BeOS, and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_6c4f.html" title="Mac OS">Mac OS</a>. The codebase still had the problem of being very hard-coded and was poorly written in general, so it was completely re-coded. This took approximately six months to complete. The project numbering was changed from the expected 0.4.0 version to 1.0.0 alpha 1.</p>
<p>The whole Arianne project was extremely well-documented; everything from specification to design was documented on web pages and made available to the public. These design documents (besides large changes in the implementation) are still valid.</p>

Arianne in Mac OS</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>2001 was a very successful year for Arianne. Many new people joined the project. Unfortunately, a new type of contributor also appeared: "the camper". These were people who joined the project, asked for tasks and then vanished. They delayed the project significantly and made it much harder to keep adding new features.</p>
<p>The first version of the alpha 1 releases was named Pandora.</p>
<p>This version featured a basic server-client framework that was easy to <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debugging.html" title="Debugging">debug</a> and expand. This created a basis for the next steps of the project. 2001 also featured two more releases of tech previews of Galadriel, the 1.2 version of Arianne. Coding started on new features like a database backend and a secure login procedure.</p>

Arianne in 2002</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the year <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> Arianne released a major version, named Galadriel, that added a python RP system, a database backend for accounts, an XML storage for the world, and a small 2D client using Kyra, a sprite engine for SDL.</p>
<p>The website was again reconstructed using <a href="../../../p/h/p/PHPNuke_bd51.html" title="PHPNuke">PHPNuke</a>. Olivier Milla and Djagg worked hard on the website to make it unique and different.</p>
<p>Although some of the core developers left, significant progress was still made. Many great contributors joined such as Skyflash and Brian Rowe. The project was #1 on <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sourceforge.html" title="Sourceforge">Sourceforge</a> for about a month during July, 2002. However, problems arose. The code was not as clean and organized as Miguel thought it should be, and he suggested another rewrite of the project. However, some developers disagreed. This, coupled with the fact that there were only one or two active workers, led to diminished interest in the project, and it was declared dead around <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">September 24th</a> of that year:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Arianne is dead.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>This project is really exhausted and IMO it can't continue anymore on the actually structure. There are 27 developers on Sourceforge and only Steve has been working lately with PHP of developers site and Skyflash with changing the sites content.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>So 24 of those 27 persons are doing NOTHING.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>And well, things are even worse if you take a look to the developers site. There are several people joined... around 20, I have dedicated several hours of my personal time to create tasks and fill them with good descriptions so that people can take them and just look what is the reply... Only Steve has used it. None except again Steve and Skyflash has filled a single task. None of the GFX people has joined the site. Well, and about mailing lists... more of the same... I have do a CALL for people to know what everyone is doing here... and the reply has been nothing: None has had time to write a few lines explaining what they are doing.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Project code needs a total clearing... I am writing test cases for Arianne and it has found to be really unstable on the Connection and Thread related things, so the only way to continue is to clear it or recode it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>If someone offers to take the leadership of Arianne I will transfer him all the keycodes and all the rights over the code that I have written, so that he can continue Arianne as s/he thinks it is better, even changing the license. If none offers to take it, I will meditate about either shutting down it, or clearing ALL and start again from the begin of the begin in a new way no developers, no website, no teams, no tasks, no contributions, no ideas.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>One of the biggest errors of Arianne has been to be too open, we have accepted on the team people that is not really to take the task, we have accepted tons of ideas that are really impossible to be done, I have failed to motivate and coordinate this group of people into working on it. Also I have written a huge amount of documetation, several of you will say that docs are a shit (like Uli did) but again, none has written a better one, what Uli wrote was only an email long documentation in a very technical language that hardly can help a newbie to understand it. I have created, used and recommended sourceforge trackers but little people has really used it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I have tried to do a schedule of the project but people has not contributed a single line to inform me of what they are doing. You don"t document anything... nor decisions, nor code.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Personally, I still have the same motivation to create a MMOG as before starting to work on Arianne, so I will for sure retry it, either on Arianne or by my own with the experience that I have get on Ariane.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anyway, I really want to thank you all the 3 years of Arianne, I have meet real good friends, I have had great times and I have felt the proud of being an open source developer, I also have felt the sadness of getting only bad words of what you do, from inside and outside, I have also understand that people always talk more than they can do. Anyway, Thanks to all.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Regards,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Miguel</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Soon, Miguel received several requests to transfer leadership of the project. The two who were considered seriously were Euan Mee and Skyflash. After a month or so of internal debate a poll was taken and everyone agreed, even Skyflash, to transfer the leadership to Euan. Euan's leadership was short-lived. There was much consulting on the project; it was evaluated as a whole, and many changes were proposed. However, Euan disappeared. After that, Skyflash took the leadership, and, using the work accomplished during both Euan's period and the previous years, he started to work on a new version that featured a <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_computer_graphics_c308.html" title="3D computer graphics">3D</a> client using plib.</p>

Arianne in 2003</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the year <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the project started to move again, and, without dropping the old code, Skyflash managed to fix bugs and add new features such as a 3D client that allowed players to move, fight and cast magic. This version of Arianne featured a <a href="../../../l/u/a/Lua_programming_language.html" title="Lua programming language">Lua</a> scripting engine. This version was called Naxos, a name which began a new version naming scheme.</p>
<p>The progress of the project was totally in Skyflash's hands, but he had to move back to his home in September 2003 and he requested someone take over the project for, minimally, six months to a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miguel had started Marauroa, a Java clone of Arianne that had the things he thought Arianne should have had: UDP, a database backend, persistent objects, scriptability, and overall robustness. Around December 2003, along with the help of Waldemar Tribus, a working version was completed.</p>
<p>Miguel asked Skyflash to pass leadership to him for the next six months, and, in October 2003, he became leader again. He created a new web page and removed the PHPNuke in favor of a previous website that Djagg had made. He then wrote a revision of the project status to determine what was working and how. The result was that the project was advanced, but soon got blocked on all paths because the main developer assigned to each area was MIA. Since Marauroa was in a stable status, it was adopted as Arianne's server.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianne.html" title="Edit section: Year 2004">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Year 2004</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Marauroa joined Arianne as a single project. Arianne's goals were redefined such that Arianne became a framework to create online multiplayer games and Marauroa became the content management system of the Arianne framework. Marauroa now features a fully scriptable RP engine using Python.</p>
<p>Arianne was rewritten to be client-side application able to connect to a Marauroa server. Arianne was simplified to make it easier to write new games, and Python binding was added so that development of games in Python was possible.</p>

<p>Arianne is composed of two different parts: <a href="../../../s/e/r/Server_%28computing%29.html" title="Server (computing)">server</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/i/Client_%28computing%29.html" title="Client (computing)">client</a>.</p>

<p>Arianne's server is Marauroa: Marauroa is a Java implementation of the Arianne design such that it is a secure, fast, and robust platform for providing content. The goal of Marauroa is to ease the creation of multiplayer games as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Content_management_system.html" title="Content management system">Content management system</a> eases the creation of web portals.</p>
<p>Marauroa is completely written in Java using a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multithreaded.html" title="Multithreaded">multithreaded</a> server architecture with a UDP oriented network protocol, a MySQL-based persistence engine, and a flexible game system. The game system is totally expandable and modifiable by game developers and is able to run <a href="../../../p/y/t/Python_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Python (programming language)">Python</a> <a href="../../../s/c/r/Script_%28computer_programming%29.html" title="Script (computer programming)">scripts</a> defining the game's rules. Marauroa is based on a design philosophy called Action/Perception. With each turn, a perception is sent to the clients explaining what they currently perceive. Clients can ask the server to perform any action in their name using actions. Marauroa is totally game-agnostic and makes very few assumptions about what are you trying to do, allowing a great <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Freedom (philosophy)">freedom</a> to create any game type.</p>
