	    <p>Hmm, I was looking into things, but can't find any pages called Easter Bradford or James Warnock. Where are these folks mentioned please, could you provide a link for me? I'll take a look.</p>
<p>Welcome to wikipedia by the way. Nice to see you've gotten yourself a user name. Were you using any particular IP address to edit with first? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 19:04, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Yeah I was, I didn't actually know how to join wikipedia at first. So I figured I'd just sign on and comment. Apparently it was wrong or something. They say its hard to find info on this website about him, but I used google and yahoo search engines and kept finding everything about him linked to here.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Easter_Bradford/delete#November_2003" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Easter_Bradford/delete#November_2003" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Easter_Bradford/delete#November_2003</a></p>
<p>Thats how I found it. I did edit alot and post but apparently now they decided that the informationt hat was added was in bad form and I recieved no notices [like I asked for] about why any of my information was changed.. nor did I receive any information as to why my stuff was removed and the website was turned into a protected one. I read the backlog information and saw minor discrepencies of someone at an IP address saying that it was all due to some sort of disagreement and that the information I added was due to some argument or something, but I'm not sure how anyone could consider it to be that.</p>
<p>I'm confused about the whole situation.. and my questions that I posted to the alleged guy who works for wikipedia and deleted my information also deleted my questions to him earlier. So I have no idea whats going on.</p>

<dd>That was <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a>; he routinely deletes anything that is not signed (as he notes on his talk page). To sign your posts, ends them with ~~~~ (that's four <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilde.html" title="Tilde">tildes</a>, the key to the left of the "1" on your keyboard, when the "Shift" key is pressed.</dd>

<dd>Please also see my response to you on my <a href="../../../o/r/t/User_talk%7EOrthogonal_8d31.html" title="User talk:Orthogonal">talk page</a>. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 02:42, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

okiedokie.. will try that. ArisBranwin 04:21, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, now that you've signed your question, I'll answer it. The reason why I keep deleting your edits to the Easter Bradford page is because that page is an archive of the discussion as to why the Easter Bradford information was deleted, and is not meant to be an ongoing discussion. If you'd like to discuss it further, you could probably do it at the <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">Village Pump</a>. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:18, Aug 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Well, what if I just up and create a new topic about him? Would that be bad? I've searched the village pump area and most of it sorta lacks well.. reasons for anything that I'd post there to be there. So if I just up and created a new area and with information that was to the point and such would that be considered a problem?</p>

<dd>Hmm I read Talk:Easter_Bradford/delete#November_2003, and goodness, what a mess really. Are you sure you really want to get into that? It might be handier to do something a little less nerve-wracking first and get the hang of things&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<p>A month or so from now, once you feel confident, naturally you can have a look at reinstating the page. You could for instance go to Votes for undeletion and ask if maybe there's an old version hanging around some old backup for you to review and tidy. If that turns up nothing, you could try to start up a new page. Do note once again that there's some controversy to be found here, so you'd best roll up your sleeves . Also do make sure for yourself that it's really worth putting in the effort before you start on it. Remember, it's most important to Have Fun! <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 17:13, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

Well the reason why I was posting on wikipedia was because my friend [who actually IS EasterBradford/JamesWarnock] went missing over 5 weeks ago. Now I had come across this website before and it had alot more information on it then what was there before I started writing things. I pretty much was using Wikipedia to not only attempt to find him but to update what little information was there and what information wasn't from December 2003 to June 2004. Of course maybe I did it in a wrong about way or something like that. In any case I'm still looking for him and thought that even if I didn't find him on Wikipedia he'd read about it since he does google his name(s) to see whats been updated or said about him. I'm just hoping I eventually hear from him. [Of course I also DO wonder how wikipedia got part of my name and used it in one of their posts towards me which they shouldn't have done because isn't that against a persons privacy.. at least I think it is] ... ah well.

<p><br />
Ah well, no biggie.. I'm not going to worry about I might find other stuff to write about. Tho I am glad people are actually available to help if and when I need it. Kinda comforting.</p>
