<p>Someone placed a good bit of useful info on the page, but there were some problems with it--particularly, it was poorly formatted and potentially out of date. If anyone wants to take a stab at sifting through it, see the december 6th edit in the History. -<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchwnj_4db6.html" title="User:Schwnj">Nick</a> 04:55, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been watching / editing the ASU page for some time, and it is clear that a few things need to be addressed / changed in this article. I considered placing a "cleanup" flag on the page, but perhaps we can take care of everything here.</p>
<p>First, there is a danger of getting too much detail (and POV) in the sports sections. The level of detail provided in the sports areas are fine for an article about the Sun Devils, but not really necessary for a general ASU article. Perhaps we should have a Sun Devils page that covers all sports in as much detail as desired.</p>
<p>Next, the section on Academics is lacking. We need to provide info about more than the business and engineering schools. There should be added focus on the many other well-regarded programs at ASU such as Anthropology (esp. Institute of Human Origins), Music, Psychology, and the Biodesign initiative. There should also be more general facts about the university--what colleges there are, how many majors there are, how many graduate programs there are, etc. Also, the detail about the individual rankings of programs within the colleges could probably be moved to a new section that lists rankings of all ASU programs.</p>
<p>I also noticed that a bit of an edit war is occurring with the ASASU paragraph. To be blunt, ASASU is a student organization that has little impact on the actual direction of the university. They have no official power, and function essentially as a special interest group that lobbyies the administration about student concerns. The "constitution" that was drafted was the ASASU constitution, not the ASU constitution. ASASU deserves a mention on the ASU page, but that's about it. I have created an ASASU article stub for all those interested in the inner workings of ASASU.</p>
<p>In sum, this article needs work. If you are contributing to it, please stick to facts (NO subjective statements--they are forbidden by Wikipedia) and information that is highly relevant to a basic understanding of ASU. And as for the general style of the article, I'd like to leave you with a quote from <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Vonnegut_46cd.html" title="Kurt Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a>, "What can be said in twenty pages can be better said in five." (or something like that) <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchwnj_4db6.html" title="User:Schwnj">Nick</a> 06:06, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The arial photography included on the page is from July 2004 and as such is essentially out-of-date. On-going construction has introduced some significant changes to the campus in the last year and a half, including but not limited to new buildings and dormitories. Maybe we should look for another photograph? <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhreyan_206e.html" title="User:Phreyan">phreyan</a> 14:33, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Current state of the university seems rather subjective, not objective.</p>
<p>Moved from the main article: <i>Note: If you are familiar with the history of Sun Devil baseball, it would be much appreciated if you would write a detailed historical summary similar to football and baseball.</i> --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 04:55, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know why people keep insisting on removing the fact that Michael Liburdi is the one who was the primary author of the Constitution. Sure, there was a constitutional convention and all...but anyone who was a part of that knows that it was Mike Liburdi who gave up his life for a couple of months in order to write the consititution. Everyone else just sort of showed up to the meetings and raised their hands to vote. Mike Liburdi deserves credit on this page (if this page is to talk about ASASU and the new constitution at all) for having served such a major role. Everyone else should stop adding themselves into the history. For goodness' sake, let's all give credit where credit is due and leave ourselves out of the history.</p>
<p>And, yes, that includes the two of you who think that you deserve credit for having been the first president and vice president of ASASU since the reformation. I mean, if you're going to do that, you need to list every president and vice president from the begining of time, in addition to everyone who serves after you. Why not just start a new article called "Associated Students of Arizona State University" and you can all practice your standard infighting and one-ups-manship there instead of on the main page. This is just getting ridiculous. Seriously, move it off the main page...it has no place here.</p>

<p>I agree. To be entirely honest, I'm not sure that ASASU stuff is all that important to include in an encyclopedia article about a large University. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchwnj_4db6.html" title="User:Schwnj">Nick</a> 23:06, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a stub at <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Students_of_Arizona_State_University_215b.html" title="Associated Students of Arizona State University">Associated Students of Arizona State University</a>; if someone could work it into the article, and possibly move ASASU stuff out to there, it would probably work well. I leave it to those more familiar with the situation... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 01:09, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not agree. The ASASU Constitution is terrible. It contradicts itself and is over-all an extremely flawed document...as far as I am concerned anyone can take credit for it, but it would be the equivalent of insulting themselves. Go ahead and use the stub page as much as you want...I cannot wait until we rewrite the darn thing.</p>

<p>A reader sent an e-mail saying that the endowment figure given in the infobox was out of date.
