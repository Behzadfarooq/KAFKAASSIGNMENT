<p>Just so you know, I deleted the two images you uploaded because a) you lied about the license-status of these images, they were not made by you and you therefore can't decide that they are in the public domain and b) I accuse you of being a (or the) troll who comes here for quite some time now, always under a different name, acts innocently and tries to convince everyone that furries are perverts.

<dd>I nominated your reuploads for deletion. Although I'm kinda sure you know it already, you can only license such images under the GFDL or CC when you <b>make</b> them yourself. This means being the photograph, and being allowed by the people on the photographs to license the images under a specific license. Just downloading them somwhere and editing them a little gives you no rights to the images, they are therefore still unfree and should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 18:46, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you do so, I am sure that the matter will be cleared up and the user, if he is acting improperly, will be reprimanded; there is no need to behave hastily or covertly, as the majority of Wikipedia users are very reasonable, open, friendly people. In other words, first try to resolve it through discussion on his Talk page; if that fails, try <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a> (if you want dispute-resolving help from a neutral user) or <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> (if you want input from the community at large, which sounds like what you're looking for now).

<p>I'm sorry. I'm not an admin. I will give you three pieces of advice though. First, edit other pages and keep away from this guy. Second, if you can't do that, get a new user ID just for those pages and try to stick within the policies of Wikipedia. Don't let the guy in question know that you're you. If another user breaches the policies, note it on their talkpage <i>politely</i> and make a note for the case you will later bring against them. If he protects pages he's editing, blocks you for disputing content, anything like that, then note it. Just make sure you personally stay within the policies, stay cool and stay polite. Third, start an RfC. You'll need to find someone else who has also suffered at this guy's hands. If he's as bad as you make out, it won't be hard to find someone. If the RfC doesn't bring an outcome you can live with, take your case to the arbcom. They will almost certainly back the admin and make out you are full of shit, so if you go that route, just lay out your evidence and walk away. Don't get involved. Don't let it get to you or make you mad. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:46, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed your entry on ALR's <a href="../../../a/l/r/User_talk%7EALR_bbc4.html" title="User talk:ALR">talk</a> page, and I don't really see what <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">ContiE</a> did wrong. It might have been premature to remove the other image, although I agree with <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> that it's hard to make out to the point of being pretty useless. As for the animated image, I think the case against it was made pretty strongly. As a side note, you can see that ContiE waited to remove the images, they were up for more than two months before the edit, and you can actually see ContiE reverting someone else's edit to the last version by <i>you</i>. I didn't look into anything else you said (actually, I don't know how to look into it, you weren't too clear on what you were saying), but from what I've seen so far, it looks like ContiE wasn't acting all that badly here. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><span style="color:#CC0000; background-color:white"><b>Osgoode</b></span></a><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><span style="color:#444444; background-color:white"><i><b>Lawyer</b></i></span></a> 15:21, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, you left a message on my talk page regarding your problems with ContiE. My advice to you would be to go down either the RfC route, or the Meidation Route. I should also point out that I'm not an administrator, so I'm not sure where you got that impression from.

<p>I don't want to get involved, but... leaving lots of messages on talk pages is not the best way to get your message across. I don't really mind at all, but to certain admins, lots of messages = spam = vandalism = instaban!

<p>Dear Arights: I have blocked you indefinitely from editing Wikipedia due to heavy spamming of administrator talk pages with a message that makes personal attacks and unsubstantiated, serious allegations against a Wikipedia administrator. This sort of behaviour is not justifiable on Wikipedia, and I regret to say that individuals exhibiting such behaviour are not welcome as members of our community. If there was a serious substantative issue it would have been sufficient to file a request for comments or to post a single, reasonably-worded message on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a> as opposed to mass-spamming. A cursory analysis of the matter shows <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">User:ContiE</a>'s conduct to be perfectly legitimate, and indeed the title of your spam messages opens with an allegation that he is impersonating you on other wikis without any kind of proof of such a claim; you do not even point to wikis he is alleged to have impersonated you on.

<p>I searched on google for people who understood that admins abused their powers and contacted them. The vandalism in progress is too confusing to find a place to report admins who abuse their powers and impersonate users as a poor attempt at justifying their abuse.</p>
<p>When asked to stop, I stopped. I can not find any where that says contacting others for non-commercial and personal messages on wikipedia is against the rules. There are rules like <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, but admins have never done so--only assuming bad faith. The claim of spam is a complete lie and it is libel because spam is only commercial messages.</p>
<p>I also did not do an RFC because I looked to see instances that others have done before of this. Anyone who complains of admins there gets banned.</p>
<p>Banning someone idenfinately on false charges (spam = commercial messages only) is against the rules. I ask that NicholasTurnbull be de-adminned and indefinately banned. The second false charge is that it makes personal attacks -- this is how ContiE is. The third false charge is that it is "unsubstantiated", when they are provable including ContiE's impersonation of myself.</p>
<p>I request that the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> page mention that admins regularly assume bad faith since I cannot request this on its talk page.</p>
<p>I also seriously demand the image deletion that Psychonaut requested be delayed until seven business days until after my access is restored. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArights_a88a.html" title="User:Arights">Arights</a> 06:08, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've had a look at this, too. Just fifteen article edits in total, and from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35063689" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35063689" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, one of his earliest, it's clearly the sock of an experienced user. The fact of the spamming, and its nature, and the unproductive overall editing history, strongly support the block. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 15:44, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
