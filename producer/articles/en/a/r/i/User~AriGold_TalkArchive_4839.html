<p>Since you appear to be sticking around and making some contributions, I thought I'd try and help make image uploading easier.</p>
<p>To add the picture, what you'll have to do is</p>
<ul>
<li>Save it to your computer (note the folder it's in)</li>
<li>Rename the file to something more appropriate (e.g. DeionSanders.jpg)</li>
<li>Log in to Wikipedia</li>
<li>Visit the 'Upload file' link, in the toolbox on the left side</li>
<li>Use the form to find the file on your computer and upload it to Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, once the image is uploaded, visit it's image description page (which will have the picture on it) and add a description by editing that page just like editing any other page. You'll want to use a copyright tag to make the copyright status of the image clear. On Wikipedia, magazine covers are considered a fair use of copyright protected images. So at the bottom of your description, add {{Magazinecover}} and the copyright template for magazine covers will be inserted. (See <a href="../../../w/o/r/Image%7EWorld.mag.2004.ncs.jpg_7a43.html" title="Image:World.mag.2004.ncs.jpg">Image:World.mag.2004.ncs.jpg</a> for an example.)</p>
<p>Then, go to the <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deion_Sanders_7012.html" title="Deion Sanders">Deion Sanders</a> article, and add the image to the article where you'd like to place it by placing [[Image:DeionSanders.jpg|thumb|right]] in the appropriate place in the article. The "thumb" attribute will thumbnail the image since it's large, and the "right" attribute will right-align it in the article. Make sure to preview the article before saving it, to verify that the image appears where you'd like it to.</p>
<p>It may seem like a long procedure but it doesn't take too long to add a picture. Plus, if you're going to be contributing often it'll be useful.

<p>Hi AriGold, great work on your Wiki contributions thus far! I just saw your comment in the history of the "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_based_on_comic_books.html" title="List of movies based on comic books">List of movies based on comic books</a>" page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"(removed Flash Gordon, didnt realize that comics based on strips were not included. Addded Lone Wolf and Cub.)"</dd>

<p>I made a <i>very similar</i> mistake a few weeks ago; I added a myraid of movies to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_based_on_comic_strips.html" title="List of movies based on comic strips">List of movies based on comic strips</a> that should have been in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_based_on_comic_books.html" title="List of movies based on comic books">List of movies based on comic books</a> list, and had to revert all my additions and put them in the other article.

<p>Well, I feel that if you are going to say why all these more than a dozen programs are notable...every university/school has notable programs. If you want to state rankings, thats fine but it seems highly subjective of you to say they are "highly regarded." Also, I don't see why they would be in that top intro section when you have then in the academic section anyway... BTW, im not a "gator fan", I am just editing the Florida University System and I've started with the 2 biggest, UF and FSU...</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with you but you had hard facts there and that's a difference. The creative writing thing is a great point and so is the golf program, but it seems biased to run off a laundry list of programs that are "notable" and not really explain why. I think they should be taken off, especially since the only source you can find that says that is the actual school website. I mean, every school brags about itself so that really cannot stand...</li>

<p>Hi AriGold!</p>
<p>I notice that you remove many of the discussions which take place on your talk page. I think that would be better if you decide to archive them instead of deleting them. Just a thought, but I am not sure what the official policy is. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJester2001_5753.html" title="User:Jester2001">Jester2001</a> 02:35, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the thought, I was honestly thinking about doing that but I have no idea how to. AriGold 18:47, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's actually quite easy, just create a new page called (for example) <strong class="selflink">User:AriGold/TalkArchive</strong>. Copy all the talk you don't want to be in your main talk page to the new page. And create a link to the archive in your main talk page. You don't have to do it because you can always go back to a discussion through the history page, but it helps to keep things organized. Just a tip if you decide to use it.</dd>
<dd>You don't have to use this method just for archiving discussions. For example, I've create a page called <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJester2001_Pictures_b81a.html" title="User:Jester2001/Pictures">User:Jester2001/Pictures</a> where I link all the pictures I've uploaded to wikipedia. That way I can go back and delete any pictures which are no longer needed.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for the info about Raquel Gibson, I've added it to my watchlist and will add any relevant information. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJester2001_5753.html" title="User:Jester2001">Jester2001</a> 12:11, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let that be a lesson to you: Don't engage in revert warring. Since you were reverting to a consensus version, you got off easy with a token one hour block. You read my message on <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a>'s talk page; I suggested a 48 hour block for DrBat, but Steve let him off with a 24 hour one. Next time DrBat tries to engage you in dialogue, I suggest you talk to him instead deleting his messages from your talk page. You also need to note that the discussion had changed; at the time he was re-inserting the image, we were going with the assumption that it was indeed a promotional image and if that were the case and if the fair use argument is better with those kinds of images, then the question becomes, is it better to show the character in the context of the cover or alone? However, we never actually got to that dialogue because DrBat decided to not engage in it. Since it turns out to not be a truly promotional image, then most likely we will not be able to use it, although a {{<a href="../../../c/h/a/Template%7ECharacter-artwork_3bd5.html" title="Template:Character-artwork">Character-artwork</a>}} fair use argument could be made. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 16:48, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>You reverted the page six times in less than half an hour. Although three admins suggested an image as better use, that does not make a definitive answer, and discussion was still ensuing. Discussion is the way to resolve things here, as outlined in pages such as <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a>. Regardless of the rightness or wrongness of your position, you violated the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule</a>, something which has to protected in all instances to save the wikipedia from disruption. Note you were told by Howcheng that the issue was not a vandalism issue but rather a content dispute, and yet you still continued to mark your actions as reverting vandalism. Your comments at my talk page do not indicate to me you have considered your behaviour, you seem to be blaming everyone else for the situation and not considering your own role in the revert war. If you read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> you will note it directs an admin to treat all parties equally. I had no choice but to block you; I used discretion and blocked for time limits based on the previous behaviour of the two participants, taking into account previous blocks. I feel your comments to both myself and Howcheng in the light of the block do not vindicate my decision. I would suggest you take a deep breath and in future consider stepping back from such issues rather than seeking to impose your own view so rigidly. Wikipedia is, and always will be, by it's nature, a work in progress. A few hours displaying a disputed image will not trouble the project over much. I would suggest you have a read of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">m:Eventualism</a>, and have a rethink of your actions. At the least I think you might consider an apology to Howcheng. You note at <a href="../../../d/r/b/User_talk%7EDrBat_52ba.html" title="User talk:DrBat">User talk:DrBat</a> that you have been told by three admins that your actions are correct. I suggest this shows a flaw in your understanding in how wikipedia works. I for one never authorised such actions, such actions are completely against policy. What you have to bear in mind is that you have to consider your actions as part of a greater whole. What effect did your reversion of Dr Bat's edit have? It escalated and inflamed the situation. I apologise for not discussing the issue with you directly, but consider this: given you used my comments as justification for your actions, where did you seek discussion with me? How am I to discuss such actions when they happen within half an hour? You have the look of a good editor about you, but you need to show more respect in your exchanges with people. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 18:46, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay, I understand. It's hard to know just where things came from. I myself had to go back and check my notes when I put in footnotes on this article. It's just that when I've submitted a FAC in the past, usually the first thing I get for responses is "oppose" votes because the photos aren't satisfactory to some voters. Rossrs put in a note about the Oprah clip, I do know.

<dd>By the way, what is <b>your</b> current opinion on the issue? Do you agree that the wording in the {{<a href="../../../m/a/g/Template%7EMagazinecover_03ec.html" title="Template:Magazinecover">Magazinecover</a>}} template forbids such uses of those images? I have also read <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFair_use_26b6.html" title="WP:Fair use">WP:Fair use</a> and I still believe we can't use magazine cover's in articles other than about the magazine itself.

<p>I was just curious why you deleted the entirety of the information regarding the eʁxpansion of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_a463.html" title="Atlantic Coast Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a>. I agree there was a fair bit of NPOV, non-encyclopedic commentary in there, but does the entire section need to be deleted? I think the national conference realignment is a pretty important topic, and at least some sort of mention should be made in the conference pages. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESertrel_a825.html" title="User:Sertrel">Sertrel</a> 22:20, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe a few sentences would be necessary, but right now there's only this sentence: "In 2003's cycle of conference alignment, the ACC added three more members, all from the Big East: Miami and Virginia Tech joined on July 1, 2004, and Boston College joined on July 1, 2005 as the league's twelfth member." Is there a major article of some sort about all the schools under consideration, which ones recanted, etc., and the subsequent cascading effect on the Big East, C-USA, etc.? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESertrel_a825.html" title="User:Sertrel">Sertrel</a> 22:27, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_East_Conference_f830.html" title="Big East Conference">Big East Conference</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference_USA_59f3.html" title="Conference USA">Conference USA</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Sun_Conference_89f9.html" title="Atlantic Sun Conference">Atlantic Sun Conference</a> for some of the effects over the past few years. But I'm beginning to think that a separate article would be the best way to address this, and then just link to that article from each of the major conference pages. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESertrel_a825.html" title="User:Sertrel">Sertrel</a> 22:30, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I guess I get your point, but:</p>
<p>- I also reedited the text for the Duke-UNC rivalry, which was awful and ungrammatical. Why revert that?</p>
<p>- If there any rhyme or reason to the order in which each rivalry's schools are listed? As in: Why is it "Virginia-Maryland" instead of "Maryland-Virginia" if we're being alphabetical? Why isn't "Clemson-N.C. State" first? <a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJbenton_aa7a.html" title="User:Jbenton">Jbenton</a> 21:35, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm still in the process of learning the exact Wiki protocol. I have read the instructive pages for new users; however, it is a lot to digest and commit to memory all at once. Right now, I'm focusing on editing stump pages and obscure pages as part of the learning process. When I'm confident that I have mastered the process, then I will try again to contribute to the Burt Reynolds page. I fully understand that this is an important page.

<p>Regarding the warning I gave you for <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suri_Cruise_64f5.html" title="Suri Cruise">Suri Cruise</a>, I do apologise. I must admit, I jumped the gun. In fact, I initially blocked you and then later, unblocked you. I'm not exactly sure why this happened. The fact that you had been blocked before didn't help, nor the fact that the page was deleted as a result, but nevertheless, I overreacted. I am sure you are telling the truth when you say you didn't mean to save the page. Anyway, I really do apologise. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:32, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your message re the Co-operative Group edit. I can see the reason for your original edit now. The reference to the College World Series at the top of the Co-operative Group article seemed so incongruous I edited it out.

<li>I apologise for yesterday's edits. I didn't realise the 'Co-Operative Group' article had been edited instead. This is one of those unfortunate cases where an American association, which isn't well-known outside of the US, has the same initials as a more well-known group.</li>

<p>Sorry for the long delay for a response. I was away and have not been on the internet for a while. All of the additions by Harvardlaw are actual Phi Delt Alumni, although I can't verify the CEO of Dr. Pepper as a Phi.

<p>This is in response to the question you left on my talk page. I've reviewed the article, the subject doesn't seem notable to me. I think it should be brought to AfD. Regards, <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 14:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. We've already speedied David Jason Silver on the same subject. I "prodded" the article, but I would be surpised if the tag lasts 5 days. I'd support an AfD. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 15:48, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if the tag holds and it is deleted after 5 days, prodded articles can be recreated.

<p>Hello, thanks very much for your message and for correcting the name of that article. I am not a FSU fan, but I am a fan of college football. Obviously there are some things about the sport that I don't know yet! I'm sorry about the mistake but I'm glad you caught it quickly so we can develop the article under the proper name.

We are really gearing up as we approach the fall season. BTW, I also created <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gator_Chomp_c7ba.html" title="Gator Chomp">Gator Chomp</a> as a stub yesterday. It was my intention to expand them both and nominate one for the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html" title="Template talk:Did you know">Did you know section</a> of the Main Page. Since you've already done some good expansion of <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Chant_b9a3.html" title="War Chant">War Chant</a>, perhaps we can improve it and nominate it together?
