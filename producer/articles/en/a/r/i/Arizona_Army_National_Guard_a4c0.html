<p><b>The Arizona National Guard</b> is comprised of both Army and Air National Guard components. The Constitution of the United States specifically charges the National Guard with dual federal and state missions. In fact, the National Guard is the only United States military force empowered to function in a state status. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_law.html" title="Martial law">martial law</a> when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the President or Congress.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 5,000 men and women serving in the Arizona Army Guard. The Arizona Army National Guard is "Always Ready, Always there."</p>
<p>When National Guard troops are called to federal service, the President serves as Commander-In-Chief. The federal mission assigned to the National Guard is: <b>"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National emergency or as otherwise needed."</b></p>
<p>The Governor may call individuals or units of the Arizona National Guard into state service during emergencies or to assist in special situations which lend themselves to use of the National Guard. The state mission assigned to the National Guard is: <b>"To provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law."</b></p>
<p>The State Defense Force (SDF) is a military entity authorized by both Federal Code and Executive Order. The SDF is a state’s authorized militia and assumes a state's mission of the National Guard in the event the Guard is mobilized. The SDF is comprised of retired active and reserve military personnel and selected professional persons who volunteer their time and talents in further service to their state. Currently, Arizona does not have a State Defense Force.</p>
<p>The <b>Arizona Army National Guard</b> is a component of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">United States National Guard</a>.

<p>National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">presidential order</a> to supplement regular armed forces, and upon declaration of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_emergency.html" title="State of emergency">state of emergency</a> by the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor.html" title="Governor">governor</a> of the state in which they serve. Unlike <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Reserve_613c.html" title="United States Army Reserve">Army Reserve</a> members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary DutY Assignments <b>TDY</b>), but only as part of their respective <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_unit.html" title="Military unit">units</a>. However, there has been a significant amount of individual activations to support military operations (2001-?); the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard.</p>

<p>For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served "<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_weekend_a_month%2C_two_weeks_a_year.html" title="One weekend a month, two weeks a year">One weekend a month, two weeks a year</a>", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or National Guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every three years of service. More specifically, current <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> policy is that no Guardsman will be involuntarily activated for a total of more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six year enlistment period (this policy is due to change 1 August 2007, the new policy states that soldiers will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 24 months, individual states have differing policies).</p>

<p>In response to the Indian wars, the <b>Arizona Army National Guard</b> was formed on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>. In 1898, hundreds of Arizonans joined the ranks of the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Riders_7059.html" title="Rough Riders">Rough Riders</a> during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish-American_War_1510.html" title="Spanish-American War">Spanish-American War</a>. The <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia_Act_of_1903_ad8d.html" title="Militia Act of 1903">Militia Act of 1903</a> organized the various state <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militias</a> into the present National Guard system.</p>
<p>However, during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the Arizona Army National Guard received its greatest praise and served its greatest moment in history. Units from Arizona were called into action on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. The 158th Regimental Combat Team were given the name the "Bushmasters," named after the deadly <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushmaster_%28snake%29.html" title="Bushmaster (snake)">Bushmaster</a> snake in <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama.html" title="Panama">Panama</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Douglas_MacArthur_f7da.html" title="General Douglas MacArthur">General Douglas MacArthur</a> said that, "No greater fighting combat team has ever deployed for battle".</p>
<p>Since then, the Arizona Army National Guard has been deployed to <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, and <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Units from Arizona also deployed to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to assist with the <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> aftermath.</p>
<p>The 158th Infantry Regiment was created September 2, 1865, as the First Arizona Volunteer Infantry. The regiment was drafted into Federal Service for World War I, 5 August 1917 as part of the 40th Division. Reorganization after the 1st World War assigned the 158th Infantry to the 45th Division. On 16 September 1940, the declaration of the National Emergency, the 158th Infantry joined its parent organization, the 45th Division at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. After being relieved by divisions in campaign after campaign across the Pacific, the 158th Infantry was selected to spearhead the final invasion of Japan.</p>
<p>The Arizona National Guard has served the State through the <b>Arizona Project Challe<i>NG</i>e</b> program. Since 1993 AZ Project Challe<i>NG</i>e has offered an in-residence, voluntary, academy-style educational program for high school dropouts who wish to return to their educational goals.</p>
<p>Many states also maintain their own military forces. These forces are federally recognized, but are separate from the National Guard and are not meant to be federalized, but rather service the state exclusively, especially when the National Guard is deployed and unavailable. <i>(stub question: does Arizona maintain such an independent, non-National Guard military force?)</i></p>
