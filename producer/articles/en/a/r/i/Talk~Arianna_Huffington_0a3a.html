<p>Arianna Huffington is a nationally syndicated columnist and author of ten books. Originally from Greece, she moved to England when she was sixteen and graduated from Cambridge University with an M.A. in Economics. At twenty-one she became President of the famed debating society, the Cambridge Union.</p>
<p>In 2003, she ran for governor as an Independent in California's recall election. Her populist grassroots campaign was widely praised for putting the media spotlight on the corrupting influence of special interest money on American politics.</p>
<p>Her first book, The Female Woman, on the changing roles of women, was published in 1974 by Random House and translated into eleven languages. In 1978 she published After Reason, a book on political leadership and the intersection of politics and culture. Her biography of Maria Callas: The Woman Behind the Legend, published in 1981 quickly became an international bestseller. Her fourth book, The Gods of Greece, celebrated the power of myths as guides to forgotten dimensions of life and ourselves, and has been republished by Atlantic Monthly Press, with paintings by Francoise Gilot.</p>
<p>Her biography of Pablo Picasso, Picasso: Creator and Destroyer, published in 1988, was a major international bestseller, translated into sixteen languages. The book was reissued by Avon Books to coincide with the release of a feature film based on the book, produced by Merchant-Ivory for Warner Bros. and starring Anthony Hopkins as Picasso. In 1994, she published The Fourth Instinct on the longing for meaning in a secular world. Her seventh book, Greetings From the Lincoln Bedroom, a book of political satire, was published in 1998 by Crown. How To Overthrow The Government, on the corruption of our political system and the need for reform, was published in 2000 by Regan Books (Harper Collins).</p>
<p>Her New York Times bestseller, "Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption are Undermining America", was published in 2003. Her latest book, "Fanatics and Fools: The Game Plan for Winning Back America" (April 2004), offers both a scathing portrait of our contemporary political landscape and a bold, inspiring, yet practical approach to restoring America to the promise envisioned by our greatest leaders.</p>
<p>During Campaign '96, Arianna teamed up with Al Franken to provide political coverage for Comedy Central during the Republican and Democratic conventions, as well as on election night. She and Franken also appeared in a point-counterpoint segment, Strange Bedfellows, for Politically Incorrect.</p>
<p>She has made guest appearances on numerous other shows, including Larry King Live, Oprah, Nightline, Inside Politics, Charlie Rose, Crossfire, Hardball, Good Morning America, the Today Show, The McLaughlin Group, and The O'Reilly Factor.</p>
<p>She serves on several boards that promote community solutions to social problems, including A Place Called Home that works with at-risk children in South Central Los Angeles. She also serves on the Board of Trustees for the Archer School for Girls, the advisory board of the Council on American Politics at George Washington University, and the board of the Reform Institute that works on campaign and election reform issues.</p>
<p>Arianna Huffington lives in Los Angeles with her two daughters.</p>

<p>The article now states: "She founded and writes for The Huffington Post which has a strong liberal bias in order to counter neo-conservative bias." First, I don't know why it has to be explained that it is liberally biased to counter neo-conservative bias. Why not just say it is left leaning? Second, what exactly is neo-con biased that they are countering? The media? The Gov? The blogosphere? And are they opposed to neo-conservative "bias", or just opposed to neo-conservative principles? -anon</p>

<p>Yes, I reverted these (twice) because they clearly violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (putting "gay" in the section title, the word "flip flop", etc). This user is causing trouble at the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">Truthiness</a> page and thus I don't assume much <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a> here either. -<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbarr_c295.html" title="User:Jcbarr">Jcbarr</a> 18:44, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I resent I am causing trouble. If gay and flip flop needs to be ommited then let be so. But to revert the whole page? Ludicruous.</p>
<p>It is clear that some people have alterior motives--guided by political bias. Look at your JcBarr biography:</p>
<p>I volunteered for John Edwards in 2004 primaries - you could have seen me open the door for him at the Virgian J-J dinner (where Elizabeth touched the arm of my coat!)</p>
<p>I watched Bill Clinton, Hillary, Al, Tipper, and Jimmy Carter build a Habitat house in Atlanta during the Republican National Convention of 1992 (and got autographs from the middle 3).</p>
<p>No wonder he wants to protect Huffingtion.</p>

You're the one who made changes to the accepted article, introducing a point of view ("cult?", "plagarism"). I care much much more about Wikipedia's good name than I do about introducing POV to support Ms. Huffington. -<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbarr_c295.html" title="User:Jcbarr">Jcbarr</a> 18:53, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firmitas, let's discuss the substance of the changes to the article instead of personalities, please. The former would be much more productive. Thank you. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:55, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not attacking JC personally. For all I know he could be a nice guy: he volunteers a lot. However, it is clear that he has a bias. I will welcome to discuss my changes point by point, in good faith and reason.</p>
<p>Cult: the ensuing passage is about wether her spirituality was actually a cult?</p>

<p>I enjoy watching the <i>Colbert Report</i>, it's a great show. However do you not see how ridiculous all of this is and how easily this <b>encyclopedia</b> is being manipulated? Two celebrities mention wikipedia on TV and suddenly there are more than 100 edits across three pages in the span of one evening? If Huffington had come on TV and said that the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> said Colbert didn't invent the word "truthiness" and he responded by saying "fuck them", do you think there would even be more than a passing mention here? For a supposedly neutral encyclopedia, everyone sure gets excited by a little bit of press. Wikipedia is not a sports team; let's stop basking in the glow of reflected glory and move on. <font color="#6D603B">S</font><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><font color="#6D603B">miconscious</font> • <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemiconscious_7225.html" title="User talk:Semiconscious"><font color="#6D603B"><small>talk</small></font></a> 19:46, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently, Arianna Huffington appeared at Pierce College (the Puyallup Campus) and gave a speech and did a book signing. Should this be mentioned, perhaps under a section called "recently"? Just a suggestion. Dante the Bard 04:30, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is outragous a whole mention of the Huffington Report and no mention of the George Clooney scandal? Talk about big brother. Huffington actually took quotations of past Clooney interview spliced them together and made into a blog. Clearly unethical. And even after being caught she has the brazen gall to state there is nothing wrong with it? Disgusting.

<p>Why is it I always edit these articles that attract POV? Ah well. I've removed the following line:</p>
<ul>
<li>" Her abysmal showing in the recall election made many wonder why she recieves so much media coverage, given that she seems to have no tangible political following to speak of."</li>
</ul>
<p>because it just seemed biased to me. Perhaps some do wonder this, but really. She receives media coverage because ... wait for it ... she's a nationally syndicated columnist! They make money by covering her. And of course her showing was 'abysmal' -- she wasn't even <i>in</i> the race. No need to point out that very few voted for someone not in the race, is there? In fact, it's rather surprising %0.6 <i>did</i> -- were they not paying attention, trying to make a point, what?<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 07:10, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, is it just me, or should this title be "Marriage" and not "Marriage to a Bisexual Republican"? Of course the article states that she was, in fact, married to a bisexual republican but the significance of the period of her life is that she was married, not that the man that she was married to was a bisexual republican. It sounds a lot more tabloid-styled than encyclopedic.

<p>This appeared in the Observer Newspaper (UK) yesterday:</p>
<p><a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1965689,00.html" class="external free" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1965689,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1965689,00.html</a></p>
<p>It raises a number of interesting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>How she uses her accent to her advantage. I would argue something maybe needs to be said about that or possibly quote this "At pretty much any public appearance, she rapidly disarms the crowd with a self-mocking reference to her accent." from the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article indicates her parents seperation and how that had effect on her in later life - it might be something worth-while mentioning this in the 'Personal Life' section.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think there is a strong case for a seperate section on her writing career (as opposed to her political career and that of a social networker?). The Female Woman as a response to Greer and the present self-help guide seem to to sell in large numbers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Cambridge education can probably be augmented with the quote: 'I got my education in speaking out at Cambridge, at the Union. It is where I discovered both my heart and my mind. I learned how to argue.'</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The names of her two daughters is Christina and Isabella, the former seems to appear in the media - it might be worth mentioning this in the 'Personal Life' section?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Advocacy for the use a new media is quite prevelant throughout the article. It might be worth considering putting that in the radio and new media section. IMHO there might be need for a subsection in that dealing with controversies.</li>
</ul>

<p>I noticed that in the Personal life section it states: "The couple divorced in 1997, after he narrowly lost the 1994 race for the U.S. Senate seat from California to incumbent Dianne Feinstein." I may just be misunderstanding something, but I don't see the correlation between the divorce and the lost Senate race in 1994. Are these related in some way, with one of the dates being possible incorrect, or are these two individual statements. If the divorce wasn't related to the lost Senate race, I don't think the two things should be in a single statement. Being that they are together in a single sentence, it makes them seem connected. Also, even if the divorce was related to the election results, it seems to be worded poorly, being that it was 3 years later, so "after" doesn't seem to be the correct word.
