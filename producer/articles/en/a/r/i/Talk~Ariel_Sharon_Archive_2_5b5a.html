<h2><span class="mw-headline">First Paragraph</span></h2>
<p>It is saddening to see what is happening with the first paragraph of this article, as it may be a sign of what bad things can happen with Wikipedia once it reaches a large-enough audiance - repeated useless editings that don't improve anything and just modify for the sake of modification, resulting in a slow drift into utter crap.</p>
<p>A few months ago, there were edit wars about the first paragraph. Some people made it say "Sharon is a war hero" and other made it say "Sharon is a war criminal", with the two camps constantly replacing the other camp's agenda by their own. The obvious solution was to do what I did: say that Sharon is regarded as a war hero by a majority of Israelis (the word "majority" I used here was proved when he was voted into office using this reputation), but he is regarded otherwise by other Israelis (some of those who voted against him) and by many other people around the world. The first paragraph as I wrote it was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sharon is highly controversial figure in and outside Israel. Many Israelis view him as a war hero, who helped defend the country in some of its greatest struggles, and as such he was voted into office. However, a significant number of Israelis, as well as much of the rest of the world, consider some of his actions to have been war crimes, and feel that his recent actions have been damaging the peace process. Most infamous were his actions during the 1982 Lebanon War (see below).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now we have:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sharon is a highly controversial figure in and outside Israel. Many Israelis view him as a war hero, and at present as a strong ruler determined to fight terrorism. However, a number of Israelis, as well as much of the Arab world, and certain other countires consider some of his past actions to have been war crimes, and feel that his recent actions have been damaging to the peace process. Most infamous were his actions as Defense Minister during the 1982 Lebanon War (see below).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Look at this, and at what we have today, and tell me if the slow drift did any good to this first paragraph. "Randomly" removing sentences that certain people didn't like for some reason, and at other times adding other sentences that certain people thought were "missing". I'm not saying the current version is bad - it is certainly better than the edit wars we used to have over this paragraph (which proves that my decision to write it like I did was correct) - but it makes me wonder about the continued quality of wikipedia in the future. <a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 12:22, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>And the drift continues.... Now, two months later, we have:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sharon is a highly controversial figure both inside and outside Israel, attracting diverse and often polar views. Thus many Israelis, a significant number of Jews worldwide and many foreign observers regard Sharon as a war hero and a strong leader in the fight against terrorism. On the other hand, a number of Israelis and foreign observers believe that his recent efforts have been damaging to the peace process. Sharon's most stringent critics have in the past sought his prosecution as a war criminal, on the grounds of his actions as Israeli Defense Minister during 1982 Lebanon War</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, it's different all right, but better? I don't think so, and I wonder who does. Let's bet that it will drift some more when I sample it again in two more months... 16:25, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Continuing to document the drift, 3 months later:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sharon is a controversial figure both inside and outside Israel, attracting diverse and often polar views. Many Israelis, a significant number of Jews worldwide and many foreign observers regard Sharon as a war hero and a strong leader in the fight against terrorism. On the other hand, a number of Israelis and foreign observers believe that his recent efforts have been damaging to the peace process. Sharon's supporters have described him as "a hero", "practical man", while his critics have called him a "terrorist", "lout", "sissy", and "spoiled parvenu" and sought his prosecution as a war criminal for his actions as Israeli Defense Minister during the 1982 Lebanon War. Still others have described him as a "de facto dove", and American President George W. Bush has described him as a "duly elected official in a democracy" and a "man of peace".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh well. I'm not saying this version is worse - the point I'm trying to make is this: this paragraph doesn't stop transforming. And it might never stop.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 08:56, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ten more months have passed, and it's time for another snapshot. This time, the entire paragraph that I added over a year ago and mutated so much since, has been deleted by <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmirpedia_217d.html" title="User:Amirpedia">User:Amirpedia</a> on July 12th, and nobody restored it since. What will happen now is pretty obvious - someone will add a sentence "Sharon is a war criminal", someone else will change it to a "war hero", someone will come along and write a paragraph to please them both, and a year later someone will simply delete that paragraph. And the cycle continues, <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_nauseam.html" title="Ad nauseam">ad nauseam</a>.</p>
<p>The pagraph in question, just before it was deleted, had already mutated into the following form:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sharon is a controversial figure, both inside and outside Israel, attracting diverse and often polar views. Many Israelis and supporters of Israel regard Sharon as a strong leader battling terrorism. Conversely, most Arabs and supporters of the Arab-Palestinian cause and some other critics refer to him as "the Butcher of Beirut" and have sought his prosecution as a war criminal.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
WHO'S CALL?!?!</p>
<p>Is it by this justifaction of one person that we ALL should be unable to type information about the Prime Minister? I think it it strange to have disabled us from adding and 'tweeking' information because of an opinion. It's weak.</p>

<dd>Interesting... someone calling Israel a "bandit state" and complaining about NPOV in the same post... at any rate, all the above NPOV discussions have been either resolved, or let go over 3 weeks ago; why is the POV warning still there? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 07:31, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, because your view is extremely NPOV as one can easily see, with such non-biased, non-inflammatory comments as "Why do you think the Israelies elected him? Because he was a famous arab-killer!" and "bandit state." If there is an anti-semite here, it's most certainly you.</dd>

<dd>I am certainly not going to try to imply that I know alot on this subject, but some information did come to light thanks to the president of Iran yesterday<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060105/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iran_israel_sharon_1" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060105/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iran_israel_sharon_1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sharon's provocative visit to Temple Mount</span></h2>
<p>First of, I've found lots of sources claiming that the Al-Aqsa intifada was "ignited" or "sparked" by Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount, many fewer that claims it was "started" by it. Second, Israel may very well have claimed that "the Al-Aqsa Intifada was engineered by Yasser Arafat as a leverage tool," but the source offered; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/56038.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/56038.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (a cite by Yassir Arafat in which he "warns of new intifada" from 1998) does not back up what the article states. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestine-info_15f0.html" title="User:Palestine-info">Palestine-info</a> 16:58, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Ignited" and "sparked" are inflammatory language, if you'll pardon the pun. "Started" certainly provides the same meaning in a NPOV way. As for the second issue, I've re-worded the language so the problem no longer exists, and found other references as well. Finally, you have failed to discuss your continued attempts to insert a nearly anonymous opinion piece that deals mostly with other topics in a non-contested area of the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:22, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ummm, wrongo. Ignited and sparked are 'not' identical in meaning to started. "A started B" implies that A is the primary cause of B. "A ignited or sparked B" implies that A was among many causes of B, and probably some other cause C was the primary cause. There is a clear difference in 'substance' here, not just in verbiage. --<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why do you believe "ignited" and "sparked" is inflammatory language? "Started" suggests that it was Sharon's visit alone that was the cause of the intifada. Most Palestinian sources that deal with Sharon's visit to Temple Mount explains that the climate was ripe for a second intifada and that Sharon's provocation was the event that sparked it. As for the second issue, your use of selective quoting to prove that the Palestinians started the intifada is not good. Neither are they relevant to this article which deals with Sharon, not the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_intifada_ceb7.html" title="Al-Aqsa intifada">Al-Aqsa intifada</a>. Better would be if you would like to provide a source for this sentence "Israel claimed instead that the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> was engineered by Arafat as a leverage tool." And you have to clarify which "nearly anonymous opinion piece" which I have attempted to insert. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestine-info_15f0.html" title="User:Palestine-info">Palestine-info</a> 18:59, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My google search found that "sparked" was by far the most commonly used term, and "ignited" the least commonly used term. I've changed it to "sparked". Regarding your second objection, I've re-worded and brought sources for all claims. Regarding the third, you keep trying to insert a link to an off-topic and nearly anonymous opinion piece. I don't have to tell you which one, since you keep inserting it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disengagement Plan Quotation</span></h2>
<p>It is also saddening to see a bias author who continues to remove the part that quoted Sharon's top aid saying the purpose of disangagement was to destroy Palestinian aspirations for years to come. There is no need to protect Sharon that he is, or is not a war criminal. If the reader hates Palestinians or is "anti-semetic" against Arab's, it is clear that Sharon, being the Butcher of Beirut is a great man- a hero! But if you are sympathetic to little girls and boys being murdered at the hands of this piece of pork you will have pleasure reading that there is an honest voice. <a href="../../../e/t/e/User%7EEternalsleeper_f7c1.html" title="User:Eternalsleeper">Eternalsleeper</a></p>

<dd>The Disengagement Plan is a <b>major</b> policy brainchild of Sharon's, and such insightful comments from such a top aide are extremely pertinent to criticism and and analysis of Sharone's peacemaking activities, and therefore most certainly belong in his biography.

<dd>You cannot delete this instance of legitimate analysis of Sharon's motives and policies just because there is a separate article on the Disengagement plan. The mention of the Plan in the Sharon biography is brief and only extends insofar as showing reasons for distrust of his perceived double-dealing and an analysis of his motives. It's great to link to the plan, which I have maintained, but to cut out his aid's quotation, which so clearly corroborates his critics' concerns regarding motivation and double dealing, is unjustified.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<dd>There are all sorts of legitimate quotes, both for and against this plan, and lots of other commentary as well, which is why it was included in a sub-article detailing this information. The reason for having sub-articles is to avoid the bloat in other articles. This is a biography of Sharon, not an in depth analysis of his plan, nor of what his various aides or political allies and foes said about it. Including one particular negative view of the plan in this article, while putting all other views (both positive and negative) in a sub-article, is biased and unjustified. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:57, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is a brief mention, which adequately crystalizes one of the most repeated Arab criticisms of Sharon, that of double dealing and actively trying to hinder a Palestinian State, and in no way encumbers the article with an off-topic "in depth analysis." Furthermore, the reference is an analysis of Sharon and his motives, not a biased negative-only view of the Disengagement Plan itself. By all means if you think there is another positive way of looking at this quotation, include it. Your wholesale deletion is unwarranted.

<p>I'm happy with Jayjg's edit, for the most part. I don't mind if the actual quotation is removed, since the paraphrased meaning is briefly mentioned, as well as the implied criticism of motives and such. I did have one proviso I wanted to include, however. For the uninitiated, reading "he has embarked an a risky course of unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip" might sound as if <i>full</i> control of the territory would devolve to the Palestinians, with sovereignty etc. I propose to add "while maintaining control of its borders and airspace, and reserving the option of military incursions" or a something similarly brief, to clarify the fact that Israel would still hold the territory, despite pulling out settlers and a full military garrison, until a final settlement is reached with the Palestinians. To prevent escalations of reverts of a controversial paragraph, I thought we could discuss it first before I added the sentence. Opinions?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"while maintaining control of its borders and airspace," should be enough; military incursion is an option for any country at any time. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:18, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Very well, since there were no other opinions, I went ahead and reworded the paragraph moderately. In addition to adding the borders and airspace proviso, I also decided that since the right wing's "security, military and religious grounds" of objection to the Plan were mentioned, I balanced that with the reasons why the other side supported the Plan, as a step towards ending the occupation and a final peace.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"large segments of the Israeli public"</span></h2>
<p>Palestine-info, why do you think the disengagement plan is opposed by "large segments of the Israeli public"? Which segments are these, and how large are they? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:04, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>These segments are liberal and conservative-leaning Jewish citizens of Israel. How many they are, I don't know but they are loud and arranges lots of demonstrations.

<p>Although this requires more research for a definitive assessment of the relative sizes of the pro and con camps (of the Disengagement), the impression I got from international news coverage was that a moderate majority of Israelis support the withdrawal, and settler activists and their sympathizers have been leading the opposition. While vocal, I would not call them a majority. I have no polls to cite; as I said it requires more research to say definitively. I suggest that for the contested phrase, polls and/or noteworthy news sources be found, cited and incorporated into the article.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<p>The articles citing the polls are very biased and they do not even mention what question was asked. Neither do they mention if their statistics include the "don't know" category. You get more clues that tell you that the support can't be overwhelming when you read about 150,000+ demonstrations against it. Or that "49% view the threat of a civil war in Israel ensuing from the plan’s implementation as high" [ <a href="http://www.jewishtoronto.net/content_display.html?ArticleID=142079" class="external free" title="http://www.jewishtoronto.net/content_display.html?ArticleID=142079" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishtoronto.net/content_display.html?ArticleID=142079</a>] Or "50% for disengagement plan" <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/jpost1403.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/jpost1403.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Knowing all this, I think we can assume that the plan does not have an absolute majority behind it and that something like 25-50% of the Israeli population opposes it.

<p>It seems like your criticism has changed from "cite your sources" then "you are incorrect" to now "the paragraph is to verbose."

<dd>Well, there are a plethora of right-wing parties in the Kenesset that do not support the Disengagement. In my opinion, we ought to mention only the prime minister's own party's bitter opposition (since this is his biography) and leave out "other MK's", which after all come under "right wing Israelis." As for the following contested sentence: <i>"The Israeli public is currently divided on the question of disengagement with the part favouring disengagement having a slight lead over those that opposes it. Call have been made both from within the knesset and from grassroot organisations to hold a national referendum over this question which they feel is very important to the future of Israel."</i> My vote would be to drop it. Besides it being grammatically <i>cumbersome</i>, I believe it delves too much into the nuances of the Disengagement Plan without being directly pertinent to the Sharon biography. I did some trimming to shorten the paragraph as well. Mentioning George Bush and Javier Solana seems verbose, I shortened it to the US and EU. I also reverted anon user 69.86.1.73's change of "involvement in" to "found indirectly respoponsible for" because the section on Sabra and Shatila is self-contained and the change, especially in quotation marks, is confusing. Palestine-info, if it were not for you, there would be no mention of the Dov Weisglass controversy at all. It is an invaluable measure of Sharon's alleged secret motives. Nevertheless, I am grateful that through compromise and consensus, it was trimmed down and the full details transferred to the Disengagement article. Perhaps you can look at this analysis of the Israeli public opposition in the same light. Let's keep it trim here in the Sharon Biography and move deeper analysis to the sub-article.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S.

<dd>I am in general agreement with AlladinSE's latest changes (even though he has reverted some of my changes as well). As I've repeated in a number of commments, this biography of Sharon is too verbose as it is, focussing too much on details which are already better covered in other articles. AlladinSE is also correct that though there are a number of parties opposing the plan, they are all right-wing parties. My only concern at this point is regarding the "bitter" opposition; I find these kinds of descriptors to be POV by their very nature. As well, the latest opinion polls have 60% of Likud supporters supporting the plan, almost identical to the support levels for Israelis as a whole. It is those to the right of Likud who oppose it at much higher percentages. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:55, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not agree that the use of the word is intrinsically POV. I watched the Likud party HQ meeting on TV when the Plan was being discussed. There were angry shouts and scuffles, and the PM was handed an embarrassing defeat from his own party. I would describe what happened as very bitter indeed. Nevertheless, I was unaware that a majority of Likud have shifted to favour the Plan. I understood that since the time they voted it down (and Sharon proceeded anyway) that a majority still opposed it. If support is now really at 60%, then I will drop my attachment to the "bitter" adjective, or propose a change a long the lines of "However, it has been greeted, <b>at least initially</b>, with bitter opposition from within his own Likud party."--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

If not, I'll remove the reference and the tag. If there is a source, I'll add it and remove the tag. At any rate, thanks Lagavulin for sharing your concerns in Talk.

<dd>Thanks, I guess my concern is that it is possible to ascribe horrible nicknames to any prominent figure. And saying "some say" or "it is alleged" or whatever doesn't really change the fact that it is unencyclopedic. I personally believe what happened in Lebanon in 1982 or whenever was disgraceful and unjustified but it doesn't mean I should be able to label him a butcher in an aricle required to be neutral. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagavulin_e51e.html" title="User:Lagavulin">Lagavulin</a> 00:20, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added two sources, (and removed the tag) and I think you'll agree that they're big wigs.

Not to mention a whole lot of highly partisan blogs. But I think the epithet is referenced by enough reputable sources to allow it to stand the way it is, i.e. clearly stating that he is a controversial figure, and has been and is called this by the whole Arab world and then some. Do you think this is sufficient, or are you of a mind to introduce an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_comment_fd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for comment">RFC</a> on the matter? --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 00:35, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Saying there are sources to describe him as a "butcher" does not cut it, I'm sorry. I don't care if his wife called him the Butcher of Beirut. It doesn't mean anything. It's just an emotive label used by political opponents. If you do a Google search on "miserable failure" you will come up with George W Bush. Now I find that very funny as it happens but does it mean it's legitimate to assert Bush is a "miserable failure"? No. It's just some crafty bloggers and a valueless opinion. I couldn't imagine a less encyclopedic entry than this whole article. So please don't remove the tag, there are serious factual errors and major bias going on here. Not sure what a RFC is but if it can bring in neutral writers that would be great. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagavulin_e51e.html" title="User:Lagavulin">Lagavulin</a> 00:38, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm surprised you returned the tag despite the sources. Remember, the article is not labeling him this way, only reporting that the epithet is widely used, and by whom, with sources. Also, your parallel to Bush does not apply. <i>The Butcher of Beirut</i> derived out of severe and specified battles and massacres. This is not to say that he is guilty beyond doubt, but the phrase is certainly an indication of one POV, which is presented alongside the opposing POV, that of the war hero. That's the Wikipedia NPOV way, present both sides. I will not remove the tag as long as fresh ideas are being discussed. As for the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_comment_fd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for comment">RFC</a>, I wiki linked it earlier so you can read about it if you are unfamiliar. Also, please list all your concerns besides this one, but please read all the earlier Talk discussions, as much of your concerns might have already been thrashed out previously.

<dd>Sorry didn't mean to surprise. I understand the source of the term. I reject its use in any form in an encyclopedia article that aspires above all else to be neutral. And you know he probably was guilty of what happened in Lebanon but that doesn't justify the use of such emotive terms. I understand and welcome your comments about having both POV's but the viewpoint asserting Sharon did the wrong thing in Lebanon can be put much less emotively than calling him a "butcher." Will read up on the RFC thing and will start writing a (lengthy) list of the issues with this article.

<p>Lagavulin, I think I understand your concern, but it is entirely misdirected here. The article does <i>not</i> call Sharon the “Butcher of Beirut,” it merely reports that he is called that by a wide swath of critics and detractors, specifically in a controversial and non-universal sense. We can no more censor this information than we can remove all reference to "Ivan the Terrible" from the article about Tsar <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_IV_of_Russia_e7f2.html" title="Ivan IV of Russia">Ivan IV of Russia</a>. <a href="../../../c/v/a/User%7ECvaneg_e729.html" title="User:Cvaneg">CVaneg</a>'s examples above are also good examples.

If it takes a long time to compile, I hope you will not insist on the Tag while we wait for it. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 03:29, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The whole reason this un-encyclopedic insult is in the article is because <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">User:Alberuni</a> kept trying to find epithets to described Sharon.

<p>You are very funny Jayjg but make a serious point. Butcher may be justified in loose chitchat but it isn't acceptable in any encyclopedia article. As questionable as Sharon's role in Lebanon was and it is appropriate to record what happened in Lebanon and Sharon's role in it, it is not necessary to tag him butcher or bastard or barbarian or whatever else would spring to mind if we were talking about it over my favorite drink.</p>
<p>Can someone delete this, I find much more in the article that is equally unencyclopedic. Sharon is obviously terribly controversial but pouring unmeasured scorn on him makes a real and critical (in its true sense) evaluation of him in the article impossible. Wikipedia - as I have said a few times - is growing in stature all the time. Let's accept the responsibility that imposes and get rid of the hyperbole and hatred even from contentious articles such as this one. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagavulin_e51e.html" title="User:Lagavulin">Lagavulin</a> 20:52, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC) PS I'm still working on the list of problems for you to consider.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jayjg, you can mention all those epithets in all of those articles if the term is used by a significant number of people and reported as such by a significant number of Media. As long as, like this article, it is clear that we are only reporting what is said and not the article itself that is describing them thus. This article mentioned the usage of the phrase while specifically denoting it's controversial nature. The invasion of Lebanon and the Sabra and Shitila massacres were bloody affairs, it's not a stretch that an emotive phrase like that will develop from the other side. The reference is sourced and presented neutrally, so unless somebody has something new to add not already covered in Talk, my inclination is to move on. This was the result of consensus after all, and much improved over what was originally proposed, as we can see by Jayjg's account. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 03:57, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aladdin, I'm sorry but just because you can find a signifigant group of people that refer to someone using a epitat does not mean it should be in the encyclopedia. Why don't we refer to Sharon as a "Kyke", I could probably find quite a bit of literature and references that people indeed do refer to him as a kyke. No matter what info you provide that the epitat is not universal, it shopuild still not be there.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 02:19, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Moshe, I just discovered these remarks, so many months after the above consensus was reached. I discovered them today after I noticed that the sourced remarks have been censored again. Please refer to my remarks above, but to specifically respond to your question as to why we don't refer to Sharon by the racial slur "Kyke", that is because it <i>is</i> a racial slur and you'll not find <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> that will ever reference such racist material.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More questions/problems with the article</span></h2>
<p>Among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly was Sharon's political career prior to 1977? The first parts of the article claim he was a right-winger, joining Likud in 1973, while the section on politics claims he didn't join with Likud until 1977, and actually courted left-wing parties early on. How to reconcile these?</li>
<li>Is there a reference for his dismissal in 1974? In particular, for it being due to his political views?</li>
<li>The end section strongly takes the viewpoint that Sharon is a right-winger withdrawing from Gaza as a political ploy. While this is a view people hold, it is definitely only one of two views—most Israeli right-wingers actually oppose his withdrawal plan, and some have even called him a traitor for it. The article should reflect that better</li>

<p>Okay, so when this article is unprotected you will not mind that I put in a sentence in an appropriate place saying that Sharon has expressed a desire to grab as much land as possible, perhaps in the bit about how he has worked to wreck the peace process, and using this as my source? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:44, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please try to remember, this is a brief article outlining the man's entire life. And it hardly seems relevant now, since his policies have changed; rather, it seems like an attempt to push a POV. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:04, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Do you have quotes that you can source appropriately that show that he has changed this position? The POV that I am "pushing" is that Sharon has supported a landgrab by the settlers, which is not consonant with the "roadmap" or any other approach to peace that involves Palestinian autonomy in the disputed territories. It's a key issue about Sharon, Jay. His position on the settlements is much discussed -- in connection both with the Gaza pullout and with the West Bank. I'm not suggesting we include our own analysis of it, of course, but I think that trying to exclude mention of his views on the settlements is a bit fishy. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 23:57, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Um, the fact that he now supports removing all settlers from the Gaza Strip despite fierce opposition from within his own party would indicate that he no longer holds this position. The settler movement now considers him to be a traitor. If you feel the you need to promote his earlier views, you need to balance them with his current views. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:06, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that his change of position over Gaza shows that he has changed his mind. It's just a tactical thing, Jay. I think it's reasonably clear that he feels that he can sacrifice Gaza to hang on to more of the West Bank and all of Jerusalem. He understands that by giving some he can paint the Palestinians as the incalcitrant party in negotiations. Hey, we gave them Gaza but they still won't give up their claim on Jerusalem. That kind of thing. But having said that (which I wouldn't want included unless it is sourced, of course, I don't expect my personal analysis of Sharon's motives to be any part of our article), I don't see why one wouldn't include that as a counterargument. If you can find him saying that he's changed his mind about grabbing land, you could include that. If you can find a reputable source who claims that Gaza represents a change of heart across the board, you could include that. The whole issue is certainly interesting. It poses a lot of questions that are not simply answered. It certainly shouldn't be ignored though, and that particular quote is taken to be indicative of Sharon's general attitude to the settlers, who he has generally encouraged, I think you'd have to agree. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:04, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>Grace Note, I believe it is factually imprecise that the Palestinians do not have any claims for the sovereign territories of Israel. These claims and Israeli demands in the West Bank are still under negotiation and are in fact, next to Jerusalem, probably the toughest issues. It is very early to discuss what an Arab Palestinian state will look like, if and mostly when established. Also, this is not so much the place for such discussions, but rather the place to discuss Ariel Sharon. I understand and share your concerns. The situation is rather worrisome for all people in the area and beyond. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb"><font color="green">gidonb</font></a> 18:15, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The removal of quotes by Jayjg is disturbing. He has done this to every Israeli politician article I have added quotes to, and has called it "vandalism" even when it comes out of Israeli/American sources. Maybe he should try to accept that Israeli politicians aren't perfect angels and that they do say some offensive things.

<p>Article currently says <i>"Gur died in October 1967 after being shot while playing with his father's rifle"</i>. My assumption is that the rifle discharged whilst he was playing with it, the shot killing him.

<p>I hope I did not just violate a rule. When I came upon the Ariel Sharon article, it consisted of a single word, the famous four-letter Anglo-Saxon dirty word. (Literary reference, "A Christmas Story": "Only I did't say 'fudge.' I said THE word.") In looking at the history, this vandalistic act had been the most recent edit. The edit before that was the placement of a "protection" tag, which obviously did not protect the page from the vandal. (I have not yet figured out whether "protected" pages are actually physically protected, or if it is "just" a rule that you are not supposed to edit a protected page.) However, in looking at the version where the page had been "protected," there had also been some edits made that substituted the "/" symbol for a number of other characters. I could not figure out whether that was a good or a bad thing but it sure did not look correct to me. Therefore when I reverted the f-word, I went back to the edit before THAT -- which means in effect that I removed the "protection" tag. If I have done something incorrect, someone please fix it because I do not know how. My only intention was to get the article back to the last fully intact version. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 14:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
