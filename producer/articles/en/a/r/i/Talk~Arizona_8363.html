<p>Just reading the section on climate in Phoenix. As it is getting hotter I find this sentence hard to believe, "The summer months of May through August bring a dry heat ranging from 90–100°F (32–38°C)". The website weather.com has a projected high temperature of 98°F tomorrow and it's only May 1st. Being a native for over 20 years I'd have to say the summer temperature range is usually more something like 95°F-115°F. Maybe 15°F doesn't seem to be that big of a deal but you can definitely feel it.</p>

<dd>No, that's New Mexico. Arizona as a whole has no official language, although large chunks do, for example the official language of the Navajo Nation, which includes a very significant portion of Arizona in the north, is <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navajo_language.html" title="Navajo language">Navajo</a>; the official language of the Tohono O'odham Nation, which takes up a very significant portion in the south, is <a href="../../../o/27/o/O%27odham_language.html" title="O'odham language">Tohono O'odham</a>, the official language on Hopi, an enclave in the Navajo reservation, is Hopi. Other large tracts of land with official languages include the San Carlos Apache and White Mountain Apache reservations which border one another, whose official language is Western Apache ("Coyotero Apache"), the Havasupai reservation whose official language is Havasupai, and the Walapai Nation whose official language is Walapai. In fact, the Havasupai Reservation is to my knowledge the only Indian reservation in the US where every single person knows the language fluently, this is partially due to the fact that most of the people there live at the bottom of a canyon. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 22:53, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arizona's official language is English (Article 28 of the Arizona Constitution) but most of the provisions of Article 28 is unenforcable.

<p>Removed: Spanish words "árida zona" ("arid zone"). <i>This would be grammatically incorrect however, since in Spanish, the noun precedes the adjective</i> In Spanish it is possible for the adjective to precede the noun.

With some adjectives it is even mandatory to place them before the noun (the translation of "a great man" into Spanish is "un gran hombre". "Un hombre grande" would mean "a big man").</p>

<p>This comment does not belong on this page, but on the main page for Mormonism or a page about Mormon temples. The construction of the temple in and of itself may be an <i>effect</i> of Mormon settlement, but it is not really relevant to state history as a whole. Mormon settlement has already been described in the preceding sentence. This "ta-da" about the temple is self-congratulatory — notice that the grammatical subject is the temple and not the state of Arizona's history or any other relevant item. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeeves_f660.html" title="User:Jeeves">Jeeves</a> 18:34, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was wondering the same thing, the editor who added it seemed to have some trouble with the wording, eg. he kept duplicating the sentence about the cession, when it turned out his real intent was to blank out the mention of the fact that the US paid Mexico a small sum for the land in 1848. (Why blank this info?) But looking at the history, the very first incarnation of his edit said the name of the Mexican state was 'Sonora', then after it wa reverted and it reappeared a minute later, it read 'Vieja California'... Maybe 'Sonora' is what he meant, and he somehow got confused? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 11:59, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Jinmex for the map, that is a good source. However, please stop removing information regarding payment for land after the cession, you can reword it a little, but there was a monitary transaction for the land aquired.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>I fear the issue was a little more complex than a "monetary transaction for land acquired". Depending on the historical and political view point, it was not a purchase, but an occupation of a sovereign nation that was later "compensated" with a ridiculous amount. By the way, this was a viewpoint shared by many US citizens at the time, and Henry David Thoreau even went to prison over this war. But this issue really does not have to be resolved here, does it? I would suggest just dropping it and leaving it to pages like "Mexican Cession" and "Mexican-American War". <a href="../../../u/l/i/User%7EUlises_Criollo_3bc2.html" title="User:Ulises Criollo">Ulises Criollo</a> 15:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The arguement, though is not whether it is considered a ridiculous amount or not, but simply the fact that a monitary transaction took place for the land.

<dd>Since this aspect seems to be of such importance to you, may I invite you to familiarise yourself at greater depth with this episode of U.S. history? An interesting starting point might be Howard Zinn's publication "A People's History of the United States", which has a readable chapter on the U.S.-Mexican War.

<dd>Although I may not be able to quote verbatim the timeline of the U.S.-Mexican War, I assure you that I do have a good understanding of the events that unfolded. I only questioned your use of the Mexican state names because until today I do not recall seeing them elsewhere. I stood accurately corrected with a good source (your posting of the Map). Thank you for the suggestion, but I will respectfully decline in reading that publication. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECascadia_2509.html" title="User:Cascadia"><b>Cascadia</b></a><a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECascadia_41b3.html" title="User talk:Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>TALK</b></sup></font></a><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;">|</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cascadia_299d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>HISTORY</b></sup></font></a> 19:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry if my remark sounded rather snide -- it was not meant to be. I believe that in light of the wall the U.S. are building along its Mexican frontier and in light of the present situation of Latinos in states like Arizona (see the incredibly biased section on "Illegal Immigration"), it is highly illuminating to take a look at the historical aspects of the relationship between the two countries. It's not about timelines and military moves, but about a historical context that reaches into the present and puts such seemingly irrelevant details as a token payment for an annexed territory into a larger perspective.

<dd>I understand that there are issues about the War that have a much more historical context and bring up certain opinions depending on which side of the issue one is on. I recognize this in it's entirety, and respect the fact that those are there. If I recall correctly, the US Army in the Southwest was nearly obliterated and had not Santa Cruz (name not 100% sure of) been called back to Cuidad de Mexico to restore order, would've been able to hold off much longer against the US Army. Had that event not happened, I wouldn't be a Phoenecian. The point I'm making with this is just pointing out I understand the historical aspects, however, when an event happens, it happens, and to cover it up is doing an injustice. That is why when I rewrote the sentance, I tried not to say anything to the effect of "Mexico recieved a hefty sum" or "Plenty of cash for the land" because the facts are that they did not. However, the event did occur. Whether someone feels for or against it is irrelevent, per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECascadia_2509.html" title="User:Cascadia"><b>Cascadia</b></a><a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECascadia_41b3.html" title="User talk:Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>TALK</b></sup></font></a><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;">|</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cascadia_299d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>HISTORY</b></sup></font></a> 19:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me disagree one last time, then I'll shut up. 1. You are not a Phoenician because one general won and another lost a battle, but because successive US-adminstrations in Washington DC systematically worked to enlarge the US-territory at the cost first of Nueva España (Florida) and then of the new-founded Mexican Republic (Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, etc., etc.). 2. There is no such thing as a historical fact. History is a narrative told from a certain viewpoint with certain interests regarding the present and the future. To realise this is to be able to articulate one's own interests in the present and the future. This is a rather far excursion, given the insignificance of the original intervention, and before it goes even further, I will leave it at that or suggest that we move it to a private discussion.

<p>Illegal immigration is a highly contested issue. The section on the subject does not cite any of its sources and makes speculative connections, for instance on the relationsip between illegal immigration and crime. It remains unspecific in giving no numbers and few facts. It could be improved trying to name (and cite) different social groups and their positions on the matter to make it clear that the issue is debated and to be able to see who says what on the matter, by citing official statics on numbers of illegal immigrants and by naming the measures the state as well as racist organisations take against illegal immigration.

<dd>"The use of professional smugglers to ferry people across the border illegally is also increasing, see: people smuggling. Such smuggling operations are known to also often be associated with the cross-border illicit drug trade and have caused a wave of crime in Southwestern states." This portion, which you've refered to, does not make a direct relationship between illegal aliens and crime, instead the fact that Coyote organizations are frequently associated with illicit drug trade and other criminal activities. I'll see if I can dig up some statistics that will show the factual information. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECascadia_2509.html" title="User:Cascadia"><b>Cascadia</b></a><a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECascadia_41b3.html" title="User talk:Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>TALK</b></sup></font></a><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;">|</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cascadia_299d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>HISTORY</b></sup></font></a> 20:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would also be helpful to be more specific about who says what. "Proponents of the changes in policy argue..." neither makes it clear what the actual policy is, who these "proponents of changes" are, and what they propose instead. "Accurate numbers that can effectively support either side of the argument are rare..." -- from the text it did not become clear to me that there actually were two positions, and what they consisted in. In general, it seemed to me that the section takes one thing for granted: that illegal immigration is a problem that has to be dealt with. But that in itself is a disputed political position, isn't it? Since I am not from the area, I cannot contribute to improving this section, I can merely draw attention to these deficits and their implications. Jinmex 20:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The general consensus is that yes, illegal immigration is a problem that has to be dealt with. That is merely the general consensus. There is a vocal oppostion to this, primarily consisting of people from Hispanic decent, who feel there should be open borders. There is even an element of that latter group that wish to return Aztlan to Mexico. I'll see about making it less ambiguous. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECascadia_2509.html" title="User:Cascadia"><b>Cascadia</b></a><a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECascadia_41b3.html" title="User talk:Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>TALK</b></sup></font></a><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;">|</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cascadia_299d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>HISTORY</b></sup></font></a> 20:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you so beautifully detailed in the discussion above, there are some historical facts not to be ignored. One of them being that the US occupied Mexico City and forced Mexico to give up almost half its territory. "Taking possession" is a nice euphemism that glosses over some inconvenient historical facts, and we are not going to do that, are we? Especially if the sadly misnamed article "Mexican-American War" spells out these very same facts. And please beware of the word "vandalism": the way you use this word is worthy of the best ideologue.

<dd>The article is supposed to remain adherent to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Historians refer to the war as the "Mexican-American War". Although those south of the border may see it a certain way, and those north of the border see it another, an attempt to add anti-American rhetoric adds a POV. Stating the facts, that the US took possession of the land after the conflict is neutral, as it implies nothing more than the facts of the situation. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECascadia_2509.html" title="User:Cascadia"><b>Cascadia</b></a><a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECascadia_41b3.html" title="User talk:Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>TALK</b></sup></font></a><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;">|</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cascadia_299d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>HISTORY</b></sup></font></a> 22:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is US historians and US historians only who refer to this war as the "Mexican-American War", though it is good international custom to name the aggressor first. I believe en.wikipedia is an international project and a medium for all who speak English as a first or second language and should therefore make a serious attempt to take international historiography into account. Accounts that the US offered to buy territory from the Mexican government before occupying it have been greatly exaggerated and it represent a century-long attempt by US-historians to beautify a war of aggression that apparently continues to cause great uneasiness. Mexican historians represent the matter in a very different light which is just as legitimate as the US point of view -- Francisco Martín Moreno's <i>México mutilado</i> is only one recent booklength study of the matter. Historical facts are always positional. I believe it is the task of an international encyclopedia to integrate these conflicting positions and get beyond the various parochialisms to post-nationalist estimations that reflect the interests of a reader in India, Australia or Great Britain as much as those of a US reader. <a href="../../../u/l/i/User%7EUlises_Criollo_3bc2.html" title="User:Ulises Criollo">Ulises Criollo</a> 16:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no such "good international custom" you speak of to "name an aggressor first" when naming wars! Where did you get that idea? There isn't even "international custom" on who the aggressor is for many wars! I think the name has more to do with euphony, for example Franco-Prussion war just rolls off the tongue more readily than "Prusso-French war" or "American-Mexican war" which sound awkward. The term "Franco-Prussian war" isn't meant to slight either side or to make any implicationabout who started the war, whatsoever. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also from what I can tell from the interwikis, the Slavic languages and French are the only languages that call it "American Mexican war", all other languages with the exception of Iberian ones call it "Mexican American war". <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Franco-Prussian War is correct, because it was Napoleon III. who declared this war. And as you can see from your own list, the number of languages that use the term US-Mexican War is quite considerable. British historians, by the way, also call it the US-Mexican War. <a href="../../../u/l/i/User%7EUlises_Criollo_3bc2.html" title="User:Ulises Criollo">Ulises Criollo</a> 20:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see it as highly hypocritical that you seek to promote Mexican historical account as accurate, and US historical account as inaccurate. I believe, from evidence I have seen both here on Wikipedia and elsewhere, that there is a calculated effort to assert certain beliefs that are held in Mexico as being accurate, and the United States accounts as inaccurate and highly biased (evidenced by the continued attempt to refer to the Mexican-American war as the "War of Northern Agression"). Although I am compelled to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, I am further compelled to prevent any further effort of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconquista_%28Mexico%29_48b5.html" title="Reconquista (Mexico)">Reconquista (Mexico)</a>, whether it be by preventing Wikipeida from being a launching point of historically inaccurate or increadibly biased viewpoints, <s>or by physical means</s>.
