<p>The science section has been altered since the comment in the next paragraph. It has taken out the Russell bias, and now seems quite balanced. Any thoughts on improving it further?</p>
<p>As someone already pointed, the whole business of the evil influence of Aristotle in saintly Science should be revised; or at least, discussed. It was quite fashionable back in the day, when men of rather limited learning, such as Einstein (who thought Aristotle's influence in natural sciences lasted for almost 2000 years...), or limited and ill-intended, such as the disgustingly egocentric Bertrand Russell, proclaimed it; although Émile Boutroux had eloquently written against that well before their age. The physical, and general, views of Aristotle don't really influence Western thought until Pietro Pomponazzi. Scholastic Aristotle is very, very limited and transformed. This anti-scientific Aristotle is a travesty created in the Renaissance (ironically, the age of the aforementioned thinker), and the influence of the true one doesn't really start until much earlier than Galileo. Of course I'm overlooking some issues, but for now this is just intended to be food for thought.</p>

<p>I will let someone else find an appropriate, if any, place for the following text in the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotle was the first to describe the "dancing" of bees, "on reaching the hive they throw off their load [<i>aposeiontai</i> 'they shake themselves'], and each bee on his [sic] return is accompanied by three or four companions," and the first to classify dolphins with mammals, "The dolphin, when taken out of water, gives a squeak and moans in the air...For this creature has a voice, for it is furnished with a lung nad a windpipe; but its tongue is not loose, nor has it lips, so as to give utterance to an articulate sound." Quoted in <i>Essays in Zoosemiotics</i> by T.A. Sebeok, ISSN 08385858</li>

<p>I've added the Greek form of the name 'Aristotle', both in Greek characters and romanisation. I've also remove the mention of the form in Italian and other languages, which I don't think is of interest to English speakers, and is covered by romanised form of the Greek. <a href="../../../m/2E/e/User%7EM.e_04b3.html" title="User:M.e">m.e.</a> 09:51, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering if I could really clean up this page a bit, specifically under the section titled "Biography." It's long and informative, but in my opinion it needs some editing. Some of the sentences are structured in a format that seems outdated and certainly is not used on most Wikipedia pages. So I was wondering if I could 'get permission' from someone to edit the section, keeping the info, maybe adding some of my own, but changing the sentence structure.</p>
<p>Second, I think it would be a good idea to open a section discussing his actual ideas and theories instead of just methodology and influence. It would have to be divided into subsections like 'Politics,' 'Physics,' 'Embryology,' and 'Ethics,' and that way a lot of miscellaneous information, like the bit on zoology posted above, could be fit into the article properly. Unfortunately, I'd need a little help on this since a) I'm not an expert on Aristotle and b) I'm very inexperienced at Wikipedia contributions. Any volunteers? <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrutannica_6161.html" title="User:Brutannica">Brutannica</a> 00:28, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right, so so far no one's "volunteered." I won't do part 2 now, but I will go ahead and rewrite the Biography.

<p>I see you have reverted the reversion. I am confused.

<p>Well, now I see a sense in which the numeric values are correct! Or they seem to be; it still doesn't seem clear. Anyway, if there really are no mnemonics that correctly give breathings and all, then then one would <i>have</i> to use numerics, at least for those cases.</p>
<p>This is definitely out of my depth. I'm not going to interfere more, now that I understand the problem. Perhaps my reversion should be reverted!</p>
<p>But it would be a really good thing if the people involved in getting Greek text into the articles would go over to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpecial_characters_2cd7.html" title="Wikipedia:Special characters">Wikipedia:Special_characters</a> and start a discussion on its Discussion page. It may be recommending a policy that just doesn't work, and a lot of future trouble could be prevented if it were fixed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDandrake_fb42.html" title="User:Dandrake">Dandrake</a> 01:05, Aug 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As an example of Aristotle's influence on Alexander, it could be mentioned that while Stageira was destroyed earlier by Macedonia, it was rebuilt at Aristotle's request.

<dd>According to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stageira.html" title="Stageira">Stageira</a>, it was both destroyed and rebuilt by Philip.

<p>Possibly the most over-rated thinker ever to grace humanity:- a morally repugnant and simplistic man, whose nonsense padded greatest hits are valuable only in their virtue as mildly absorbent bog roll. Aristotle offers to the modern thinker what Vanilla Ice offered to the discerning music lover, a man whose greatest achievement is considered to be the dragging out of 1 simple phrase (everything in moderation) over several hundred pages. Perhaps more amazing than the fact he eluded public ridicule in his own time is that scholars around theworld are still content in massaging his swollen dead ego.

<p>The depiction of Aristotelian science is a parody, and quite false; Darwin considered Aristotle the greatest biologist before Linnaeus and an actual reading of his biological works proves that he was a consummate observationalist. The idea that you can learn how the world works by reason without experiment is from PLATO, not Aristotle, and Aristotle argued AGAINST such a view.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. As his <i>Oxford Classical Dictionary</i> entry points out, for example, his description of the embryology of some fishes was rediscovered as empirically accurate only in the 20th c. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 20:28, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ummm...there seems to be a big misunderstanding underlying the entire discussion of Aristotle's science here. Aristotle was not an empiricist but a rationalist (and a very strong one at that). While he certainly thought that empirical study and observation was necessary for arriving at knowledge, it is reason (nous) and reason alone that grasps universal truths. And, as knowledge in the strict sense is, for Aristotle, confined to these universal truths and the truths that can be derived from them, all knowledge, in the strict sense, is grasped by reason alone. Aristotle will use the term "knowledge" (episteme) in a debased sense to refer to the cognitive state of a man of experience, but he distinguishes this from true knowledge. The first chapter of the Metaphysics is perhaps the clearest presentation of this fact, but the last chapter of posterior analytics does as well. Also, Michael Frede's paper "Aristotle's Rationalism" makes a very strong case for this point.</p>

<p>This is not a particularly important issue, especially considering the influence this great man had on our world, but wasn't Aristotle homosexual?

<dd>I know that Aristotle had a wife and son, ie: a heterosexual relationship. There is no evidence that he had a homosexual relationship, but given the ancient Greek attitudes, it remains a possibility--that is all I was saying.</dd>
<dd>The <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicomachean_Ethics_1419.html" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a> does not discuss sexuality at all and may have been addressed to his son. Perhaps more likely is the possibility that it was addressed to all students at the Lyceum. It was compiled from a series of lectures Aristotle gave: the compilers may have dedicated the series to Nicomachus because Nicomachus had inherited the Lyceum from Aristotle.</dd>

<p>It's not quite true that the Nicomachean Ethics never discusses sexuality. He includes sexual pleasure in his discussion of moderation; he conclusion is that we have to strike a balance between too much and too little sexual pleasure. With regards to homosexuality, in his discussion of friendship, Aristotle does give quite a bit of attention to the relationship between 'lover' and 'beloved' (that is, the pederastic relationship you have all been talking about). He argues that because the older man wants pleasure, and the youth wants other benefits, their friendship can't last as long, or be based as deeply on the participants' personalities, as perfect, "virtue" friendship.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you're right. (my excuse for getting this wrong is...) It can be difficult to tell what sorts of relationships Aristotle is talking about. He isn't very explicit about differences between sexual and nonsexual friendship, or distinguishing between heterosexual and pederastic love. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 17:23, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This illustrates Greek attitudes generally. love between men was more idealised than that between men and women, and there was no ditinction between 'homosexuals' and 'hetrosexuals'. look at the 'friendships' between Patroclus and Achilles or Alexander and Hephaistion.

<p>I have significantly expanded the ethics section of the article (including a reference) and made some other organizational changes.

<dd>Until this reorganization, the main article on Aristotelian ethics was <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicomachean_Ethics_1419.html" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>. I believe that it should stay there unless someone thinks that there are significant differences or additions to Aristotle's ethics that can not be found mostly in the NicEth, but in his other works (such as <a href="../../../e/u/d/Eudemian_Ethics_1268.html" title="Eudemian Ethics">Eudemian Ethics</a>). Removal of most of the ethics section to NicEth would reduce the new length of this article considerably.</dd>
<dd>Many of your additions would be welcome over there, or could be merged over there. Other bits duplicate things which are already over there, but it always helps to have several people look and try to find the best way of explaining things.</dd>
<dd>Some parts sound really good but I'm just not sure where they come from, and could use a reference. The 'Developing Ethics' section is one of these.

Take the information I've added here and the general details from the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicomachean_Ethics_1419.html" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a> page and combine them into <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotelian_ethics.html" title="Aristotelian ethics">Aristotelian ethics</a>. Leave the specific information (the "Overview" section) on the Nico page there as a subpage of the general ethics page. I think that would make more sense going from very general (<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>) to one subset of his philosophy (Aristotelian ethics) to a book that teaches this subset (Nicomachean Ethics). What do you think? If you're ok with it, I'll make the changes and then we can tweak.</dd>

<p>Nearly all of the content of the section titled "Aristotle's metaphysics" discusses topics that he treats in detail in the work traditionally called the <i>Physics</i>, not the work traditionally called the <i>Metaphysics</i>. (Aristotle does mention the four causes in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, but he refers the reader to the <i>Physics</i> for a detailed discussion.) This is, it seems to me, a potential source of confusion, so perhaps the section should be titled "Aristotle's <i>Physics</i>" (and references by Bekker number for the quotations would be nice). Also, it's a shame not to have any discussion of at least the subect matter of the <i>Metaphysics</i> on the main page (namely, the problem of first principles, which he solves quite differently in the <i>Metaphysics</i> than in the <i>Topics</i> [the comment about <i>endoxa</i> in the opening of the article should probably also be revised: Aristotle would have empatically denied that in general he was interested in "non-contradiction" and that he <i>wasn't</i> interested in "Truth"], the problem of substance [which he solves by rethinking form and matter as actuality and potentiality, respectively], and the problem of theology, as well as some miscellaneous comments about other philosophers and some less influential material on mathematical questions [number as form, &amp;c.]). If this sounds good, or at least doesn't sound objectionable, to everyone, I'll make some changes along these lines when next I drop by this page.

<p>Aritotles was the first truly cosmopolitan thinker. He was interested in almost everything. He studied at Ploto's Academy. Aristotle's philosophy is to see it as a development of what plato began. Aristotle rejected Plato's metaphysical dualism, namely Plato's separation of the Form from the material world. Plato's primary reality was the unchanging world of Form that exists apart from the world of particular things. Aristotle beleieved he could avoid introducing this unnecessary duplication of the one and only world that exists and still explain everything Plato tried to explain with his separate Forms. The central issue in Aristotle's disagreement with Plato's theory of the Form was Plato's insistence on thier separate exsistance. Aristotle continued to believe that Forms or universal exist, and he believed that the Form are the only proper objects of human knowledge. Aristotle brought Plato's Forms down to earth. He brought Plato's two worlds tpgerther. Plato's primary reality was the separate world of the Forms and Aristotle's primary reality was the world of paticular. Plato's thinking was always directed upward the ideal world, Aristotle's attention was directed toward this world, one benefit of his approach is the extent to which it encourages the development of scientific thinking. Like Plato's Form, Aristotle's Form is an unchanging essence. But unlike Plato's, Aristotle's Form is an essential part of the substance it composes. Source from "Life's Ultimate Questions" Ronald H. Nash</p>

<p>I want to ask about a particular sentence, "Aristotle was the first to recognize about causality" But, Buddha (Siddharta Gautama) who lived in India in 600-500 BC has taught about this. Aristotle lived in about 300 BC. I think it need to be fixed. Andrew 12:28, May 30, 2006.</p>
<p>Many of Aristotle's "own" philosophical thaughts are actually taken from India. If you compare ie. the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Veda</a> and Dhama Pada by <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> with Aristotle, you will find many thing that have been stolen, as he, as far as I know, never referred to these sources. The proof I have for this allegations is that Aristotle stayed in India for som while he was teacher to Alexandr and the sources I refer to are older than aristotle. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeep750_386c.html" title="User:Deep750">Dhirad</a> 18:24, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A section on Aristotle's work in Biology would be useful, mainly because his theories were important for the development first of creationism and then of evolutionary theory: basically his grouping of the world into animal, vegetable and mineral, and his development of the scale of nature.

<p>I believe we could improve the section about logic. The "History" part is ok, and I don't really know anything about the topic to make comments on it.

Also, I think we should supress the word "aristotelian" in the sentence <i>What we call today Aristotelian logic, Aristotle himself would have labelled analytics</i>, for it just confuses: wouldn't Aristotle label as analytics any other philosophy of this kind? After listing the books of the Organon, we could mention that this <i>corpus</i> is called Organon.</p>
<p>Then, we could include a paragraph about syllogisms and another about dialetics, but not go to much into details, since this is the subject of the article about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organon" rel="nofollow">Organon</a>. <a href="../../../b/h/v/User%7EBhvilar_a143.html" title="User:Bhvilar">Bhvilar</a></p>

<p>I think that this article would benefit from clearly distinguishing between Aristotle's own rich Greek vocabulary and that of Latin translations, particularly in the Metaphysics section. So many of Aristotle's most important terms are his own neologisms, and adding the extra layer of Latin translation without including discussion of the Greek terms could impede readers' understanding of his thought significantly. I myself am not well versed enough to know all the appropriate terms.

Recently I also created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Alexander_the_Great_d3a1.html" title="Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great">Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great</a> out of material that had been deleted from the biography article. Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.

<p>There was a paragraph under the section on Aristotle's Early Life and the Academy that speak's on a reported encounter with a learned Greek-speaking Jew. It was interesting, but why would this paragraph of marginal importance to anyone wanting to know about Aristotle make up one third of that section on his early life, especially when the text clearly said that it was not certain at what point in Aristotle's life it happened? I have removed it as it was very obviously misplaced. However, its content is interesting and could find a place in Wikipedia, under either a section describing Aristotle's encounters with and thoughts about foreign cultures, or if that is not possible in one of the pages concerned with the historical presence of Jews in Judea and their interaction with other people.</p>

<dd>I re-added the paragraph. Maybe there should be a new section, don't know...

Then he was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, Proxenus of Atarneus, who also took over his education. He gave Aristotle significant instruction in Greek, rhetoric, and poetry (O'Connor et al., 2004). Aristotle went to Athens at the age of 18, and attended Plato's school for young Greek aristocracy (the Academy). Aristotle quickly became Plato's favorite student.</p>

<p>These quotes from Aristotle have been marked as needing reference. Some of them can be tracked down to particular writings of his, but a good number are categorized as "unsourced" at WikiQuote.

Given the difficulty of sourcing these quotations, the lack of Wikipedia precedent for including quotations on philosopher pages, and that there is already a link to a more comprehensive list of Aristotle's quotes on WikiQuote, I propose we remove the section altogether.

<p>I get tired of people using first order theory to analyse Aristotle. A basic discussion of the level of abject perfect form of relations is warrented. It is like reading another language. And to analyse is a long study in logic.</p>
<p>A warning to read interpretations of his work is a good thing, because it is a bad thing to have people read without warning. It only confuses.</p>
<p>And then the reader thinks he was kind of stupid, Aristotle I mean, and always says so, because his sentences were ill formed.</p>
<p>It is just the opposite and the level of form was to be a goal of learning his work. So small decomposition is recommended. Here is an example of his style, but it is my writing:</p>
<p>"All the space became."</p>
<p>Four little words were used and it is a certain relation as defined in Greek theory. A subject was to be the relation, not the topic of space. A relation of space was the topic. So reading his style is difficult and the exact relation appears foundational in physics. And he will do this for the entire work, of his life time. A sentence is formulated. And when you find out his work is all non repeated as knowledge topics. And a little sentence is a discoverable relation of physics.</p>
<p>So searching as theorists is a pastime. Attempting to read is a pastime because it is a litteral puzzle of form.</p>
<p>If you do not understand that, you will always have the wrong standard of true genius. You will understand the distinction between work of genius of exceptional caliber and work of somebody trying to get an IQ of 200. There is no comparision.</p>
<p>And the warning needs to be in every topic. His school master was the same.</p>

<p>A short original explaination is this sentence. And to read the topic as the special analyst is different than the normal reader. So step one, is to allow a multiple logic writing. Some texts have several logical forms as the basis for statement. And to simply use an example from his work is different from his statement of form as a scientist of all logic.</p>
<p>A five order transform is common in his analysis. And the level of question always become the failure. Has there been a cause to form's failing in example? A five transform appeared and the reader was to question. And some writing in this discussion above is quite announcable Aristotle style. And I mean also the previous talk. A.</p>
<p>As a sentence in English, "A." is a transform of the applied reference to make the abstract. So the sentence, "A." is my short example of his theory. A sentence becomes A.</p>
<p>So read the discussion seriously because a sentence as reference to cause abstract is a powerfful method as the school would recommend. A letter as a symbol then denotes a see. "A see.", means something in the theory.</p>
<p>All sentence transforms the previous. And style as the one discussed appears the level of expertise available to help make this a fine paper. A bas.</p>
<p>And bas as the appearance then becomes the style applied in transform of a certain special kind. A symmetric appearance. So the cause to a certain logic as the e.</p>
<p>And the e appears as new symbol where as distinction between e as a subject rather than a symbol is a certain form to be read. Read this.</p>
<p>Infer e. And in predicate the transform was defined in two logical sentences. A certain relation as the a. A small letter. And large to small appeared.</p>
<p>note:Learn. Symmetry was the a. Without the symmetric form as certain style is denounced by the other schools. Do.</p>

<dd>Here is a quote from the Beginning of Aristotle's treatise on Category.
<blockquote>
<p>Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. Thus, a real man and a figure in a picture can both lay claim to the name 'animal'; yet these are equivocally so named, for, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. For should any one define in what sense each is an animal, his definition in the one case will be appropriate to that case only.</p>
</blockquote>
NOw I can write the sentence to translate third "equation". Aritotle uses several orders of abstraction always. He has the term "equivocally" as the English translation, of third equation. ANd to write the applied predicate version is a simple translation. And all you have to do is find somebody who can read five order theory. And correct the meaning of category as a science because the applied , Man, in the above discourse will not be read as third abstracted man while the picture is a second abstracted person.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what you're referring to specifically as "the definition of read as a topic"; can you point me to it? Read the Wikipedia policies I've linked; they try to make clear what kinds of work are rudimentary enough that they don't have to worry about being original research. The relevant category of original research is, "introduces an analysis, synthesis, explanation, or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments without attributing that analysis, synthesis, explanation, or interpretation to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article." So an interpretation that provides an original analysis of a philosopher's arguments and what they mean would be inadmissible. I'm relying on your statement that your views are original; if they are, then surely you appreciate that one individual's unpublished interpretation of Aristotle is not normal encyclopedic content. The encyclopedia, as unglamorous as this is, aims only to present standard views already worked out in other, citable reliable sources. There are certainly other venues for publishing any original interpretations, but the Wikipedia article space is not one of them. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 19:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. You answer in a difinitive fashion. Thanks. Policy is written to entail the transform as the meaning of synthesis, I believe. And so all reading to a certain person, i.e. a predicate reader, requires a synthesis. So all Aristotle must be interpreted given the size of the audience. And when I write like Aristotle I get called a gibberish writter. So policy to write needs clarification. A standard implemented with the same rigour as the interpretation definition. And if I write like that then it sounds stuffy. Stuffy stuffy no style wrting. I truely understand the goal of consistent presentation, but Aristotle is a special case. He litterally is unreadable for the audience. I will leave the topic alone.</dd>

<p>I am perplexed to see that this article makes no mention that Aristotle was born in Macedonia. He was born in the city of Stagiera, which even modern Greek historians claim to be part of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonia_bec6.html" title="Ancient Macedonia">ancient Macedonia</a>, albeit saying that Macedonia was actually a Greek city-state (which many ancient Greek texts contradict by saying that Macedonians were barabarians-not Greek speaking- and that King Philip II spoke Greek with an accent, providing evidence that Greek was not his first language). Aristotle's father was a physician to the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a> king and upon his fathers death, Aristotle was sent to study in Greece with Plato. I understand there is much cultural conflict between modern Greeks and Macedonians about ancient culture in the balkan region today, but we must look at the facts, especially in articles which are being viewed by millions of people. The fact that Aristotle taught another <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, makes their relationship a very logical one, especially since Aristotle's father had previously served the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a> rulers in the past. This makes it only fitting that the king of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, King Philip II, would trust <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> to teach his son, being that his father and previous ancestors had served the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a> kings in the past.

<p>Just wanted to let you know that there is an error about Aristotle. Though it is commonly assumed that he was Greek, he was in fact, Macedonian. He was born in Stagira (or Stageros) on the Chalcidice Peninsula. His father was Nichomachus, the Royal Physician to Amyntas II King of Macedonia. I think someone should change the info on the page, however, I did not do so because I thought that people would think my edit was a purposeful lie. My sources were my old world history text book, <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/6407/needto.htm" class="external free" title="http://library.thinkquest.org/6407/needto.htm" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/6407/needto.htm</a> and the Chalcidice Wikipedia page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.23.46.25_31e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.23.46.25">76.23.46.25</a> (talk) 01:50, 1 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dl>
<dd>Just to draw out the obvious inference from Nikolaos' correct information, since it seems necessary: Chalcidice was not part of the Macedonian Kingdom when Aristotle was born. Moreover, it is wrong to say that anything in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalcidice.html" title="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a> article supports considering it Macedonian <i>in the time of Aristotle and his father</i>. I'll avoid repeating any more of what I've said just above. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 23:57, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
