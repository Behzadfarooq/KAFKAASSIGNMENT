<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed on "Le Marge.JPG", you tagged the image claiming it was a logo of the WikiMedia foundation, which seems like a mistake. Did you mean to use the GFDL-self tag?</p>
<p>Thanks - <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 21:12, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Understood. You just used an incorrect tag. Take a look at the license tag currently on Image:Le Marche.JPG - the "CopyrightByWikimedia" license tag is used for things like the Wikipedia logo itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see a tag at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_tags_f270.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright tags">Wikipedia:Copyright tags</a> that does what you want to do. What I would recommend is that you use the GFDL-self tag, which states that you, the author of the picture, is releasing it under the terms of the GFDL; and additionally add as text that you are donating the copyright for the photo to the Wikimedia Foundation. Thanks - <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 22:01, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm just pointing out that tag is incorrect. Notice on Image:Le Marche.JPG, the tag says, "It is one of the official logos or designs used by the Wikimedia foundation or by one of its projects." The brief text in the pop-up license-selection menu is unfortunately not very clear. Just please change it to whatever tag is appropriate. Thanks -- <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 04:00, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And thanks again for changing the tag. The "CopyrightByWikimedia" tag has been removed from that popup menu to eliminate future confusion. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 06:27, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, of course Bremer was not a head of state or government... I must have missed that when I edited the alumni section of the school, but I've made the change now. Thanks for letting me know! As to your confusion about my history - well, what exactly are you talking about?</p>

<p>I appreciate the Constitutional lesson, but I'm American (and the one who listed Bremer under International Governance). I think you do not fully understand the distinction between government, which you outline a bit above, and governance. Governance cannot be defined in such a clear, limited, and anachronistic way. Governance is not government, and Paul Bremer is not listed as head of state or government. He is listed as a head of international governance given that he was the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. In essence, Bremer was the American proconsul in Iraq. The term governance is not associated with the formal government of any one state, but is more associated with governing - or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. Governance in this particular sense denotes formal and informal political institutions or individuals that aim to coordinate and control interdependent social relations and that have the ability to enforce decisions within a given organization, state, region, or on the world stage more generally. This would include a head of the Red Cross or CARE International, a UN Secretary-General, and someone like Paul Bremer.</p>

<p>Sorry, but you clearly do not understand what governmance is vis-a-vis government. I suggest you look it up b/c the distinction is certainly not erroneous.</p>

<p>Sold into <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> as a young girl (some accounts suggest by <a href="../../../v/i/k/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> others, by an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_4220.html" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> king), the young Bathilde served as a <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_in_waiting.html" title="Lady in waiting">lady in waiting</a> in <a href="../../../e/r/c/Erchinoald.html" title="Erchinoald">Erchinoald</a>'s household, King Clovis II's mayor of the palace of kings of France. Bathilde was beautiful, intelligent, modest, and attentive to the needs of others. Erchinoald (whose wife had died) was attracted to Bathilde and wanted to marry her. But she did not want to marry him; therefore Bathilde hid herself away and waited until Erchinoald remarried. King Clovis II noticed her (at some unknown date) and asked her hand in marriage sometime in <a href="../../../6/4/9/649.html" title="649">649</a>. Bathilde was 19 years old when she became queen. Different versions of this story suggest Clovis II was somewhere between the ages of 12 and 16 years old when he married Bathilde.</p>
<p>Even as queen, she remained humble and modest. She is famous for her charitable service and generous donations. From her donations, the Abbey of Corbey and the Abbey of Chelles were founded (and likely others such as the Abbeys of <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumi%C3%A8ges.html" title="Jumièges">Jumièges</a>, Jouarre, and Luxeuil too).</p>
<p>Queen Balthilde's husband died in <a href="../../../6/5/6/656.html" title="656">656</a>. Clothaire, the eldest son and heir to the throne, became <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clotaire_III_f2b8.html" title="Clotaire III">Clotaire III</a> at age five. Bathilde served as the queen regent until he was old enough to rule. As queen, she was a capable stateswoman. She abolished the practice of trading <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> slaves and even sought the freedom of children sold into slavery. As the story goes, after Bathilde's three children (Clothaire, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childeric_II_2b71.html" title="Childeric II">Childeric</a>, and Thierry) were of age and "established in their respective territories" (Clothaire as King of France, Childeric in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neustria.html" title="Neustria">Neustria</a> and Thierry in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgundy.html" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>), Bathilde entered the abbey and gave up her royal rank. She dedicated the rest of her life serving the poor and the infirmed.</p>
<p>Bathilde died on January 30, 680. She is buried at the Abbey of Chelles outside of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Bathilde was <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonized.html" title="Canonized">canonized</a> to sainthood by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Nicholas_I_22d7.html" title="Pope Nicholas I">Pope Nicholas I</a> about 200 years after her death.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the new year, i.e. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, my editing style could once again evolve. I am a strong supporter of freedom, liberty, and most of all <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and strongly believe in fighting for and defending those precious liberties found in any society - freedom of worship, the right to bare arms, freedom of speech, ... to name a few. I try to keep my political views in check, but that too could change. And another <i>oh by the way</i>, I've always opposed what was once called <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> right from the time I first learned of it - not because of as one Wikipedian puts it <i>"much debate concerning claims that the practice is itself racialist"</i>, but because affirmative action encourages employers to seek skilled labor (albeit, cheaper) elsewhere. From experience working in a field dominated by <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men.html" title="Men">men</a> (after 20 years, there are still fewer numbers of females in the engineering fields than females in medical and business professions), the concept does more harm than good. Much improvement is needed but <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> isn't the solution - this is just my personal opinion. There are many others who don't feel this way. It's much more difficult to force equality down a person's throat than convincing another that one's ability is equal (sometimes better) to that of another. I think you gals know exactly what I'm saying - go <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Power_1b32.html" title="Girl Power">Girl Power</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Copy of the Declaration of Independence &amp; U.S. Constitution, <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/declar.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usconstitution.net/declar.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>Highlight of the Intro: <i>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed, -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Does <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_of_church_and_state.html" title="Separation of church and state">Separation of church and state</a> suggest that the statement <i>... that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights....</i> is false? Who is the <i>Creator</i>? Unless there's another explanation to why the author(s) chose to use the word <i>Creator</i>, the declaration clearly points to the belief that <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> created men/women. Modern day court decisions to separate religion from government suggest that these <i>unalienable</i> rights may not belong to all men/women after all. Alternatively, the move to separate religion from government ensures <i>freedom of worship</i> without government intervention (as it occurred historically under British rule). Those who support "Separation of Church and State" should clearly define their position on this issue.</dd>

Dear Ariele, I've been working on the best User Page Project for quite some time, and my intentions from the beginning were to wait until we had solid structure and organisation.</p>
<p>However, I now realise that it is almost impossible to achieve such a goal without users who vote and partecipate, so that eventual fallacies can be discovered. Furthermore, it is pointless to spend great collaborative efforts for a project that does not have visibility.</p>

<p>I have proof Geo Swan used Wikipedia to promote Paul Bremer's book and scheduled lectures on his and Simon &amp; Schuster's behalf. It is our understanding that this is in direct violation to WIKIPEDIA's policies. You, Geo Swan and Fred Bauder (especially the administrator) have violated Wikipedia policy and abused certain privileges given to an administrator when you blocked a Wikipedia user without cause, and is furthermore, reason for revoking your privileges. Mr. Bauder, you have abused the tools available to an administrator, and should never have been selected to serve as a Wiki administrator.<i>,,,,,Ariele 06:07, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p><i>Eversince <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">User:Geo Swan</a>'s made these edits to the article on Paul Bremer, the issues which this sockpuppet had discussed in the article have also appeared in main stream media such as the Washington Post. More recently, the Op-ED article in the NY times by the author Paul Bremer. His OP-ED piece starts off about something to do with issues creating more</i> heat than light<i>. <b>What heat?</b> Furthermore, these repetitive reruns are the only issues which seem to have been stamped into the minds of the public over and over as if its saying <b>buy the book to find out first hand what actually happened in Iraq</b>. However, whenever I attempt to contribute a non-biased piece of information, User GEO SWAN just go bullistic. I do strongly believe Wikipedia has been used and abused by this sockpuppet.</i></p>

<dd>Well, there are a few users with the capability, I believe they are listed somewhere over on the arbitration page. You need a compelling reason for a check though, not just an ordinary dispute. Of course, you can always tell an i.p. if the user doesn't log in. You could just ask the user to make such a post, so you can check. That's not so helpful if they have access to multiple i.p. addresses.</dd>
<dd>On the sneakier side, you might be able to get both ends of a puppet to post under different i.p.'s (home/work for example), under their mistaken assumption that this will disprove puppetry. Conveniently, you can check the origin of an i.p. using geobytes.com. So, if they're both in Sacramento, you've probably got yourself a puppet. Of course, offering that last tip to your accuser won't help in this case, since it depends on ignorance. Derex 17:28, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dogged Defense?????</dd>
<dd><b>Paradigmbuff, do you have some personal connection to Ambassador Bremer?</b> Why is your defense of him so dogged? Your repetition of his defense, "my staff was inexperienced!", provoked me to alternate between laughter and frustration. The classic example of someone illustrating chutzpah is the man who murdered his parents, and asked for leniency because he had just become an orphan. Bremer was responsible for setting the CPA's hiring policies. And the CPA chose absolutely disastrous hiring policies. -- Geo Swan 22:17, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

You do know that the convention is that your response should have one further indent than what you are responding to?

<dd>Hiring Policies
<dl>
<dd>Geo Swan's persistence at placing the entire four ton weight on Bremer's shoulders is rather interesting. She (presumeably this person is a "she") extracted this piece from an article. I and probably others had been following events leading up to the transition on June 28, 2004. It would indeed be intriguing to see what Amb. Bremer has to say in his book.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Curious, I went looking for the actual "hiring policies" used by Bremer, the former American administrator. I discovered that the link to support Geo Swan's argument were none other than her own and about some Washington Post article. The article is really about how the Defense Department selected the few who were sent to work there and about the experiences one such staffer had in Iraq. Unless of course Geo Swan was there herself or himself.</dd>

<dd>Prefixing Bremer's name with "Ambassador" or "The Honorable"&#160;?
<dl>
<dd>An edit today prefixes Bremer's name with "The Honorable", with the explanation "Honorary Degree Recipient of Doctor of Law on June 19, 2005". Being awarded an honorary degree doesn't make one an "Honorable". In the USA the holders of certain offices are entitled to the prefix "Honorable". That list includes Judges, Congressmen, and Ambassadors. But none of the other US Ambassadors who have articles written about them are described as "The Honorable" in their articles. See: David Wilkins, Tony Garza, Tom Schieffer, George Herbert Walker III, Francis Rooney, Dan Coats, John Kenneth Galbraith, Zalmay Khalilzad, Paul Cellucci. Note: None of these other Ambassadors or former Ambassadors has every instance of their name prefixed with the title Ambassador. -- Geo Swan 17:36, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Iraqi Sovereignty&#160;?
<dl>
<dd>The introductory paragraph to this article currently reads:</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>He arrived in Iraq on May 11 and left on June 28, 2004, when sovereignty was returned to Iraq.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At most, limited soveriegnty was handed over to an appointed Iraqi administration. To assert that the Alawi administration was sovereign is a gross distortion. The Alawi administration did not control its own Armed Forces. The US controlled, still controls, the Iraqi Armed Forces. The Alawi administration did not control its own budget. Every Iraqi ministry was overseen by a US auditor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that the current Iraqi administration still only has limited sovereignty. Iraqi citizens got to vote for whomever they wanted. Exercising a free choice in the voting booth is one of the essential elements of a real democracy. But, missing was the information needed to make an informed choice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>According to a news segment shown on the CBC, as a security measure, the new Iraqi political parties were not allowed to publicize their political platforms, or biographies of their candidates. Iraqi voters couldn't make an informed choice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Americans still control the Iraqi Armed Forces, not vice versa.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>American forces are not subject to Iraqi justice. In other countries where this is true, it is the result a bilateral agreement with the host country. Those agreements are limited. Those host countries take jurisdiction if the US military justice system fails to investigate. This is not true for either Iraq or Afghanistan. American contractor, including the tens of thousands of gun-toting mercenaries, are also not subject to Iraqi justice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bremer's highly decrees still carry the force of law in Iraq, including the highly contentious, over-bearing, inappropriate ones. So, what's my point? I think the POV sentence in the introductory paragrpah should be replaced by a more NPOV sentence, like:</dd>

<dd>God helps those who take a big helping for themselves [says Geo Swan]
<dl>
<dd>In the "Post-Iraq" section I [Geo Swan] added:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When asked what he thought of reports of $9 billion missing from the funds to rebuild Iraq he said "I suggest you not worry, as that $9 billion was Iraqi money, not US money." Someone felt that should be supplemented with:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The $9 billion was Iraqi money intended for the Iraqi people. To be fair Bremer has also pointed out in a speech he made recently that "Clearly, public service must be guided by a steadfast respect for the natural moral law. The knowledge of and respect for the natural law, in fact, is indispensable for the proper fulfillment of civic duties."</dd>
<dd>Ariele's comment for this edit was "Geo Swan's version left out this part"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ariele's first sentence is correct. Bremer allowed Iraqi funds to be looted. But since she just said this, in the preceding sentence, I don't understand why Ariele felt it was necessary to repeat it. This point had already been made several paragraphs above, when the article discussed Bremer's obligations under UN resolution 1483.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If Ariele's comment that the $9 billion was derived from Iraq's oil revenue was really worth repeating I think it should begin a new paragraph.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>GeoSwan,</dd>
<dd>I had to rummage around in the archive to find this. To make this very clear to you, Bremer was not the one who pillaged and plundered the oil for food program, nor would he allowed that to happen under his watch. Look it up. The CPA archive has a transcript of his speech and I also took the liberty of copying it here JUST FOR YOUR BENEFIT.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I didn't say Bremer was the one who looted the oil-for-food program. Nor have I said he looted the DFI, the follow-on for the oil-for-food program, once Iraq's oil revenue was under Coalition control, not UN control.</dd>
<dd>See, you are responding to things you think I said, not to what I actually said.</dd>
<dd>What I actually said is that Bremer was responsible to make sure proper fiscal controls were in place to prevent a repetition of the scandal on his watch -- and that he did not do so -- did not put in place even the most basic fiscal controls. Did that absence of fiscal controls mean there was looting? Human nature being what it is, an absence of controls as profound as that Bremer was responsible practically guaranteed looting. The absense of fiscal controls means that no one can prove there was no looting. This, in and of itself is a terrible problem. And it was a terrible violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1483.</dd>
<dd>His speech, while well-written, doesn't seem particularly meaningful. Actions speak louder than words. It seems to me that his actions seem to show, at best, a complete lack of concern for fiscal responsibility. Where were the internal auditors he committed to hire? Where was the transparency of financial decisions and oversight of contractors? Why didn't the CPA meter the oil pipelines to make sure the oil sales could be audited? The Bush administration has a President, Vice President and Secretary of Defense who were all oil industry executives. They can't claim they didn't understand the importance of this metering. -- Geo Swan 03:31, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This paragraph was removed recently by a very disgruntled individual under the alias of Geo Swan: Ambassador Bremer, a "staunch" Roman Catholic, took the nickname Jerry from a renown Bible translator and religious historian known today as St. Jerome[6], his patron saint. While in Iraq, Bremer became famously known for wearing tan desert combat boots with his tailored suits. Although well respected and liked by most Iraqis, there were those who were more critical of his presence even threatening intending physical harm. Just one day after reports of Paul Bremer's departure, Dar Al-Hayat, a London based Arabic language newspaper, started a rumor that Ambassador Bremer (who so happens to be happily married to the former Frances Winfield) left behind a young 35-year old Iraqi lover. The newspaper followed up with another article criticizing Bremer's administration of Iraq; adding both Bremer and his "Iraqi lover" are together happily writing "his diary". A more substantial story occurred on March 28, 2004 when the former administrator ordered a controversial Iraqi newspaper Al-Hawza shut down for two months.</dd>
<dd>Geo Swan, you have just accused a fair and righteous man of immoral and indecent behavior. The rumor of an extra-marital affair which you speak of was never substantiated. Ambassador Bremer has during his stay in Iraq, been asked repeatedly by reporters if he would take an Iraqi "girl" as his wife. He responded to this sort of questioning diplomatically by saying that his religion allows for only one wife [and not up to four, as is the custom over there]. And if you had read the article published by the Catholic standard "Faith Gives Him Strength" and decipher what it was trying to tell you, his wife of 39 years is truly the love of his life. Furthermore, during his stay, there were repeated attempts to harm this man. If you had played back his speech he made back in February at a T.D. Waterhouse symposium you would have discovered that fact as well. And sure, you're upset that a controversial Iraqi newspaper was shut down. There was a reason for that. The newspaper was inciting violence. You speak of freedom of the press. What about "thou shalt not bear false witness?". Then there's your remark: God helps those who help themselves to a heap of money. Where did this come from? For your information, it was Bremer who established the Inspector General offices [5] to ensure that rampant abuse which you accuse him of, would be detected under the watchful eyes of the inspector general. So, it would seem that you are hell bent on destroying this man's reputation and using Wikipedia for this wicked and evil plot of yours. Who are you accountable to? The papermill?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You've attracted attention and created suspicion indicating that you perhaps are the lover which Bremer is rumored to have had "during his stay in Iraq". When I discovered the rumor, I did a fair amount of research into this and actually found the Arabic version of this account (which was quickly removed from access later). The rumor also quickly spread throughout Europe and found itself posted on a Dutch porn site as well (a rather x-rated version of the rumor). A gilted lover with much to scorn about. If that is who you are or claim to be. Ariele 02:58, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My mistake! Many apologies to the readers. It would seem that Geo Swan is not the "lover" or "romantic" type. Ariele 21:08, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have asked you many time before to make a greater effort to be civil. In the last couple of days you have dismissed me as "disgruntled"; you have said I am carrying out an "evil plot"; you have made a joke, in very poor taste, associating me with a porn site. Well, I am not going to respond in kind.
<dl>
<dd>Your contributions does portray this man in a very contradictory fashion. Why? What do you have against this person? Ariele 20:46, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You have responded, with outrage, to some of the things I have written, or rather, things you think I have written. Because, it seems to me, that your outrage stems from not properly reading what I wrote. The rumor of Bremer having a mistress predates my first contribution to this article. Let me encourage you to direct your outrage about the al-Hayat accusation to the writers at al-Hayat, and anyone else who put forward that story as if it were true.</dd>
<dd>Are you sure that the wikipedia is the correct venue for expressing that outrage? -- Geo Swan 06:47, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your contribution is outrageous. Who do you think you are making such childish comments such as "God helps those who help themselves to a heap of money".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In response to your question "venue ...". My more recent contributions are not a show of "outrage" as you put it. For several months, I have been watching what you're putting down here and all of it seem to indicate you are extremely displeased with the way things were and with Bremer. You have personally attacked his integrity and that of his staff. Your wording has drawn suspicion that seem to indicate Bremer had done something criminal. Furthermore, your persistence has drawn suspicion that you in fact may have been the "lover" or someone in close proximity to him. No one thus far has consistently and persistently written so much criticisms about Bremer EXCEPT you Geo Swan. Now you expect readers to believe that Iraqis have "limited" sovereignty over their own country?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me demonstrate to you what I am truly like when I use Wikipedia as the venue for expressing outrage: You remind me of this fanatic who claimed to be a former drug addict who co-habitated with three women at the same time, who excused himself for talking like a red-neck because he had a tumor removed from his brain, pretended to be a Christian preaching God's message and who along with a bunch of other like-kind fanatics thought that a recorded speech I made with some alterations no doubt (something similar to what you've done here about Bremer &amp; the CPA) would coerce a government into supporting their extravagant (and expensive) way of life. That's called blackmail. And your contribution here has all the components of one.</dd>

<p>Now that is me expressing outrage. Ariele 19:24, 14 August 2005 (UTC) [edit]</p>
<p><b>More Threats from Geo Swan to Ariele:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to be more civil</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ariele, I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to be more civil.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I know you know that accusing other wikipedians of criminal activity is a violation of wikipedia etiquette. You just compared me with a reprehensible con-artist, who tried to defraud the USG. You seem to be saying that both your con-artist acquaintance, and I, were guilty of blackmail. If you didn't mean to accuse me of blackmail I think you should say so right now.</dd>
<dd>I urge you, to exercise more caution here. I urge you to exercise more about jumping to conclusions. I urge you exercise more caution about posting here when you are in the grip of strong, intemperate emotions. We are all supposed to assume goodwill here. You keep failing to extend goodwill to me.</dd>
<dd>Case in point, you read an edit I made, and you reacted as if I had accusd Bremer of adultery. You are skeptical of the report from the London Muslim newspaper, which didn't provide any details that any other journalists could check? I was skeptical too. That is why I condensed the <b>adultery section</b> when I moved it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am going to point out I said it was a rumor. I didn't say it was proven. You read what I wrote, and you were swept by feelings to strong you reposted a long paragraph accusing me of a "wicked and evil plot" right into the article. You could have put a question, on the talk page, saying something like: "Geo Swan, I am concerned about your most recent edit of the section on the rumor of Bremer's alleged adultery. When I read it, it sounds like you are arguing the rumor is true. If that is not true, I think you should modify it, possibly by inserting the word 'alleged' before 'affair'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ariele, it is clear you have strong objections to some of the material I put in this article. But do you think your reaction is really how you should react?</dd>
<dd>You could ask civil questions about the material you find disturbing, or which you disagree with.</dd>
<dd>You could go read the audit reports yourself, so you could form your own opinion. If your own independent conclusions differed from mine you could return here, and we could have a civil informed discussion about the substance of the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is possible for people of goodwill to disagree, and yet have reasonable, civil discussions. Sometimes that results in one of those parties modifying their views. Sometimes both parties modify their views. I try my best to never enter a discussion without being ready to give my corresponent's view fair consideration. I try my best to be prepared to acknowledge that I might be wrong, and my correspondent might be correct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You just said, I "have personally attacked his integrity and that of his staff."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I don't see that. My intention is to summarize things that can be documented. I spent considerable time reading the audit documents. Did Bremer do a good job making sure the Iraqi oil revenue he expended on behalf of the Iraqi people was well-spent? Well, the audit reports record what kind of job he did. I tried to give fair summaries of those reports. A fair summary of those reports may leave readers with a low opinion of Bremer, But if my I am fair then I have nothing to apologize for. Instead of criticizing my character, you could write a civil challenge to my interpretations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Consider the cash reconciliation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Did Bremer's authorization to expend Iraqi oil derive from UN resolution 1483?</dd>
<dd>Did resolution 1483 require him to make sure expenditures were made in an open, transparent manner.</dd>
<dd>Did resolution 1483 require him to take basic steps to make sure those truly massive amounts of cash could be traced and accounted for?</dd>
<dd>Did he take those most basic steps? No, he did not. Not even a monthly cash reconciliation.</dd>
<dd>Did I say that Bremer knowingly failed to fulfill his oblgations to institute proper fiscal controls as part of a criminal conspiracy? I do not think I said that.</dd>
<dd>At this point in time we can only speculate as to why Bremer fiscal controls were so inadquate.</dd>
<dd>The explanation he offered was that the CPA was understaffed, and his staff was young and inexperienced. I don't accept that explanation. I don't think that explanation makes any sense. Bremer instituted a deeply flawed, deeply inadequate hiring policy.</dd>
<dd>Bremer had very serious responsibilities. He absolutely had an obligation to oversee a hiring policy that lead to a staff of the most qualified people who were available, without regard to their apparent political loyalties.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But Bremer only hired people who had submitted their resume to the Heritage Foundation. He has given the appearance that his highest priority was choosing employees who shared his ideology.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe hiring only those who applied to the Heritage Foundation was just a thoughtless mistake. If so it was a very costly one. Possibly very costly for Iraq. Who knows how much more effectively, fairly and responsibly the CPA might have managed the recostruction of Iraq's infrastructure, if he hadn't crippled it with his deeply flawed hiring policy?</dd>
<dd>But, IMO, that policy should be very costly for Bremer personally. IMO it should strip from the use of the excuse, "Have pity on my! I had an inexperienced staff!"</dd>
<dd>I am going to return to where I started. If you think something someone wrote falls short of the fairness and objectivity that should be practiced in the wikipedia I am going to encourage you to assume goodwill and ask the other contributors civil questions. Civility is important. A lot of your accusations against me, like the accusations around the rumors of Bremer's alleged adultery, are simple misunderstandings.</dd>
<dd>I am only human. You must understand that it requires an effort to stop short of simply responding in kind. So, please try harder. -- Geo Swan 01:46, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For my edit summary when I put a {test2} notice on your new userid <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Bremer_e67f.html" title="User talk:Paul Bremer">User Talk:Paul Bremer</a> I put <i><b>"Ariele, I know you can be civil, if you only make the effort..."</b></i></p>
<p>I know you can be civil. You have accused me of hating you. I don't hate you. I have intellectual concerns with some of your contributions. A minority of the contributions you have made have been basically indistinguishable from vandalism, And a smaller portion of your contributions have been, unquestionably, vandalism. Most of the time, however, I believe you are doing your best to make a positive contribution to the wikipedia, just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>You resigned your accounts before, but you chose to come back. I encourage you to stay positive in your contributions. I encourage you to have civil dialogues with the other contributors with whom you have intellectual differences. I encourage you to <b>"assume good faith"</b></p>
<p>You have leveled a lot of accusations at me, both lately, and over the course of the last year. I believe they are all baseless, and that a large portion of them are based on simple misreadings or misunderstandings of what I have said.</p>
<p>I think I know you well enough to know that you are very likely to change your mind, and return to wikipedia, under a new userid, if you resign. Personally I would far rather that you stayed under your Ariele userid, and simply made the effort to be civil and constructive at all times. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 18:01, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have no plans to stick around because (for quite some time now) I want to start a web site again. Ha, I bet you didn't know that did you? Take care of yourself and try to keep your nose clean.

<p>Ariele, I have seen your recent complaints that you were <i><b>-unfairly-</b></i> blocked, and that I have been harrassing you.</p>
<p>During the last year you have violated the no personal attacks dozens of times. You have compared me with was a porn-star. You have called me a teenage delinquent. You keep presuming I am female, and implying that this has something to do with my judgement. You compared me to a corrupt phony evangelist you know. I waited a full year before I asked an administrator for help dealing with you. And I only did that when you created new sockpuppets to attack me.</p>
<p>You were blocked because you created new sockpuppets to harrass me and vandalize pages.</p>
<p>I told you yesterday that I would rather you didn't resign, but that you just confined yourself to a single userid, like the rest of us, and confined yourself to constructive posts, that dealt with intellectual issues, and fell within the wikipedia policies and procedures. This idea you have that I have been harrassing you and stalking you is (1) just plain wrong, (2) self-destructive, as it seems to grab ahold of you and trigger your lapses from the wikipedia policies and procedures.</p>
<p>I haven't attacked you. I haven't called you names. I have confined myself to urging you to be a good citizen, and obey the wikipedia policies and procedures. I don't use sockpuppets. I am not secretly an administrator. Your recent accusation that I am, somehow, profiting from promoting Paul Bremer's book, on the wikipedia, doesn't even make sense. If anyone has been promoting his book it was you, not me.</p>
<p>None of the administrators you have been admonished by has ever attacked you. Some of them have been very patient with you. All of them were only doing things they were authorized to do, based on your misbehaviour.</p>
<p>I firmly believe you can be civil, and make all your contributions to the wikipedia be positive constructive ones. I urge you to do so.</p>
<p>But, if you are really set on having Ariele, and all your other sockpuppets deleted, shouldn't you give the administrators a complete list?</p>
<p>You forgot some, including:</p>

<p>How can anyone be certain that a user here in Wikipedia will be safeguarded from personal attacks? I firmly believe there's original research involved. Geo Swan changed the subject and accuses me of calling him/her names. So it is okay to criticize others so long as it isn't directed at Geo Swan. I think my userboxes are rather tame compared to what you're accusing me of. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">User:Geo Swan</a>, are you familiar with this external link <a href="http://www.tacitus.org/story/2005/7/4/19137/60367" class="external text" title="http://www.tacitus.org/story/2005/7/4/19137/60367" rel="nofollow">Tacitus</a>. Surely, this is just a coincidence, right?</p>
<p>I am wondering if the <a href="../../../s/y/s/Sysop.html" title="Sysop">Sysops</a> will grant my request to delete my accounts here. If anyone wants to continue using these accounts, please feel free to do so. I did however think the "Laura Croft" thing was rather funny.

<li>How can anyone be certain they won't be attacked here? We can't. But when we are we can keep our heads and follow the procedures. Which I have done, and you haven't.</li>
<li>Your "original research" allegation is unsubstantiated because it is baseless.</li>
<li>Personal attacks are prohibited, no matter who they are directed against. Even putting attacks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AAriele&amp;diff=35679721&amp;oldid=35346125" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AAriele&amp;diff=35679721&amp;oldid=35346125" rel="nofollow">as you did,</a> on your personal user page is an attack on the culture of civility we want on the wikipedia.</li>
<li>I don't care how tame you think your userboxes are, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Geo_Swan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40215881" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Geo_Swan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40215881" rel="nofollow">you had no business placing them on my User page,</a> or that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Businessdr&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Businessdr&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Businessdr</a>.</li>
<li>No, I was not familiar with that Tacitus page. I think they were mistaken, whoever they are, to think their identity was obvious. It is not obvious to me. If you were wondering if I was a party to that discussion let me assure you I wasn't.</li>
<li>I have no idea what you are talking about with your Laura Croft reference.</li>
<li>For crying out loud, I could have gone to arbitration over your attacks a year ago. I have been extremely patient. The final straw was your creation of new sockpuppets to disrupt my constructive efforts to start the article <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship_lifts_in_China_beea.html" title="Ship lifts in China">Ship lifts in China</a>. And even then I didn't go to the arbitration committee, I went to one of the users authorized to check to confirm that the newly created user who was using your style was a sockpuppet of you. Note: I didn't ask them to block you, or admonish you. I merely asked them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fred_Bauder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40357115#CheckUser_advice.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fred_Bauder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40357115#CheckUser_advice.3F" rel="nofollow">to confirm that you and PurplePussnBoots were the same person.</a> -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 21:26, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
