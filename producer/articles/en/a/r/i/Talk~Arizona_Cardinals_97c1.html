<p>Could someone please give me a source that confirms that they were officially called the "Racine Cardinals" in 1920 and 1921? All the sources I have say that when they became a charter member of the league in 1920, they were officially known as the "Chicago Cardinals", including:</p>

Refer to the the minutes of the second APFA organizational meeting at a car showroom in Canton on 17 Sep 1920, where Art Ranney, a partner in the Akron Pros ownership group who took the minutes, erroneously listed the team as "Racine Cardinals, Wisconsin," mistaking them for a team based in Racine. While many Chicago area teams at the time named themselves after their street or neighborhood - remember, there were several pro or semi-pro teams in Chicago in 1920 - this wasn't the case for teams in other (smaller) cities and towns, probably one source of confusion. Then again, there was plenty of free beer provided for the meeting, despite Prohibition! (source: Professional Football Research Association: "1920: Associating in Obscurity," by PFRA Research, unknown date). One possible explanation is that, at least until a Racine team joined the NFL in 1922, the Cardinals were referred to as either Racine or Chicago by fans and press. Back then, what professional sports teams were called was far more informal and fluid than today, and it usually took several years before a common name was universally accepted by fans and the media. 211.59.191.28 10:31, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, I'll look into that. This Racine/Chicago issue should be put into the article. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 12:13, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is Alakzam! I just found out on Chris Creamer's sportslogo.net that the old logo that the Arizona Cardinals used until until 2004 was ACTUALLY first used in 1982, when they were the St. Louis Cardinals of football. You can check out the old Cardinals logos and see the logo that Cardinals originally used when they were in St. Louis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quite frankly, the Cardinals were using that old logo on their <i><b>helmets</b></i> since 1960. <a href="http://www.sportslogos.net/Site/logo.php?lo=1039" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sportslogos.net/Site/logo.php?lo=1039" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 13:57, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK! I believe you! I even remember watching old NFL Films that showed the Arizona Cardinals having that particular logo on their helmet. However, I was just wondering. Wouldn't be interesting if we also included that particular St. Louis Cardinals football logo onto the Arizona Cardinals article, since it WAS part of the Cardinals history.</p>
<p>Also, I'm a bit nervous to put the old St. Louis Cardinals logo on the article, since I'm afraid that I'll break copyright laws.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the logo is probably still copyright. See those NFL video games that are containing old football teams which use old NFL/AFL logos. Well, the article currently contains the old Chicago Cardinals logo and many sports team articles include the old logos such as the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Titans_ab07.html" title="Tennessee Titans">Tennessee Titans</a> *cough* Oilers and <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> *cough* Texans. Yes, if we're talking about the old St. Louis Cardinals football team then it pertains to the Arizona Cardinals' history.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J.

<p>The references for this article were a mess. I made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) Converted untitled links to titled inline references.</li>
<li>2) No need to link to EVERY individual page. I simply cited the relevent frontpage, and used the &lt;ref name=XXXX&gt; tag to multi-reference. Bringing people to the main Cards page at PFR is probably enough.</li>
<li>3) Moved the references mess to external links and condensed. The references section should be used for inline references. Use the &lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;ref name=XXXX&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; tags in articles to create inline refs, then use &lt;references /&gt; in the ==References== section to recall the refs list. Also, again no need to site the ENTIRE NFLhistory linescores pages one by one. A single link will do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still needed to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) We need to finish referencing the article. The history section is lean on references from the 1930's-1990's. We got the beginning and the end real good, now we need the middle.</li>
<li>B) Perhaps a more friendly organization, such as a decade-by-decade organization, with brief overall notes and highlights. An entire season-by-season review (as done in the 1920's already) makes for a thick read, though even that is OK if we organize with subheadings and better divisions. As it stands now, the writing and organization is a little scatterbrained. I may get to this, but don't let anyone else stop if they get to it first.</li>

<p>This whole section seems like it was ripped from an Arizona Newspapers account of the game. I consider myself a fan of the Cardinals, but this section is really biased and probably does not require this amount of detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with you, I removed the two lines you quoted above and removed several other POV and weasel words as well. I plan to add a few references to the article shortly.

<p>I guess this is the place to put this comment. I read the article, we have 1920 than in some unnamed year they merge with the Steelers during WWII and then all of the sudden they move to St. Louis in 1960 apparently not taking the previously merged Steelers with them as they are still in Pittsburgh. I work less than a mile north of the Cards practice site and while not a friend, would be willing to see if I could get more information on their history, unless others have it here (and less biased). Autkm 05:39, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is more info than that. But what can you say about a team that's like the Washington Senators of the NFL? More needs to be said (which I just started to mention in the article) about this team's ability to survive for as long as it has with virtually nothing to recommend it or to show for it. One interesting item that I don't think was mentioned was their early 1950s trade of <a href="../../../o/l/l/Ollie_Matson_94c3.html" title="Ollie Matson">Ollie Matson</a> for 11 members of the L.A. Rams. A weird highlight, but the Cardinals' history is full of weird highlights. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Having just done some work on this article, I now have to wonder whether it is too repetitive. That is, there may be a bit too much information in the intro (both before and after I worked on it) that is also restated in the more detailed portion of the article.

<p>What happened to AZCardinals.png? That's the true logo! The other logo is just a darker cardinal red, plus it's head is tilted back!
