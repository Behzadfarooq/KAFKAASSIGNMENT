<p>I added a cleanup tag because this article needs some work. What I mean is that the way this article has been written, it acts like Sharon's recent strokes are the biggest events in his life. They're not. He has done a lot more then become prime minister and die, and yet this article dedicates waaaayyyyyy too much room to his strokes. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPielover87_8b90.html" title="User:Pielover87">pielover87</a> 07:32, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi. I keep making grammatical corrections in this article, and I see that they keep disappearing. To all of you out there, I am a professional writer, and my knowledge of American-style English is virtually perfect (Wikipedia was started in America, and there are more native speakers of American-style English than British-style English, as funny as that sounds and with all due respect to the motherland of the English language, so I feel that spelling and placement of punctuation in relation to quotation marks should reflect the American style, especially since most of the spelling and quotation-mark-related punctuation placement in the article already are in the American style - let's be consistent). So please don't add a comma or delete a hyphen, for instance, in my revisions. Thank you. By the way, my mother grew up a few miles from Sharon's ranch, and Sharon and his sons have friends from my mother's community. Additionally, I've read Sharon's autobiography. So if you see me adding a minor fact about his life, please don't delete it unless you have read his autobiography and have interviewed his friends from my mother's kibbutz a few miles down the road from his Sycamore Farm and have found out then that I have erred. I don't see myself as better than any of you - I just happen to have access to some knowledge about Sharon's life that many of you happen to not have because my mother was born in a certain place. Thank you again.66.214.230.155 19:06, 6 January 2006 (UTC)66.214.230.155</p>

<p>I am somewhat impressed overall of the portrayal of Ariel Sharon in his actions and policies. The continued debate over what is and is not pertinent in this biography is at the forefront of why I am impressed. I am pleased that people continue to place negative and positive aspects, for to have only of one side is POV. However, I must contend the placement of media views. It is a widely known fact that every news agency is known to twist information to their perspective, especially mainstream media such as the BBC and the New York Times. Largely, I have found the most major cases at this site<a href="http://www.honestreporting.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.honestreporting.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. While not anti-Israel, it is at the very least anti-media bias against Israel, such as the case in this news report on the supposed Israeli soldier attack on a Palestinian here, <a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/reports/The_Photo_that_Started_it_All.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/reports/The_Photo_that_Started_it_All.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. As noted in the article, an Israeli soldier is said to be shown attacking a Palestinian youth; however, the case is quite the opposite as he is trying to protect an ISRAELI youth from a mob of Palestinians. This is a cause to question the information in every news report, <b>both</b> pro- <i>and</i> anti-Israeli, as media can not only twist information, but blatantly lie about it as well.</p>
<p>In no regards am I anti-Palestinian, in fact I am both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. I feel that the only method that could possibly be attainable for the peace of a single state would be the combination of Israel and Palestine into one single nation, with equal rights given to <i>EVERY</i> citizen. I will explain why at a later posting under Israel, as I have not the time at the moment.--Antibias 08:55, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have not figured out exactly where and how this should be included in the article (there is a paragraph on his health at the end of the intro and there is a separate section, "Stroke"), and I am still awaiting a source that is clearly reliable, so I am leaving the article alone for now. However, I have been hearing radio news reports for days that Sharon's medical condition is a bit more complicated than a "minor stroke." This was further confirmed this morning when I heard that he will be having a "procedure" on his heart. Now I have found this article [<a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Politics/7630.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Politics/7630.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] which confirms that he will undergo catheterization to repair "a small hole in his heart"; that the stroke was not "minor"; and that some in Israel (at least, his political opponents) have questioned the accuracy of the medical reports and appear to have doubts that he is making decisions on his own. The latter statements must be taken very cautiously because they are obviously an attempt to influence the upcoming election, but at the same time it may turn out that the doubts about Sharon's fitness to continue as Prime Minister are valid. Someone may wish to edit the article based on this information, but at the very least, it bears watching. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 16:53, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, someone has now added some medical information, including the upcoming operation, but it is so much in medical-ese that I am not sure a general readership can be expected to understand it, but for the same reason I am not sure how to edit it into plain English and still retain the gist of it. Even so, the new information does not mention that the operation will be a "catheterization," which I think would at least have some meaning for the general reader. It amazes me that a heart defect that Sharon has had all his life (which I assume is implied by "congenital") should "decide" to manifest itself right at this pivotal moment in his career, but that's life I guess (and I realize that my amazement is non-encyclopedic.) <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 03:30, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a dispute with the last paragraph and with the first line which states that Sharon has died. No other source currently confirms that the massive stroke suffered by P.M. Sharon has led to his death. Neither Reuters/AP/Fox News/CNN has this info yet. We should hold off on his death date until it is clear that he has died. ber06122, January 4, 2006, 5:41 p.m. (EST)</p>

<p>Sky News has just reported that Sharon's prognosis is "extremely bleak". However rumours of his death are greatly exaggurated. Don't report his death (which seems likely in today) until at a major source (BBC, ABC, NBC, Sky) confirms a newswire story. Newswires do report rumours and then withdraw them. The key is the TV broadcasts. They will double-check any reports with their own stringers in Jerusalem. If they state it as fact it usually (not always, but usually) means that they have verified it from two sources. A newswire report in isolation is no guarantee of accuracy. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:04, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I read the article, it kind of seems like the information about his early life shouldn't be lumped in with his early military career, although the transition between his pre-adolecent years and his joining the paramilitary group ties in nicely.

<p>I think that characterizing the first Sabra and Shatilla massacre as "one of the worst exterminations of the 20th century" is both a POV violation and patently false; as tragic and deplorable as it was, it didn't reach the proportions of countless others. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 16:33, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>True - Srebrenica, for example, saw 8000+ Bosnian Muslims massacred over a period of days by the Serbs. And let's not forget Hama, where tens of thousands of Syrians were killed by Assad - or the genocide against the Kurds and the Marsh Arabs by Saddam Hussein, or the killing of Lebanese Christians at Darmour, or the Killing Fields of Cambodia, or My Lai - the list goes on... Lebanon was a hideous war and Shatila and Sabra a terrible atrocity but its not one of the worst exterminations of the 20th Century. I'm surprised Sharon is not condemned more for the bombing of Beirut. Shatila and Sabra have become emblematic of something. Its worth remembering that the shock of it brought thousands of Israelis out onto the street in protest. User: ThePeg 16.15. 2.6.2006</p>

<dl>
<dd>There are some claims here that Syria is responsible for Sabra and Shatila. This is a viewpoint held by a very tiny minority since it suggests that Israel and Syria were <i>allies</i> cooperating with each other during the massacre.

<p>I've removed the word "strangely" from the phrase " "Strangely, The Kahan Commission also claimed ...," as it is clearly POV. Gni 21:25, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Sabra/Shatilla section has become disturbingly partisan. One added section reads: "The subsequent Israeli Kahan commission of enquiry into this atrocity provided absolute proof that Israeli soldiers saw the massacre taking place. The evidence of a Lieutenant Avi Grabovsky was crucial. He was an Israeli deputy tank commander and reported what he saw to his higher command. He was told by his senior officers: 'Don't interfere.'" Saying in introducing the Kahan report that the report "provided absolute proof..." is a misrepresentation of the Kahan report. The Kahan report actually concluded that "...we determine that indeed I.D.F. soldiers who were near the embankment which surrounded the camp saw certain acts of killing and an attempt was made to report this to commanders of higher ranks; but this report did not reach Brigadier General Yaron or Major General Drori." Indeed, Grabovsky never claimed that he himself was told "Don't interfere" by senior officers. Rather, he said that he was anecdotally by collegues that officers responded to an earlier radio bulletin by someone else that they are disturbed by the reports, but that the soldier should not interfere. I'm removing the reference to Grabovsky. If it is to be in, it should reflect the actual contents, and just as importantly, the actual tenor of the Kahan report. Gni 21:44, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is becoming annoying to be honest, people are only insisting on including the softer parts of the Kahan Commission and refusing to include any other sources on the massacre. I have added a part about Palestinian survivor testimonies, which I referenced. Please do not remove it, it is laughable that some of you want to make sure that the viewpoints of the survivors, who were not consulted for the Kahan Commission, are not included.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Gaborsky clearly said that he was told not to interfere, and I reinstated that part. If you don't like that fact, you shouldn't remove it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest you reread the report, carefully. Again, Grabowsky was never told by his senior officers "don't interfere." Grabowsky spoke with a tank crew, whose members claimed to have heard a communications report in which a commander had said, "We know, <i>it's not to our liking</i>, and don't interfere." I will paste the text of the report below. Secondly, if you are quoting a sentence fragment ("Don't interfere"), it needs an ellipsis. But in this case, it is downright distortion to quote "Don't interfere" instead of the full quote: "We know, it's not to our liking, and don't interfere." In any case, as it is, it is simply incorrect. I am removing it again. Maybe the administrator could take a look at the Kahan report to verify that commanders never told Grabowsky "don't interfere," but rather a tank crew told him that they heard a commander say the bit. Finally, how is it neutral POV to claim that other investigations "have all been more candid" than the Kahan report. I'm not interested in getting into which reports are more orless candid here in discussion--and such point of view certainly does not belong in the article itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is the actual text from the Kahan report regarding Grabowsky:
<dl>
<dd>Lieutenant Grabowsky wanted to report the event by communications set to his superiors, but <b>the tank crew told him that they had already heard a communications report</b> to the battalion commander that civilians were being killed, [and] the battallion commander had replied, "We know, it's not to our liking, and don't interfere."

<p>To the ignorant administrator (Markalexander100) who keeps revising my grammatical revisions and changing of such misnamings as "Israeli Defense Forces" to "Israel Defense Forces" (its proper name), you're a clown. Don't mess with my edits; I'm not vandalizing anything - I'm fixing the inconsistencies in grammar in this article and adding minor details of an impartial nature. Also, ignorant administrator, I am something you're not: a speaker of Hebrew, and with the knowledge of that language, I'm correcting some of the transliterations from Hebrew to English in certain people's names. Why not have the Hebrew names as the people who have the names say them, as opposed to the way people ignorant of the Hebrew language say them? Additionally, ignorant administrator, you list yourself as a native speaker of English, but since you reverted all of my edits, which included corrections of grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the article, I obviously not only know a language that you don't know, I also know how to speak your own language better than you. I'm a professional writer and a historian by training with a much deeper knowledge of the Middle East than yours. My mother grew up a few miles from Sharon's ranch; Sharon knows people who live in my mother's community. I feel that I'm entitled thus to add a few minor facts. Now, if you have a problem with how infinitesimally longer the article is becoming because of my edits (and it's probably not because I'm taking out a few misplaced letters here and there, along with my minor additions), you should say so. Be true to the scholarship in which Wikipedia believes - proper scholarship, not your personal non-scholarship.

<p>Don't change the succession box yet. Sharon remains Prime Minister until either one of three things happens: (1) he dies, (2) he resigns, or (3) he is declared <i>permanently incapacitated</i>. He is currently <i>temporarily</i> incapacitated as far as the law is concerned, ie, they do not know officially whether he can resume the post or not. (In practice he probably cannot, but that isn't officially declared yet.) His deputy is merely <i>acting PM</i> (ie, he isn't PM but fulfils the role). As of now he will not feature in the list of Israeli PMs. Only if Sharon is declared permanently incapacitated will the deputy assume not merely the powers but the <i>role</i> of PM.</p>
<p>BTW does any know what the technical procedure is for formally declaring an Israeli PM incapacitated? Some countries require Supreme Courts to issue such a ruling. Others require a ruling of parliament, or of the Parliamentary Speaker, or of the cabinet, or of the cabinet secretary, or of the head of state? What is the formal procedure in Israel? It might be useful for WP to know, because given Sharon's condition it is only a matter of when, not if, that ruling is made and he is deemed to no longer be PM. Alternatively though, it could be decided not to make such a ruling, but to leave him theoretically in office and continue using an acting PM (on the basis that sympathy for Sharon would boost his party's prospects in the general election). But leaving him in power would be controversial. Unusually a constitutionally independent officer or organisation has the task of ruling someone permanently incapacitated and so de jure terminate their premiership. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup></p>

<p>I am proposing that the recently created article <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illnesses_of_Ariel_Sharon_76a5.html" title="Illnesses of Ariel Sharon">Illnesses of Ariel Sharon</a> be merged here, with the transference of the relevant information. There is absolutely no reason for there to be a separate article about his health problems, especially when this article already addresses the early problems he had in December of 2005. And there aren't that many "illnesses", anyway. He has a birth defect in his heart, and he had (possibly as a consequence of the previous problem), two strokes in two months. That's it. A reporter's speculation on whether or not the PM is obese does not seem suited for Wikipedia, not to mention that it seems to be a generalization to iclude it in the same "package" as the heart defect and the strokes (which is what this new article ends up doing, by listing it all as "the illnesses of Ariel Sharon").

<dl>
<dd>I advise to refrain, for now; the merge may be better suited for later. The main article spin-off appears to give us more maneuverability with respect to current new(s) developments. A lot of the detail that can go on in the main article might to be suited for a biographical article, but it's detail that people right now wish to know. And it's convinent to have a smaller space, too. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 04:43, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well the obesity issue isn't idle speculation, there are a million stories about Sharon's eating habits and people have been worried for a long time that his weight would come back to haunt him. Sharon's obesity is very encyclopedic since the stroke that resulted from it seems very likely to throw the political situation into turmoil.</dd>
<dd>As for whether the article should be moved, I agree with El C, there are a lot of advantages to having a separate article. Wikipedia has a serious problem with articles where a huge amount of detail is loaded into one section, throwing that section out of proportion with the article. If we merge in the article on Sharon's illness and the story keeps going for another week than the section on Sharon's illness will take up half the article on Sharon, better to put it in a separate article. The illness deserves an article because it is an important news story, not just one aspect of Sharon's life. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 04:52, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About a year ago a friend of my Dad's was at a party that Sharon attended. The host made two large trays of deviled eggs and Sharon planted himself next to the food and ate one and a half of them. Nobody wanted to stop him because of course he's the prime minister. It really seems strange that something like a guy's eating habits can change the course of history. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 05:10, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's all a matter of odds; a tenth of a milimeter here or there and an otherwise inconsequential this or that becomes pivotal.

<p>From what I can tell, the only worthwhile and non-repetative information in the "Illnesses" article are the "International reactions" which are important. The other stuff about Sharon eating <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pringles.html" title="Pringles">Pringles</a> is a joke. Sharon is an old man, most people don't make it to 77, and as he is close to 78 all the discussions are moot because old people get sick and die from such things as heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, pneumonia, dehydration, or accidents (what's missing?). Sharon is nothing special.

There are more international reactions, for example, the Pope calling on Catholics to pary for his recovery (if I recall correctly). Adding more details about the health aspect of it could be beneficial; detail impertinent to a biographical article (entailing a more brief summary of these), but that readers may still find interest in. Feel free to change the title to Health of Ariel Sharon, or whatever you see fit, I don't consider the title to be of an important issue (barring pringles &amp; such!). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 06:48, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sigh. It's not enough that the old man is in a coma, or that the fututre of Isreal, Palestine, and probably most of the rest of the world as a result, has been thrown into uncertainty. But now you're bickering over potato chips and challah? Yes, he was severely overweight, and I have no doubt his obeisity contributed to his current condition, or that it will kill him before his time. But right now, there is something more important to worry about. We can save discussions on his diet until after his body is cold and in the grave.</dd>
<dd>It appears that the idea would be <cite>keep it separate for now, and once the whole story has unfolded, then merge it here</cite>. But if the objective is just "data management", for lack of a better term, then it would perhaps be a good idea to move the entry from the article namespace, to something like Ariel Sharon/Illnesses. We'd be making it into a temporary subpage, as opposed to an article, which is what is raising the eyebrows. Thoughts?

<dd>Sorry, what? I am well aware of the role played by wikinews. As for moving the article to Ariel Sharon/Illnesses, I could not care less, nor do I see how it makes the slightest difference about anything. Perhaps you'd opt explain why it matters, though? No one, to my knowledge, cares about how it's denoted on the namespace (&amp; how does it matter so long as it's linked from the main article?), but some are questioning the utility of the article itself. If and/or when it is merged, then it would no longer be on the namespace. Simple. This seems like needless overcomplexity, but again, it's trivial enough that I don't care to expend any more thought of it beyond my ("data management, for lack of a better term") puzzlement.

<dd>Well, it seems to be agreed upon that the separate article should not exist, and that it should be merged, but at a later time. By moving it out of the article namespace and making it a subpage of the Ariel Sharon article, with the express role of a "staging area" for a future merge, we prevent constant re-opening of the discussion of whether or not the article should be there. Furthermore, it's not proper for us to create "temporary articles", that are only there for a period of time, for a later merge with another article. Gotta keep it organized somehow. I'm only thinking about making things as clear as possible, and in the process, minimizing our work related to whether or not the article should exist.

<dd>The only benefit (which is probably a big benefit depending on your view) of making the Illnesses article a subpage of the Ariel Sharon article is that the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illnesses_of_Ariel_Sharon_76a5.html" title="Illnesses of Ariel Sharon">Illnesses of Ariel Sharon</a> article can be made a redirect to the subpage, and when the hullabaloo settles down, the content can be merged into the Ariel Sharon article and the redirect easily changed to point to <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> instead of to Ariel Sharon/Illnesses. What I see as the biggest arguments in favor of this is the two part "We all agree it's a temporary page"--and--"when the time comes we can avoid the whole <i>to merge or to not merge</i> discussion as a foregone conclusion", avoiding an edit war over where the redirect should point in the process.

<dd>Good answer, Redux. To Tomer also: Actually, now I do have a problem with this, as a shortcut to consensus. We don't need namespace devices to reflect on the prevailing thinking that we, <i>at this point in time</i>, are following. We can note it in whatever notice we feel is needed (if at all). If this method is followed, I would like for it to be brought to the realm of policy and guidelines; that is, I want many more editors involved in what that method means, editorially, beyond just this case, for any possible future parallels (and for this case, future developments — as unlikely as those are with respect to turning the article in the future into a notable topic in itself).

<p>Thanks for your words&#160;:) And what you're saying does make sense, and I agree. I'd favor that, once we've moved the article to the subpage, the redirect from "Illnesses of Ariel Sharon" to the subpage be deleted. If anything, because people just will not research that. The tendency is for people to come to this article in order to find information about Sharon, and from here, if need be, they are redirected elsewhere. At the Ariel Sharon article, I see it as essential for us to have a header pointing to the subpage, or else people might start adding information to the main article as well, and we'll have to be going back and forth to integrate everything. And, at the subpage, I'd favor including a notice at the top, making it clear to contributors that that page is temporary, and that the content will be merged into the Ariel Sharon article at a later time, a process which could result in further trimming of the text, etc., etc.<br />
I remember a while back I started a discussion concerning people's eagerness to create new articles about topics that should really be sections of other articles. Unfortunately, the general response I got was basically "boys will be boys", so now we are still working on this on an article by article basis. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 22:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Likewise. Point taken, but still, I'll think we may have to deal with these potential difficulties, regardless. It's possible that preparing for it so expressedly, in that sense, may compound rather than aleviate these issues. I am against a notice on top of the page since I don't wish to disorient the reader. We could, however, work on establishing such a notice on the top of the talk page. Thanks again for your thoughts.

<p>While Tomer is looking for his precious pills&#160;;), I'll say this: a notice on the talk page only would be sufficient for users minimally experienced, but anons and generally newcomers tend to ignore those. I'm thinking that if some major development were to take place (such as mr. Sharon dying), the main article would be overwhelmed with anons wanting to pitch in about what happened. El_C is right: no matter how much we antecipate and prepare, there's always the possibility that everything will go down the pipes. Of course, as a <i>last resource</i>, if the main article becomes too unstable as a result of the current events (which would render pointless our having a staging area for this), we <i>might</i> consider temporary protection of the Ariel Sharon article (or rather, semi-protection), as a means of directing the "mess" to the temporary entry. But, why is it that you think that a notice at the top of the article could disorient users/readers? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 12:28, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have not reviewed this myself, but it has been suggested during this discussion that a lot of the information at the "Illnesses.." article is redundant with what is already at this article. A later merge, in this case, would mean trimming down the information significantly. <i>Assuming</i> that to be a fact, the users who have posted here thus far have expressed a general opinion that the information should be merged here, just at a later time (and thus using the subpage as a staging area). I suggested moving the article to a subpage position because, if it is decided that the separate entry is temporary, just to gather and organize information before merging it into the main article, than it would be bad form for us to keep it in the article namespace. Furthermore, as long as it is there, an opening exists for people to start discussions about whether or not it should exist, and we'd be running in circles, addressing the same points over and over again.

<dd>Yeah, I know what a Hebrew name is; it's just to me a concept that doesn't make as much sense for an Israeli Jew named Ariel as for an American Jew named George or something. For Israelis, the "son of"/"daughter of" form is just a traditional <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patronymic.html" title="Patronymic">patronymic</a>; it's not any more "Hebrew" than their ordinary name. Of course "Arik" belongs in the article; it certainly was here before and must have been removed very recently. I think it would be a bit overkill to include "Ariel ben Shmuel", but it certainly would be appropriate to include the names of his parents, which communicates the same information.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 08:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Ariel ben Dvora thing is being spread around by people (family, rabbis, various kibbitzers) requesting that people (individuals, synagogues, various follow-the-leader types) say a misheberakh for Ariq. Since his father is Jewish, his Hebrew name if he were to be called for an `aliya would be ben Shmu`el, not ben Dvora (although in some congregations it might be ben Shmu`el uDvora [ben Shmu`el's dad, etc.]). That said, I rather doubt that Sharon (as an Ashkenazi) actually considers his father's name to be part of his own. Not that I'm presuming to speak for him, but afaik, that's not part of Ashkenazi naming convention. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 08:15, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Sabra and Shatila references in the intro and appropriate section seem out of tune with each other. The intro states:</p>
<p><i>Furthermore, some consider certain of his wartime actions</i> (particularly during the 1982 Lebanon War, see below) to have been war crimes.</p>
<p>The 'Sabra and Shatila massacre' section reveals that it was the <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahan_Commission_f109.html" title="Kahan Commission">Kahan Commission</a> that recommended Sharon to be removed from his post as defense minister because:</p>
<p><i>We have found, as has been detailed in this report, that the Minister of Defense [Ariel Sharon] bears personal responsibility. In our opinion, it is fitting that the Minister of Defense draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office...</i></p>
<p>In my opinion, if the Kahan Commision reference is correct, the intro needs to be rewritten. While <i>some</i> consider his wartime actions to have been war crimes, I think it should be remarked in the intro that a government-appointed Israeli commission recommended his removal from office, because he <i>bears personal responsibility</i>.</p>
<p>Given the controversial topic, I'd like to hear some feedback before anyone touches the intro. 213.140.21.231 10:28, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While the Kahan Commission refers to "personal responsibility," this is only after it makes clear that "absolutely no direct responsibility devolves upon Israel or upon those who acted in its behalf." The reference is to Sharon's "indirect responsibility"--a point that isn't (but probably should be) made clear in the "Sabra and Shatila" section. 24.61.42.54 02:28, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People love to believe they aren't being told the whole truth. Perhaps this skepticism is good, because it ensures that people will always doubt and check the media's source material, creating greater accuracy. At the same time, I don't really think the media has a vested interest in lying about Ariel Sharon's medical crisis. People are probably more distressed now, because there's so many possible outcomes (death? full recovery? Partial recovery? Permanent disability? Resumption of political activity? Cessation of political activity and retirement into obscurity?) than there would be if there was only one outcome (death). Think of how you would feel if someone you felt passionately about (love or hate) were in a coma. Would you feel more relief if they were dead? At least then, you'd know what to expect.

<p>According to the World Tribune, Sharon was declared dead by 6 AM EST on Friday January 6th by physicians at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital.</p>
<p><i>A computed tomography scan taken on Friday morning showed little to no brain activity in Sharon. At that point, Sharon's son, Omri, called aides and senior officials to the hospital to prepare for an announcement of the prime minister's death.</i></p>

<dd>It means clinical death, I think. All of this will likely become clear soon. Even though no one had said anything at this stage, it looks likely that they'll set up a commission to look into the health care he recieved, esp. why he wasn't forced to rest after the 1st stroke (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ariel_Sharon&amp;diff=34074166&amp;oldid=34073285" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ariel_Sharon&amp;diff=34074166&amp;oldid=34073285" rel="nofollow">this</a>). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 05:13, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have changed the title of this section from "Sharon's Dead? Or Is He?" to "Death Rumors." Based on the news, it appears very much as if he is NOT dead. Even the worldtribune.com story linked-to above states both that he is, and is not, dead. Of course it could all be one huge conspiracy and he really did pass away on Friday but it is being covered up for some unfathomable reason. But I don't think so. Anyway, I changed the heading so nobody looks at it and immediately decides Sharon is dead, when all the current evidence suggests he is not.

<p>At the moment we have far too much detail in the lead section, and we should avoid this, even for subjects that are high-profile current events. I propose we move nearly all the information about the stroke from the lead section to the "Health problems" section, leaving only a sentence or two in the lead.

<p>Do we really need three huge paragraphs in the introduction, taking up more than half the section, dedicated to his hospitalization? This wouldn't be a standard part of a biography.

No. Just because it's a current event shouldn't give the event such huge prominence in the introduction — there should be a short reference to it, and then the information should be in the article's body. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 15:46, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, but... You could put all of the details in the section later in the article regarding his health, and/or in the separate article about his health, but I suspect someone will just come along and add a lot of that stuff back into the intro. This (these) article(s) will not stabilize until after Sharon's situation does (for good or for bad) and the information can be added, rationally, into the right places in the article, and the "Illnesses" article can (probably) be merged back into this one.

<p>"It is the duty of Israeli leaders to explain to public opinion, clearly and courageously, a certain number of facts that are forgotten with time. The first of these is that there is no Zionism, colonialization, or Jewish State without the eviction of the Arabs and the expropriation of their lands."

<p>What's more, this certainly can't be said to represent Sharon's "ideology and beliefs", even from the time. In fact, on Nov. 17, one day before the alleged quote, Sharon spoke before the Israeli Knesset, saying:</p>
<p>"I know of no other nation that would give up land embodying its historical heritage, but the government had to decide whether we want to make a genuine, sincere effort to reach arrangements that may some day, God willing, bring peace between us and our neighbours. The government's answer was yes. I, too, decided to try to reach an arrangement with the Palestinians."</p>
<p>So again, let's all be careful to keep within Wikipedia guidelines, and, of course, to stay accurate. Thanks. Gni 19:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed that some contributors have been copying passages from articles by Robert Fisk and pasting them into the body of the article (without quotes or citation, as if it was written by a contributor). That's alarming not as much because of the clear plagiarism, but because turning the wikipedia article into a Robert Fisk article hardly bodes well for neutrality.</p>
<p>This passage from a 4/17/01 Fisk article, for example, was pasted right into the Ideology &amp; Beliefs section:</p>
<p>"He voted against the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979. He voted against a withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 1985. He opposed Israel's participation in the Madrid peace conference in 1991. He opposed the Knesset plenum vote on the Oslo agreement in 1993. He abstained on a vote for peace with Jordan in 1994. He voted against the Hebron agreement in 1997. He condemned the manner of Israel's retreat from Lebanon in 2000"</p>
<p>The passage about Lt. Grabowsky in the Kahan report, which has been removed due to inaccuracy (see Sabra Shatila discussion above), was similarly pasted directly from a Fisk article.</p>
<p>I hope all agree that there is, and must remain, an essential difference between a neutral Wikipedia encyclopedia entry and a partisan Fisk opinion column. Gni 21:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The passage on Gaza evacuation states that "Dov Weisglass was quoted in Haaretz on October 6, 2004, as saying the purpose of disengagement was to destroy Palestinian aspirations for a state for years to come." Only a miniscule fraction of the Weisglass interview was published in the Oct. 6 Haaretz. The full interview was published Oct. 8, and it became clear that the Haaretz "teaser" from Oct. 6 distorted and took out of context Weisglass' words. In the full interview, Weissglas says nothing about "destroying Palestinian aspirations," and it is disingenuous and partisan POV to word it this way. He said in the interview that the gaza disengagement came after Israel, along with the U.S., "reached the sad conclusion that there is no one to talk to, no one to negotiate with" on the Palestinian side. "What's important is the formula that asserts that the eradication of terrorism precedes the start of the political process," Weissglas noted. This principle, he said, was the main achievement of the "road map" peace plan. According to Weissglas, Israel was pushed to the disengagement idea because the Palestinians were not fulfilling their obligations under the "road map". With the "road map" stalled, he explained, Sharon realized Israel would be pressured to negotiate even while the terrorism continued and that the principle calling for an immediate stop to Palestinian violence would be "annulled." He continued: "And with the annulment of that principle, Israel would find itself negotiating with terrorism. And because once such negotiations start it's very difficult to stop them, the result would be a Palestinian state with terrorism ... The disengagement plan is the preservative of the sequence principle. It is the bottle of formaldehyde within which you place the president's formula so that it will be preserved for a very lengthy period. The disengagement is actually formaldehyde."

<p>I believe the term <i>"Incapacitation"</i> does not accurately reflect the overall health ordeals Sharon has gone through. His health problems did not begin with his being comatose. I tried changing article title to <i>"Health Problems and Subsequent Incapacitation"</i> but it has been reversed to <i>"Incapacitation"</i>. I'd say we should keep his illness a very brief memo on the page and link readers directly to his "Illnesses" page. Shiranweber 18:59, 24 February 2006 (UTC)Shiranweber</p>
<p>His previous health problems, whatever they were, were not politically important. He was after all a very overweight man in his 70s so he was bound to have some health problems, but so what? His stroke and subsequent incapacitation is what is politically important.

<dd>It is not meaningless. Areil Sharon is highly controversial. He attracts a great deal of passionate support and criticism, and always has. Sharon does happen to attract polarized opinions about himself and his policies. It is just flat out false to claim that he is no longer so since falling into a coma. However, if you really dispute that he is controversial and want citation, I understand, though it might seem strange to a reader that such a widely held view seems to require citation. More importantly, it's Moshe's edit that "Today his critics are mostly outside of Israel" which is false, and unsupported by citation. Also, Moshe's other changes and citations do not match. The BBC source he used does not say that at the time of his stroke Sharon enjoyed support "from most areas of the political spectrum" or that "<a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadima.html" title="Kadima">Kadima</a> is expected to gain a plurality in the 2006 national elections". I replaced one of the BBC sources with another that directly mentions what Kadima is expected to accomplish, and accurately correlated the information about support for Sharon at the time of the stroke, to the source. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 00:35, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It doesn't signify, since Moshe has accepted the rewording and source changes/correlation re support for Sharon and expectations of Kadima, and since there is no longer a claim that he is no longer much criticized in Israel, which was my principal objection, I find the removal of the "controversial" description to be adequate.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 00:35, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While the Sabra and Shatila massacre was undoubtedly a defining moment in Sharon’s history, I find that the article focuses too much on it while neglecting his vital role as the originator and architect of the Israeli invasion to Lebanon in 1982 (during which the massacre took place).

However, now comatose, Sharon's chances for recovery are estimated as "very low".

<dd>It was common practice in the early 50s for all gov't officials and sr. army officers to change their names which had meaning in European languages to Israeli/Hebrew names that either sounded like their previous name, or had the same meaning, as part of the process of "nation building".
