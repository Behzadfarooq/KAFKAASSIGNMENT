<p>Aristides (named for his breeder's good friend and fellow horse breeder, the Pennsylvanian Aristides Welch who had imported Leamington into the US) was foaled late in the season, and was small, never standing taller than about 15 hands. But his stablemate and half-brother, the bay Chesapeake, was bigger and born months earlier. He was also a mean-spirited cuss.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> It was Chesapeake who was expected to do well at the races.</p>
<p>Price McGrath was himself no prince.

<p>Both Aristides and Chesapeake were born and bred on the McGrathiana Farm in <a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayette_County%2C_Kentucky_2917.html" title="Fayette County, Kentucky">Fayette County, Kentucky</a>, a short canter from <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington.html" title="Lexington">Lexington</a>.</p>

<p>Fifteen horses were entered into the first Kentucky Derby, two of them fillies. The track was fast, the weather was fine, and ten thousand people were in attendance. Aristides was one of two horses entered by Hal McGrath. The other, of course, was Chesapeake. Both horses wore the green and orange silks of H.P. McGrath. Trained by future <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame_1577.html" title="National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame">Hall of Famer</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansel_Williamson_1d92.html" title="Ansel Williamson">Ansel Williamson</a>, an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>, Aristides was ridden by <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Lewis_36de.html" title="Oliver Lewis">Oliver Lewis</a>, also African American. (In those days, African-American jockeys dominated the sport.) McGrath expected the smaller speedball Aristides to be the "rabbit." He was to go out front fast and force the pace so that Chesapeake, ridden by Bobby Swim (a celebrated jockey, and white), could stalk the front runners, and when they and Aristides tired, would come from behind to vanquish the exhausted field.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Just as McGrath had planned, little Aristides broke in front and took the lead, but a horse called McCreery quickly overtook him near the end of the first quarter. Aristides fought back to lead again, followed by McCreery, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Broeck_2ff6.html" title="Ten Broeck">Ten Broeck</a>, Volcano, and Verdigris. Chesapeake, meanwhile, was almost the last to break and wasn't doing much at the back of the pack. As the "rabbit," the willing Aristides kept gradually increasing his lead until there was really no chance that Chesapeake could ever catch up. Chesapeake wasn't that kind of horse...and this McGrath did <i>not</i> plan. Aristides's <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jockey.html" title="Jockey">jockey</a>, Oliver Lewis, knowing he wasn't supposed to win, looked to owner McGrath...but McGrath wisely waved him on.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Both Volcano and Verdigris challenged Aristides in the stretch but it was no use—Aristides won by a long length and took the $2850 pool. Chesapeake came in 8th. (A horse who would go on to greatness came in fifth that day: Hall of Famer Ten Broeck owned by Uncle John Harper.)</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville_Courier-Journal_9988.html" title="Louisville Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a> wrote: "It is the gallant Aristides, heir to a mighty name, that strides with sweeping gallop toward victory...and the air trembles and vibrates again with the ringing cheers that followed."</p>

<p>Aristides, again ridden by Oliver Lewis, came in second in the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belmont_Stakes_d32b.html" title="Belmont Stakes">Belmont Stakes</a>, the race that today is the third race in the triple crown of American thoroughbred <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_racing.html" title="Horse racing">horse racing</a>.

He came in second in the Thespian Stakes and the Ocean Hotel Stakes and was third in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travers_Stakes_78d5.html" title="Travers Stakes">Travers Stakes</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, Aristides raced twenty one times with 9 Wins, 5 Places, and one 1 Show. His career earnings were $18,325, a considerable sum for the times.</p>
<p>In 1875, he was the American Champion Three Year Old Male.</p>
<p>Aristides died on June 21, 1893.</p>
<p>In 1988, the Grade 3 Aristides Handicap was inaugurated at Churchill Downs to honor the little red horse who wasn't supposed to, but did, win the first Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>A life-sized bronze statue of Aristides by Carl Regutti stands in the Clubhouse Gardens as a fitting memorial.:)</p>
