<p>While Mu is depicted as a pacifist throughout the first half of the series, he is an extremely capable fighter when the situation demands so. Not only is the Saint of Aries built with two offensive and one defensive attacks, he is also a master of various psychic techniques. From basic teleportation to advanced telekinesis, Mu is revered as a premiere psychic user among even those outside of Sainthood.</p>
<p>"<b>Crystal Wall</b>" is a defensive technique that creates a transparent, glass-like barrier between Mu and an object. The wall is very durable, and has been shown to shield Mu against everything from normal cosmos attacks to poison scent. The strength of the wall is dependent on Mu's cosmos level; at 100% of his power, it was unbreakable to almost all but Mu's mentor, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Shion_ad0f.html" title="Aries Shion">Aries Shion</a>. Reduced to 10% of his power, however, the wall becomes far less useful; it failed to withstand against <a href="../../../w/y/v/Wyvern_Rhadamanthys_d104.html" title="Wyvern Rhadamanthys">Wyvern Rhadamanthys</a>' "<b>Greatest Caution</b>" attack.</p>
<p>"<b>Starlight Extinction</b>" is a psychic-based offensive technique. On its own, it is a fairly powerful move that defeated even gold saints such as <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisces_Aphrodite_8bc8.html" title="Pisces Aphrodite">Pisces Aphrodite</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_Deathmask_e74b.html" title="Cancer Deathmask">Cancer Deathmask</a> (However, it can be argued that those two gold saints faked their defeat, since their defection to Hades is fake). It can also be used to teleport an opponent out of sight; when Mu used it against <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Seiya_2a2c.html" title="Pegasus Seiya">Pegasus Seiya</a>, he was able to send the bronze saint to a location of his choosing.</p>
<p>"<b>Stardust Revolution</b>" is Mu's most powerful move. Like "<b>Crystal Wall</b>" and "<b>Starlight Extinction</b>", it is an attack that was handed down by his mentor Shion. The attack summons stardust from stars and galaxies, and obliterates an enemy with raw cosmos power.</p>
<p>In addition to all of these powerful techniques, Mu is also blessed with the amazing speed of Light that all Gold Saints possess. He can also teleport his own body at will at anytime, even during the midst of battle.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Mu_85a3.html" title="Edit section: The most gifted Saint">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The most gifted Saint</span></h2>
<p>Under the tutelage of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Shion_ad0f.html" title="Aries Shion">Shion</a>, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Mu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.</p>

<p>Mu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official Chinese translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as 'Mu xiansheng' (穆先生), or 'Mister Mu'. He is good friends with <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taurus_Aldebaran_31fc.html" title="Taurus Aldebaran">Taurus Aldebaran</a>, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libra_Dohko_3b60.html" title="Libra Dohko">Libra Dohko</a>.</p>
<p>Before the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Shion_ad0f.html" title="Aries Shion">Aries Shion</a>, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or cosmos power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn't until years later, when he met <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Shiryu_b1f1.html" title="Dragon Shiryu">Dragon Shiryu</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Seiya_2a2c.html" title="Pegasus Seiya">Pegasus Seiya</a>, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.</p>
<p>Throughout the series, Mu is the man to go to when a saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person's total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and a sprinkle of stardust to return life to a dead cloth.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Mu_85a3.html" title="Edit section: Encountering the Bronze Saints">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Encountering the Bronze Saints</span></h2>
<p>After their lengthy battle with one another, bronze saints Shiryu and Seiya found themselves with the loss of their cloths -- they had both heavily damaged them to the point where it was impossible to wear them. With the impending threat of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Ikki_ce96.html" title="Phoenix Ikki">Phoenix Ikki</a> and his Black Saints, Seiya and Shiryu both desperately needed a solution. Luckily for them, Shiryu's sensei, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libra_Dohko_3b60.html" title="Libra Dohko">Libra Dohko</a>, knew of a man who would be able to return life to their bronze cloths. That man was known as Mu of Jamir. Shiryu, carrying both the Dragon and Pegasus cloth on his back, quickly left for a journey to locate this mysterious entity.</p>
<p>Shiryu had to endure many traps and hardship on his way across the mountains. Dead spirits of former saints haunted him. Giant boulders crashed down from the sky. But after all was said and done, Shiryu overcame Mu's tests of determination and finally reached the mystical Jamir. At first, he was greeted by Kiki, of whom he had assumed to be Mu himself. Fortunately, Mu was present in Jamir at the time, and appeared to the Dragon Saint to correct the misunderstanding. Shiryu then dropped the two bronze cloths and begged Mu to repair them. Mu originally refused, stating plainly that the armors had been far too damaged for him to fix. However, he soon found himself convinced to give Shiryu a chance when the bronze saint revealed that he would sacrifice his very life if it meant the cloths could come alive once more.</p>
<p>Mu agreed to take the job, but explained that he would need 1/3 of Shiryu's blood on the cloths before he could touch them. Shiryu, without the slightest bit of hesitation, slit his own wrists and poured his blood onto the Dragon and Pegasus bronze cloth. Mu was impressed, and healed Shiryu's wounds just as the blood had dripped to the amount he needed.</p>
<p>In the manga, Mu appeared moments after the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Ikki_ce96.html" title="Phoenix Ikki">Phoenix Ikki</a> vs. the Bronze Saints battle was over. He used his teleportation abilities to remove Seiya, Shiryu, Hyoga, and Shun out of the collapsing Mt. Fujii. After getting the saints to safetly, he was confronted by silver saint <a href="../../../l/i/z/Lizard_Misty_b9fa.html" title="Lizard Misty">Lizard Misty</a>, who threatened him by creating a crater with one finger, inches from Mu's feet. Mu was unimpressed, however. The would-be fight was interrupted when Seiya's mentor, <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Marin_e897.html" title="Eagle Marin">Eagle Marin</a>, appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>At one point, the silver saints commented that it would be a bad idea to challenge Mu. Although it was not known at the time, their assumption was correct because Mu is, in fact, a gold saint.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Mu_85a3.html" title="Edit section: The Gold Saint Mu, Guardian of the Aries Temple">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Gold Saint Mu, Guardian of the Aries Temple</span></h2>
<p>After the defeat of the Silver Saints, the Supreme Pontiff commented that he was missing 3 sets of Gold Cloth to complete the 12 Gold Saints of the Zodiac:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gold Cloth of Sagittarius, which belonged to the "traitor," Aiolos, which was now currently in Japan.</li>
<li>The Gold Cloth of Aries, belonging to a hermit living in Jamir with the power to repair Cloths.</li>
<li>The Gold Cloth of Libra, belonging to the oldest Gold Saint who left Sanctuary many years ago, living in the Roshan Falls.</li>
</ul>
<p>He dispatches <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_Deathmask_e74b.html" title="Cancer Deathmask">Cancer Deathmask</a> to Roshan, attempting to take the Gold Cloth of Libra by force from its owner, who was revealed to be Roshi, Shiryu's master. Roshi does nothing to stop Deathmask, and Shiryu was clearly no match for Cancer Deathmask - a Gold Saint with the ability to move at the overwhelming speed of light. As Deathmask was about to use his deadliest technique on the Dragon Saint, the Gold Saint of Aries interferes, and prevents Deathmask from killing Shiryu, saying that Shiryu is a good friend of his. Shiryu is shocked that Mu was actually the Gold Saint of Aries.</p>
<p>Although he has left Sanctuary many years ago, Mu was bound by duty to return to Sanctuary when Saori Kido declares that she is Athena, and challenges the Pope for leadership of Sanctuary. When the Bronze Saints were sent to make their run through the 12 Temples, they see that Aries Mu was the guardian of the first temple. Instead of fighting them, Mu tells the Bronze Saints that their Cloth withstood small amounts of damage over the past battles, and asks them to spend 1 hour here so he could repair them. He also reveals to the Bronze Saints about the "Seventh Sense," the strongest cosmo that is mastered by the Gold Saints.</p>
<p>Mu decides to stay behind with his apprentice Kiki, and watch over the body of the fallen goddess while the Bronze saint go through the 12 Zodiac palaces.</p>
<p>Near the end of the battle in Sanctuary, Mu suddenly hears the voice of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Shaka_e1f0.html" title="Virgo Shaka">Virgo Shaka</a>, calling him from another dimension to help him return to the material plane. Mu replies that Shaka is a Gold Saint and should have no trouble crossing over this plane. Shaka explains that he has another being with him, and he need his help. Out of all 12 Gold Saint - Mu is the most gifted Saint in Telekinesis. Mu agrees to help and suddenly <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Ikki_ce96.html" title="Phoenix Ikki">Phoenix Ikki</a> returns to the Earthly plane along with Virgo Shaka. After their return, Ikki rushes to help Seiya fight with the Pope.</p>
<p>Aries Mu reveals the secret which was known among very few (Libra Dohko, and perhaps Cancer Deathmask - see Episode G) that the Grand Pope is actually the former Gold Saint of Gemini - <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_Saga_b686.html" title="Gemini Saga">Gemini Saga</a>. It was Saga that had orchestrated the assassination of Athena, labeled Aiolos a traitor and took over Sanctuary as Pope.</p>

<p>Because their Cloth has been destroyed in the battle against various Gold Saints, Mu had to repair them again. This time, each Cloth was repaired by the blood of a Gold Saint, allowing them to reach levels of strength similar (though not equal) to a Gold Cloth. Similarly, they would glow golden when a Bronze Saint powers his cosmo to a Gold Saint level.</p>
<p>During the war against Poseidon's Marine Generals, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Aiolia_785c.html" title="Leo Aiolia">Leo Aiolia</a> wanted to join the Bronze Saints to save Athena. Unable to stand still, with the knowledge that the weaker Bronze Saints are battling overwhelming odds, enemies powerful than them, and even confronting a God - decides to leave the House of Leo and head off to Atlantis to help the Bronze saints. However, Mu reveals that under orders of Roshi (who acts as second-in-command of Sanctuary due to the death of the Grand Pope, and the absence of Athena - and him being the Eldest of the Gold Saints) all the Gold Saints must remain in Sanctuary, to prepare themselves for "the war that is ahead." Aiolia was angered by this, and Mu threatened to stop him by force if he tried to leave.</p>
<p>The spirit of the deceased Gold Saints Sagittarius Aiolos and <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarius_Camus_6f06.html" title="Aquarius Camus">Aquarius Camus</a>, hearing their dispute, send their Gold Cloth to Seiya and Hyoga, allowing the remaining Gold Saints to remain at Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Despite the order that Roshi has declared in Sanctuary - Aioria comments in how that won't stop his older brother's way of thinking. He has always watched over everybody and has decided to go off to Atlantis to help the Bronze saints against Poseidon. Shortly - the Aquarius Gold Cloth takes off as well.</p>
<p>Mu thanks both former Gold saints in helping them in such crucial moments.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Mu_85a3.html" title="Edit section: Hades: A Reason to Fight">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hades: A Reason to Fight</span></h2>
<p>At the entrance of the Aries temple, the first temple of Sanctuary, several black cloaked men have appeared before Mu. Mu tells them to stop, but the leader of the cloaked spectre orders Mu to bow down to him. Mu is shocked when he recognizes the man as his deceased master <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Shion_ad0f.html" title="Aries Shion">Aries Shion</a>, former Pope of Sanctuary, and does so. Shion orders Mu to enter Sanctuary and return with the head of Athena, an order which Mu could not accept. Shion then sends two spectres: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_Deathmask_e74b.html" title="Cancer Deathmask">Cancer Deathmask</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisces_Aphrodite_8bc8.html" title="Pisces Aphrodite">Pisces Aphrodite</a>, to attack Mu. Mu managed to reflect their attacks with his technique: <b>Crystal Wall</b>, while Shion mocks Mu for daring to stop him with such a simple trick, and shatters the Crystal Wall.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Seiya_2a2c.html" title="Pegasus Seiya">Pegasus Seiya</a>, who arrived in Sanctuary, is shocked to see Deathmask and Aphrodite still alive, and tries to fight them. Mu stops him by hitting Seiya, and explaining to him - that this is no longer a battle for a simple Bronze Saint. Deathmask proves this point by hitting the Pegasus saint many times, while Mu only watches. Seiya is ready to counter-attack when a gold beam pierces his chest from behind. Mu declares that he will kill him if he refuses to leave Sanctuary, an order decreed by the Goddess Athena herself. Seiya refuses to believe that, and Mu is left with no choice but to finish off the Pegasus Saint with a <b>Starlight Extinction</b> attack (though in reality, he actually warped Seiya to another part of Sanctuary). He then proceeds to defeat Cancer Deathmask and Pisces Aphrodite with another <b>Starlight Extinction</b> attack, banishing them to the world of death once more. According to Shion, this was the first time Mu fought to kill his opponent.</p>
<p>Shion tells Mu that this is not over, and warns him that <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_Deathmask_e74b.html" title="Cancer Deathmask">Cancer Deathmask</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisces_Aphrodite_8bc8.html" title="Pisces Aphrodite">Pisces Aphrodite</a> are not the only fallen saints after Athen. The spectre of <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_Saga_b686.html" title="Gemini Saga">Gemini Saga</a>, <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarius_Camus_6f06.html" title="Aquarius Camus">Aquarius Camus</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capricorn_Shura_f445.html" title="Capricorn Shura">Capricorn Shura</a> appear before him. Mu is shocked to see, the strongest of the Gold Saints stand before him and he was no match for their combined power. A battle of the most powerful Gold Saints begin, which ends with Mu being defeated, allowing the three to pass through the Aries temple. Shion paralyzes Mu, and decides to kill him in a painless manner because he was fond of his former pupil. Shion tries to finish Mu himself, but is interrupted by <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libra_Dohko_3b60.html" title="Libra Dohko">Libra Dohko</a> (Roshi), Shion's friend in the past Holy War 243 years ago. Roshi reveals Shion's true nature, and reveals that it was him and Shion, the only 2 survivors of the past Holy War. He orders Mu to gather Aioria and the rest to protect Athena for next 12 hrs (Roshi realizes that Shion's and the others' lives are like the flame on the clock, slowly dying away) - Mu then pursues after Saga, Camus and Shura.</p>
<p>In the Taurus temple, Mu is surprised to see <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taurus_Aldebaran_31fc.html" title="Taurus Aldebaran">Taurus Aldebaran</a> dead. He realizes the true Spectres of Hades' army have infiltrated as shadows in Sanctuary after the appearance of Deep Niobe, who claims that he poisoned Aldebaran to death, and attacks Mu. Mu blocks his attack with the <b>Crystal Wall</b>, and tells Niobe that he is already dead and has been killed by Aldebaran's <b>Great Horn</b> but fails realize that his body his about to fall apart. Niobe is shocked as his body explodes as Mu exits the temple.</p>
<p>Mu then comes across another Spectre, saying Mu is his target (all Spectres seemed to fear him, and thus leave). The Spectre revealed himself to be a caterpillar-looking creature, and traps Mu in a cocoon. Mu managed to break free eventually, and the Spectre states that he was only biding time to transform into his ultimate form: he now appears as a human with a butterfly surplice, Papillon Myu. He possesses strong telekinetic powers much like Mu, which he uses for this battle. Myu managed to evade Mu's <b>Stardust Revolution</b> attack easily, and used his <b>Fairy Thronging</b> attack which managed to pin down Mu twice, but Mu escapes both times by teleportation. Myu wonders why Mu wouldn't teleport away to another temple escape the battle, and Mu reveals his attack: he has woven a web with his psychic powers and stardust, trapping Papillon Myu and the fairies he use for his <b>Fairy Thronging</b> in a giant spider web. He then proceeds to kill him with the <b>Stardust Revolution</b>.</p>
<p><i>(Note: <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Aiolia_785c.html" title="Leo Aiolia">Leo Aiolia</a> reveals that Sanctuary is under the cosmo and will of Athena, and not even Mu - the Gold Saint with the strongest psychic powers, is able to teleport any further than within the same temple. No matter how strong a person can be in Cosmo, all living beings in Sanctuary must travel by foot. However, in the past it was seen that Saints may warp across Temples with use of Another Dimension attacks, which Saga and Shaka use.)</i></p>
<p>Mu arrives in the Virgo temple, and prevents Seiya and others from helping <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Shaka_e1f0.html" title="Virgo Shaka">Virgo Shaka</a>, saying that this was Shaka's final wish, but is shocked to see that Saga, Camus and Shura have just killed the Gold Saint Virgo Shaka with the <b>Athena Exclamation</b>, the forbidden technique. Saga, Camus and Shura charge up another <b>Athena Exclamation</b> - threatening that they will do it again if anyone stands in their path. Mu reminds Saga, that there are also 3 Gold Saints standing in their path. Mu combines his powers with <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Aiolia_785c.html" title="Leo Aiolia">Leo Aiolia</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpio_Milo_a855.html" title="Scorpio Milo">Scorpio Milo</a> to use <b>Athena Exclamation</b> against them. The clashing powers of two Athena Exclamations destroy the Virgo temple apart. Eventually, the combined power of these two attacks was deflected by <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Shiryu_b1f1.html" title="Dragon Shiryu">Dragon Shiryu</a> (in the anime, it was by the combined power of all 4 Bronze Saints). Athena beckons the two parties to stop fighting and come to her at her palace. Athena tells the fallen Gold Saints that they no longer have to suffer and commits suicide (secretly invoking the 8th sense as told by Virgo Shaka in his petals he sent her) and it was then that Shion's true intention was revealed: they came to Sanctuary as Spectres to tell Athena of the God Cloth, and that the only way to defeat Hades was to enter Hell alive using the Eighth Sense - the ability to go the realm of the dead while having the will to live.</p>
<p>Mu, Aioria and Milo arrive in Hades' castle, where they face Wyvern Rhadamanthys. To their shock, Rhadamanthys easily overpowers the three of them, revealing that in Hades castle is under Hades' will and cosmo - all Saints have their power reduced to 1/10th (this was stated by Gemini Kanon in the anime AND in the Manga). He defeats all three of them easily, and throws them into the abyss to Hell.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Seiya_2a2c.html" title="Pegasus Seiya">Pegasus Seiya</a> was cast into the frozen Hell where those who dare to defy the gods are kept, he saw Aries Mu, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Aiolia_785c.html" title="Leo Aiolia">Leo Aiolia</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpio_Milo_a855.html" title="Scorpio Milo">Scorpio Milo</a> trapped in there as well, apparently dead. However, upon Athena's arrival to Hell, they were revived by her power, and broke free. The three arrived in front of the Wall of Sighs, the gateway to Elysion, with <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Shaka_e1f0.html" title="Virgo Shaka">Virgo Shaka</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libra_Dohko_3b60.html" title="Libra Dohko">Libra Dohko</a>, and the group attempts to break the wall with the weapons of the Libra Cloth, but fail. Eventually, they had to gather all 12 of the Gold Cloth, and sacrifice themselves to open this gateway, allowing the Bronze Saints to reach Elysion - the paradise of the Gods - the true home of Hades.</p>

<ul>
<li>Although Mu appeared very early in the series, it was only by the Hades arc that his fighting abilities were seen. This was due to Mu's <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifist.html" title="Pacifist">pacifist</a> nature (commented by <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Shion_ad0f.html" title="Aries Shion">Aries Shion</a>), and the first time he fought to kill his opponent was against <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_Deathmask_e74b.html" title="Cancer Deathmask">Cancer Deathmask</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisces_Aphrodite_8bc8.html" title="Pisces Aphrodite">Pisces Aphrodite</a>.</li>
<li>In <i>Saint Seiya: SD</i>, Mu's talent for reparation extends far beyond cloths -- he is also able to repair electric appliances, and even owns his own business.</li>
