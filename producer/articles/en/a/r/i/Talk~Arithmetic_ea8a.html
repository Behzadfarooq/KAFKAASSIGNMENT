<p>According to the wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_theory.html" title="Number theory">number theory</a>, (the sense of the term) arithmetic is not to be confused with (the sense of the term) <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_arithmetic.html" title="Elementary arithmetic">elementary arithmetic</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I do think there is a lot of good stuff in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_arithmetic.html" title="Elementary arithmetic">elementary arithmetic</a> and am concerned that this article might evolve to duplicate much of what is there.</dd>

<p>Probably not a lot of progress to be made until someone turns up who actually does arithmetic in a sense other than the sense of elementary arithmetic.</p>
<p>mikeliuk 16:36, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is currently no material here that cannot be put under either elementary number theory or elementary arithmetic. As such, this topic is superfluous. Arithmetic - in the broadest sense - is the set of properties one might associate with the integers. Yet arithmetic is in no way restricted to the integers. For instance, "arithmetic of elliptic curves" describes the point of view of treating points on elliptic curves as integers, whereas "arithmetic in rings" describes the use of number theoretic properties (such as divisibility and irreducibles) in general rings (usually in Dedekind domains where the definitions make most sense). If we are to make the topic of arithmetic different from that of number theory and elementary (aka pre-school) arithmetic, I suggest this is the most appropriate route to take. 217.155.61.70 18:01, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strange enough, all commentors here agree that "arithmetics" should not be confused with "elementary arithmetics", yet this persists on the main page.</dd>

<p>"Base 2" or "a binary base" or simply "binary" are what you are inaccurately referring to. Note that "binary operation" is a compound term with a distinctly different meaning.</p>
<p>"Binary operations" are defined at this moment as such in their Wikipedia entry. [Perhaps it carries some weight with you?]</p>
<p>"In mathematics, a binary operation, or binary operator, is a calculation involving two input quantities and one kind of a specific operation. It is sometimes called a dyadic operation as well.</p>
<p>More precisely, a binary operation on a set S is a binary function from S and S to S, in other words a function f from the Cartesian product S × S to S." _________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>"Typical examples of binary operations are the addition and multiplication of numbers and matrices as well as composition of functions on a single set." __________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>"Binary operations are often written using infix notation such as a * b, a + b, or a · b rather than by functional notation of the form f(a,b)." ________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The following definition is currently on the Wikipedia entry for "arithmetic"-</p>
<p>"Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics which records elementary properties of certain arithmetical operations on numbers."</p>
<p>This is an empty definition because it relies upon the term "arithmetical operations" to define the term "arithmetic".</p>
<p>(Omitted an inappropriate remark.)</p>
<p>OmegaMan</p>
<dl>
<dd>I realize that there is more than one definition of binary, but the 1 and 0 one is more prominent and it is likely to confuse the readers. If you could explain it better, than maybe it could be used. You have to remember that this is an encyclopedia and the readers are not likely to be well versed in math. The first paragraph at least should probably be a general idea that describes the subject in the least confusing terms possible. Perhaps if you explained the term binary in this context later in the article, it would be more helpful and it could be used. I did not mean to imply that you do not understand the field (I am a math minor myself).</dd>

<p>Hm. I tend to think of arithmetic as the symbol-manipulating procedures on numerals ... but I admit that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is about something deeper than that, so it may be too narrow. 142.177.23.79 23:40, 14 May 2004 (UTC) (My degree was in maths but all my education's Canadian, so ignore it. =p )</p>
<hr />
<p>Can anyone explain what on earth "arithmetic" (in the sense of this article) has to do with "change"??</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Arithmetic is a branch of (or the forerunner of) mathematics which records elementary properties of certain operations on numerals.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Completely inaccurate. "Arithmetic" has 2 distinct senses:
<ul>
<li>The study and practice of computational algorithms involving certain operations on integers and other numbers. These typically include +, -, *, ...etc., etc. The focus here is on the ALGORITHMIC and COMPUTATIONAL nature. This type of arithmetic is not an exploration of "properties of certain operations". It is simply the application of algorithms which implement the operations.</li>
<li>Number theory (MODERN, as well as "elementary"). The study of the properties of the integers, esp. related to primality, divisibility, etc., etc., as well as any of the outgrowths of modern research that have developed as a result of this study.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>These are 2 different things. Saying "which records elementary properties of certain operations", makes it sound like a fuzzy combination of both. The first sense only records results of applying algorithms, not "properties", the second records properties of operations, but much more (not just "elementary properties", not just "operations", etc.) The definition at the start manages not to get EITHER sense correct.</dd>

<p>I would like to work on the history of arithmetic, but I'm worried that it will take me too far afield. I think the scope should be limited to arithmetic that can be performed with up to only pencil &amp; paper (e.g. no <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napier%27s_bones.html" title="Napier's bones">Napier's bones</a>, no multiplication using trig functions, and certainly nothing electronic.) This would include finger math, the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_peasant_multiplication.html" title="Russian peasant multiplication">Russian peasant algorithm</a> algorithm, and (a few others after I think about it.) And also, limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_a_s_f9ec.html" title="User:M a s">M a s</a> 01:34, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Have deleted the starting paragraph, "Recent experiments in cognitive science <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> have shown that even infant humans have an <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subitize.html" title="Subitize">innate ability</a> to add and subtract small numbers (up to about five.) Linguistic evidence suggests that all cultures have had the concept of numbers greater than five, and the words for various numbers are in many languages simple additions (or in rare cases subtractions) of small numbers."</p>
<p>The phrase "recent experiments" does not give a good introduction to history. "Cognitive science" can tell us about history but would need rather more discussion. The sentence on "linguistic evidence" is rather short considering it heads the section on "history".</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments Mike. I was trying to create a case (which many people believe, and have argued better than I have) that concepts of arithmetic are innate or at least predate written or recorded history - hence the connection to the experiments in subitizing, and also the connection to linguistic evidence. Is it your sense that such an argument should be integrated into the history section, or are you saying that a "prehistory" preamble doesn't belong?

<p>Sorry that the original comments were terse&#160;:) There should certainly be something about the observation that humans have a tendency to show understanding of number; both at very young ages (an innate understanding or an innate predisposition to formulating concepts of number), and this understanding is seen to develop independently in geographically separated civilizations. The proper place for ideas of innateness should probably be in the unfortunately titled <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_arithmetic.html" title="Elementary arithmetic">elementary arithmetic</a> (which is elementary in the sense that this branch of mathematics takes so much paper to outline that it could be in no way innate) where there is discussion of mental arithmetic and the arithmetical operations that one could argue are innate.</p>

<p>Research mathematicians like my colleagues and I generally consider the arithmetic algorithms not as a tedious school subject, but as the living heart of algebra. Abstract algebra was not cut out of whole cloth by Galois or Kummer or Hilbert. The ring axioms of associativity, distributivity, etc, are what make the standard algorithms work: understanding the algorithms essentially means understanding these properties, which is half-way to abstract algebra. Furthermore, the recent movement toward computational algebra and algebraic geometry (Grobner bases), is a direct continuation of the genius of the arithmetic algorithms.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that there's a lot of beauty and elegance in the algorithms themselves, and the relationship to abstract algebra is clear. There's plenty of documentation in the computational complexity studies to indicate that some computer algorithms for multiplication (<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strassen.html" title="Strassen">Strassen</a> etc.) were only developed after a more full understanding of abstract algebra. But is there any reliable documentation to show that the development of ring theory, field theory, and aa in general was influenced by a desire to understand the school algoirthms for arithmetic in general? In other words, which preceded the other? Thanks. --<a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_a_s_f9ec.html" title="User:M a s">M a s</a> 22:16, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the statements that <i>Subtraction is essentially the opposite of addition...</i> and <i>Division is essentially the opposite of multiplication...</i> probably need to be removed, since the definition of an opposite to an operation isn't given. it might be a simple way for schoolchildren to remember ("when i add two numbers, the result is bigger. when i subtract two numbers, the result is smaller"), but i don't think that is a mathematically rigorous definition, though i may be wrong. in fact, i'd be happy to find out that i am wrong and see an article on it, either old or newly created&#160;:) 192.223.226.6 16:14, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted Milogardner's edits, then put back his reworked sentence about the Egyptians. Saying 'It is clear that Babylonians and Egyptians..' doesn't work for two reasons. Firstly the next sentence starts 'Likewise' and goes on to talk about Egyptian maths, and compare it to Babylonian maths. This doesn't make sense if the Egyptians have already been mentioned. Secondly, the first sentence claims 'historians cna only infer' the methods of derivation. But then the next sentence goes on to explain how the Egyptians did their arithmetic! If the Egyptians 'aren't given enough credit' in this paragraph, it needs to be properly reworked, and not butchered by a casual edit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EVia_strass_3093.html" title="User:Via strass">Via strass</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/a/User_talk%7EVia_strass_d649.html" title="User talk:Via strass">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Via_strass_0aee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Via strass">contribs</a>) 11:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
