<p>A pleasure to have another contributor knowledgeable about Chassidus. I found your new article <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernobyl_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_29c6.html" title="Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)">Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)</a> very informative. Please work on your formatting, though. "Nowiki" tags are rarely used the way you are using them. The same goes for the external links - footnotes (such as with <a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">Template:Ref</a>) are more useful for this, or inline links which display as footnotes.</p>
<p>I had to put your page Ariel Sokolovsky up for deletion. It says nothing about you beyond what is on your userpage.

<p>Eliezer here is a copy of my email to JDwolf:<br />
By the grace of G-d<br />
Shalom uBrocha!<br />
Jfdwolff I didn't threaten to mailbomb Eliezer. Reread what said. I offered to write a satirical article similar to <a href="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com/2005/06/just-say-no-to-terrorism.html" class="external text" title="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com/2005/06/just-say-no-to-terrorism.html" rel="nofollow">Just Say no to Terrorism</a> on my <a href="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">popular website donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com</a> dedicated to <a href="http://www.yudelkrinsky.com" class="external text" title="http://www.yudelkrinsky.com" rel="nofollow">Elizer's Rebbe</a> and <a href="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com/2005/07/house-confused-cannot-stand.html" class="external text" title="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com/2005/07/house-confused-cannot-stand.html" rel="nofollow">his faithful emisaries</a> And to put his email ad dress in the article so other Chassidim of Yudel can email him and give him much needed [[c hizuk]] If that's mailbombing threat in that case [<a href="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com/2005/04/who-is-amazing-donkey-moshiach.html" class="external free" title="http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com/2005/04/who-is-amazing-donkey-moshiach.html" rel="nofollow">http://donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com/2005/04/who-is-amazing-donkey-moshiach.html</a> Yudel is not a donkey] As a side note due to the simple technology at my disposal your ban is totaly useless waste of time. You should better rescind it and ban Eliezer instead for mercilesly deleting other POVs than his own over extanded peri od of time. I bet If I were to delete theRebbe.org because like Chabad.org it's a part of the same corrupt PR structure called Chabad Media Center he would scream bloody murder,yet he had [[ hutzpah]] to delete Chabad.am because it's a devision of Lubavitch Networks and leave 1 single mashichist site in the whole external links section of both <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabadand</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson_07ba.html" title="Menachem Mendel Schneerson">Menachem Mendel Schneerson</a> articles specificaly to downplay the internet visibility of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson&amp;section=7#Succession" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson&amp;section=7#Succession" rel="nofollow">Mashichistim</a>].

<dd>If you are concerned about visibility of <i>Mashichistim</i>, your present approach is about the worst you could choose. Trolling, jargon, threats and insertion of external links will be treated with annoyance by other users, and treated with blocks by administrators. On Eliezer's talk page I gave you some tips on how to be tolerated on Wikipedia: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">balanced reporting</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">avoiding personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing your sources</a>. Violation of these policies will lead to decreased visibility of <i>Mashichistim</i> and your failure to achieve your goal of coming to Wikipedia in the first place.</dd>
<dd>Sockpuppetry is considered a bannable offense, and creation of different accounts to engage in edit warring has previously led to long-term (e.g. 1 year) bans. I urge you to stop this. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 16:08, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

For the benifit of those editing the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad</a> and related articles I'm going to post an email exchange between me and Eliezer on this page and you are welcome to repost it elswhere&#160;:</p>
<p>In response to my request to him few months ago asking to stop misinforming the Wikipedians about the true nature of our beliefs as to the identity of Moshiach Eliezer sent me an email with an attachment of a cutout part of a letter in the Rebbe's handwriting&#160;: Date: Wed, 20 Apr 2005 17:16:14 +1000 From: "Eliezer 770" &lt;&gt; View Contact Details To: ariel5740@yahoo.com Subject: letter from Rebbe from Adar 5752</p>
<p><br />
See what I wrote on My talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Eliezer" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Eliezer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Eliezer</a></p>
<p>attached to this was this picture of the Rebbe's letter with the Rebbe's words retyped next to it for easier reading: <a href="http://www.torah.5u.com/rebbe's-letter.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.torah.5u.com/rebbe's-letter.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.torah.5u.com/rebbe's-letter.jpg</a><br />

<ol>
<li>1 I'm well aware of the letter you attached.I'm also aware of the background of the letter.A shaliach was giving lectures identifying the Rebbe as Moshiach it bothered another Chossid and he criticized him for it and wrote to the Rebbe King moshiach Shlit"a about the situation the Rebbe replied to him with the letter containing this fraze (to the effect that he shouldn't criticize the Shaliach anymore since ahavas Yisroel is important.This letter was taken out of context and publicized by a well known "anti-mashichist" few years later causing the person this letter was ardressed to to come and speak about it in 770 to make people aware of the deception taking place.</li>
<li>2 Wikipedia is a neutral point of view enviroment.You have to agree the article as I have changed it presents a more objective view of the situation.Even the link to video from my site I have posted shows that the Rebbe has aproved calling him Moshiach before the stroke unlike the nonsense stated in the previous version of the Wiki article.</li>
<li>3 The Sichos from 5745 you quoted are irelevant to the issue just like Rebbe's answers about acceptance of Nessius from 1950 are irrelevant now as far as the question is it permited to call him a Chabad Rebbe in view of the later Sichos on the subject.</li>
<li>4 Boruch Hashem I was able to cause a number of people to study More Chassidus and some to become shomrei mitzvos specificly using the internet to promote the identity of Moshiach Igrot Koidesh as a way to communicate with him and publishing his prophecies and miracles.(If you want I can ask my mekurovim to contact you and tell you their stories.)</li>
</ol>
<p>But this is secondary to the fact that the Rebbe himself said we should publicize the identity of Moshiach in the media (look in the public bookmarks subject list here <a href="http://www.otzar770.com" class="external free" title="http://www.otzar770.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.otzar770.com</a> and personaly "leaked" parts of Sichos about it to newspapers ordered Kehos to print the title Admo"r MH"M Shlit"a on his Sforim published Dvar Malchus -Word of the King see <a href="http://www.rabbiyess.com/ruling_of_Rabbis.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rabbiyess.com/ruling_of_Rabbis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbiyess.com/ruling_of_Rabbis.html</a> etc etc etc<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>5 I can change the page as often as you change it back and I can post this email and even more links and quotes from the Rebbe King Moshiach Shlit"a in support of it on the general talk page which would make you look stupid and or dishonest, but I am not going to do it if you stop changing the page back but instead try to add things to it to improve it to make it more informative.<br /></li>
<li>6 As a Chabadnik you should know that everything that happens is for good including Bergers attacks on Chabad and article on Israel613.com .I personaly became interested in learning more about Chabad in 5753 after reading a book by the students of Shach trying to prove that Chabad is avodah zorah and if you want it's posible to find lot's more examples like this from modern times and from the history of Chabad and Chassidism in general of people being drawn to it as a result of being exposed to opposition to it.<br /></li>
</ol>
<p>Brocha veHatzlocha!<br />
Gut Moed!<br />
With love and respect and prayerfull wishes for the end of this silly machloikes.<br />
Sincerely Yours:<br />
Ariel Sokolovsky<br />
PS:I think you would enjoy reading this answer from the Rebbe about importance of unity <a href="http://moshiachtv.blogspot.com/2005/04/rebbe-says-unity-is-important.html" class="external free" title="http://moshiachtv.blogspot.com/2005/04/rebbe-says-unity-is-important.html" rel="nofollow">http://moshiachtv.blogspot.com/2005/04/rebbe-says-unity-is-important.html</a> PPS:If you read the Wiki article as you have changed it you'd see it doesn't give much honor to the Rebbe or many of his Chassidim who proclaimed him Moshiach.It's much less "be'oifen ha'miskabel" than after my changes and additions.The enciclopedia is not meant to be a venue for Yudel's propaganda machine it's meant to present honest and objective picture to people researching the subject.<br />
PPPS:If you revert the article to previous version again I'm posting this letter on the talk pages of Chabad and Lubavitcher Rebbe on Wiki , (not to mention any other creative tricks that I may have up my sleeve. Read my bio online to learn what I'm capable of doing when I see people who are censoring the Rebbe's words <b><a href="http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/ariel_sokolovsky.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/ariel_sokolovsky.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/ariel_sokolovsky.htm</a>  :-)<br /></b></p>

Now go make a Didan Notzach farbrengen with your friends about this amazing development:-) PS. By the way your intention to "simply enforce Wiki rules" was once again proven when you didn't simply remove that one link you had problem with but reversed the whole article with all the added info and gave this as an excuse.

<p>For now on, I say Ariel is Mashiach!!! May He Bless Himself!!!</p>
<p>No, I am Moshiach, the Rebbe said so. The Rebbe cannot wait for me to resurrect him from the dead. (that's right, Ariel, he's dead).</p>

<p>I just looked up the rules you cite and there is an exception: "Action If you feel it necessary to make changes to Wikipedia articles despite a real or perceived conflict of interest, we strongly encourage you to submit content for community review on the article's talk page or file a Request for Comment to the wider community, and to let one or more trusted community members judge whether the material belongs in Wikipedia.

<p>The article Yudelism has been speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

As far as <a href="../../../y/u/d/Yudel_Krinsky_7614.html" title="Yudel Krinsky">Yudel Krinsky</a> himself I have nothing against him personaly he is a very softspoken and intelegent man (who can allow police to beat up Jewish mothers next to 770 and arrest them in front of their kids, but every great leader makes mistakes King Saul for example destroyed city of innocent Kohanim let that not blind us to organizational prowes and messianic charisma of <a href="http://www.donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://www.donkeymoshiach.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">our great leader</a> ).

(not that chilul Hashem is a valid arguement as far as Wiki rules are concerned for example if you vote to delete Yudelism because in your subjective opinion it is chilul Hashem you are breaking Wiki rules a point lost on some prominent <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad.html" title="Chabad">Chabad</a> wikipedians who deleted <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gil_Student_f878.html" title="Gil Student">Gil Student</a>'s profile few times till they could do it nomore or my profile for that matter despite obvious notability after HaAretz article <a href="http://rebbegod.blogspot.com/2007/02/for-readers-of-rebbe-as-g-d-new.html" class="external text" title="http://rebbegod.blogspot.com/2007/02/for-readers-of-rebbe-as-g-d-new.html" rel="nofollow">"Lubavitcher Rebbe as G-d"</a> and two other articles in major newspaper about me. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriel_Sokolovsky_3ee1.html" title="User:Ariel Sokolovsky">Ariel Sokolovsky</a> 16:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
