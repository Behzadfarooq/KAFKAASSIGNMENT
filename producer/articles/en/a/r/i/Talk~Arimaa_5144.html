<dd>Yes, I think it would make sense to mention Go as the prime example of a game computers play poorly relative to humans. But apparently there are others such as Havannah, Octi and Twixt.

<dd>Even a comparatively mediocre player can currently beat the best Go software. Most advanced Go software is considered to be at 5th to 8th Kyu, amateur scale, which can be related to a human amateur who has played regularly for about two to three years at most. A professional Go player would beat the very best Go engine available on any day that he wasn't dead drunk, which makes those things useless except for beginner training. --84.186.219.85 11:24, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think more explanation is needed on the trap squares, and how these can be used to remove pieces from the board. Since the concept of a trap square is quite uncommon in board games.</p>
<p>From what I have seen, there only seems to be one paragraph explaining the trap square and even that is buried in the middle where it is not easily recognized. --82.3.32.72 13:36, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a fair criticism. I recall that when I learned the rules myself, the trap square was explained late in the presentation, even though it was something I was very curious about. It might even pay to explain that there is no replacement capture, as in chess. If you can edit the article to make it clearer to the average reader, please go ahead. Otherwise I will see if I can think of a way to restructure things to cater to people who are totally unfamiliar with the game. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 23:05, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The successful quest to build a world-championship-caliber chess program has contributed essentially nothing to the field of artificial intelligence": huh? sure it has, although people don't seem to listen. Computers don't think like humans do; a machine that can do millions of multiplications a second and store gigabytes of information [i]exactly[/i], but for which fuzzy pattern matching is a non-trivial operation does things differently from a machine that is excellent at fuzzy pattern matching, but has trouble storing more than a few bytes exactly or doing [i]any[/i] multiplication. Funny that. A winning Arimaa program will demonstrate just that, IMO. That's my POV, but it helps show that this statement is POV. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 03:47, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My own POV is that computers are already intelligent in many reasonable senses of the word. I watched on ICC when Kasparov was playing Deep Blue, and heard people objecting to comments like "Deep Blue thinks the bishop is worth more than the knight right now," objecting on the grounds that computers don't think, and to say that Deep Blue "thinks" anything is an abuse of language. I personally believe that it was and is an extremely natural use of language, and to insist that we not talk that way is pedantry. You and I probably agree more than we disagree about whether computers display intelligence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, I believe that my original statement in the article was not as subjective as you are making it out to be. The phrase "artificial intelligence" is coming to have a technical meaning which is divergent from my understanding of "intelligence". There is a community of people who are interested in making computers do certain things well that they don't do well at present, and who are as interested in how it is done as in what is done. To call that set of goals and techniques "artificial intelligence" is in some ways at odds with a common notion of intelligence, but less so than (for example) what ecomonists call "efficiency" is at odds with a common notion of efficiency. For you to object to the way in which artificial intelligence is used in a technical sense seems to me quite as pedantic as objections to saying that computers think.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there are more accurate words to use in these contexts than "think" and "artificial intelligence", then by all means substitute them for clarity. But to insert a "He believes" in front of the statement illuminates only that you had a difference of opinion, and doesn't illuminate your grounds for objecting. Am I right that you are not objecting to the statement of fact so much as taking exception to the way most people define artificial intelligence? Do you accept that strong chess programs are strong for reasons other than pattern recognition, learning from mistakes, using neural networks, self-modifying, or any of the hodge-podge of things that are lumped together under the name of artificial intelligence? If so, then let's get this issue straightened out in some other way than the current edit. Let's recognize it as a fact that chess was conquered by computers in a way that AI people didn't find useful or applicable to the problems that interested them. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 07:06, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. It is worth noting that Bomb, the best Arimaa-playing program at present, does not use any AI techniques (as commonly defined), but rather uses techniques which have worked well for chess. They don't work <i>as well</i> for Arimaa as they do for chess, but so far they work better than anything else that has been tried.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a quick response--your message needs much more thought to respond in full--but I had AI in college, and one of the sections was on alpha-beta trees. If AI has a technical meaning that doesn't include alpha-beta trees, I would say that that technical meaning is too esoteric for wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 23:05, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm... maybe the definition of AI that I've learned isn't as widespread as I think. Just out of curiosity, do alpha-beta trees have applications outside of computer gaming? --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 05:00, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, anywhere stratagy is needed, of course. But beyond that, I suppose that the same concept, if not the exact implimentation, could be helpful in, say, public heath sims as a way to try and determine the best course of action. Of course, it could be argued that that is just a complex game with real applications... hmm... --Kinkoblast 19:13, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't see how alpha-beta trees could have application out of a game; it's a pretty narrow technique. I'm going to try something on the page. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 07:09, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jimmy Wales just posted the pronoucement on the WikiEN-l that "All images which are for non-commercial only use and by permission only are not acceptable for Wikipedia and _will be deleted_." Since there are a lot of images that fall under this category here, I figured I'd drop a note on this talk page to make sure frequent contributors here were aware of it. Perhaps Omar Syed could be convinved to GFDL these images, or some other substitute set created - it seems like a fairly straightforward thing to do once one has appropriate little animal icons to copy and paste onto a blank grid. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:46, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The two images in the main Arimaa article were taken from the arimaa.com server's Flash interface, so I believe the change to the copyright notice is technically incorrect. The images in the Arimaa Tactics and Arimaa Strategy articles were created using David Fotland's copyrighted software, so there the notice would be correct. The images look essentially indistinguishable because they each use piece and board graphics which (I believe) are copyrighted by Omar Syed, i.e. David obtained Omar's permission to use Omar's graphics in his software. I don't know what that does to the legal status of the images, but if it somehow is less legally problematic to have images from the Arimaa server rather than from Fotland's software, even if they are based on the same underlying piece graphics, then I guess I could recreate the images. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 13:56, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

As I understand it, that clears up any licensing problems with the images in the Wikipedia articles. One project for me would be to change the license tags on all the images, but I think an even better project would be to make an Arimaa-diagram template based on the chess-diagram template.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Talk%7EArimaa_5144.html" title="Edit section: Human Advantage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Human Advantage</span></h2>
<p>It is correct to attribute the difficulty fast computers running an AI program reasonably well-designed exclusively for playing Arimaa have mainly to the extremely high branching factor of this game. The four-move-per-turn move cycle and consideration of the vast number of additional, meaningfully-distinct orders for casting the four individual moves comprising a turn is a related factor worthy of specific mention as well.</p>
<p>In attempting to pinpoint the learning psychology involved and how a human advantage manifests, I believe the current description is somewhat incorrect based upon my own related experiences in playing various chess variants (which have positive transfer to Arimaa).</p>
<p>When I first look at the gameboard immediately after my opponent has moved where the positions are complex, I am rarely, totally disoriented even if the moves made were unexpected since I am following the game to that point intently. However, I am usually moderately disoriented at that moment by consideration of the numerous possibilities for response, esp. any competing, important offensive and defensive priorities which must be chosen between sacrificially. I would actually assess my initial state as similar to that of a computer opponent- overwhelmed by the possibilities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I am usually able to quickly identify all of the most pressing offensive and defensive theatres, inerrantly pruning a vast number of bad and trivial moves from further consideration. Then, it is a matter of course to correctly identify the very most important ONE out of typically 2-6 options for response. It often becomes clear with certainty which move is the most important one to make after a thorough analysis of all of the candidate moves is made. Sometimes this requires only a little time; sometimes this requires a moderate amount of time ... but this never requires a huge amount of time such as is the case where a computer is trapped working thru a combinatorial explosion at a given ply of search depth.</p>
<p>I am interested in and value the experiences of others and their opinions.</p>
<p>--AceVentura</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting speculation, Ace. Now that you mention it, I have very little clue why humans can play Arimaa well, and what the elements of the psycholgoical process are. I can observe myself as I play, but that does not provide infallible information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, no matter how inaccurate my wild guess on the subject may be, the issue needs to be addressed. It is not at all sufficient to say that computers play Arimaa badly due to a high branching factor, because there are games with a high branching factor that humans play awfully compared to computers. There must be something about the game that humans are able to quantify more quickly and accurately than computers can.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From my experience I would say that it is possible that I consider and reject many moves so quickly I am unaware of the pruning I am doing. However, it seems highly implausible that I am rejecting thousands or even hundreds of possibilities each move. I am convinced there are whole categories of moves I don't consider at all, for example because I judge a certain theater to be temporarily relatively unimportant. To my mind it is qualitiatively different to neglect to consider a move than it is to consider and reject that move. You may call each a sort of pruning, but that conceals more than it reveals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, as I ponder a position, I routinely find new moves I hadn't considered before that I then judge to be better than any of my previous candidates. This happens even in postal games where I have studied a position for half an hour or more, and suddenly see something new that solves my problems more efficiently or effectively. It does not strike me as being at all similar to selecting from a small number of candidate moves if I can bring new moves into the mix very late in the thinking process. It seems like I say things to myself such as "There must be some move which threatens his camel without exposing my cat. Aha! I have found one!" Is this not more akin to building up a set of candidate moves, than it is akin to winnowing down the multitude to a few?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know how others experience their own thought processes, but I feel that I orient myself by first identifying strategic elements of the position and only second considering relevant moves. I could perhaps orient myself a different way, namely by looking at a variety of possible moves I can make and using those samples to inform me what potential the position holds, but this seems hopelessly inefficient. If there are only a handful of important possibilities, what are the chances I would stumble upon even one of them, never mind several of them that are worth comparing? No, it is much better to try to grasp the position first, and then <i>generate</i> relevant moves. It is a method that seems to work for me, at any rate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, I am aware that my guesses about human game psychology are tenuous, and I am open to the article being edited in any number of ways. In particular (although this has nothing to do with how humans play) you are quite right that generating repetitive moves from different step-orderings consumes a significant percentage of CPU cycles for Arimaa software, and it would be a technological breakthrough to find a way generate each unique move only once. Hash tables may be used to prevent duplicated searching further down the tree when a move is generated multiple times, but it would be nice to be able to avoid multiple generation in the first place. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 06:28, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just as the opposite methods by which chess supercomputers running sophisticated AI programs and top, human chessmasters play chess (for example) extremely well must both be respected, likewise should contrasting methods of evaluation used by skillful human players.</p>
<p>In light of your interesting, detailed description of how you "solve the board" when it is your turn to move (in Arimaa and other board games), I no longer have any confidence that I should replace your personal account, infused into the article, with mine. Unfortunately, I fear that adding my personal account (and others who have not yet spoken-up) alongside yours in describing the human thinking process would unavoidably render this encyclopediac article too vague, confusing or self-contradictory. Instead, I recommend that existing attempts to define and describe the human advantage in Arimaa, however it undoubtedly exists, should be made much more concise so as to confine ourselves to facts we are relatively sure of (if any). --AceVentura</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that my guesses sit awkwardly in an encyclopedia article. I should be more clear about how speculative I am being. One way to do this would be to include alternatives, but I fear you are right that it would make the section vague and rambling. Probably more appropriate would be for me to remove that paragraph entirely and replace it with "we don't know how we do it, but we do it", or words to that effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Still, I feel the need to say <i>something</i> about the remarkable human ability to pick a good move among thousands, because the current vogue is towards oversimplification along the lines of "Any game with a high branching factor will of course give an advantage to humans over computers". This is probably outright false, but at a minimum doesn't tell the whole story. There must be features in the game which are easy for humans to spot and hard for computers to spot, and a high branching factor doesn't insure this. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 17:08, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excellent work! The section you added "human competence" nicely counter-balances the pre-existing section "computer ineptitude". Anyway, there was only one paragraph that I previously took exception to. Describing the human advantage as you did in terms of adaptation or improvement with experience is verifiably factual and simple without taking a dangerous turn into unprovable theories of psychology. Yes, it is responsible to mention that the nature of the human advantage is not fully understood. --AceVentura</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reading these articles has led me to consider what humans don't do. For example our perceptual limitations might be an advantage. Human beings cannot visualize, let alone evaluate, more than a small number of moves in a board game like Arimaa. Yet they can defeat computers. In other words an approach based on limited perception is more effective than brute force analysis or large task methods.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps it is due to our physical and mental limitations that we are even able to make sense of games like Arimaa - or the world in general. Human beings tend to perceive the world as physical objects or conceptual groupings. The rest (math, causation) is ignored. This approach was necessary for our survival as a species - a useful evolutionary algorithm perhaps. I do hope Arimaa will help! Pendragon39 20:33, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's also something to be said for gathering information visually, while the poor computer merely gets blind input from its keyboard. Pattern recognition and object tracking are useful functions being developed for automated systems elsewhere... board games should be no exception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My analysis of human psychology in playing Arimaa would be as follows: The human player examines the board position visually. During the course of this examination, certain areas of the board will attract their attention. The player may make a cursory examination of less interesting areas of the board, but his or her focus will return majorily to those areas deemed to be of greater significance. The player will then examine possible moves in more detail by visualizing the movement of pieces. In terms of what is evaluated as 'interesting' or 'significant', there are two categories: opportunity and threat. More effort is given to moves or situations that appear to fit these two concepts.

<p>The rules section reads: "A move consists of one to four steps." Later in this paragraph, however, the Wikipedia page claims: "[...] one may not, for example, take one step forward and one step back with the same piece, effectively passing the turn." Now that is somewhat contradictory, isn't it? Some confusion might also arise due to the fact that the term "move" is unnecessarily replaced with "turn". The official rules at <a href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/learn/rulesIntro.html" class="external free" title="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/learn/rulesIntro.html" rel="nofollow">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/learn/rulesIntro.html</a> are much clearer about this: "A player can pass some of the steps, but at least one step must be taken on each turn to change the game position." I think said paragraph should be rewritten accordingly. 145.254.33.193 18:52, 8 March 2006 (UTC)Def</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree completely. The terms "step" and "move" are meant to be equivalent but are used inconsistently with the term "turn" used to distinguish that there are 4-moves-per-turn throughout the game.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Step" is NOT a standard term equivalent to "move" in the chess variant community although generally, limited-range pieces with the ability to move only 1 geometrically-contiguous space at a time per move are called "steppers". I presume the inventor unnecessarily and presumptuously made-up this incorrect usage. Of course, he can do as he likes on his own web page but YES, we have standards here.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>AceVentura</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that there is some confusion between "step" and "move". I tried to be consistent in the usage of "step" as being a constituent part of a "move". A step relocates a piece one square orthogonally, whereas a "move" consists of one to four steps. Unfortunately, "move" also has lots of generic meanings. Perhaps it would be clearer to use "step" exclusively to mean moving one space and "turn" exclusively to mean one to four steps, while letting "move" retain a general meaning which is sometimes synonymous with turn, sometimes with step, and sometimes with neither. When it is important to distinguish between a step and a turn we can use the appropriate term, and otherwise freely use "move". I have provisionally made this change in the article in order to see how it looks. Does it appear clearer this way?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I purposely didn't copy "at least one step must be taken on each turn to change the game position" from the official rule, because I found that clause to be confusing when I was learning the rules. The essential requirement is that the position must change, not that a step must be taken. If the requirement were merely that at least one step be taken, then one <i>could</i> take a step forward and a step back with the same piece, which would have the same effect as making zero steps. My personal feeling is there is no need to mention the requirement of taking at least one step at all, because it is subsumed by the requirement of changing the position.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think the sentence, "A turn consists of making one to four steps," contradicts the sentence, "A turn must make a net change to the position." The latter merely restricts the former. If it is still confusing this way, I'll try again to think of better wording.</dd>

<p>Although in popular gamers' language, "move" is sometimes used synonymously with "turn", this is probably due strictly to the commonplace truth of the assumption in most board games which allow 1 move per turn. In Arimaa, where such an assumption is false, "move" should never be used synonymously with "turn". By the way, "turn" has a sufficiently distinct definition as the limited duration, measured in "moves", that one player can exclusively control or operate upon the game following the rules.</p>

<p>I don't think this really should be categorized as a chess variant. It has almost no features in common with chess: movement, capturing, and even the goal are completely unrelated. It has about as much in common with checkers as it does with chess. It seems more like it was <i>inspired by</i> chess (and the strength of computer players thereof) than a variant of it.

<dd>To me, playing Arimaa doesn't feel like playing chess in the way that playing bughouse feels sort of like playing chess, so I also am uncomfortable classifying Arimaa as a chess variant. On the other hand, the equipment is the same, and that isn't accidental. Syed realized that a game could be made computationally more difficult than chess by enlarging the board and adding more pieces, but he wasn't out to "complexify" chess. So not only was Arimaa inspired by chess, it was designed with the constraint of using the same board and pieces. For example Arimaa has in common with chess (and not checkers) that each player has six kinds of pieces. I wouldn't introduce Arimaa as a chess variant, but it seems reasonable to classify it as such. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 04:02, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This feat is calculated correctly by the inventor as being orders of magnitude out-of-reach by state-of-the-art CPU's, regardless of the quality of the written program in terms of its efficiency, resourcefulness or tactical soundness, due to the extremely-high, estimated branching factor of Arimaa.

<dd>From whom did this dubious propaganda originate- the inventor? Are not you two merely splitting hairs over the difference between "absolutely impossible" and "virtually impossible"?</dd>

<dd>Why would complex algorithms consume too many resources? Optimal sorting and searching algorithms are considerably more complex than the naive simple solutions. What matters is the cycles used, not the code size. Your emphasis on evaluation functions misses the point, IMO. For one thing, a lot of work has been done on the code that calls the evaluation functions, like <a href="../../../m/t/d/MTD-f_4bf8.html" title="MTD-f">MTD-f</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negascout.html" title="Negascout">Negascout</a>.</dd>

<dd>More importantly, I think you're looking way too small. The propaganda you complain about comes from AI researchers who have been swearing full AI is right around the corner since five minutes after the Enigma machine cracked its first code. I don't see any chance of getting good solutions to hard AI problems like translation and leave games that can be described completely in a few lines of code without good solutions. Maybe it will come out of neural nets or fuzzy logic or more likely something no one expects, but I expect that alpha-beta type searches are not the end-all and be-all for game playing.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 13:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If and when Omar Syed begins to generate revenue (never mind profit) from his holding of the Arimaa patent and copyright, additional scrutiny of the article will be appropriate. As it stands, however, he has not made a dime, has distributed over $7,000 in prizes to developers, players, and spectators, and has spent several thousands more on the infrastructure that would enable someone to win the $10,000 grand prize. A neutral observer might well infer from Syed's actions that he is more interested in spurring AI research and/or in proving a point than he is interested in making money. I am not neutral: I have personally begged Syed to mass-produce Arimaa sets for the purpose of making money and popularizing the game, and he has repeatedly refused.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The lack of commercialism aside, this article is as factual as those on for-profit games, for example, <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_and_Allies_33f8.html" title="Axis and Allies">Axis and Allies</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratego.html" title="Stratego">Stratego</a>. Even if Syed were making money hand-over-fist from Arimaa (and I hope he does some day), the text would be appropriate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The thrust of your objection appears to be that the $10,000 prize will never be paid out, either because it doesn't exist, or because the conditions of victory are impossible to meet. You present this as a fact. Quite apart from what the text of the article should read, you and I now have an opportunity to make a wager we both will consider profitable. Whether you believe the Arimaa Challenge is "absolutely impossible" to win, or only "virtually impossible" to win, you are quite certain that there isn't even, say, a 9% chance that the money will be paid out. Therefore you should be happy to give me ten to one odds against the event.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At 10:1 odds, I will wager any sum you care to name that Omar Syed will pay out the $10,000 prize by 2020 to someone who has met his Arimaa Challenge criteria. Thus if you wager $100, and Syed doesn't pay out the prize (because nobody has won or because the offer was not genuine or for any other reason), I will pay you $10, whereas if Syed does pay out the prize, I will win $100 from you. We can each forward our stake to a neutral third-party arbiter to hold and pay out to the eventual victor. (If we make the bet, I will naturally recuse myself from defending the Challenge, so as not to have a conflict of interest.) So, how much do you want to bet? --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 20:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gambling is generally illegal in US-America (where we both reside) except in certain places and under restrictive conditions where it is permitted. Besides, I never gamble. Gambling either hurts yourself or the person you win against. Moreover, I do not want to be bothered by keeping an "unfinished business" post-it-note in my financial folder until 2020. I appreciate your brave offer, though, in the spirit it was intended. It is very sporting and it demonstrates confidence. Despite my strong doubts, I actually hope I am someday proven wrong.</dd>

<dd>Interestingly, Syed himself rates his chance of paying out the $10,000 prize by 2020 near 50%. Indeed, he is quite convinced that if we develop sufficiently smart software fifty years from now, that same software running on a vintage 2002 home computer will be able to beat the best humans. In other words, he feels that hardware is <i>already</i> fast enough if only the program is smart enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I rate the chances of a payout by 2020 around 20% myself. Everyone I know considers the chances near zero without an algorithmic breakthrough, i.e. the current programs running 100 times faster wouldn't be enough. Indeed, it is possible the current programs running 10,000 times faster wouldn't be enough, so the uncertainty comes mostly from software approaches that haven't yet been tried.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If someone makes learning software to play Arimaa well, Syed will actually be happy to pay out the prize money. The only way he will think he has "lost" is if boring, brute-force techniques turn out to be sufficient. But in some sense he will have accidentally won simply by creating a game that is great fun to play quite apart from whether computers are good at it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I actually hope that computers can <i>never</i> beat the top humans at Arimaa. If that happens, it will be just one more step towards my obsolescence. But as much as I hope the Arimaa Challenge is insurmountable, I sadly expect it will fall long before computers stop getting faster. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 00:15, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
