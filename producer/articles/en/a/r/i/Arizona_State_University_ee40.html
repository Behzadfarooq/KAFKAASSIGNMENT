<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">February 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>, House Bill 164, “An Act to Establish a <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal_School_1487.html" title="Normal School">Normal School</a> in the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territory_of_Arizona_c5a8.html" title="Territory of Arizona">Territory of Arizona</a>,” was introduced in the 13th Legislative Assembly of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Territory_7e22.html" title="Arizona Territory">Arizona Territory</a> by John Samuel Armstrong. The bill, strongly supported by Charles Trumbull Hayden of <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tempe.html" title="Tempe">Tempe</a>, passed the House on March 6 and the Council on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a> and was signed by Governor F.A. Tritle on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>, thereby founding the institution known today as Arizona State University. Under the supervision of Principal Hiram Bradford Farmer, instruction was instituted on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>, when 33 students met in a single room on land donated by George and Martha Wilson of Tempe.</p>
<p>The institution began with the broad obligation to provide “instruction of persons…in the art of teaching and in all the various branches that pertain to good common school education; also, to give instruction in the mechanical arts and in husbandry and agricultural chemistry, the fundamental law of the United States, and in what regards the rights and duties of citizens.”</p>

<p>For the first 14 years, the school was governed by six principals. At the turn of the century and with another new name, Normal School of Arizona, President Arthur John Matthews brought a 30-year tenure of progress to the school.</p>
<p>He assisted in changing the school to an all-college student status; the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal_School_1487.html" title="Normal School">Normal School</a> had enlisted high school students who had no other secondary educational facilities in Arizona. He embarked on a building schedule that included the state’s first dormitories. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. His legacy of an “evergreen campus,” with the import of many shrubs and trees and the planting of Palm Walk, continues to this day: the main campus is a nationally recognized arboretum.</p>
<p>Matthews also saw to it that the Normal School was accredited outside the state. His service on national education organization boards was conducive to this recognition. The school remained a teacher’s college in fact and theory during Matthews’ tenure, although the struggle to attain status as a university was ongoing.</p>
<p>An extraordinary event occurred <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, when former President <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> visited the Tempe school and spoke from the steps of <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Main_8fe9.html" title="Old Main">Old Main</a>. He had dedicated the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roosevelt_Dam_da30.html" title="Roosevelt Dam">Roosevelt Dam</a> the day before and was impressed with Arizona. He noted that construction of the dam would benefit central Arizona’s growth and that of the Normal School. It would be another year before the territory became a state.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term. This was a time of uncertainty for educational institutions. Although enrollment increased due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Central_Association_f330.html" title="North Central Association">North Central Association</a> became the accrediting agency for Arizona State Teachers College.</p>

<p>In 1933, Grady Gammage, then president of Arizona State Teachers College at <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flagstaff%2C_Arizona_16bf.html" title="Flagstaff, Arizona">Flagstaff</a>, became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years.</p>
<p>The Graduate Division was created in 1937, and the first master’s program was established the same year.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the three state institutions of higher learning came under the authority of one Arizona Board of Regents, which oversees ASU today.</p>
<p>The phenomenal growth of the college began after the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Dr. Gammage had foreseen that the G.I. Bill of Rights would flood campuses everywhere with returning veterans. Many of the veterans who had received military training in Arizona had fallen in love with the state and vowed to return after the war. The numbers within one year were staggering: in the fall semester of 1945, 553 students were enrolled; over the weekend semester break in January 1946, enrollment increased 110 percent to 1,163 students. Successive semesters saw continuing increased enrollment.</p>
<p>Like his predecessor, Dr. Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings. His greatest dream, that of a great auditorium, came to fruition after his death. He laid the groundwork for it with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_96e4.html" title="Frank Lloyd Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, who designed what is now the university’s hallmark building, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gammage_Auditorium_fa21.html" title="Gammage Auditorium">Gammage Auditorium</a>, built in 1964.</p>

<p>During the 1960s, with the presidency of Dr. G. Homer Durham, Arizona State University began its academic rise with the establishment of several new colleges (the College of Fine Arts, the College of Law, the College of Nursing, and the School of Social Work) and the reorganization of what became the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Perhaps most important, the university gained the authority to award the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Philosophy_8163.html" title="Doctor of Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> and other doctoral degrees.</p>
<p>The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn, 1969–71, John W. Schwada, 1971–81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981–89—and Interim President Richard Peck, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, led the university to increased academic stature, expansion of the campuses, and rising enrollment. But this time period also emerged a political nightmare when <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morris_Starsky_fdc0.html" title="Morris Starsky">Morris Starsky</a> - a tentured philosophy professor - was fired for his participation in the anti-war and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> movement.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Dr. Lattie F. Coor, from 1990 to June 2002, ASU grew to serve the Valley of the Sun through multiple campuses and extended education sites. His commitment to diversity, quality in <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undergraduate_education.html" title="Undergraduate education">undergraduate education</a>, research, and economic development underscored the university’s significant gains in each of these areas over his 12-year tenure. Part of Dr. Coor’s legacy to the university was a successful fund-raising campaign. Through private donations, primarily from the local community, more than $500 million was invested in targeted areas that significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign’s achievements were the naming and endowing of the Barrett Honors College, the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts, and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management at ASU East; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.</p>

<p>ASU entered a new era on July 1, 2002, when <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crow_5882.html" title="Michael Crow">Michael Crow</a> joined the university as its 16th president. At his inauguration, President Crow outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_American_University_e159.html" title="New American University">New American University</a>—one that is open and inclusive; that embraces its cultural, socioeconomic, and physical setting; and that promotes use-inspired research. As the only research university serving the entire metropolitan Phoenix area, Crow claims that ASU should be in a unique position to evolve together with the city into one of the great intellectual institutions in the world. Crow created a lot of controversy, gaining many supporters and critics among the faculty. In an early meeting with community members, representatives from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints asked if the new administration wanted the on-campus private church moved as past presidents had (presumably) tried to negotiate. President Crow replied no, that actually he would prefer to see all the on-campus churches further entrench their properties and activities with the campus. In early 2006, the church acted on this advice by tearing down the church institute building to replace it with a much larger complex including its own parking garage. Following the stated mission of the New University, posted on the main ASU website, another recent change has been a plan to include Spanish-speaking Arizona residents in bachelor's and post-graduate programs taught in Spanish (to be implemented over many years), reasoning that the mission of the university is to teach residents of Arizona, and to the extent that they only teach ¾ of the population, the mission is being failed. Those are just two examples of the new value of inclusion, among many other listed new values and examples of change.</p>

<p>ASU has consistently been ranked in the third tier of national research universities by the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_News_and_World_Report_8b36.html" title="US News and World Report">US News and World Report</a> guide to US colleges. This ranking (which reflects admission standards, endowment, graduation rates and student-faculty ratio) is undoubtedly affected by ASU's status as a public university, and its requirement under Arizona law to guarantee admission to any Arizona resident who meets a minimal set of academic requirements. However, the Barrett Honors College serves as a virtual university-within-a-university, and maintains strict admissions standards while providing a more rigorous curriculum with smaller classes and increased faculty interaction. This honors college is largely responsible for the 188 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Merit_Scholar_b62f.html" title="National Merit Scholar">National Merit Scholars</a> who attend ASU.</p>
<p>As of the Spring of 2007, resident tuition and fees totaled $2,345 for 7+ credit hours. The total for non-resident tuition and fees is $7,924 for 12+ credit hours. Current and prospective students should expect these rates to continually rise over the next few years.</p>
<p>ASU has had a reputation as a "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_school.html" title="Party school">party school</a>," and has been highly ranked in party-school lists published by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_Review_c6c9.html" title="Princeton Review">Princeton Review</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Magazine_8ce0.html" title="Playboy Magazine">Playboy Magazine</a> (in addition to being joked about on such shows as <i><a href="../../../m/o/m/Mom_and_Pop_Art_1b83.html" title="Mom and Pop Art">The Simpsons</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../h/e/l/Helping_Hands_%28American_Dad%21%29_0062.html" title="Helping Hands (American Dad!)">American Dad!</a></i>.

<p>ASU Student Media includes The <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Press_e764.html" title="State Press">State Press</a> (student newspaper), the Web Devil (online news site) and <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Devil_Television_2446.html" title="Sun Devil Television">Sun Devil Television</a> (television station broadcast on campus and in student residence halls). The State Press is a daily paper published on Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and weekly during the summer sessions.</p>
<p>The State Press Magazine, a weekly arts and entertainment publication, is published on the back of The State Press every Thursday. The Web Devil, the online arm of the State Press, publishes the paper's daily content online, as well as independent news/editorial content.</p>
<p>ASU Student Media is independent, with a Student Media Advisor employed by the University. 18,000 copies of the State Press are printed every day other than Thursday, when 20,000 are printed. More than 96% of ASU students on all four campuses read The State Press at least once per week, and 65% read it every day or most days. There are an average of 2.5 readers per each copy of the State Press, resulting in more than 45,000 readers across all four campuses.</p>
<p>The campus radio station, <a href="../../../k/a/s/KASC_290f.html" title="KASC">KASC</a> The Blaze 1260 AM, is not an official part of Student Media - it is owned and funded by the Cronkite School - but is completely student-run save for a faculty and professional advisor. The Blaze broadcasts local, alternative and independent music 24 hours a day, and also features news and sports updates at the top and bottom of every hour.</p>
