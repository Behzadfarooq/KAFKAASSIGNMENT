<p>Nothing is known about how Lassiter joined the Cartel or any of his dealings with their group prior to their first battle with the <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers</a>.</p>
<p>In order to take down the Zodiac Cartel <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Fury_36c8.html" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a>, disguised as <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpio_%28comics%29.html" title="Scorpio (comics)">Scorpio</a> captured the Avengers. He called the Cartel for a meeting in order to present the Avengers to them. The Avengers managed to break free before the Cartel could execute them. Fury nmasked himself and joined the heroes in fighting off the Zodiac Cartel. Aries managed to claim the Zodiac Key, and led the Cartel to their escape through a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>Lassiter led the reorganization of the Cartel and its planning to takeover <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. A mercenary group in the Zodiac's employ was sent to <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_Mansion_a6d8.html" title="Avengers Mansion">Avengers Mansion</a> and was able to subdue the Avengers who were subsequently put into stasis. The Aries-led Zodiac army was able to take over Manhattan. Aries used the Zodiac Key to entrapping it within a force field. The Cartel demanded one billion dollars or they threatened to kill the entire population of Manhattan. The <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_%28comics%29_6109.html" title="Black Panther (comics)">Black Panther</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil_%28Marvel_Comics%29_111b.html" title="Daredevil (Marvel Comics)">Daredevil</a> managed to free the Avengers, and, in the ensuing battle, Aries was apparently slain <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thor_%28Marvel_Comics%29_b08e.html" title="Thor (Marvel Comics)">Thor</a> destroyed his vessel with a bolt of lightning. The rest of the Zodiac Cartel escaped capture.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: Grover Raymond">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grover Raymond</span></h3>
<p>Raymond was recruited by Taurus to replace Marcus Lassiter as Aries. The Zodiac Cartel decided to kill every person born under the sign of <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini.html" title="Gemini">Gemini</a> because they thought them to be untrustworthy. The Cartel was defeated by the Avengers who were able to destroy the Star-Blaster which the Zodiac was to use to fulfill their plans.</p>
<p>Following their defeat, Raymond was able to get the rest of the Cartel, except for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libra_%28comics%29.html" title="Libra (comics)">Libra</a> to back him in overthrowing Taurus as their leader. The renegade Zodiac met with Cornelius Van Lunt, the Cartel's financial backer, in an empty warehouse but were attacked by the Avengers during the meeting. Van Lunt fled, but revealed that he was Taurus and that the warehouse was, in fact, a rocketship which Taurus shot into space. The <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vision_%28comics%29.html" title="Vision (comics)">Vision</a> was able to persuade the Zodiac to help the Avengers get back to earth rather than continue their battle. Upon their return to earth, the Avengers turned Aries and the other Zodiac, except for Libra, over to the authorities. Except for Taurus, all the Cartel ended up in prison.</p>
<p>While in prison, Raymond was visited by <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucifer_%28Marvel_Comics%29_28e9.html" title="Lucifer (Marvel Comics)">Lucifer</a>, who had possessed the body of Rafe Michel, a criminal. In order to keep his power from consuming a single body, Lucifer offered to divide his power. Raymond agreed, and gained some of Lucifer's strength, along with his costume. They did battle with the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falcon_%28comics%29.html" title="Falcon (comics)">Falcon</a>, but managed to escape to Mr. Morgan. Morgan asked the two to kill the Falcon.</p>
<p>The two Lucifers attacked, but were defeated by the Falcon. Raymond-Lucifer led the other to Lucifer's base, where they revived Lucifer's undamaged Ultra-Robots and sent them to attack the Falcon. The Falcon, though, was helped by an uncostumed <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a>, who defeated the Lucifers and destroyed the Ultra-Robots. Still unable to contain Lucifer's energies, both host bodies died with Lucifer being sent back to the Nameless Dimension.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: LMD">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">LMD</span></h3>
<p>This version of Aries was a <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_Model_Decoy_373c.html" title="Life Model Decoy">Life Model Decoy</a> created along with an entirely new Zodiac in the Theatre of Genetics by <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpio_%28comics%29.html" title="Scorpio (comics)">Scorpio</a> (aka Jake Fury). The <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defenders_%28comics%29.html" title="Defenders (comics)">Defenders</a> attacked the Theatre and Scorpio was forced to activated the LMD Zodiac prematurely. The Aries LMD rushed into battle but was hampered by his clumsiness and recklessness. During the battle <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_Knight_5932.html" title="Moon Knight">Moon Knight</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nighthawk.html" title="Nighthawk">Nighthawk</a> were able to cause Aries to slam into a wall knocking it unconscious. The Aries LMD was taken into <a href="../../../s/2E/h/S.H.I.E.L.D._6d56.html" title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> custody following the battle.</p>
<p>Later, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac, led by <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quicksilver.html" title="Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, battled the Avengers whom Quicksilver was attempting to frame for treason. During an underwater battle near Avengers Mansion with a team of the heroes, the Aries and Taurus LMDs were flung out into the river and apprehended by the authorities.</p>
<p>After being released from prison, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac attacked and killed all the human Zodiac Cartel except for Cornelius Van Lunt (aka Taurus). Soon after the LMD Zodiac attempted to rob the Denver Mint, but were interrupted by the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Avengers_72af.html" title="West Coast Avengers">West Coast Avengers</a>. During the battle the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpio_%28comics%29.html" title="Scorpio (comics)">Scorpio</a> LMD brought both the Zodiac and the Avengers to the Ankh Dimension, but this had the unwanted result of shutting down all the LMDs, leaving them immobile in that foreign dimension.</p>

<p>It is unknown who the person was who became this version of Aries or how he joined the Zodiac Cartel. He likely was invited by Cornelius Van Lunt as done previously. This Aries was asked by Taurus to kill <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Man_58f4.html" title="Iron Man">James Rhodes</a>. In their battle, Aries was defeated and turned over to the authorities.</p>

<p>It is unknown who the person is who became the fifth incarnation of Aries or how he became a member of the Zodiac Cartel. He was a member of the human Cartel who were killed by the LMD Zodiac.</p>
<p>(<i>Comment: The fourth Aries was an African-American, while the fifth is shown as Caucasian. It is possible that the fourth and fifth incarnations are, in fact, the same person, but there was a coloring error in the issue in which the human Cartel were killed.

<p>This incarnation of Aries was a product of genetic engineering recruited by Scorpio who was working for the <a href="../../../e/c/l/Ecliptic.html" title="Ecliptic">Ecliptic</a>. This version of Zodiac was sent by Scorpio to steal the Nth Projector from <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_H_f9cf.html" title="Department H">Department H</a>. During their mission they were attacked and defeated by <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Flight_4159.html" title="Alpha Flight">Alpha Flight</a>, but were able to escape.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Director of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_X_bf49.html" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a> sent a Weapon X team to the Zodiac's castle headquarters to retrieve <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Jeffries_ac8f.html" title="Madison Jeffries">Madison Jeffries</a> who had become one of the Zodiac's <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_%28comics%29.html" title="Gemini (comics)">Gemini</a> twins. The Zodiac were defeated and Jeffries was recovered. The Zodiac were drained of their life energy by <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Sauron</a> and, after the creature had left, Weapon X blew up the castle leaving the Zodiac for dead.</p>
