<p>Regarding your comments about Khorasan on the Afghanistan discussion board. If this is true, then you need to change the Wikipedia articles on Greater Khorasan, if all of Afghanistan was once part of Khorasan. If you don't have time to change it right away to reflect that all of Afghanistan was once part of Khorasan, please post some type of alert to let readers know the article is incorrect and will be changed. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 23:23, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your introductory paragraphs in the article on Greater Khorasan conflict are still in conflict as is what you posted on my talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the article you say:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Greater Khorasan <i>included territories that presently <b>are part of</b></i> Iran, <i>Afghanistan</i>, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"[Part] of ... Afghanistan" does not, in English, mean the same thing as "Afghanistan's current regions were entirely part of Khorasan."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And when you detail the territory you mention only "northern regions of Afghanistan, and ... central regions of Afghanistan," leaving the reader to conclude that, as you stated early only "part" of Afghanistan was Greater Khorasan, the southern portion of Afghanistan that was not part of Greater Khorasan.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, please change the text to conform in its entirety with what is accurate. Either all of Afghanistan was part of Greater Khorasan and you need to indicate what province the southern portion of Afghanistan was part of, or not all of Afghanistan was part of Greater Khorasan and you need to remove that information.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whether an inaccuate phrase (part of) is used, whether you have misunderstood. I will try to find a better expression for it. In fact, Khorasan was not only limited to Afghanistan. Afghanistan was only a <b>part of</b> Khorasan. So by saying Khorasan included territories that presently are part of Iran, Afghanistan, etc. I think it conveys the exact meaning: The territories of Greater Khorasan are now part of Iran, Afghanistan, etc. <b>So Afghanistan's entire region is part of Khorasan</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I edited that sentence in the article. If you still think it does not express that point, so I would appreciate if you edit that sentence in the article. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriana310_7edf.html" title="User:Ariana310">Ariana310</a> 17:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are you talking about?! I do not know you and you do not know me. Claiming that "Afghanistan was called Khorasan" is wrong. "Khorasan" was a loosely defined region in eastern Persia, dominated by a sedentary, Persian-speaking and Islamic culture. Modern Afghanistan is only one part of Khorasan and not its continuation or inheritor.</p>

<p>Could I suggest that mundane editorial disagreements are most likely to resolve quickly and productively when editors observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain polite per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback and ask questions.</li>
<li>Keep the discussion focused. Concentrate on a small set of related matters and resolve them to the satisfaction of all parties.</li>
<li>Focus on the subject rather than on the personalities of the editors.</li>
</ul>

Your comment, "It clearly indicates your inability for response," fails to "focus on the subject rather than on the personalities of the editors," as you have introduced a personal comment (about the other editor's "inability"), namely your assessment of the capabilities of the other editor. This will not help to resolve the issue, but, rather, has introduced an extraneous issue, your assessment of the other editor's personality. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are two entries at Wikipedia, which have falsely created by Pan-Turkists-- they are <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turco-Persian_3a45.html" title="Turco-Persian">Turco-Persian</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turko-Persian_Tradition_42f7.html" title="Turko-Persian Tradition">Turko-Persian Tradition</a>. Both entries are factitious. I have requested the entries to be deleted. My reasons are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term <b>Turko-Persian Tradition</b> (or <b>Turco-Persian</b>) does not exists academically and it is a factitious entry! Check the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> to confirm -- The correct name for that culture is the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persianate.html" title="Persianate">Persianate</a> culture not the "Turko-Persian". Turkophones (mostly of mixed race and Persianized in culture) only spoke in Turkic dialects and were in the military. That is not enough participation in creating and forming the culture to deserve the name "Turko-Persian Tradition" – This is misinformation. All the elements in that area, which have to do with tradition and culture, were drawn from the Iranian culture (Persian, Kurdish, Azari, Baluchi, Tajik, Luri, Gilaki, Talishi, Mazandarani, etc.), and the Islamic faith, not much Turkic elements (like shamanism, yurts etc.) were incorporated in. That is what makes the name "Turko-Persian" an imaginary one and therefore the entry should be deleted.</i></dd>

<p>Hi Ariana</p>
<p>Just a comment on Bidel:</p>
<p>Iranian experts have been working on Bidel over the last three decades. We have hundreds of persian poets and I think Bidel is among those that have been studied pretty well in Iran. I don't see any point to disrespect Iranian experts. Persian literature is our common heritage. You know that most research works on Hafiz, Ferdowsi, Rumi, ... have been done in Iran. But I think it is not fair to say that Firdawsi, Rumi and Hafiz are unknown in Afghanistan because Iranian worked more on them. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 07:52, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just a comment by an Afghan researcher:</p>
<p>ظرف چند سال‌، بيدل چنان موقعيتی در اين کشور می ‌يابد که بيش از بيست هزار نسخه غزليات او به چاپ می‌رسد و چندين کتاب معتبر درباره اين شاعر نوشته می‌شود</p>
<p><br />
Regards. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 07:57, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am familiar with these arguments. In any case one can not ignore that Iranians were behind Bidel's international recognition and the majority of books written on Bidel were published in Iran. I agree that Bidel has a stronger presence in Afghan music. I can understand this. On the other side Rumi has more presence in Iranian music. One can not argue that Rumi has a higher status in Iran than in Afghanistan. Here we can only talk based on evidence and statistics. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 10:14, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have already read Kazemi's article. The above quote is from him.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 10:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Reza_Shafiei-Kadkani_573a.html" title="Mohammad Reza Shafiei-Kadkani">Mohammad Reza Shafiei-Kadkani</a> who is perhaps Iran's leading literary critic and distinguished professor at Tehran University has conducted a long-term research project on Bidel. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 10:20, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't see what you mean by being "more famous":</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>He has more presence in Afghan music. (agree)</li>
<li>He has a higher status in the heart of Afghan! (disagree/ subjective/pov)</li>
<li>He has a language (relatively) incomprehensible to ordinary Iranians (disagree/As an Iranian I can tell you that ordinary Iranians can not digest the language and style of most of Persian poets including Saeb Tabrizi and even Simin Behbahani!)</li>
<li>He has a language incomprehensible to Iranian experts (strongly disagree)</li>
<li>If you ask a random normal Iranian, there is more chance that he/she has heard the name of Bidel than Saib Tabrizi. (my personal idea)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally I don't like such arguments and I think if you try to enter this game you will be the loser as I can easily provide statistics to show that almost all of these persian poets have a higher status in Iranian research Institutes than anyother country. I don't like to enter this game though. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 10:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Saa'eb Tabrezi is also a poet of Indian school, brings no importance in your point." Ofcourse it makes a difference. Read Kazemi's article.</dd>

<dd>Iranians are either expert or non-expert. I discussed both above. What is your problem with it?!</dd>
