<p>Sorry to bother you <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris</a>, but I was wondering if you would happen to have some good sources for Post-Soviet reform.

<p>Hi. You've helped with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Wiki_Syntax_e9db.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Wiki Syntax">Wikipedia:WikiProject Wiki Syntax</a>, so I thought it worth alerting you to the latest and greatest of Wikipedia fixing project, <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYann_Untagged_Images_164a.html" title="User:Yann/Untagged Images">User:Yann/Untagged Images</a>, which is seeking to put copyright tags on all of the untagged images. There are probably, oh, thirty thousand or so to do (he said, reaching into the air for a large figure). But hey: they're images ... you'll get to see lots of random pretty pictures. That must be better than looking for <i>at at</i> and <i>the the</i>, non? You know you'll love it. best wishes --<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a> <a href="../../../t/a/g/User_talk%7ETagishsimon_9445.html" title="User talk:Tagishsimon">(talk)</a></p>

<p>Hi, I've <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html#Free_the_Rambot_Articles_project" title="User:Rambot">started a drive</a> to get users to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">multi-license</a> all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> Attribution-Share Alike (<i>CC-by-sa</i>) v1.0 and v2.0 <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">Licenses</a> or into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> if they prefer.

Since you are among the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_8bec.html" title="Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits">top 1000</a> Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at <i>minimum</i> those on the geographic articles. Over 90% of people asked have agreed. For More Information:</p>

<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>. The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:</p>

<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:</dd>

<p>I felt like reverting what you've changed but decided not to when I discovered that you <i>appear</i> to be a legimate Wikipedia contributor.</p>
<p>If you haven't worked out already - and I suspect you haven't - this particular article is currently a hot topic. One particular user (Cumbey) has been making edits that other users (myself and Squeakbox) find to be totally spurious and not encyclopedic at all. There now seems to be a major war on this article, and Squeakbox and myself are in the process of convincing administrators to ban Cumbey and the other various sockpuppets or else protect the page from further edits.</p>
<p>Squeakbox has spent a great deal of time fighting for this article's veracity. By coming in and swearing at him and criticizing his work you may appear to be on the side of the vandals. I'm hoping you aren't, and that your comments came from lack of knowledge. By all means contribute to the article, but be aware that it is hot. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 06:38, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Squeakbox may have meant well but he removed relevant quotes and pieces of information, without challenging their accuracy as far as I understand.

<p>This is a good example of how the NPOV rule leads us into falsifying the truth. Everyone knows that the CIS is just a branch office of the Russian Foreign Ministry and that the CIS "observers" in Kyrgyzia were merely Putin agents, but there is no "NPOV" of saying this. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:34, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed -- frustrating isn't it? However I think in the long term, an insistence of strict factuality does much more good than bad to truth. The mere claim that CIS is controlled by Russia (even though I consider it 100% true) one can ignore as bias, or even worse use to justify similarly unsubstantiated claims of foreign control in other pages (regardless of the inaccuracy of *those* claims). But I give a link that goes to a list of factual events showing the nature of such "CIS observations missions". Such facts are less ignorable and more indisputable, and anyone that's not intentionally blind can see the truth. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 06:47, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would make sense to use a standard, wouldn't it?&#160;:-) The process started out a bit unorganized, first someone did only the EU nations (at which point there wasn't much confusion), then we continued with the whole of Europe, now proceeding to the whole world. As I was creating templates I thought of using the first three letters except it such cases where confusion could arise at which point I switched at some other standard like IOC or ISO or FIFA, whatever seemed more natural and intuitive to me.

<dd>Ugh. Some of those are *so* counter-intuitive. Who remembers that CHE means Switzerland? Who'll remember what DZA means? It's okay to *create* templates based on those codes, but it was probably unnessary to replace all the alternate templates (like ALG for Algeria) from the actual pages. I am afraid you may have made the editing of the pages more difficult, with needlessly difficult-to-read codes.... Do please remember that we must also think of the human factor, not standardize for standardization's sake. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 04:51, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Use the TWO-letter country abbreviations, which many people are more familiar with than the three-letter ones, because of their use in domain names</li>
<li>Use unabbreviated names: Template:CROATIA, Template:ALGERIA and so forth.</li>

<dd>You are probably right about the need for a standard (as long as that's reasonable -- remember that there'll always be exceptions e.g. with the need for different GBR and UK template, because the name "Great Britain" is still used in Olympics and so forth). Still I'd argue against reducing the templates to two letters. It'll probably be more incomprehensible then, and even less easy to decipher. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 06:10, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After thinking it over, I think Template:CROATIA, Template:ALGERIA, etc. might be the best solution. A little more typing, but much less error-prone, and no lookup is necessary. It's probably important to make it foolproof, because any fool can edit any article on Wikipedia. Conversions like Croatia → Template:CROATIA could even be automated in some text editors. And the problem with IND not being available for INDIA is solved as well. What do you think? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:13, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Same for Template:PUERTO RICO, which has its own Olympic team, or Template:CHINESE TAIPEI, which is the name Taiwan competes under at the Olympics (with a separate flag). Picking a three-letter abbreviation for "Chinese Taipei" is rather non-obvious, after all. In some cases, we might want flags of sub-national entities, like Template:QUEBEC, which is a separate part of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francophonie.html" title="Francophonie">Francophonie</a>, or templates for the French and Flemish parts of Belgium, which are also represented separately in some international institutions. I think the spell-it-out solution gives maximum flexibility. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:23, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The longer names reduce slightly the value of the template in reducing size, but I guess that's indeed compensated more than enough because of the clarity.

<dd>I'm a bit busy Sunday, so I won't be able to participate today much more in further discussions, but if you will try to widen the circle of debaters, by bringing in some of the people that participated in the template making-and-moving, or making some comments on the talk-pages of those articles with the widest use of such templates, that might be good -- let's bring in more opinions in this issue and widen the circle of discussion. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 06:34, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Too long?? Well, remember, the places we'd be typing in {{PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA}} are simply the places where [[People's Republic of China]] existed previously! So it's the <i>exact</i> same amount of typing, just uppercased and with curly braces instead of brackets. So the full templates should definitely be created, though abbreviations of various sorts could be created as redirects to them.</dd>

<dd>Yes, you should have deleted none of these. The purpose of templates is ease, and I'm gonna want a NEP even if there exists a NPL, and a KUW even if there exist a KWT. The existence of these never hurt noone. I'm not gonna force anyone to remember to use one specific code just because I personally prefer it. I'm not gonna force someone to use the hard to remember AGO if ANG can only mean Angola. I'm not gonna force someone to choose ISO over IOC. Thanks for restoring these.</dd>
<dd>I think one of the problems plaguing this discussions is that both of you seem to believe we only need to have a 1-to-1 link between templates and countries. Not so. I want PRC to intuitively indicate People's Republic of China, and I'd prefer CHN to be the simpler "China" instead. I want my TWN to say Taiwan, and I want by ROC to say Republic of China. I want my Holy See to be different than my Vatican. I want my GBR to be different than my UK.</dd>
<dd>I'm going back to thinking that my way had been the best, except in the cases where confusion may exist (e.g. about what BEL or SLO or MAL could mean). When the idea of standardization means making things more difficult than they had been, it's time to ditch standardization. As long as a template won't be confusing or misleading in meaning by having it, it's good to have whether as a redirect or in it's own right. Instead of forcing people to memorize the ISO, IOC or FIFA codes, they'll have good chances of hitting the right code by just randomly guessing and if they make a mistake to have a good way of guessing the correct answer the second time. And besides I'm gonna build a page, which will mention all possible codes and templates referring to these nations. I'll keep on creating the missing codes, and then start using them.

<p>THANK YOU for cleaning up the introduction to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_Fiji_82c4.html" title="List of political parties in Fiji">List of political parties in Fiji</a>. One well-meaning but over-pedantic user has been working his way through every "political parties" article he can find and adding that rather superfluous preface defining what a "political party" is. He adds a similar one to every article about elections that he can find, trying to define what an "election" is, as if readers of Wikipedia wouldn't know. Having said that, he is an otherwise valuable contributor who actually does quite a lot of useful work, which is why I've avoided clashing with him by reverting all these superfluous insertions. Nevertheless, I'm glad you've done that here. Hopefully, enough other users will clean up the rest! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 13:14, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, given how I've written articles on online comics like <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fans%21.html" title="Fans!">Fans!</a> that you've probably never heard of, I'm sure wasting my time writing articles about international organizations, given how we'll have forgotten all about them in a handful decades. How does the article on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_revolutions.html" title="Color revolutions">color revolutions</a> look to you? Is that "real" enough for you? I'm sure that's also an insignificant topic, having caused the collapse of only three governments so far.</dd>
<dd>I think that the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-Soviet_space_bb72.html" title="Post-Soviet space">Post-Soviet space</a> (an article I've largely helped create from scratch btw) is the place where history is currently taking place. The CIS by itself is not the important thing, the Union of Russia and Belarus is not the main thing, the SCO is not the main thing. Being informed about the alliances of the region however -- that's the main thing. And it'll be the main thing *even* if history passes over the regions and collapses all said organizations. (Then it'll be a piece of history which will be worth knowing.) And the only way I know of detailing all these alliances in a factual neutral-point-of-view manner is by writing about the unions and organizations that express them. Or are you ready to delete all the historical articles also, e.g. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, etc. Castles in the sand, all of them?</dd>
<dd>Which issues do you consider to be "real" political articles, btw? Either way, I think you should reorder *your* priorities.

Yet you still want to put as all together into one box. --<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a> 22:43, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All these countries have the basic commonality of having relatively recently been Soviet Republics. This means they inherited many of the same issues and problems, including their youth as independent self-governing nations, and the element of Russian influence. Monitoring their progress as a group, and describing both their differences and their similarities is not a fool's errand. The Baltic states are the only ones that have broken so cleanly away from the rest of the former Soviet Union that you'd be troubled to find common elements between them and the CIS states.</dd>

<dd>The information there (on <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-Soviet_space_bb72.html" title="Post-Soviet space">Post-Soviet space</a> page) to the best of my knowledge seems to be correct and good. Though, for example, I have some small things I don't like: Poland is mentioned as an "occupier". FYI, Belarus/Lithuania land was an equal member of that union. It was a a totally peaceful union of two states. And even creeping Polonization was never forced, it was happening as a natural process. I did not propose to delete any pages, you have lead the discussion in a different direction. I only wanted to say one thing (and I did say it. Maybe I didn't formulate myself clearly enough): you are focusing on pages like <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Russia_and_Belarus_d6bc.html" title="Union of Russia and Belarus">Union of Russia and Belarus</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/s/CIS_ecc1.html" title="CIS">CIS</a> and from reading those pages one might think it's some really cool organizations with bright future.

<dd>I think that all these organizations are alliances of tyrannies, whose future will *hopefully* be brief -- something I'm also hoping for the reigns of Lukashenko and Putin. These are things I'm *hoping*, but I have no way of estimating. I don't know what is there in the article that you perceive as "coolness". If you have any way of improving the quality of the articles, please do contribute to them. I thank you for mentioning flaws concerning the mention of Poland for example -- that part was written by someone else, and I'll think of ways to improve it. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 00:24, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the advice on editing. I will try to write something in the cases you are talking about. I don't think there is any attempt to take credit for anything in this type of project though. My understanding is that reproduction from the europa site is permissible with the appropriate references to the source. So the problem is that the source should be referenced, isn't that correct? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParmaestro_b88e.html" title="User:Parmaestro">Parmaestro</a> 09:37, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I usually agree with almost all your decisions? I'm curious about your opinion of template use. I don't find it particularly hard to edit templates. It seems to me that when you have a dozen or so articles with identical text and especially where this text will be needed to edited in the future because of upcoming changes that it makes sense to have one template that can be edited/updated/corrected as necessary rather than making the identical edits/corrections/updates to a dozen or more texts. Wouldn't you agree&#160;? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParmaestro_b88e.html" title="User:Parmaestro">Parmaestro</a> 11:36, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Templates are usually good to use, but always in places where the text will *necessarily* be identical. Where it is *good* that it should be identical. This case however is different -- the initial paragraphs of each article should be individual to that article, and if anything these templates worsen and make permanent what was already a not-very-nice redundancy and repetition. Moreover large templates must make themselves obvious as templates: As <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_namespace_8f91.html" title="Wikipedia:Template namespace">Wikipedia:Template_namespace</a> says: "Templates should not masquerade as article content in the main article namespace". <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 11:42, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We seem to be in agreement than about te use of templates. I completely agree with you about the EU-10 template. The only apparent difference we might have is in the application to this specific series of articles. The initial paragraphs in these articles all include an introduction about the euro before discussing the items that specific to the article. Should those introductary paragraphs be deleted and just start with those items that are individual to tha article&#160;? If not and if we are still going to include the same introductory paragraphs, we'd be better off with the template. Or maybe you have a better solution than these two ideas.</dd>

<dd>Since I added the templates to <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_e2bf.html" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion">Wikipedia:Templates for deletion</a> it'd be better if we took the discussion there, if you will. Feel free to move both my comments and yours there, if you want to, or I can do it, if you have no objections. I think that the introductory paragraphs should be as small as possible, and the relevant information in them (and part of it *is* relevant, e.g. when talking about the other side that is in common) perhaps combined with the rest of the text. Turning it into a template makes this introduction permanent however in a way that I don't think it should be made. Moreover, the specific content of the template was itself lacking, as it actually *enlarged* the repeated non-specific information in them, e.g. by adding mention of the circulation dates that hadn't existed formerly. The content of the templates ended up speaking about the whole of the Eurozone, even adding mention about Kosovo or Montenegro!! Egads. But as I said it's more than the specific content that bothered me, it was the nature of the templates themselves. That's why I didn't just edit them but tfd them instead. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 12:09, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with what you are saying. I've already replaced the template with text for EU 10. This template is not in use anywhere now. Although I agree with you that one is not interested in Andorra when reading an article about Belgian coins, I think it is germane to talk about where the euro is a currency which is why the article starts out with saying that it used in the twelve Eurozone member states. I think it's particluarly relevant when there are euro coins from the Vatican, San Marino and Monaco. I agree with you that introductory paragraph should be as short as possible. Are you saying that even if the text is identical, it's better not to use a template even though it means that all the articles would have to be edited separately? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParmaestro_b88e.html" title="User:Parmaestro">Parmaestro</a> 12:20, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid I think it's intrusive, and goes against the typical Wikipedia style of how to begin an article. Also, for clarity's and simplicity's sake, and also because they serve different purposes, I think that the two templates (the background text and the menu on the right) should be discrete, and not contained one in the other. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 15:58, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been persuaded by your arguments and agree that the boilerplate template was a bad idea. I believe the problem arrived because the articles had the same boilerplate introductory text which is itself a bad idea. I think the text explaining the euro coins in general should remain in the euro coins article and the specific state coins should reference that article for people interested in what the coins have in common.</p>
<p>I've made some changes to German euro coins.</p>

<p>I have adjusted the color on some of the images you have uploaded to make them more readable by colorblind individuals (like me). I hope you don't think I uglied them up too badly but some of them were just extremely difficult to make out and I think in the case of maps, information dissemination should perhaps take a front seat to aesthetic quality.--<a href="../../../d/e/g/User%7EDeglr6328_f293.html" title="User:Deglr6328">Deglr6328</a> 07:24, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! I hope you're well. I noticed your reformatting of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html#Table_of_territories_and_regions" title="North America">above noted table</a>; I don't disagree with the reasons <i>per se</i> (and it looks fair) but, unfortunately, I disagree with this reorganisation. A glance at the history for this and other <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> articles will reveal periodic edits to nix this or that territory or move it to one of a region (which may have various definitions) of 'subjective' liking. The reorganised table will promote that. As well, one more or less column (as before) is just as wilful as one or more row (as now). Moreover, the prior format is consistent with tables I've placed in other continents (except Asia and Oceania, due to timing just yet).</p>
<p>I will note this on the NA talk page but, given the above, may restore the prior one. I'm not wholly rigid on this, though. Thoughts? Thanks!

<dl>
<dd>The argument about "one more row is just the same as one more column" seems good at first glance, but given the number of *cells* each column has in such a page, versus the number of cells a row has, they don't amount to the same thing: one more text column makes the table look much more cluttered up. As for people inserting countries in different regions and so forth, I think that the fact we're going by a specific clear definition (the definitions offered by the UN) will avert that, or atleast will help us all keep a specific criterion for inclusion, so that we'll know which edits to revert without much arguments.</dd>

<dd>As for the other continents, I was just about ready to change those ones as well, and was editing Africa in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editpad.html" title="Editpad">Editpad</a>, when I saw your message.

<dd>I don't disagree. I'm unsure the row/column argument holds fully either way: four rows have been added in substitute of one column of cells. (I admit, though, it looks cleaner than the prior version.) I also alphabetised the territories for each continent to obviate any real or perceived preference in organisation.</dd>

I also created the tables for each continent. My concern is that the tables have undergone minor POV editing already (esp. Europe), and I'm reluctant to introduce any other changes that may promote more of that.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Since you've been doing a great job with all of those articles on AEC RECs, I thought you might be interested in the fact that we're currently still missing one on Wikipedia, namely the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_of_Sahel-Saharan_States_895a.html" title="Community of Sahel-Saharan States">Community of Sahel-Saharan States</a> or <a href="../../../c/e/n/CEN-SAD_78da.html" title="CEN-SAD">CEN-SAD</a> (cf. <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.za/au.nepad/recs.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dfa.gov.za/au.nepad/recs.htm" rel="nofollow">this link</a>). It's got 23 member states, and is one of the eight RECs likely to live through the upcoming rationalisation (according to <a href="http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=qw1146664621382B216" class="external text" title="http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=qw1146664621382B216" rel="nofollow">this IOL report</a>; <a href="http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/southern_africa/0,2172,126736,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/southern_africa/0,2172,126736,00.html" rel="nofollow">this SADCnews report</a> seems to indicate the same).</p>
<p>Additionally, do we want to include a note about this specific rationalisation plan at <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Economic_Community_5ed5.html" title="African Economic Community">African Economic Community</a>, or do we wait until <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">2 July</a> (AU heads of states summit), when the plan should (hopefully) be presented to the public and the next steps should be laid out?</p>

<p>I believe you're the author of the image linked above.

The two colors currently used look almost the same making it very hard to figure out which is which. <i>disclaimer:</i> I'm partially colorblind, so normal people might have no problem with the current one.

<p>Recently I changed two images, but I had to change their names too to be capable to upload them, because they are in the Wikimedia commons.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is one image that I created for the initial version of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental_nation.html" title="Transcontinental nation">Transcontinental nation</a> in regards to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The Commons were quick to take the image, but soon it became apparent that it should be changed, because of errors in the initial version. I somehow changed (maybe by just uploading the new image to Wikipedia) it, but recently it seems that all duplicate wikipedia-wikimedia images were "redirected" to wikimedia (or something like this?) so the very old revision of the image appears again. So, could you change the wikimedia image (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Europe_political_map.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Europe_political_map.png" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) with this one: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Map_of_Europe_%28political%29.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Map_of_Europe_%28political%29.png" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>?</li>
<li>Also, I made an update to your map of CSTO/GUAM regarding Uzbekistan. The wikimedia image (Uzbekistan not member) is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CSTO_GUAM_in_CIS_Map.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CSTO_GUAM_in_CIS_Map.png" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and the image with Uzbekistan membership in CSTO -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CSTO_GUAM_in_CIS_Map%28Uzb%29.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CSTO_GUAM_in_CIS_Map%28Uzb%29.png" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</li>
