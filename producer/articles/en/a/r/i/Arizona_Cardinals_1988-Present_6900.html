<p>In 1988, the Cardinals moved to <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, and the <b>Phoenix Cardinals</b> started playing home games in <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Devil_Stadium_d89a.html" title="Sun Devil Stadium">Sun Devil Stadium</a> on the campus of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_State_University_ee40.html" title="Arizona State University">Arizona State University</a>.</p>
<p>In March of 1994, in a move designed to better market the franchise to a statewide fan base, team owner Bill Bidwill announced his intention to change the name of the team to the <b>Arizona Cardinals</b>.<sup id="_ref-azcardinals_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-azcardinals" title="">[1]</a></sup> The rest of the NFL owners quickly approved the name change.</p>
<p>However, the Cardinals spent most of their first decade in Arizona as a cellar-dweller. Things began to look up during the 1998 season as <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Plummer_bb46.html" title="Jake Plummer">Jake Plummer</a> enjoyed his greatest stretch of success during his tenure with the franchise, in terms of victories at least, as his quarterback rating was still an average 75.0. The team during that time had once again been dubbed the <b>Cardiac Cards</b> by the local and national media<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> as eight of their 16 regular-season games were decided by three points or less, and seven of those games ended in favor of the Cardinals. Solidifying their status as the team to beat in the clutch, as the Cardinals, with a 6-7 record going into the 15th week, won 3 straight games to clinch a playoff spot, including one that very week which had to be decided in overtime, and the total margin of those 3 victories was a mere 8 points.</p>
<p>This and the fact that none of their victories had been to teams with winning records made them heavy underdogs going into their <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_card_%28sports%29.html" title="Wild card (sports)">Wild Card</a> Playoff game against the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>. Considering their two regular season losses to the Cowboys and the fact that they had been on the losing end of 16 of the last 17 games against their division rivals, including 9 straight losses at <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Stadium_ab68.html" title="Texas Stadium">Texas Stadium</a>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> the "Team of the Nineties" seemed to have history, among other forces, on their side. To further the situation, the Cardinals franchise had not won a single playoff game since their title year of 1947, resulting in the longest active drought in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_sports.html" title="Professional sports">professional sports</a> history.</p>
<p>The Cardinals won the game 20-7; however the final score made the game appear closer than it actually was, as Arizona dominated the Cowboys on both ends of the football throughout the game. At Texas Stadium that afternoon, the Cardinals jumped out to a 10-0 halftime lead. The Cardinals would later increase that lead to 20-0 in the final minutes of the 4th quarter. The Cowboys only score was a touchdown late in the 4th quarter, and the Cardinals held on for the upset. The Cardinals, who had suffered for 51 years as the NFL's doormat, finally had a playoff win. However, the distinction was short lived as the Cardinals fell in the divisional round of the playoffs to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> who possessed a 15-1 record as well as the highest scoring offense in NFL history. The Vikings won the game 41-21 in the <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome_d019.html" title="Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome">Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a> in downtown <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis.html" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Cardinals have not won more than seven games in a season since their 1998 playoff appearance. Coming off of their playoff run in 1998, the Cardinals were expected to do bigger and better things in 1999, but a tough schedule ranked in the top 5 as well as key injuries resulted in what would be another dissapointing season, getting off to a 2-6 start. However, the Cards would make another run winning 4 straight to get back into the playoff chase, but it was not meant to be as Arizona lost their last 4 to finish with a disappointing 6-10 record. The team finished with 5-11 records in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>In 2000, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maricopa_County_ce28.html" title="Maricopa County">Maricopa County</a> voters passed a ballot initiative by a margin of 51% to 49%, providing funding for a new Cardinals stadium (as well as for improvements to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_training.html" title="Spring training">spring training</a> facilities in the greater Phoenix region; and youth recreation). After some legal obstacles, the Cardinals began construction of their new facility in April 2003, in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_Arizona_a261.html" title="Glendale, Arizona">Glendale</a>, one of the western suburbs of Phoenix. <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Phoenix_Stadium_63bc.html" title="University of Phoenix Stadium">University of Phoenix Stadium</a> features a <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retractable_roof.html" title="Retractable roof">retractable roof</a> and a slide-out grass surface, which is good for the hot desert weather; the new stadium has a state-of-the-art air conditioning system and high-back seats.</p>
