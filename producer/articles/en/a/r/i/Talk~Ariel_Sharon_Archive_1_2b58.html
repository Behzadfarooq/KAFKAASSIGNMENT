<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Belgium Law</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>(Belgium courts have the power, under both Belgian and international law, to try war crimes committed anywhere in the world.) Ariel Sharon cancelled an official visit to Belgium in early 2001, which many said was because he feared being arrested, although the official reason given was the bombing of a disco in Israel.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ariel Sharon, as an acting representative of a foreign government, is protected by international law. Therefore he could not be arrested in Belgium, or any other country that upholds the Vienna Convention of 1815. His visit was canceled as a sign of diplomatic protest, which is certainly in place. Also, Belgium is no "courthouse for the world", since most legal conventions disallow persecution by a country over crimes that happened in a foreign nation (and that did not involve any citizens of that country). Also, is not having a disco bombed with 21 murdered children a bad cause? I delete this. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></p>

<dd><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> has been prosecuting offenses against Spanish nationals committed in a second country and this has been recognized me than once by a third country (the one that extradites). It is becoming much more accepted. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Court_154c.html" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a> is obviously another move in that direction. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_jurisdiction.html" title="Universal jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> rule is also claimed by many states, including Israel itself when it kidnapped Eichmann.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Vienna Convention of 1815 is superceded by the Nuremberg Protocols which hold that being a head of state or head of government does not give one immunity from being charged and convicted with war crimes. 130.15.183.129 00:24, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>"Ariel Sharon, as an acting representative of a foreign government, is protected by international law." That is a question of some dispute -- Belgium argues that while government representatives can't be arrested for ordinary crimes, they can be arrested for war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, etc. The Vienna Convention of 1815? Don't you mean the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which dates from some time in the 60s I think. War crimes are crimes of universal jurisdiction under international law, thus any state in the world has the right to try war crimes cases, not just cases involving its own citizens or territory. (Also, legal jurisdiction is determined by customary international law, not by conventional international law.) Most states don't take advantage of this right they have, but Belgium does. Israel also does, that is how they tried Eichmann (the Holocaust did not occur on Israeli territory, and none of its victims here Israeli citizens at the time it occured, since Israel did not then exist.) And the last sentence is completely true: he cancelled the visit, many people said it was because he feared being arrested, but the official Israeli government reason was the bombing of a disco. Everything in that sentence is true, and I don't see what your problem is with it. -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Well, Belgium can claim whatever it wants, but it is <i>Belgian</i> law, not international. Also, again, while I am not thoroughly familiar with the current legalities, all the cases of war crimes that I know of were ever put on trial, were put on trial in an <i>international</i> court, not a Belgian court. The only contrary case happened in Belgium several years ago, but again, that's Belgium and its view on the problem.</p>
<p>As to the Eichmann trial, please note the following difference: Sharon's action took place Israel, which is a souverign country recognized by Belgium, and which exists now. Eichmann was an official of Nazi Germany, which was dissolved, and therefore unable to try him (he could be tried in Western Germany, but it was only the <i>heir</i> of Nazi Germany). Sharon could, theoretically, be taken to an Israeli court. I'm sure that much more significant differences exist, but unfortunately I'm not yet familiar enough with the international law to put up a better answer. I meant the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, which was based on practice that originated in the Vienna Congress of 1815 (I apologize for my ignorance).</p>
<p>In addition to the above: although I hate to go <i>ad hominem</i>, I must say that you eagerness to mention Sabra and Shatila without doing any further research on the problem (like reading Kahan's report, which is freely available on the Internet) is regrettable and indicates that your bias is stronger than your desire to be objective. It is you and your decisions; however wouldn't you feel better if you didn't omit details another side in this conflict might consider important? --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I don't think international law protects anybody. Each state, being sovereign, does whatever it wants. It is customary to <i>grant</i> diplomatic immunity to individuals or classes of individuals.</p>
<p>The question Uriyan and SJK are discussing, needs clarification as to how Belgium would regard Sharon during a visit:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would grant him diplomatic immunity.</li>
<li>It would refuse to grant him diplomatic immunity and seek to arrest him.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Its more than Belgian law, its what Belgian claims the international law on the matter is (whether or not Belgian is right ultimately depends on future state practice, court decisions, etc.).</p>
<p>As to jurisdiction: there are about five different basises for jurisdiction recognized under international law: territorial jurisdiction (crimes committed on territory of the state), nationality jurisdiction (crime committed by a national of the state), jurisdiction based on the vital interests of the state (forget what this one is called), jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victim (once widely rejected, but increasingly accepted for terrorist offences), and universal jurisdiction (any state in the world can try the crime, no matter where it was committed and by who). Universal jurisdiction however only applies to certain offenses (e.g. piracy, genocide), so the question would be whether or not universal jurisdiction applies to whatever they would might indict Sharon for. And the primary jurisdiction under international criminal law rests with national courts, not international courts; international courts can only exercise criminal jurisdiction over individuals when a state has delegated its own jurisdiction to that court, and an international court can have no more criminal jurisdiction than the states that made the delegation did.</p>
<p>This is all well established customary international law, and is accepted by just about everybody. Just because the law on this matter may only be rarely applied doesn't mean it does not exist. (If you want a nice summary of all this, get a textbook on international law.)</p>
<p>Secondly, the distinction you make between the Eichmann case and what Belgium claims the right to do is irrelevant. The exercise of universal jursidiction under international law is not dependent on whether or not it is possible for the territorial state or the state of nationality to try it. Of course, if the territorial or nationality state (i.e. either Lebanon or Israel) is willing and able to try Sharon, then it has the right to do so instead of Belgium. But if either is unwilling or unable to do so for whatever reason, then (presuming universal jurisdiction applies to what Belgium indicts Sharon for), Belgium has the right to try him. The only possible difference is the question of whether or not what they seek to charge Sharon with is subject to universal jurisdiction. (Genocide, with which Israel charged Eichmann,</p>
<p>I was not aware that Kahan's report was available on the Internet (I knew there was an Israeli government inquiry, but I didn't know Kahan chaired it). Most of the information was what I remembered from news reports. I hope I was not overly biased. I will openly admit I really don't like Sharon, but I'm trying to be as neutral and unbiased as I can. (Look, I even went to the trouble of including a summary of his political career from gleaned the Israeli government; if all I wanted to do was attack him, why should have I bothered?) -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I thank you for this basic introduction, I will definitely look up international law references. Your original version was quite biased (to my Israeli taste). I tried to NPOV-ise it a bit (include both our opinions on fatality count, terrorism etc). You also did a similar thing to <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Begin_0c8c.html" title="Menachem Begin">Menachem Begin</a> (writing he was a terrorist without ever mentioning the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> - certainly, you'd mention it the latter if you wrote about Arafat!). However, I understand that total lack of bias is a hard goal (and it's diffcult for me to approach it two - and I'm sorry if I was in a flaming mood for a while). --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Okay, I admit I was trying to stir people a little bit with the article on Begin, by calling him a terrorist. If I was biased with my original account of Sabra and Shetila, thats probably because a lot of the sources I use for news are probably biased from your point of view. And why didn't I mention the Nobel prize? because I'd forgotten it, thats why. -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Ed: "Each state, being sovereign, does whatever it wants" is not correct. State soverignity is subject to international law, most importantly the principle of pacta sunt servanda (i.e. states must abide by treaties they freely enter into) to, and the jus cogens/erga omnes rules of customary international law (i.e. rules like the prohibition of genocide, which no state is permitted to violate.) Since most states have signed lots of treaties, and they are bound by customary international law anyway, their soverignity is limited in quite a few ways. Also, be careful about your use of the word "custom" -- you seem to be using it to imply that its not legally required that they grant diplomatic immunity, its merely a custom -- but customs are legally binding under international law, provided they meet certain conditions (states in following the custom must feel a sense of legal obligation; newly established customs may not apply to persistent objectors to them). -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>
<p>Simon,</p>
<ol>
<li>the article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a> says, "International legal norms can be customary or conventional."</li>
<li>I don't really care if he's a war criminal or not. Just say what he did (and who says he did it). Then say why that's a crime (and who says it's a crime). <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the article on international law says that (I think I may even be the person who wrote that sentence). I'm just trying to make sure you understand what customary international law is, because the way you said it made me suspect you didn't. -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Article said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some claim that this suit is illegal, because trial of non-citizens for crimes supposedly comitted to non-citizens is not widely accepted in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a>. However others disagree, and claim that states have the right under international law to try war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, even when the crime did not involve their nationals and did not occur on their territory, since these crimes are recognized as being subject to universal jurisdiction. (Israel made use of the same right as Belgium when it tried and convicted Adolf Eichmann for his involvement in the Holocaust, even though neither he nor any of his victims were Israeli nationals at the time, and the crime was not committed on Israeli territory.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some may claim that, but no international lawyer would claim that. They might claim it was illegal, but if they did it would be because what Sharon did was not an offense subject to universal jurisdiction, or because of head of government immunity during office, or something like that. Universal jurisdiction for at least some offences is accepted by everybody. I've got no problem with admitting this is a subject of legal dispute, I'm just asking that the dispute be framed correctly. -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>SJK, do you think you could include some of what you have written on this page in the page on <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a>? I'd do it myself if i weren't certain to bungle it&#160;:-) --Anders Törlind</p>

<dd>To Joseph (who has obviously written this). Wikipedia is not for saying 'evil, evil man'. We don't even say it here about <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a>. His nicknames among his haters are also irrelevant. You also don't make statements without any grounds or evidence. If you want this material to ever get to <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a>, you'd better rewrite it starting with "Palestinians think that" ... Append the heading about "Opposing Views" to the end of the article. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Joseph, I appreciate the moderation that you've done, but this is still not NPOV! As the Wikipedia editor, you don't have a narrator. Unless you talk about very, very obvious facts, the statements that you make must be explicitly associated with the side that makes them. I'll post below the way I think the statements should be made:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ariel Sharon has followed a military solutions based policy of no negotiations under fire. He refuses to engage in political negotiations until there is a seven day period of absolute peace and quiet in all of Israel and the occupied territories. Many people and some governments (mainly the European Union members) feel that this is an unrealistic demand, that could never be fulfilled.</dd>
</dl>
<p>URI: with all due respect, please, lets try and not mince words here, it is Ariel Sharon's policy. He is the one that will not negotiate under fire, he said so... Furthermore, he has forbidden specific members of the Government from pursuing dialogue with Palestinians (personally a method I feel will result in lowering the violence). He is the Prime Minister now, whether we (Palestinians) like it or not. Feel free to reword this how you see fit as long as the main point remains it is this that:</p>
<hr />
<p>1) Mr Sharon's policy is one of extreme military responses to any attack, by any Palestinian group. That essentialy means that any extreme person can derail any peace talk. Imagine if that was how it was with extreme Jewsih settler groups doing the same, and the Palestinians refusing to negotiate. At least try to see my point here.</p>
<p>2) The European Union wants to change this policy, and it asks that Mr Sharon and his government stop this policy, as it is unrealistic.</p>
<hr />
<p>(<i>Sharon is not Israeli government - Sharon himself is a private individual while the government is an official body. Also note that both the government and the majority of the Israeli public support these policies, as recent polls indicate</i>)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Palestinians claim that all of the current policies followed by the Sharon government so far have failed to bring about this prerequisite for peace. They claim that the policies carried out by his government - assassinations of leaders of Palestinian groups (some of whom being terrorists is disputed), blockades of whole areas (including towns and villages), the destruction of Palestinian Authority infrastructure as well as civillian infrastructure (including police and security buildings), continued house demolitions, Israeli Army incursions into Palestinian territory, the confinement of the nominal head of the Palestinian people in his headquarters that essentially amounts to a house arrest - have only created further difficuly in calming the situation down .</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Uri, again, I feel that this point above is important, as these policies, started by Barak, continued to an even greater extent by Mr Sharon and his government, only lead to more violence and destruction. I hate it when there is a Palestinian attack on civillians or innocents, I feel that if these extremist groups want to go at it with the Israeli Army, then go one for one against the military only. It pains me, and I am truly sorry for the agony, grief, and loss of life of innocent civillians. Truly, the situation is such that more and more ordinary Palestinians are getting drawn into an ever more destructive spiral of violence.</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>Palestinians consider Sharon's advocacy of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_settlements.html" title="Israeli settlements">settlement</a> building in the occupied territories as a further step away from peace.</dd>
</dl>
<p>No change here, settlements like it or not are the main reasons for this problem, every expansion and building of new settlements create more 'Facts on the ground' to quote an already overused term.</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>The latest round of violence the, so-called 'second Intifada' started in the Fall of 2000. Palestinians claim that it was started because of Ariel Sharon, and over a thousand bodyguards marching in sacred Arab East Jerusalem. (A number of protesting Palestinians were killed in the immediate aftermath of this visit. <i>never heard of that</i>) Some commentators have accused him of purposely starting this event, to prevent the further continuation of peace talks.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(<i>Actually, one of Arafat's advisors claim otherwise, see <a href="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/myths/mf19a.html#a" class="external text" title="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/myths/mf19a.html#a" rel="nofollow">here</a></i>)</p>

<dd>The absence of a peace camp in Israel has played into Sharon's favour but lately the Israeli public is wondering why they elected a closed-minded general with no political vision as their prime minister?

<dd>It has been a year since this man came to power, and most people can see where he has brought the Middle East conflict, and to some extent, the entire world, close than ever to a regional war.

<dd>It seems to most Palestinians, peace groups (specifically <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_Now_419d.html" title="Peace Now">Peace Now</a>), and foreign peoples and governments, that Mr Sharon has no intention of peaceful relations with the Palestinians.</dd>

<p>Uri, I am not sure what you want to change here, however, my sources indicate this feeling.</p>
<p>Here is the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,201552,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,201552,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,201552,00.html</a></p>
<p>Here is the quote: "Sharon's impressive diplomatic achievements haven't erased the basic fact haunting Israelis: His first year in office has failed to produce the security promised in his election campaign. A poll published by the newspaper Maariv a week ago showed that Sharon's domestic approval rating had fallen below 50 percent for the first time since his landslide victory. Clearly, Israel's grinding economic recession and the absence of any signs of progress towards resolving its conflict with the Palestinians are taking its toll on domestic politics."</p>
<p>Uri, I am willing to have you change my comments to an NPOV, I am not sure how to do it, however, please do not change my meaning or content. I have provided comments above, I hope that this clarifies my points... I only want to point out that the awy Mr Sharon wants Peace to be, it will never happen. He may have Mr Bush on side, he may even win over the Israelis in an another election, however, Peace has to be made with us the Palestinians, not Mr Bush, or the Israelis themselves...</p>
<p>Hoping I have not offended, or made unreasonable requests.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I edited your comments on the main page a bit, most of the changes being confined to adding "Palestinians think that...". The comments that I made in <i>italics</i> are not editorial, but my personal comments as an Israeli. Anyway, if you don't like something (if you think that I left out something important etc.) - feel free to restore it (either from this page or from history).</p>
<p>I deleted the line about four Palestinians being killed, because it happened after Sharon's visit, and during very heavy riots that these Palestinians were taking part in. So if we wanted to present the full picture we'd then have to discuss whether the violence that the protesters applied was extreme (e.g. they burnt a police station about the same time) and branch into a whole new discussion which is not directly related to Ariel Sharon.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd been thinking to write an opposing Israeli opinion about this (and perhaps even add one to <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>). Of course, you (or any other Wikipedian) would be able to edit my comments in a similar way. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>Sorry I guess we were editing at the same time, here were my roiginal comments:</p>
<p>No problem Uri,</p>
<p>After your edits I added a title because Commentary did not seem to cover what I was after, mainly to make it relevant to current events. This is the title I chose:</p>
<p><a name="Commentary_on_recent_events_and_the_evolution_of_the_peace_process" id="Commentary_on_recent_events_and_the_evolution_of_the_peace_process"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Commentary on recent events and the evolution of the peace process</span></h3>
<p>a bit long perhaps, feel free to edit, however the main point should be recent events and the Peace process (what is left of it, the fault of Yasser and his cronies as well as Sharons).</p>
<p>I looked it over, seems better, more balanced, I hope you do as well. I also added some new info. about the newest news that over one thousand have now joined in this protest. I am sure you have heard the news, that they incresed their support for this protest, and pullout of the territories... If not I will provide a link to my news story. I thought the important point was that this will force the Palestinian leadership to re-establish law and order, something that is sorely lacking, or something that they are not able to do.</p>
<p>I hope that the edits are ok.</p>

<dd>In recent days this protest has increased in number to over 1000 top-level reserve generals, colonels and officials from the internal and external security agencies, Shin Bet and Mossad. They feel that by withdrawing from the disputed territories it will force the Palestinian leadership to resume its security responsibilities towards the Israeli population</dd>
</dl>
<p>I wonder where you've heard <i>that</i>, since I didn't. Of course several officials claimed that leaving the territories would be optimal, but none that I know of called to do it <i>now</i>, and none called to do it on a personal basis - they were rather calling for a general political solution like Shimon Peres (or unilateral separation). Anyway, they do not belong to the same category as the 50 reservists, since they didn't call for military disobedience, but rather point at a political course that they like more. And also, their number is not bigger than 10 (although they include one retired Head of Shin Bet).</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_1827000/1827328.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_1827000/1827328.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_1827000/1827328.stm</a></p>
<p>Also I made a small mistake, this is following on the heels of the protests, Saturday night. It is now 250 reservists that have signed the petition.</p>
<p>Sorry I will correct it.</p>
<p>Joseph</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, I looked at the BBC article. It isn't really precise, to say the least. The whole Israeli army has less than 1000 senior officers. I don't think there is any more than 20 of them at the Council, the rest being "regular" officers and soldiers. From what has been reported on the local media, they're talking mostly about a <i>unilateral</i> withdrawal, since they don't give too much weight to PA's commitments. They emphasize the enhancement of Israeli security caused by the introduction of a border fence.</p>
<p>I updated the article to reflect these points. Feel free to change it, if you feel I'd left something important out. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></p>
<p>"The absence of a peace camp in Israel" plays in Sharon's favor. Get real! 400,000 Israelis demonstrated on behalf of a Commission of Inquiry following Sabra and Shatilla. In a country that then had 5 million people, that is close to ten percent of the population that attended the demonstration. Peace Now has been a major player in Israeli politics, while today, Sharon is contending with a large group of army reservists who refuse to serve in the West Bank or Gaza. True, the events of the past year have whittled away at the peace camp, but there is a vibrant peace camp nonetheless, perhaps one of the most vibrant in the entire Middle East. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>
<p>Once again I removed the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The absence of a peace camp in Israel has played into Sharon's favour but lately the Israeli public is wondering why they elected a closed-minded general with no political vision as their prime minister?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>See my note above as to why. Actually, it contradicts the article itself, which says that 1,000 reserve officers refuse to serve in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Secondly, I removed:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Secondly, Ariel Sharon claims, and many Israelis agree, that <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> is an absolute evil.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course they do. What is the point of that statement.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't really think that the two sections: "The Israeli Point of View" and "The Palestinian Point of View" have a place in this article. Unless someone can justify them, I will remove them to talk.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi, I removed (and modified) several statements on the Israeli and Arab positions. Regarding the former, they were simply not true (no Israeli Jews consider suicide bombings justified). As to the latter, many of them did not bother to remind that this is the Arab <i>opinion</i> (and not concrete fact), while others were simply repeating the points already mentioned (in particular the fact that Arabs dislike Sharon), or not saying anything at all (the opinion of individual, anonymous Israeli analysts is quite meaningless) --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></p>
<p>"the opinion of individual, anonymous Israeli analysts is quite meaningless", unless what they say is true, accurate or offers a particular insight. Being individual and anonymous has no effect on the value of their opinions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's see. An analyst provides, by definition, opinions. In Wikipedia, opinions are not seen as either true or accurate; they're merely represented. Now to the "insight" part. The analyst used a Hebrew idiom meaning Sharon paid too much attention for detail. This is an extremely general statement (without mentioning of the context, it's difficult to tell what the quote is about). So it isn't particularly insightful either. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uriyan</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Nevertheless, as minister of housing in the 90s, Sharon increased the speed of settlment considerably and he is also against dismantling any settlements at all out of principle. This is widely seen by his opponents as hampering peace efforts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>While it is true that there was a certain increase in settlement building in Sharon's period, I'm not sure whether that was Sharon's call or a decision made by the government as whole, in which Sharon's voice wasn't decisive. Also, Sharon has seldom declared any special sympathy to settlement-building, and he was the person to evacuate Sinai. Both seem to go against my notion of being a principal man. I think that the quote above needs to be researched more fully before it can be reincorporatd into the article. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>Reasons for NPOV: The Israeli position is much larger and detailed than the Palestinian position. Furthermore, whilst the Palestinian position includes lots of criticisms and counter-arguments, along the lines of Israelis-would-say-this, the Israeli argument includes no such thing, and reads just as a propaganda diatribe. This is not acceptable in a neutral encyclopedia, which should give equal weight to each argument. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonesy_e304.html" title="User:Jonesy">Jonesy</a> 19:55, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is silly. Sharon is an Israeli, not a Palestenian. His opinions and those of his nations should indeed be contrasted by those of other nations (such as Palestenians) and the world, but it's only natural if Sharon's own opinions, those of his government (he's currently the prime minister of Israel) and the opinions that actually got him voted into office and his actions in his military carreer (yes, he had a military carreer, not a carreer of peace-talks), get a prominent position. When stating the beliefs of a political figure, or the platform of a political party, we can't contrast every one of its points with 3 other thought schools - it's only important that the beliefs or platform as a whole be contrasted by those held by other groups. Can you give example sections where you see the problem you describe? Are these sections impossible to fix?</dd>

<dd>The NPOV discussion appears dead, with only one person claiming that this article should be marked NPOV. I don't see any "dispute" here... Shall we remove the NPOV link?</dd>

<p>I am removing the claim "<i>an official Israeli judiciary enquiry found him partly responsible and banned him from ever again acting as Defence Minister.</i>" The Kahan Commission did not have the authority to ban him for life, nor did they try to. They didn't even have the authority to sack him from his present position, but only to make recommendations about it. The recommendation they made was that Sharon should "<i>draw the appropriate personal conclusions</i>; i.e., resign, and if necessary, the Prime Minister should <i>consider whether he should exercise his authority</i> ... to <i>remove a minister from office</i>. He refused to resign as Defense Minister but Begin forced him to, while allowing him to stay in the cabinet. After the next election he was appointed Minister of Industry and Trade. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 10:02, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jayjg's tactic for diluting criticism of Ariel Sharon was to insert a long list of silly names that were subsequently deleted by another editor, deleting all critics' perceptions of Sharon. That's not how the NPOV process is supposed to work. Ariel Sharon is considered a terrorist by many Palestinians and Israelis and others around the world because of his numerous massacres of civilians over the years. He was elected by the facts Israelis so that he would employ an iron-fist against the Intifada that he himself was central in inciting. He was a member of a terrorist organization prior to the formation of Israel. He was Minister of Defense during the invasion of Lebanon and Sabra and Shatila massacres, he was commanding units in Sinai that executed Egyptian POWs, he has authorized the assassinations of numerous Palestinian leaders and militants while blithely slaughtering hundreds of innocent Palestinian men, women and children since becoming PM. That he is known as a mass murdering terrorist thug is an important and widespread POV that should be included in his bio despite the bad faith edits and duplicitous efforts at censorship engaged in by his extremist fans.--<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 19:56, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To avoid the perception of double standards, you would have to dig out all the non-notable accusations levelled against the other butcher type nationalists, such as "a punk", "a traitor", "dangerous", "a screaming disaster for [Iraq/Germany]", "a bum", "a fool", "a lout", "a sissy", "a tired old man", and "a spoiled parvenu". - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 22:13, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To begin with, it was Alberuni who put in the non-notable description of Sharon as a "terrorist", yesterday. Indeed that was what our dispute was about. I then put in many other "non-notable" descriptions of Sharon. It was only a few hours ago that Alberuni came up with the "Butcher of" designation, which you have decided is "notable". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 00:47, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if you're going to put the name-calling nonsense in anyway, then at least attribute it correctly: <i>the man Arabs call "the butcher of Beirut"</i> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1157838.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1157838.stm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <i>Mr Sharon is prime minister, and is routinely called in the Arab world "the butcher of Beirut"</i> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/05/21/wmid121.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/05/21/wmid121.xml" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Also, Bush is called a terrorist at least as often as Sharon, if not moreso; when I see the Bush article mentioning this in its intro, I'll take it as a sign that it is a Wikipedia standard to wildly throw around pejorative labels in biographies. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 23:22, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with any of your butchers list, although the "butcher" accusation has less merit for some than for others. (The number one butcher among all of these is probably King Léopold II - we Europeans will be record-holders for some time I think when it comes to butchering other peoples.) You are wrong if you think that this is an issue of name-calling, at least for me it isn't.</dd>
<dd>I think there are several criteria for deciding whether this kind of accusation is encyclopaedic or not&#160;: (1) how widespread the particular view is&#160;; (2) the merits of the accusation -(a) if there is any factual basis to the accusation&#160;; (b) how direct the link is between the atrocities and the person in question, (c) how much responsibility the person in question has. If a person scores high for all these criteria, then the accusation should be included and attributed.</dd>
<dd>So, concerning this article, Sharon clearly scores high on all these criteria. He is perceived as a terrorist in much of the Muslim/Arab world and in left-wing circles in the Western world. He is directly linked to the <a href="../../../q/i/b/Qibya_massacre.html" title="Qibya massacre">Qibya massacre</a> and the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre_6d7e.html" title="Sabra and Shatila massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a>, even personally involved in the former, and he carried the majority of responsibility for both&#160;; these massacres are well-documented i.e. there can be little doubt as to the factual basis. In these events, violence was used against civilians to achieve political goals, so the "terrorist" label is in fact a neutral description, however since it is disputed, we can only describe it as view.</dd>
<dd>As for Bush, the "terrorist" label sticks but is more questionable. "Shock and awe" tactics practially carry the word "terrorist" in their name&#160;; and the attack on Fallujah this spring (as well as the one which is about to be launched) targetted civilians (again, this is well-documented), and senior US military commanders are on record as describing the event as a revenge attack for the lynching of four US contractors. However, Bush is quite removed from these events, and Bush being a terrorist is not a view that is held by very many people.</dd>
<dd>I am quite uncomfortable with the phrasing <i>However, some <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a> have called him "the butcher of Beirut"</i> because this implies a racial analysis of the conflict (especially when it is meant as a contrast to <i>Many Israelis, a significant number of Jews worldwide</i>). It is true that there is considerable anti-Semitism in the Arab world as well as considerable anti-Arab racism in Israel, and therefore both sides of the conflict tend to frame it in racist terms. However, a racist/racialist analysis of human conflict has been widely discredited since WW2, and I believe it adds nothing to our understanding. All racist analyses should be excluded from the Wikipedia narrative. I suggest we use a formulation containing "the Arab press" or something like that, as "Arab" becomes then an adjective relating to the culture in question. Also, it is not just a view held in the Arab world, it is quite common in left-wing Western circles. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 00:55, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think Juan Cole is Arab either. I think Ariel Sharon is widely known among critics inside and outside of Israel as the Butcher of Beirut (and for good reason). --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 01:08, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh and by the way, pir, since you've returned from your Wikibreak and re-inserted the "Butcher of" description into the introduction, I trust you will edit the articles listed above that also require "notable" "Butcher of" designations, to avoid the perception of double standards. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 00:47, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Jayjg, you are the editor who noted that those articles could benefit from more description and I, for once, agree with you. The onus is on all of us to improve those articles. If these are commonly used appellations, more description is better than less. You did a creditable job of looking up all the references. As long as the source is mentioned and the description is accurate, I agree with you that a title like that is a relevant description and should be included. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 01:08, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still don't agree with the "terrorist" name-calling in the opening section. Again, Googling "Bush is a terrorist" and "terrorist Bush" yields over 3,500 hits. Googling "Sharon is a terrorist" and "terrorist Sharon" yields around 1,100 hits. +Bush +terrorist yields 2.1 million hits whereas +Sharon +terrorist yields 350K hits. Now, I know this second set of searches is not particularly good; yet if you look at the links provided, at least on the first few pages, they are highly relevant. While a name like "The Butcher of Beirut" is at least reasonably unique, "terrorist" is just a term thrown around to indicate a political leader you disagree with who has been involved in wars. As for "the left", I'm not aware of the left in Israel calling him "the Butcher of Beirut", which is an English phrase in any event; Israelis speak Hebrew. For it to be a "left" phrase, it must be commonly used by the left, and not just some writer on the left mentioning that Arabs refer to him that way in English. The links I brought made no mention of the left referring to him that way either. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 02:48, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's no measure of anything. Of course Bush gets millions more hits than Sharon. He is the president of 280 million people while Sharon lords over 7 million or so. Sharon and Bush both claim to be at war with terrorists so your second search is totally flawed. They both fail to indicate anything. What <b>might</b> be more representative would be the percentage of "Ariel Sharon" pages (705,000) that say "Ariel Sharon is a terrorist" (97) (or 0.014%) versus the ratio for George Bush (232/3,400,000) (or 0.007%). The admittedly crude result indicates that Sharon is twice as likely as Bush to be labelled a terrorist.--<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 05:21, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main point is that they are both frequently called a "terrorist" by their opponents; when I see this name-calling enshrined in the opening section describing George Bush, I'll consider it appropriate for Ariel Sharon's article as well. It might be interesting to see someone try to enter this description in the Bush article; I doubt it would last more than 2 minutes. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 19:05, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I admit my mistake. Sharon was a Haganah terrorist. Shamir was the Lehi terrorist and begin was the Irgun terrorist. It is easy to get all the Jewish terrorists confused. Who labelled the PLO a terrorist group? Your links? What <a href="http://www.monitor.net/monitor/0102a/em-palestinebloodbath.html" class="external text" title="http://www.monitor.net/monitor/0102a/em-palestinebloodbath.html" rel="nofollow">Eric Margolis</a> writes "<b>To Israel's left, however, Sharon is a dangerous extremist, even a war criminal, and widely known as 'the Butcher of Beirut.'</b> " THIRD TIME QUOTED HERE. You claimed that can't be true because Israelis don't speak English, they speak Hebrew. What a bad argument! Israelis do speak English, you should know that. And does that imply that Arabs use English to call the butcher the Butcher? I'm sure it translates into Hebrew as well. The regressive racialsit categories are saying, "Arabs believe this, Jews believe that" as if they are mutually exclusive. Pir made the argument well, but as usual, you don't listen if the source is not Hasbara Central.--<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 04:27, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your Hebrew is probably better than mine but I am surprised that you, of all people, would dismiss a Toronto Jew.

<p>So? Syrian Arabs kill 30.000 Arabs - who cares?</p>
<p>Lets take another: Syrian secret polices place a bomb in Beirut, killing Gemayel - democratically elected leader of liberated Libanon and scores of other Christians. Figthing naturally erupts and some Christians and terrorists (socalled "palestinians") supporting Syria's illegal occupation get killed when the terrorist retreate to there heavely protected military camps at shatila. Suddenly THAT'S big news!!!</p>
<p>I should add, that I don't like revenge, but I DO understand the Christians - afterall the so-called "palestinians" had a legacy of massacres of scores of thousands of innocent Lebanese civillians. They should have killed all those "palestinian" pigs!!!</p>
<p>And that's the only reason why I blame the statsman Ariel Sharon: he should't have intervened to protect the palestinians. He should just have let the Lebanese kill them all.</p>

<p>Daily Dvar and authour Amos Oz have given unlimited rights for the interview to be published as long as its attributed correctly</p>
<p>After a rant against liberal non Israli Jews Shorn has this to say...</p>
<p>"Leibowitz is right, we are Judeo-Nazis, and why not? Listen, a people that gave itself up to be slaughtered, a people that let soap to be made of its children and lamp shades from the skin of its women is a worse criminal than its murderers. Worse than the Nazis...If your nice civilised parents had come here in time instead of writing books about the love for humanity and singing Hear O Israel on the way to the gas chambers, now don't be shocked, if they instead had killed six million Arabs here or even one million, what would have happened? Sure, two or three nasty pages would have been written in the history books, we would have been called all sorts of names, but we could be here today as a people of 25 million!</p>
<p>"Even today I am willing to volunteer to do the dirty work for Israel, to kill as many Arabs as necessary, to deport them, to expel and burn them, to have everyone hate us, to pull the rug from underneath the feet of the Diaspora Jews, so that they will be forced to run to us crying. Even if it means blowing up one or two synagogues here and there, I don't care. And I don't mind if after the job is done you put me in front of a Nuremberg Trial and then jail me for life. Hang me if you want, as a war criminal. Then you can spruce up your Jewish conscience and enter the respectable club of civilised nations, nations that are large and healthy. What you lot don't understand is that the dirty work of Zionism is not finished yet, far from it. True, it could have been finished in 1948, but you interfered, you stopped it. And all this because of the Jewishness in your souls, because of your Diaspora mentality. For the Jews don't grasp things quickly. If you open your eyes and look around the world you will see that darkness is falling again. And we know what happens to a Jew who stays out in the dark. So I am glad that this small war in Lebanon frightened the Yids. Let them be afraid, let them suffer. They should hurry home before it gets really dark. So I am an anti-Semite&#160;? Fine. So don't quote me, quote Lilienblum instead [an early Russian Zionist - ed.]. There is no need to quote an anti-Semite. Quote Lilienblum, and he is definitely not an anti-Semite, there is even a street in Tel Aviv named after him. (C. quotes from a small notebook that was lying on his table when I arrived:) 'Is all that is happening not a clear sign that our forefathers and ourselves...wanted and still want to be disgraced? That we enjoy living like gypsies.' That's Lilienblum. Not me. Believe me. I went through the Zionist literature, I can prove what I say"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amos Oz never met nor interviewed Sharon. In fact, the so-called “interview” was a literary device taken from Oz's book “In the Land of Israel.” In the English version, the interviewee's identity is not revealed, and is referred to as Z (Flamingo/Fontana 1983). Apparently, Palestinian propagandists substituted Sharon's name for Z in the Davar interview. The description of Z does not fit Sharon, and at one point Z refers to Sharon, Begin and General Eitan. In a telephone conversation with journalist Holger Jensen, who had misattributed these quotes to Sharon, Amos Oz confirmed that he had never met nor interviewed Sharon.<a href="http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=7&amp;x_issue=372&amp;x_article=372" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=7&amp;x_issue=372&amp;x_article=372" rel="nofollow">[32]</a></p>

<p>OK, both versions need qualifying IMO. The first version (that is current at the time of writing) needs to state which Palestinians of note say that "Ariel Sharon has followed an aggressive policy of non-negotiation" and that "allege that the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">al-Aqsa Intifada</a> started because of a visit by Sharon and an escort of several hundred policemen to the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haram_al-Sharif_9bfc.html" title="Haram al-Sharif">Haram al-Sharif</a>/<a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Mount_9e35.html" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a> complex".</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> version needs to state who the observers are that are in agreement that the "second Palestinian uprising started because of the provocative visit by Sharon with an escort of several hundred policemen to the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haram_al-Sharif_9bfc.html" title="Haram al-Sharif">Haram al-Sharif</a>/<a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Mount_9e35.html" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a> complex"!

<p>The following sentence was changed from:</p>
<p>"After being dismissed from the Defense Minister post for <font color="red"><b>indirect responsibility</b></font> in the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre_6d7e.html" title="Sabra and Shatila massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a>"</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>"After being dismissed from the Defense Minister post for <font color="red"><b>his personal responsibility</b></font> in the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre_6d7e.html" title="Sabra and Shatila massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a>"</p>
<p>OK, the quotation that we have in the article is as follows:</p>
<p><i>for "indirect responsibility" in the massacre, stating that the "The <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahan_Commission_f109.html" title="Kahan Commission">Kahan Commission</a> investigating these massacres recommended in early 1983 the removal of Sharon from his post as Defense Minister of Defense [Sharon] bears personal responsibility".</i></p>
<p>This was changed to:</p>
<p><i>The Israeli <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahan_Commission_f109.html" title="Kahan Commission">Kahan Commission</a> investigating these massacres recommended in early 1983 the removal of Sharon from his post as Defense Minister, stating that Sharon bears "personal responsibility" for the masacres.</i></p>
<p>Which is more correct? If the second is more correct, then the sentence should be "After being dismissed from the Defense Minister post for <b>his personal responsibility</b> in the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre_6d7e.html" title="Sabra and Shatila massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a>", however if it not then the sentence should be "After being dismissed from the Defense Minister post for <b>indirect responsibility</b> in the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre_6d7e.html" title="Sabra and Shatila massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a>"</p>
<p>Perhaps the source of the original quotations would shed some light on this?</p>

<dd>I agree. It also says "As a politician responsible for Israel's security affairs, and as a Minister who took an active part in directing the political and military moves in the war in Lebanon, it was the duty of the Defense Minister to take into account all the reasonable considerations for and against having the Phalangists enter the camps, and not to disregard entirely the serious consideraton mitigating against such an action, namely that the Phalangists were liable to commit atrocities and that it was necessary to forestall this possibility as a humanitarian obligation and also to prevent the political damage it would entail. From the Defense Minister himself we know that this consideration did not concern him in the least, and that this matter, with all its ramifications, was neither discussed nor examined in the meetings and discussion held by the Defense Minister. In our view, the Minister of Defense made a grave mistake when he ignored the danger of acts of revenge and bloodshed by the Phalangists against the population in the refugee camps.". Should we add this, or should it go into the <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahan_Commission_f109.html" title="Kahan Commission">Kahan Commission</a> article?

<dd>Yeah, it does seem a little too detailed (and boring) for the main Sharon article—the kind of stuff folks can read the whole report to get. Might belong in the other article, though, since it focuses on the report. And that report should also cover what the report says about the whole country itself not being responsible and why and so on.<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer"></a>—<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">iFaqeer</a> <a href="../../../i/f/a/User_talk%7EIFaqeer_6379.html" title="User talk:IFaqeer">(Talk to me!)</a> 05:10, Dec 4, 2004 (UTC)

<p>The Kahan commission stated that Israel and Israelis in general had indirect responsibility. Regarding that indirect responsibility, Sharon himself bore personal responsibility. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 01:55, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is true. However the report, as I read it, never said that Sharon had was indirectly responsible. It only referred to the indirect responsibility of Israel(is). I could be wrong. I'm happy to correct any factual errors if this is incorrect, however I would ask that relevant sections of the report be quoted. I think that would only be fair. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:19, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the report is clear that the Israeli responsibility in general was indirect. It then went on to explain the specific nature of the indirect responsibility of various individuals, like Sharon. Thus Sharon was personally responsible for indirect responsibility for the massacre (quite a mouthful, I know). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 17:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"possibly to testify against Sharon"</span></h2>
<p>"possibly to testify against Sharon" - doesn't the phrase seem speculative and POV? I actually wrote it myself, as an attempt to compromise with HistoryBuffEr, but it still doesn't seem to belong. See this article: <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/460.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/460.cfm" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 02:01, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure of the dispute here. What was the point of contention? However, who has stated that he might have gone to testify against Sharon before he was killed by a car bomb? We need to source this statement, otherwise it is <i>our</i> POV, which we can't have because then it is opinion and thus original research. However, we should definitely include the information:
<dl>
<dd><i>Writing in The Daily Star (Jan. 25), columnist Michael Young opined that Sharon certainly had a stake in killing Hobeika, but there were doubts that Hobeika actually intended to testify in the first place. “Others had the same reason as the Israelis for fretting about Hobeika,” he surmised, adding that his testimony in Belgium might have exposed others for their misdeeds. “Hobeika’s indictment in Belgium would have reflected badly on those who collected him in 1986, after his ouster from East Beirut,” he added in apparent reference to Syria.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Sound fair? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:26, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I would have just removed the phrase altogether. It's a lot of speculation whatever way you look at it; maybe he was going to testify against Sharon, maybe against Syria, maybe some-one else. I'm not sure all this speculation is required, but your paragraph is fine if you want to include that kind of information. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 17:41, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't the article mention the Phalange were sent in to clear out PLO fighters? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 02:07, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it probably should. We should reference the report to make the article accurate, or mention that was the reason given in the report. However, was there any PLO fighters found or killed? If there weren't I think that should probably also be mentioned. IMO. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:29, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that is a point of contention, one side claiming that PLO fighters were killed, the other (naturally) claiming only civilians. Regardless, as it stands the article gives the impression that the express Israeli reason for sending in the Phalange was to murder civilians, which is hardly accurate or NPOV. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 17:44, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
