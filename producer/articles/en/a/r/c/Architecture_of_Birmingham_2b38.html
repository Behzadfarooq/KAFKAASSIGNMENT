<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_Birmingham_2b38.html" title="Edit section: Post War Architecture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post War Architecture</span></h2>
<p>Birmingham's industrial importance in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> led to some of the heaviest bombing raids during <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blitz_2aa3.html" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a>. This claimed many lives and many beautiful buildings too, but the destruction that took place in post war Birmingham was also extensive: dozens of fine Victorian buildings like the intricate glass-roofed <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_Station_d49a.html" title="Birmingham New Street Station">Birmingham New Street Station</a>, and the old Central Library, were destroyed in the 1950s and 1960s. These planning decisions were to have a profound effect on the image of Birmingham in subsequent decades, with the mix of concrete <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_road.html" title="Ring road">ring roads</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_mall.html" title="Shopping mall">shopping centres</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_block.html" title="Tower block">tower blocks</a> often referred to as a '<a href="../../../c/o/n/Concrete_jungle.html" title="Concrete jungle">concrete jungle</a>'.</p>
<p>Tall office blocks were constructed in city centre in the form of basic shapes such as cuboids. For example <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_McLaren_Building_9038.html" title="The McLaren Building">The McLaren Building</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre_City_Tower_330c.html" title="Centre City Tower">Centre City Tower</a> which were constructed towards the end of the 1960s/ early 1970s. 'Big Top' was completed in the late 1950s and became the city's tallest building and the first shopping centre in Birmingham.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Madin_1b99.html" title="John Madin">John Madin</a> was a major architect in the city from the 1960s to the 1970s with his most famous buildings being <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Central_Library_9cb4.html" title="Birmingham Central Library">Birmingham Central Library</a> in Chamberlain Square. Built in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, it quickly became detested by the public for its <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutalist.html" title="Brutalist">Brutalist</a> architecture and was once described as "<i>looking more like a place for burning books, than keeping them</i>" by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince Charles</a>. Despite this, there have been campaigns launched to get the building listed status in more recent times. Another building by John Madin, received other views from the public. The <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_and_Mail_building%2C_Birmingham_5af9.html" title="Post and Mail building, Birmingham">Post and Mail building</a> was completed in the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and upon its completion, the tower was hailed as a great achievement. A lesser known building in the city by John Madin, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_House_8d32.html" title="Metropolitan House">Metropolitan House</a>, shows the variety of architecture he brought to the city. Madin also designed the 200 ft-high <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rotunda_%28Birmingham%29_cf3d.html" title="The Rotunda (Birmingham)">Rotunda</a>, a circular tower block at the South end of New Street.</p>
<p>However, as Modernist architecture fell out of favour in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, proposals for the redevelopment of many of the buildings constructed in Birmingham during the 1960s and 1970s were aired including redevelopment proposals for the Post and Mail Tower (most including the total demolition of the tower). In 2005, demolition work began on the tower and a replacement office block is under construction on site. A building of similar architecture, the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce on the Hagley Road, still remains, however, is under threat from demolition as the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce look for a new building.</p>
<p>The largest high-rise estate in Britain was constructed at <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_Vale_0575.html" title="Castle Vale">Castle Vale</a> with over 30 tower blocks in one small area. This became an unpopular and there were many problems in the area. As a result, one of the largest tower block demolition and renovation programmes anywhere in Europe began on the estate, with the construction of new buildings, squares and green spaces.</p>
<p>Stephenson Tower is a city-centre tower block, located near New Street Station. When New Street Station is renovated, the tower is expected to be demolished. A group of four tower blocks located behind The Rep Theatre on Broad Street are currently undergoing an extensive renovation to improve their insulation and appearance.</p>
