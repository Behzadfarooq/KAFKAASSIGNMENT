	    <p>I'm a young-un who just remembered about wikipedia and haven't been following the discussions (is this <i>everything</i> that's been said about the page? less contentious than I'd have imagined) anyways, if our job description is, more or less, to order the built environment, it's a pretty poor show to have a disorganised virtual environment. So I'm going to add some headings.</p>
<p>I also disagree with the division between building and architecture, it seems to me architecture is one of the ways in which society as a whole reacts to the environment they live in. Everything built is architecture, it affects how we see the world, changes every situation we encounter, that little thought is given to the non-architectural aspects of the built environment (which comprises its bulk) only point to the waning relevance of architecture itself. Until care of all the environment is readmitted into the more holistic concerns of architecture; the lifelines of our society, such as pylons, motorways, developer housing and office districts will only illustrate the eventual death of our architecture - not the ability of architecture to trump building.</p>
<hr />
<p>Architecture is very broad, for example, it could be literal,"I think the architecture presented by Frank Gerry is interesting." Or... "I belive the architecture of my soul is broken by the course of recent events. " There is also the idea of infastructure. Urban design is also as open as architecture because untill recent years when we thought about urbanism we thought abouta city( large amounts of people to small amount of space, and the feeling that arises from that situation. Recently with technology, people can always connect with the masses, creating a different sort of reality or urbanism. Environmental desighers(ME..), study many aspects of design and architecture, and almost are the conductor( like in a musical production) of a built environment. The env. designers decide the harmony in the flow and design of the entire environment(from the furniture to the lighting to the structure to the landscape. Does that clear it up?</p>
<p>I'm duplicating the lists of architectural styles here - 'cultural movement' is far too vague (as are most of the entries under that heading! "golden age of theater and architecture" indeed!). Duplication is not a bad think in Wikipedia</p>
<p>I want to create a page for the Statue of Liberty, and can't figure out where it belongs. (A search got me lots of unrelated pages.) There's no entry for "statue" under sculpture, and nothing for monuments as a class. I think we need a category for monuments, which would include (for example) the Statue of Liberty and the Arc de Triomphe, but I'm not sure where to put it.</p>
<hr />
<p>so far the only entries for buildings (I'm thinking of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>) are under the style to which they apply - there might as well be a list branching off of the architecture page for "monuments" (please don't call it "famous" or "important", because all sorts of obscure but interesting things will end up there, too. --MichaelTinkler<br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I reorganized the front page so that it would be less cluttered. Now there are links to the pages that contain main items...such as architect, forms, etc. --<a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPlemeljr_66d7.html" title="User:Plemeljr">Plemeljr</a><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I removed the sentence: "It is meaningless to try to understand a work of architecture without taking in to account all three aspects." There is plenty of meaningful discussion of architecture that doesn't use Vitruvius's three concepts (not to mention precious few who ever use the nomenclature). --MichaelTinkler</p>
<hr />
<p>I reorganized the Forms in Architecture so that it is more logical following an archetype approach. I also have a long-winded discourse that explains my motivations and some theory that is relevant to architecture. More archetypical elements need to be included, and I think there might be a better way to structure that page. It seems that there is too much on the page right now.--Plemeljr<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I love it. Much improved. "Elements" started out as an archeytype list and has been mishandled a little (mainly I've been sticking in stubs for things that needed to be explained). I'll confess that as I progress into middle age I'm more and more of an Archetypicalist, in part because I've tired of the way in which most theorists manage to blather on and on about art or architecture without ever showing a picture. If we're talking about things, let's talk about things. 'Space' in most critical discourse is discourse, not spatial extension around a thinking person. Of course, here on Wikipedia we live without pictures, so 'Relative Homelessness' might work. On the other hand, 'primoridial soup' is a clever description, but a tad condescending to a highly developed theory of architecture that existed before the 20th century. It also implies a kind of 'evolutionism' in thought that I find unhelpful when dealing with anything larger than a cell. --MichaelTinkler</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I feel the definition of architechure in the article is too broad.</p>
<p>Is it really correct to say that arcitecture includes furniture design? I realize that some architects design furniture, and many of the concepts overlap.</p>
<p>Many other aspects of the 'built environment' are not in the architect's domain. The design of suspension bridges and dams require skills that the typical architect does not have.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for a more focused definition?</p>
<hr />
<p>Wow, this is an amazingly written page, but... NO PICTURES!!</p>
<p>Don't you think we should scrounge around for some appropriate representative examples? -- Jeff</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Nice work, whoever wrote this page! -- LVehko</p>
<hr />
<p>I love that an article on the history of architecture becomes a microcosm of the entire history of civilization, touching on so many important topics... but I'm biased, I'm an architecture student. I love feeling like we're the ones who have the big picture&#160;:-) -- Chris PS - I agree, well-written article. There's always more we could add though... maybe once school's out for summer I could take a crack at it... PPS - Whoever wrote the "definition of architecture is too broad" note up there... NO!! BAD! We are the chosen ones! We can do anything!&#160;:-D sorry... but, you know, the CEO of Nike is an architect. Some professional musicians I know too... then there's architects who are urban planners, architects who are also engineers, architectural historians, architecture critics, heck authors of all sorts, horticulturists, philosophers, politicians, etc. ... architects can be experts in just about any field they focus on. It's part of the training, we're supposed to aim for the ideal, the renaissance man. Oh, and we're modest too. Ok, I'm done.</p>
<hr />
<p>To me, one of the benefits of Wikipedia is that it's a ready launching point for investigating just about anything. And, while an academician might argue that this article doesn't constitute a professional overview of the subject, I find it a helpful starting point for any novice wanting to learn more about civil architecture. Perhaps some of the historical points deserve more time than others, but the various contributors have at very least seeded the ground with relevant information.</p>
<p>To add a little constructive criticism, however, I think this piece could deliver better on one of the other Wikipedia innovations -- the "au currant" encyclopedic definition. For example, how did the word evolve from a meaning specific to individual buildings to encompass the entire built environment (which it certainly does, in common parlance) and eventually many abstract structures, such as software, information, national security, business process, et al?</p>
<p>I would contend that the term architecture has taken on these new contexts not because it has broadened in meaning, but because its meaning has become more refined and exclusive in reaction to mass production. One can build a structure (physical or otherwise) that is completely devoid of architecture. We might all agree that an archetypical "tudor-style tract home" does not represent good architecture. But is it bad architecture?</p>
<p>If it it is bad architecture, it must have attempted something at which it failed. Furthermore it must have attempted and failed at something intrinsic to the idea of architecture -- something at which "good" architecture, in all its diverse exemplars, succeeds. Clearly this is not the case. A building -- or any other product, for that matter -- can succeed brilliantly at its design objectives (maximum profit?) and yet be utterly lacking in architecture.</p>
<p>So what is the stuff of architecture, as distinct from building, manufacturing or even <i>design</i> in and of itself? I would suggest that answering that question in this article would be a very useful improvement to the text. I took a crack at meeting this objective, but had my additions repeatedly over-written by one particular zealot with way more time on his hands than I have at my disposal&#160;:-)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I don't know whether you referring to me(I am not a zealot and I don't have time). In any case why don't you create a user ID so that your edits can be discussed? As far as I am concerned my opinion is that if you want to apply a meaning of a word retrospectively, it shouldn't go as far as confusing the original meaning or sidelining it when it still exists. The structure of the page and meaning suffer because of this. That's why I moved the original architecture(ninety five percent my contribution) to its own page as there were repeated attempts at forcing a coherence in a detailed page on the original architecture(See the practice of disambiguating pages). <a href="../../../k/r/s/User%7EKRS_9867.html" title="User:KRS">KRS</a> 13:57, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>
