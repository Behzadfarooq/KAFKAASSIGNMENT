<p>I moved a discussion of technique to the front, because archery is a technique. I moved the sport aspects next, because it is also a sport. I put the history and multicultural stuff last, as it's interesting to an enthusiast, but far less important than doing the activity safely.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would argue that if I wanted to learn how to do the activity safely, I wouldn't go to Wikipedia. I think history and sport aspects are more important *to an encyclopedia article* than technique.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, since it's all in the article anyway, I don't think the order is that important. Just wanted to point that out, though. <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAcheron_0aec.html" title="User:Acheron">Acheron</a> 18:58, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Order really isn't that important, provided that there is a logical flow to the article. There are several different archery techniques. The anonymous author broke up technique, placing part of it at the front, and merged the remainder with history. I believe that this reduced the clarity of the article, and I recombined the sections to fix it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the technique section, I've put the Occidental/Oriental sections before the Recurve section. They're both short summaries compared to the more detailed Recurve/Compound sections. Occidental also classifies Recurve as Occidental; something I think would best be mentioned beforehand. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGertlex_2999.html" title="User:Gertlex">Gertlex</a> 02:41, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This wasn’t the first time that the hunting section of this article was swayed a bit by someone’s point of view about the humanity of bow hunting or the lack thereof. Thanks to Zeimusu for cleaning it up. I made an attempt to make the section even more neutral. Please understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some individuals and governments believe bow hunting is profoundly inhumane.</li>
<li>Other individuals and governments believe that bow hunting is more humane and sportsmanlike than rifle hunting.</li>
<li>Bow hunting is banned in certain countries (UK for example)80.177.1.159 20:56, 1 December 2005 (UTC)MPD</li>
</ul>
<p>If you disagree with this, please post your disagreements to the talk rather than the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not a disagreement, but…<br />
It's beyond me how any sane person can think it's <i>less</i> humane put an animal down with an arrow (which cuts deep and cleanly into your quarry) than with a bullet (which uses brute force to punch an ugly hole in your quarry). I suppose there will always be such ignorant people around. –&#160;NRen2k5 07:17, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. Canting is actually necessary with some longbows.

</ul>
<p>Canting is *not* necessary with any type of bow, especially longbow. I have shot bows for some years, mainkly English longbow and anyone who cants and tells you it is "necessary" is just kidding themselves that their bad technique is excusable.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the article has some flow problems, I've noticed/fixed the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Equipment sub section of History, the English armies are suddenly mentioned. I'm almost certain they weren't the only ones who supplied their soldiers with arrows. <i>(not fixed)</i></li>
<li>"Now release the arrow by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand." The last paragraph of the Recurve sub section of Technique, from out of nowhere, sounds like an instruction guide. <i>(fixed)</i>

<li>Same section, removed a redundant statement at the end.</li>

<p>North America was settled by Paleo-Indian peoples during the late Pleistocene (about 20,000 years ago) who did not possess the bow and arrow. Was archery then developed independently by Native Americans? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_Gregg_9b2a.html" title="User:Jay Gregg">Jay Gregg</a> 18:11, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seems like it was. Here is a reference from <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/learn/ancient/archery.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/learn/ancient/archery.htm" rel="nofollow">University of Iowa State Archaelogist:</a> "American Indians did not always have the bow and arrow. It was not until about A.D. 500 that the bow and arrow was adopted in Iowa some 11,500 years after the first people came to the region." --69.32.163.3 17:01, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've reordered the article. It makes no logical sense for an article about archery to immediately jump into modern competition archery with no historical context. Accordingly the sections now run History --&gt; Technique --&gt; Hunting --&gt; Competetion. <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjbrianuk_0376.html" title="User:Djbrianuk">Djbrianuk</a> 22:46, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm a rifleman, not an archer, but am interested in the history of marksmanship. I do not find mention of the selfbow here (made of one piece of wood, unlike compound, etc.) Shouldn't that be explained? BT, 24 April 2006</p>

<dd>Selfbow is a pretty broad description. You could try searching for Longbow and Flatbow. And there is a discussion board by the name of PaleoPlanet which has a section devoted to traditional archery. I would bet that somebody there could tell you more than you would ever want to read.&#160;;) —&#160;<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva, cursive;">NRen2k5</span> 14:48, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've tried to determine when the bow and arrow was invented via internet search but haven't succeeded to my satisfaction. The oldest number I've seen is <a href="http://www.bowandarrow.info/historical/" class="external text" title="http://www.bowandarrow.info/historical/" rel="nofollow">40,000 years ago</a>, but the information is only cursory. The <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_evolution.html" title="Timeline of evolution">timeline of evolution</a> says 30,000 years ago in the Sahara. This archery page has a much smaller number.

<dd>Impossible to say for certain. Archery is definitely millennia old, but how many millenia? The problem is that after so many thousands of years, bows and arrows are not always reliably identifiable as such. An arrowhead could just as easily be a spearhead; you can't tell if the shaft and binding have completely rotted away and left no imprint in the ground. —&#160;<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva, cursive;">NRen2k5</span> 17:57, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's interesting to me that the bow and arrow appeared in so many cultures without any contact among them. For example, native Americans were using the bow and arrow long before they had contact with non-native Americans who were also using the bow and arrow. Is there some science that has studied the nearly simultaneous discover of technology in cultures who otherwise have no any contact? I'm thinking also of the wheel...</p>
<p>I'm new and don't know how to edit the atricle, but the online Encarta intry on archery verifies the 5000 year estimate. Could someone put that up? I found it at <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551756/Archery.html" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551756/Archery.html" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551756/Archery.html</a></p>

<p>I have done the admittedly controversial and arbitrary action of removing the "Equipments" section, since it seems to refer only to a specific epoch in Western European military history, thus making it an oddity in an article that is meant ot be a global introduction to archery. Currently I'm searching for a better place for that block of text--perhaps in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_longbow.html" title="English longbow">English longbow</a> article, perhaps in some other article on English military history. <a href="../../../l/_/c/User%7EL_clausewitz_b0a6.html" title="User:L clausewitz">Lay</a> 14:52, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It has been proposed that Target archery gets it's own page, and that a brief summary of the sport should be mentioned here with a wikilink to the more in depth article.</p>
<p><b>agree</b>: I noticed that field archery has it's own page but this could be due to the popularity of field archery in the United States. Since target archery is the other famous competition (internationaly as well), I believe it should get it's own page. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerakhantu_3ed3.html" title="User:Perakhantu">Perakhantu</a> 05:39, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section on the actual shooting of a bow is getting long as I expand and reorganize. I think that, once it seems fully fleshed out here, we should split it off and leave a summary. What say ye?

<dd>Well, another way to say it could be <b>technique</b> or <b>practice</b>.

<dd>We do need to come up with (or adopt) a classification system. Are bows primarily classified by shape? Material? ⇔ <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristTrekker_3e2b.html" title="User:ChristTrekker">ChristTrekker</a> 18:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Depends on the circle you are in. In some circles, because of the bows which are not permitted, it becomes more logical to classify the ones which <i>are</i> permitted differently. Generally, bows are classified first by shape (e.g. longbow, flatbow, recurve). After that comes material and/or details of design (e.g. Yew, Osage) and/or culture of origin (as historically, many cultures "invented" the bow independently of one another). A few examples: I think that most of us would call a Martin X200 a "recurve" rather than a "laminate", and the English Longbow is usually called the "English Longbow" rather than the "English Yew Bow". So I think the classification should be: Longbow, Shortbow (maybe), Recurve, Composite, Compound, and last but not least Crossbow. Finally, for better detail, we could always cover materials in their own section or even split the article between "traditional" archery and "modern" archery. —&#160;<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva, cursive;">NRen2k5</span> 14:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then I believe we should mention both/all types of classification systems. Material (solid, laminate/composite), shape (straight, recurve), mechanism (traditional, compound, crossbow)… I think we have to simply decide which systems, and which labels within those systems, are <i>useful</i>. A 2-D matrix would then be helpful to depict how the various bows relate in features. Although, that much detail would probably be more appropriate in the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_%28weapon%29.html" title="Bow (weapon)">bow (weapon)</a> article than here. ⇔ <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristTrekker_3e2b.html" title="User:ChristTrekker">ChristTrekker</a> 19:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was just thinking of putting in the major types of bows: Recurve, compound, barebow, crossbow. If I remember correctly, a longbow is a type of barebow. Doesn't FITA have some set rules about types?

<dd>AFAIK, "barebow" is a competitive division where one does not use sights. (I shot in that category for my entire archery career.)

<dd>Basically what ChristTrekker said. A barebow does not have any sights, stabalizers, or other such attachments. I guess you could refer to it as the "purest" form of a bow. Sorry for not repsonding earlier; been busy. Anyway, I look into the FITA rulebook and poke around USA Archery to dig up more material on this subject. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerakhantu_3ed3.html" title="User:Perakhantu">Perakhantu</a> 21:02, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd> Okay, so barebow seems to me to be much too broad of a classification to be of much use outside of competition. Also seems to be a very minor design consideration - you could drill a hole in the riser of a recurve like my X200 to allow attachment of a sight (though I would never recommend doing so), and presto, it's no longer a barebow. One would also have to wonder whether traditional attachments such as fur string silencers would disqualify a bow from "barebow" classification.<br />
 Not to say that it isn't worth mention, though. It's definitely worth noting when talking about competition and "modern" archery, just not so important to archery as a whole. That's my two cents, anyway. —&#160;<em>NRen2k5</em> 10:41, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
