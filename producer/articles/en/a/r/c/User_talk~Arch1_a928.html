<dd>Zealots? Whats the CPIM or IMC? Those are not balanced sources. Anybody that calls them women and children is now Hindutva? Looking at your history of edits, and the pages on your userpage, the ONLY sources you find acceptable are anti-Hindu sources. Of course, since I am trying to work under Bcorr's guidelines, I won't voice my opinion on the actual page but consider this a response to the sad state of the article.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 00:00, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Though they could very appropriately be mentioned as zealots (wasn't it their zeal to go to Ayodhya - to demand a temple be built on the mosque site)- I have not refered those who died in the train incident as zealots in the Wikipedia text,So why are you citing something that I have not mentioned in the article.</dd>

<p>Hello TerryJ-Ho. I have access to millions of older news articles from various databases. If you want, I can email you some reliable articles from the New York Times regarding the 2002 Gujarat violence, and if you have a request for other reliable sources, I can probably get you those too. Just email me. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 01:07, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Bhaisaab, Thanks, I have a long list of articles too..I am asking for acceptable sources from Baka, the thing is while working with other groups on the previous article.I have this problem of people attacking each and every source as Anti Hindu.So may be those people could cite sources that they will agree with - they attacked Amnesty,HRW,US government reports,reports from NHRC,other humanrights teams that visited Gujarat.They seemed to be happy with a particular site called as Bharatvani that has a Pro-BJP,RSS panel.I will email you though to be able to get more data on this topic.</dd>

<dd>Bharatvani is run by a scholar named Koenraad Elst who has a degree in Indian culture. He is a reputable source. HRW is biased as are any human rights groups that condemn Godhra but don't condemn the ethnic cleansing of Hindus from Kashmir or the attacks against minorities in Pakistan. Those are bigger issues than one riot in which a large number of Hindus were killed also. When Netaji comes back he will probably have some good sources, seeing as how he spends most of his time on this article (and other articles similar to this) while I prefer to work on Wikiproject:Bengal with Ragib, and therefore have less time to check on the POV.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 01:36, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The dynamics of Kashmir problem are different being a problem with two different countries while Gujarat is an internal problem of India.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a></dd>
<dd>Really. I believe the Muslim terrorists who blew up the train received support from the ISI. And there are <i>no</i> Kashmiri Pandits in PoK, so both are India's problems, one large scale (Pandit massacre and genocide) the other a measly communal riot.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 15:25, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Those who put the coach on fire were no terrorists, they were just responding to the provocations and it was a spontaneous outbreak of emotions.There is hardly any need for ISI to help, India being a big country has many resources specially the traitors in the army.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a></dd>
<dd>Really, not terrorists? Burning innocent women and children isn't terrorism but the victors of the communal riots are perpetrators of a genocide. What kind of twisted logic is this?<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 16:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No , They were just responding to the heat of the moment ..it is action and reaction.Kar Sevaks shouted slogans and misbehaved at the railway stations,so the result and what happened after that in the whole of Gujarat justified that <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 21:24, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Suit yourself. So some people singing "Jai Sri Ram" <i>naturally</i> made the Muslims burn down a train which <i>naturally</i> led to the riots, which <i>naturally</i> led to the Mulsims getting owned in the riots. <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 21:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Normally, people would voice their concerns (perhaps in court) but of course <i>secular</i> people get treated in a special way right?<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 21:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I totally agree. The riots were merely a Hindu reaction, with no gov't intervention (present or even needed).

<dd>I agree it was but not unlike the edits by another user who contributes on these pages.I can see a number of his articles where a criticism chapter enters an otherwise normal text.Though there is hardly any need to discuss, the Wikipedia article itself on Pipes mentions the number of occassions he has been referred to as Anti Muslim.This is another effort at weasling.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 15:25, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What does Israel have to do with this? Fact is, Pipes is a scholar and he wrote about this. Bear in mind that many muslims regard India as part of the "Greater Middle East" and so Pipes, a middle east scholar, was naturally interested in the Islamism in India.<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 20:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That question is secondary.The primary question is whether or when Rama was born or is just a mythological legend.That site is important to Hindus as they say it is Rama's birthspot.If he was never born - what is the point of creating a birthplace and exactly on the spot where a mosque stood.Secondly,if you have gone through the external sources cited on the Babri - RJB pages, there is ample evidence that no such temple existed not from Muslim but Secular researchers.</dd>
<dd>I see no such evidence. The question I asked has gone unanswered. Meanwhile this question is a stupid question, because Ram did exist. I won't answer any of your questions (needless to say Ram existed, and the Mosque was an eyesore) until you give me refs. <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 14:46, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made no such calculation of 9000BC. I asked for you to <i>prove a TEMPLE never existed</i> under the eyesore called the Babri Mosque. Anyways, your source merely proved there <b>was a temple</b> under the disputed structure. As for trying to put Ram advocates against Saivites, you will find that Saivites support the Ram temple and dont really care about whether it <i>may</i> have been a Saivite Ashram, myself (a hard core Saivite) included. As for your IP tag team buddy, you just screwed up his statement "there is ample evidence that no such temple existed not from Muslim but Secular researchers", looks like your trusted source failed you. For proving Ram existed, you may want to consult the Ramayan where Valmiki states "this is a true story" at the beginning of the narration.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 18:05, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why is Ram Janmabhoomi so important.Not because it is any temple but because it is the birthplace of Rama according to Hindutva history.So the actual question is whether or when Rama was born.So find out whether Rama was born or just a bed time story.You seem to be placing your eggs in a wrong basket when you say Saiva temple was found.The article is taking a dig at the historians by saying taht.Raed "There is no mention of a temple, only of evidence of a massive structure, fragments of which speak about their association with temple architecture of the Saivite style""However, D. Mondal questions this, saying that these pillar bases would have been unable to support "load-bearing pillars of stone". Mondal also says that the pillar bases are not contemporaneous, but belong to different structural phases. In other words, they were not built together as base pillars of one superstructure, ("a grand 10th century temple," as BJP president Venkaiah Naidu claimed) but belonged to different periods when they supported different superstructures.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 19:42, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, calling people paid agents and making other disparaging remarks isn't a good idea. You've been asked to stop attacking - its always a good idea to remember, if your comment is about the contributor and not the content, you might want to reword it. Since you continued to be highly incivil even after repeated requests, you've been blocked for one hour. When the block is up, please continue with dispute resolution and don't let yourself be drawn into rude behavior just because you think others are doing it.

Gujarat gov't gets the most investment out of all states in India, it also has the most transparent government, which means theres a very high chance gave the truth. Human rights watch is a leftist watch group accused of anti-Semitism and anti-Hindu actions, and it is in collusion with the CPI. The Muslim perspective is strivtly political and not motivated by facts. If the guju gov't wanted to pull off a stunt, wouldnt they exaggerate Muslim deaths?

<dd>I dont think these sites have been used - however these are very mainstream sites and they republish news from very mainstream India and International media.You can not compare Bharatvani or Elst or Oak to them - the research of whom is original.You can compare your Hindu vani sources with Muslim Sites who would be more directly concerned with the Hindu Muslim issues and these Muslim sites have rarely been cited in these articles.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a></dd>

<dd>No, RSS's alleged fascist leanings are baseless accusations, based largely on attacks from biased people. The articles prove nothing other than vague associations and circumstantial evidence. There is scholarly evidence backed up by journalistic sources on Indian Express that prove that RSS is not fascist.

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>one can speak of Vedic mathematics, Islamic mathematics and Pythagorean beliefs; those are different kettles of fish. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellbird_c267.html" title="User:Bellbird">Bellbird</a> 14:42, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There isn't Islamic Mathematics.It is purely mathematics by Muslim Mathematicians.If a Muslim scientist helps in Nuclear Physics do we call it Islamic Nuclear Sciences <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 15:01, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>better to speak of Mathematcians who were Muslims by religion than Muslim Mathematicians in case you read something else in my wordings <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 15:03, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How does it matter? The fact is Muslim users may want to know which mathematicians are Muslim and Hindus and Jews and Christians want to know likewise for their religions.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 01:00, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They can consult a list of Muslim scientists, if their intention is that.When you place a category - that becomes an exaggeration as if being Muslim was most important to them at the expense of other aspects of their life and personality that are not present on that page..Secondly, religion is a very complex issue, say for example , many people place Salman Rushdie as a Muslim writer as he was born in a Muslim family..while he can't be called as Muslim as he does not believe in the fundamental creed of Islam and has been declared apostate...similarly what would you say of Ayaan Hirsi Ali..Is she a Muslim? Many in the west mention her as a Muslim woman..while she may not be one in the eyes of the Muslims themselves..I already mentioned the Bollywood actor Dharmendra - who is legally Muslim but for all other purposes Hindu..Who is going to ensure that such categorisation is correct and who will define what makes them belong to a particular religion??? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 18:31, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi - as I'm sure you're aware, there has been some edit warring going on at <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipu_Sultan_c2f4.html" title="Tipu Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>, which has, from what I've seen, lead to some nasty accusations and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. Of course, these are things that we don't want in Wikipedia - we're building an encylcopedia, not making an informal forum for arguement. I have been called upon to mediate for, and provide my opinion on the article in question by <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">User:Hkelkar</a>, and am sending this message to all those to whom I feel it pertains. What I am looking for are reasons for the reversion (or, as I could be seen by some, content blanking) of edits by Hkelkar, which were well sourced (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) verifiable (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) and presented in a neutral point of view (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), in the hope that with this reasoning, I can turn the article back into a peaceful editting area. As part of this request, I would like you to consider that Hkelkar's submissions were well sourced, and that if there is a counter arguement against them, then that should be included too - the whole contribution should <b>never</b> be deleted. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and please place your reply in a new section on <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">my talk page</a>.
