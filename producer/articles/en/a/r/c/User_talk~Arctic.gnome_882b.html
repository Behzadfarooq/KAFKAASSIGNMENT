<dd>iTunes Originals has no standing in officiality. The titles of the tracks are written by iTunes, as songs like In The Drink are mistitled. Just like the etown recording (also on itunes) which calls Old Apartment "Where we used to live" or something. <a href="http://www.suebeedesigns.com/bnlmusic/auto/yellow.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.suebeedesigns.com/bnlmusic/auto/yellow.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> copy of the yellow tape does not have an "a" in the title of the song.

<p>I think we might be adding them up differently. Feb 5, 2007 was his 365th day in office, but that is still not a complete year. There are 365 days in a year, but when it his 366 days, then it is a complate year, starting a new year. Feb 6, 2007 was Harper's one year in office, Feb 7 was Harper's 1 year and one day. <a href="../../../s/f/r/User%7ESFrank85_a96d.html" title="User:SFrank85">SFrank85</a> 23:32, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The dates for the prime ministers' terms in office now don't agree: the date in the information boxes vs. the date in the articles. Examples are Trudeau (June 29 vs June 30) and Mackenzie King (Nov. 14 vs Nov. 15). If you change one date in each prime minister's article, should you not change <i>all</i> the dates for each article ... for consistency? <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQue-Can_3496.html" title="User:Que-Can">Que-Can</a> 05:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still think the days for Harper is wrong (not total days). There are 365 days in one year. Once you hit 365 days in a year, it is now a new year, but the last day of the first year. February 6 is Harper's first year, but according to this, his first year anniversary was on February 5, which is wrong. <a href="../../../s/f/r/User%7ESFrank85_a96d.html" title="User:SFrank85">SFrank85</a> 15:08, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re the article you created called Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership convention, 1914, the first Ontario Conservative leadership convention did not occur until 1920.

<p>I've fixed the dates (Mackenzie to Martin), when these PM resigned &amp; their successor's were sworn in. My source? <b>Prime Minsters of Canada</b> by <b>Jim Lotz</b> (c.1986). As for Campbell, Chretien &amp; Martin, CBC News made it quite known, when these respective PM's resigned and their successor were sworn in (the resignation &amp; swearing in occured on the same date; give or take a few hours). This notion that a defeated or retiring PM resigned a day before his/her successor was sworn in, is the wrong notion (the only execption were the 19th &amp; early 20th century PM's). <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 23:20, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've added 2 more external links to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada_5d74.html" title="List of Prime Ministers of Canada">List of Prime Ministers of Canada</a> to back my edits. Furthermore, I have a 'Funk &amp; Wagnalls' Encyclopedia set that backs my edits. Also, in 1984, 1993, 2003 &amp; 2006, while watching CBC news (Canada's leading News channel), they distinctively announced the outgoing PM's resignation occuring earlier on the same day as the incoming PM's being sworn in. Finnaly, I think Jim Lotz did research, before he wrote his book.<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 23:51, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I removed one of the External Links (which I added, earlier), it was inconsistant (it actually had Campbell leaving office Oct 25, 1993 -Election Day). I'm signing out for the night. As we have conflicting sources, I suggest we have a Rfc for all PM of Canada pages &amp; the List article. An 'Edit war' wouldn't be good. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 00:06, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is very late reply to what you asked two months back on <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EMirrors_and_forks_4970.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Mirrors and forks">Wikipedia talk:Mirrors and forks</a>. You asked how could Wikipedia allow its content to be freely used by anyone, even to make profit for themselves. A number of people answered your query, but in the end you looked unconvinced. I chose to reply to your page itself as you might not be watching the said page till now. Hopefully in the two months, you would have understood more about our philosophy, but if you haven't here's my sincere attempt.</p>
<p>Wikipedia licenses its content under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_FDL_5de3.html" title="GNU FDL">GNU FDL</a> license, which is a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyleft.html" title="Copyleft">copyleft</a> license. In short, this means that anyone can use the content for any purpose, provided they also license the content under GNU FDL with full text of the license, and acknowledges all the authors of the content. Full details of this can be found at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>. Also note that the top of the page says: "The Wikimedia Foundation does not own copyright on Wikipedia article texts and illustrations." Thus, Wikipedia is a place where you can license your contributions under the GFDL, but this doesn't make Wikipedia own the work done by you. The Wikipedia encyclopedia chooses to make the content freely available to anyone throughout the world, free from any kind of advertisements or other bounds. This moral high ground need not be taken up by anyone using GFDL content. Some may want to use the content commercially by making it a part of their own website, by selling CDs, etc. But whoever chooses to do this also understands that if s/he wants to make profit, there should be something that would distinguish him from Wikipedia. For example, if there is a Wikipedia mirror that contains lot of pop-up ads, and spam anyone who visits the site, there would be a good reason for someone to use that website rather than the plain-ol' Wikipedia. Also, making into CDs would require some effort on his own part. Add to the fact that anyone can copy his business model, so it would be difficult to operate such a business on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernormal_profit.html" title="Supernormal profit">supernormal profit</a>. While the example I gave is good to give an understanding of how Wikipedia's content cannot be exploited beyond a certain extent, but in reality, Wikipedia did not start functioning with this hindsight. Wikipedia just wanted to make things freely available to everyone. The best way that this was possible was to use the power of the internet. The content is so free that the only thing we want to ensure is that it remains free even in the derivative works (that is why we expect our mirrors to be GFDL compliant). It is true many people who contribute to Wikipedia actually think that they still own the content. Another whooping majority thinks that the content gets owned by Wikipedia. Frankly, I believe that if everyone is made truly aware of how free we make our content (especially with regards to commercial redistribution), many contributors will stop contributing. But there are still many people (like me, of course) who believe in promoting freedom of knowledge. Thus we all contribute for the greater good of humanity (as a near perfect charity work). Looking at your userboxes, I find that your contributions are perfect charity as you release all your content to the public domain. This means that anyone can use the content originally created by you for any purpose, even without acknowledging you, and even if you wish they don't.</p>
<p>Hope this clarified your doubts. If you have any more outstanding queries, I will be glad to answer. — <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">☎</a>) 12:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am guessing I would have to leave the last one out of the topic. Would I have to research <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Factory_d6a1.html" title="The Factory">The Factory</a> to site it or can this group be nominated if Warhol gets a GAC? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonyTheTiger_c92e.html" title="User talk:TonyTheTiger">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TonyTheTiger_dfd9.html" title="Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger">cont</a>/<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_Antonio_Vernon_c5a1.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon">bio</a>)</small> 04:29, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am guessing you are saying if Andy Warhol is the topic The <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_Museum_2293.html" title="Andy Warhol Museum">Andy Warhol Museum</a> would need a true article and The Andy Warhol Foundation would need an article. In addition, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Factory_d6a1.html" title="The Factory">The Factory</a>, and<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_Art_Authentication_Board_6c76.html" title="Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board">Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board</a> would need great improvement. However, Campbell's Soup Cans might make it with just the first three articles. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonyTheTiger_c92e.html" title="User talk:TonyTheTiger">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TonyTheTiger_dfd9.html" title="Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger">cont</a>/<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_Antonio_Vernon_c5a1.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon">bio</a>)</small> 14:15, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
