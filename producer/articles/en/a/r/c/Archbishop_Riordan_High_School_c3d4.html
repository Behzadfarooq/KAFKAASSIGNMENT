<p>Archbishop Riordan High School, an Archdiocesan Catholic High School in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marianist.html" title="Marianist">Marianist</a> Tradition, develops the character of young men and instills <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> values in an environment of academic excellence that reflects the cultural diversity of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Area_2a1a.html" title="Bay Area">Bay Area</a>.</p>

<p>Archbishop Riordan High School was opened in September of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> and was entrusted to the direction of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Mary_249f.html" title="Society of Mary">Society of Mary</a> (The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marianist.html" title="Marianist">Marianists</a>), an international religious congregation of men in the service of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>. The society was founded by Father <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Joseph_Chaminade_86f8.html" title="William Joseph Chaminade">William Joseph Chaminade</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1817.html" title="1817">1817</a> at <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux.html" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, France. This society has a unique characteristic in the church. Its members - Brothers and priests, teachers and non-teachers - belong to it on a plane of absolute equality; there are differences in function, but none of rank, privilege, or prerogative. <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">Education</a> is the principal work of the society, though a large number of members are in other works of the apostolate such as preaching, parish work, orphanages, missions, and directing lay apostolate groups.</p>
<p>The Marianists were invited to California in 1884 by Archbishop Patrick Riordan. In the summer of 1886, five Marianists from Saint Mary's Stockton began the many years of service in San Francisco. At St. Joseph's Parish, in the downtown district of the city, they began a grammar school for boys. In 1906, the Marianists opened a high school department at Saint James while also conducting Saint James Grammar School in the Mission District. With the increasing demands for another, still larger boys' high school in San Francisco, the Marianists closed the high school department at Saint James in 1949 and moved to the newly constructed Archbishop Riordan High School, a monument to the memory of Archbishop <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_William_Riordan_e79d.html" title="Patrick William Riordan">Patrick William Riordan</a>, D.D., second <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_San_Francisco_87d8.html" title="Archbishop of San Francisco">Archbishop of San Francisco</a>, 1884-1914.</p>

<p>ARHS utilizes an "intensive block" schedule commonly known as the 4x4 schedule. The school year is split into two semesters, Fall and Spring, and students take four courses each semester. Each class lasts eighty minutes, providing time for students and teachers to delve more deeply and actively into topics and activities. This emphasis on depth promotes greater understanding of skills, concepts, and ideas than the traditional fifty-minute period allows.</p>
<p>In addition, the 4x4 allows ARHS students to take eight different ten-credit courses per school year rather than six, as is the norm in traditional school schedules. Therefore, over a four-year career ARHS students will be able to take eight more classes than students in schools with traditional schedules. A Riordan student’s academic courseload will not merely fulfill University of California and California State University requirements, it will exceed them, with ample room to spare to sample the expanded elective opportunities available.</p>
<p>One major criticism of the 4x4 schedule is in respect to Advanced Placement courses. Such AP courses taught in the Fall semester would end in December, but the actual AP Exam is in May. Thus, the student is expected to retain the learned material for five months. In addition, because the AP exam is administered in early May, courses taught in the Spring semester are often cut short by three weeks. Three weeks, while seemingly a short amount of time, is very valuable in the 4x4 block schedule and often forces the instructor to "cram" the material in the weeks approaching the AP exam.</p>
<p>Archbishop Riordan High School also offers a variety of Honors and <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_5c2b.html" title="Advanced Placement">Advanced Placement</a> courses. The AP Calculus class, taught by Mr. Paul Arrigotti, is nationally recognized for its high passing rates and scholastic achievement.</p>

<p>Riordan athletics would begin in the 1950s, a time when many high schools, both public and private, were rapidly expanding due to the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Boom_fc74.html" title="Baby Boom">Baby Boom</a>. Participating in the newly created Catholic League for high schools around San Francisco, the crusaders experienced immediate success in a multitude of areas. The student body enthusiastically supported the program, as Riordan fielded new sports every few years. Notable events of the decade include the first <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> game at Riordan (September 18, 1951), the first <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homecoming.html" title="Homecoming">homecoming</a> night rally (November 10, 1955), the Riordan versus <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Ignatius_College_Preparatory_9c0e.html" title="St. Ignatius College Preparatory">St. Ignatius College Preparatory</a> <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> game at <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seals_Stadium_eab9.html" title="Seals Stadium">Seals Stadium</a> (November 3, 1956), the Faculty versus Seniors <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> game (April 4, 1957), and the Block Society's soponsoring of Fight Night, which featured eight boxing matches as well as wrestling and judo (March 28, 1958).</p>
<p>Sports at Riordan was initially shaped by Mr. Edward Fennelly, then a 24-year-old graduate of St. John's High School in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alameda%2C_California_fdde.html" title="Alameda, California">Alameda</a>. He coached the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">track</a> teams, but would expand his influence on the Riordan in the years to come. To many, he is a symbol of the origins and development of Riordan, and to thousands of alumni was the epitome of sportsmanship and gentlemanly behavior. He would coach, teach, and serve as an administrator for 40 years.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_Riordan_High_School_c3d4.html" title="Edit section: 1960s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1960s</span></h4>
<p>During the 1960s, Riordan athletics would blossom into a major force in the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Area_2a1a.html" title="Bay Area">Bay Area</a>. Joining the new <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Catholic_Athletic_League_bc19.html" title="West Catholic Athletic League">West Catholic Athletic League</a> in 1967, the Crusaders became successful in a number of athletic endeavors. The victory bell was introduced, which still resides in the junior hallway of the school. It was put to good use, as <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> won varsity championships in '60, '68, and '69, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_country_running.html" title="Cross country running">cross country</a> won championships in '65, '66, '68, and '69), <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> in '66 and Track in '67 and '68.</p>
<p>As the CAL divided, and Riordan joined the WCAL, Ed Fennelly became commissioner. This coincided with the 1966 football team dramatically won the championship against league powerhouse <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellarmine.html" title="Bellarmine">Bellarmine</a>. Under "Doc" Erskine, the Crusaders battled the Bellarmine Bells under the lights of <a href="../../../k/e/z/Kezar_Stadium_0dab.html" title="Kezar Stadium">Kezar Stadium</a> to come out on top - 13-10. In their exuberance after the game, studens tore down the goalposts at Kezar, fashioning trophies of the wood. These trophies, signed by the team, reside in the Crusader Forum today, remebering their legendary upset for the first WCAL championship.</p>

<p>The '70s saw the most varsity championships (13 in all) and the greatest varsity record (6 sports). They included: One each in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">track</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_country_running.html" title="Cross country running">cross country</a>, 2 in <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>, 3 in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a>, and 4 in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>. Soccer soared at Rioran during the decade. The Varsity won four consecutive <a href="../../../w/c/a/WCAL_337f.html" title="WCAL">WCAL</a> titles and the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Coast_Section_78d4.html" title="Central Coast Section">Central Coast Section</a> championship in 1976. Never before or since has soccer reached the same heights, but during those years achievement came from talent, enthusiasm, and hard work under the guide of Coach Tom Carroll.</p>
<p>Riordan saw the birth of Camp Crusader, a summer camp for the Riordan athletes of the future. Mr. Ron Isola inaugurated the camp in 1974 for boys in 4th through 8th grades. Consisting of two three week sessions, hundreds of youngsters swarmed to Riordan. Original organized leagues included <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a>, pee-wee <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">track</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_hockey.html" title="Field hockey">field hockey</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumbling.html" title="Tumbling">tumbling</a>, <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestling.html" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling.html" title="Bowling">bowling</a>.

<p>By 1980, Riordan had established itself as a <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Area_2a1a.html" title="Bay Area">Bay Area</a> powerhouse in a variety of sports, but had yet to create an athletic niche, an area that would unquestionably be the territory of the Crusaders. Under the direction of Coach Ron Isola, Riordan would become a <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> juggernaut, winning six straight championships from 1985 to 1990. A legend in his own time, Isola ushered in an era of Riordan dominance in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a>, going to sectional and state championships a number of times.</p>
<p>Another feature of the '80s would be the <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestling.html" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a> program. Started in 1979 under Coach Steve Swanson, the sport caught fire amongst the student body, and matches were a highlight of the week. Although the Crusaders never won a championship, Swanson guided ten individual league champion wrestlers and six CCS placers. Among these was Adam Cohen, two time CCS champion and an eventual <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_e914.html" title="NCAA">NCAA</a> finalist at <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_State_University_ee40.html" title="Arizona State University">Arizona State University</a>. Wrestlers competed abroad as well, carrying the Crusader banner to <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honolulu.html" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>.</p>
