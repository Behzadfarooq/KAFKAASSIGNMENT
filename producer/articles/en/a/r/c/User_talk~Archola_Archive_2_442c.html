<p>SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways, from comparing articles that need work to other articles you've edited, to choosing articles randomly (ensuring that all articles with cleanup tags get a chance to be cleaned up). It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work. Your contributions make Wikipedia better -- thanks for helping.</p>
<p>If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please tell me on <a href="../../../s/u/g/User_talk%7ESuggestBot_d5a3.html" title="User talk:SuggestBot">SuggestBot's talk page</a>.

<dd>I'm not sure why you believe that I'm making a threat. A friend of mine <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">User:KHM03</a> was forced to resign from Wikipedia when an off-site webpage posted personal information about himself and his family. This lead to threats against his family and colleagues. I also posted <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist#Wikipedia_Review" class="extiw" title="m:Talk:Spam_blacklist">here</a> about this incident (although since I don't have a meta account, I had to sign with my KDSI IP 65.121.136.204). The off-site page is on Wikipedia's spam blocklist, and I have been asked not to reveal the URL on Wikipedia pages.</dd>
<dd>The site that cyberstalked KMH03 has content very similar to <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn1838_97a7.html" title="User talk:John1838">User talk:John1838</a> and <a href="../../../j/1/8/User_talk%7EJ1838_0b0d.html" title="User talk:J1838">User talk:J1838</a>, which alledges a "Christian cabal" emerging on the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> page. Far from making a threat, I share SOPHIA's concern that this offsite page will take this as further evidence of a cabal, unwarrented though it is. I've been watching this site, and I know that this site has been closely watching some editors on Wikipedia. Although I'm not on their list at the moment, far from <i>making a threat</i> I am <i>feeling threatened</i> and trying to warn others.</dd>

<dd>OK, I'm unblocking you. It appears I have misunderstood your remarks. I apologise for any assumption of bad faith. However, with certain recent events in mind, your edit summary realy worried me. Please don't use edit summaries to comment or discuss, they are really only to summarise the nature of a post. Edits can be removed later, but edit summaries are always there. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 00:13, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That was quick: you edit conflcted with me when I tried to post the above explanation. Again, the short answer is that a friend of mine has been threatened, I'm worried that I may be threatened myself and I'm trying to warn others.

<p>Hi, Archola. I'm really sorry that misunderstanding happened last night, as I think there's enough tension here already! I didn't know about it until later, when I saw Sophia's comments on Doc's talk page, but I would certainly have tried to help if I had known. Enjoy your wiki-break, and come back soon to us.

<p>Since you are the direct contact with KMH03, I'll use this place for the discussion to convince KHM03 to return. I have many ideas, besides the ones you have already communicated to him for me. I wonder if he responded?</p>
<p>However, here is another one that should work logically, although it may not be ethical or practical so I propose this only as a brainstorm and to be hypothetical and theoretical in nature--in the form of an argument, not as a proposal of an actual practice that I advocate. Indeed, to implement it would be as unethical as the tactics used to drive him away because the ends do not justify the means.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, here it is: KMH03's logic is that because he was contacted "where it hurts" he must leave wikipedia to give in, I guess, to what the stalker wants him to do, given the use of these tactics. So, we know that such an action/tactic is effective--it works in the mind of KHM03 to get him to leave--do what the stalking party wants him to do. Well, if it works one way, it should logically work the other way, too, no? I mean his info is still out there--that does not change. So, therefore, can't all his friends (or those who want him to come back) simply use the same tactics, or threaten the same tactics, for the purpose of his friend-stalker to get their way (to get him to return?). If there are more of us then the enemy stalker, then should not he come back for the very same reason he left--we have him where it hurts? If KMH03 can be convinced that unless he comes back, he will get MORE letters, etc. (from friends who pretend to be enemies--in order for him to take it seriously we may have to sound very serious), demanding that he return or they will continue to stalk him, etc, then this would force him to come back for the very same reason he left. Again, this is not an actual proposition but it should work in theory, and hypothetically speaking-- what would KMH03 due in such a situation? I'd like his answer. This is a type of fighting fire with fire. I just set fires in the other direction and get him running back to this place that relatively speaking is much safer (one person vs. many). The real object of this mind-game is to demonstrate the error of his decison to give in the the stalker by leaving and giving them what they want, in effect encouraging such a tactic to be used against others. So, in reality this is just a variation of one of my earlier arguments. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 05:31, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gio I'm hoping I've misunderstood what you are suggesting as if I haven't then this is the most morally and logically screwed up proposal I have ever heard. To make a guy who is feeling threated feel even worse because his friends are after him too is sadistic to say the least. KHM03 made his choice and we must respect that. I want him back too but the way to achieve that is for the project as a whole to take a definitive stand against the real life stalkers and create an environment where there is real practical support for individuals targeted by these sad creepy losers. I would NEVER support any action that threatened another user in ANY way as whatever the otherside chooses to do is up to them but we don't have to descend to the gutter with them.

<dd>Yes, you did misunderstand. I suggest you re-read. I tried to make myself clear. This is not an actual proposal for any kind of action of the sort. Infact, don't I clearly say that it would be as unethical as the event which caused him to leave? What this is, is an argument for him to re-think about the power he is giving those who stoop to use this tactic. He/she should not be granted the power to effect his departure, or else, anyone can start sending off letters to get him to do what they want, which would be absurd. Yes, he has a right to make his own decision, and I dont presume to know enough about the details to determine what is right for him. However, based on what I do know, I don't agree with his decision. Ofcourse, its fully his right to do what he thinks is best given his priorities. That goes without saying. However, that doesnt mean I have to agree with him, nor not try to change his mind, esp. if I think (based on what I know) is making a mistake by leaving. I also don't want this tactic to be given the success. If Gator did not leave, would this have happened? And, if he leaves, who is next, encouraged by the success of this letter ploy (which really should just be ignored). So, no, I only want to use the power of reason to convince him to reconsider and rejoing his efforts at building the best free encylopedia there is. This is my sole tactic, and that is perfectly fine, and ethical standpoint.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 09:39, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess you don't have kids - they do complicate things which is why I think at this time KHM03 did the right thing. However wikipedia as a whole has this issue to address as they specifically encourage new users to fully identify themselves(see <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a>) with no warning as to what real life problems this has caused. I have discussions here that would never take place in real life as people are very cagey about their beliefs and passions face to face. That to me is one of the wonders of this place a you really learn new stuff and ways of looking at things. Until my interactions with Str1977 I had no idea how much of a humanist I was and that has really helped me organise my thoughts and present them in a clearer manner. The down side is that some people go over the top and don't know how to handle people who don't agree with them in a mature way - hence the stalking. I'm glad this was only "thinking aloud" and I understand your point on giving in to bullies but wikipedia is only a hobby and if your real life is threatened then until wikipedia sorts out how to deal with this opting out is the best way. Maybe the next generation of online encyclopedia will have sorted these problems.

<dd>Well we just have different POV's about this matter. I certainly agree with you, that Wikipedia has a wonderful side-effect in addition to its lofty goal--people come together and get exposed to a diverse range of ideas and knowlege, and it is in the contrast with other's POV that one fully understands and develops their own mature thinking, including putting it in perspective. We are what we do and if we help to bulid an encylopedia, we become, to a degree, encylopedic.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>But, we do disagree about KMH03, kids or no kids, the prankster only sent in a letter, probably doesnt even live in the same continent, and there is no reason to think he or his kids would ever be in any real harm. The person smoking nearby would be a much greater real threat to his kids well-being, or crossing the green-light at the intersection. Sending a letter is just a petty attempt at intimidation and they probably get a kick out of doing it, but I would not empower such a sophmoric act by giving it a big reaction, much less leaving alltogther. This is what they want, and this will give him/her great encouragement. Ofcourse, I don't know the details. Maybe it was much more serious than I realize. Maybe the letter had details letting him know that they were really stalking nearby, had photos of his kids, made specific threats should he come back here, etc (a matter for the police, for sure), but I hightly doubt this is the case. If it is, then it would be understandable. If its what I think it is, then KM03 should not give it a second thought.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 10:16, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't mind if you use my talk page, but I felt that I had to respond.</p>
<p>I think I understand where you're coming from, Giovanni, but it was exactly that kind of "don't let them win" attitude that got me kicked out of Wartburg College. Also, if you fight fire with fire, everyone gets burned.</p>
<p>KHM03 most definitely felt threatened and we should not push him. If he comes back, it will months later if at all. I have not heard from him since April 18th. OTOH, it's good to show that people respect KHM03 to want him back, even if they don't always agree with his POV.</p>
<p>I don't have children myself, but I shudder to think what would happen if people started stalking my neice and nephew.

<p>Hi Archie, I am being passive at CKB! But I am going to get off my bed and do something on CKB...some day! (since it's holiday for me here I am going to sleep in...)</p>
<p>In your profile it says you are male and single. But I thought Archie is a female name... Can you tell me what Archie means? --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkybutton_b6ff.html" title="User:Inkybutton">inky</a> 08:33, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Archie has always been a male name. "Archie" is a reduced form of the English name "Archibald," which means something like "nobly bold."

<p>Hi Archie,</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you know that CKB has now moved as per the discussion of changing servers. I am hosting it myself now on a really good server. I have more control over extensions and stuff. Incidentally, the name has changed to ChristWiki because CKB was so unweildy and long.&#160;;)</p>
<p>We are just about ready to go live!</p>
<p>When I transferred everything over, it worked out pretty well. However, you will have to recreate your user. Your user/talk page should be intact. The reason is that for privacy issues I didn't copy the user table over because that would give me access to passwords (encrypted, mind you) and personal information stuff. Thus, the user table is blank and you need to recreate yourself&#160;:)</p>
<p>As soon as we finalize the CPOV policy, I think we're ready to "go public" with this project and invite the world! I'm pretty excited for that, and I wanted to thank you for your contributions thus far. We can submit to DMOZ and Google and start getting some real active hits on that site.</p>
<p>Please join up and re-register at the new domain: <a href="http://christ.relately.com/" class="external free" title="http://christ.relately.com/" rel="nofollow">http://christ.relately.com/</a></p>
<p>Drop me a message on my talk page once you've done that so that I can +admin you.</p>

<dd>Yes, both of you should maybe wait but think about it. I'd love to see excellent admins who I know I can trust to be fair and impartial despite POV differences. My edit/article ration is also hight, about 9, as well, which AnnH says suggests that I'm here to push a POV, in her many posts about me. I think we have high ratios is only because we want to stick to a few articles at a time in order to devout enough time to be able to solve the major issues with the articles we are working with first, before moving on to others. I think this is normal. I like to finish a job and not leave it unfinished before I move on to other articles--or too many others. Therefore, it seems to be a matter of persistence and dedication to an article istelf, which is not a matter of POV pushing; POV pushign is about content, not subject. The hight ration indicates conentration of articles, not content or any particular POV, just interests in the subjects.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 00:43, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
