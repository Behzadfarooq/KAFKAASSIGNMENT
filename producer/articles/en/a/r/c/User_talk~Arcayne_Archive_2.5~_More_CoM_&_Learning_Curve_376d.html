<p>Hi Arcayne. C-SPAN's book <i>Who's Burined in Grant's Tomb</i> is my source for my statement. While they do not have a statement that says this exactly as the organizational structure of the book is based on chronological arrangement of administrations, it is not new research for me to conclude that. So, no, not a singular unified source. But, from this source every U.S. president to die in the twentieth century (whose body went to the Capitol), beginning with Wilson, with the exception of Kennedy (St. Matthews), constitutes "most." Of course please feel free to edit if you like. Best, Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 21:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your first one (which is the one I think you are missing) is a revert. Even though you changed the wording around, you technically reverted the information back to the state before Viri removed it. In all intents and purposes, an Admin would consider this a revert. The others are obvious, because you labeled them "rv". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 00:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This would imply that Viri is also at his limit, correct?<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 00:37, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, and I've told him so as well. Now, other than blatant vandalism, if either of you revert ANYTHING on the page in the next 24 hours (really 24 from the first revert) than you could be subject to blocking. Now, I'm not going to report either of you if you do violate that rule (unless it gets out of hand and you both have reverted like 5,6,7+ times), but be warned that if you choose to violate the rule and revert, someone else (probably Viri, because I'm sure he knows you've reached the limit) can report you. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 00:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not planning on doing anything. If he reverts, i'll just report it. The lesson taught by 3RR was learned by me. Thank you for the heads-up.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 00:51, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's your right as an editor. My clock says 12:51pm was your first revert, so that means you have about 17 hours before you can revert again, but I'd would just ignore it. I don't know who, if anyone, was contacted as a mediator for this situation, but I'd wait till they came. I saw you were worried about them just looking at the plot and saying "it looks fine to me;" trust me, they will go through the history and see what was being reverted and look at the talk page too. Sometimes they may not do detailed readings, but they will, in the least, glance over all the available aspects of the page (article, history, talk page). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 00:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they were up awhile ago. They should have been up about 12 hours ago. I don't know if that means you are planning on starting the revert war again. Has someone been contacted for a third opinion yet? Let me know, I'm off to bed (it's technically 12:32 am here). IMO, I would just leave it, and when the third party shows up, then make it a point to say something to them specifically. But that's my opinion. I've gone through a number of edit wars over the smallest of things to the largest of things. Sometimes you win and sometimes you don't. As far as the talk page goes, I'd just leave it alone there too. You both have cited your sides, and I think since then it's been nothing but "you're wrong" on both ends, and the "this is why I'm right". Not trying to say anything bad, but that's basically what it boils down to. You both understand that it's your opinions and they differ from each other, but I don't think anything constructive is going to come from the talk page until you get some outside views. There's no real point bantering back and forth between each other. I would step back (ignore any future comments about the subject with Viri) and work on other parts of the page. I would work at getting the page to GA status, and worry about the Shantih thing later. It's such a small piece of the puzzle, that I'd focus on the edges first and apply that finishing touch last. I think that after you help to get the article to GA status that you could simply go, "ok, now since it's been awhile, I'd like to address the addition of the 'Shantih' quote at the end of the film". But that's just me, and you can handle it however you want to, just don't let the rest of the article suffer (and I'm not putting any blame on you, just in case you might be thinking that). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 05:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I have to admit that I was sorely tempted to add it again, as whoever shows up to edit it will look at the past history, and (subsequent edits having pushed it down the history list) see that the version with the Shantih was 'stale', and simply shrug at my concerns. I still have that concern. I am inclined to add it once more, but not keep going backand forth, just to keep it current for when independent editorship shows up. I think offering to add it after the GA status is confirmed would be too late, as the issue of 'well, we got here without adding that, so why bother now?' I feel the article suffers without it. Since you and I have gone around and around before, and have found some middle peace (at least least, I hope we have), maybe I should ask what you think about the points made. Do you think it belongs?</dd>
<dd>As for the independent views, Erik sent posts to the filmmaker and Hal Raglan (I would have added the wikilinks to their talk pages if i could find them; I think I somehow must have screwed up my archive, as the conversations placed in there are no longer there...)</dd>
<dd>I do think you are right about Viriditas issue, though - nothing constructive is going to come from trying to reason with him. Nothing short of a 3rr block is going to remind him of WP:OWN. I will work on that and other issues and avoid his commentary. His behavior will cause him to self-destruct eventually. It's too bad, though; he otherwise has interesting things to add.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 06:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(heh - found it. Renamed an archive by accident, and simply reverted it. the independents Erik sought were: <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a>.)
<dl>
<dd>It won't be too late if you reach GA status with the article. One thing that both GA and FA articles have, is a little note that says "if you can improve this article further, please do so." Even FA articles are not perfect. As far as my opinion on the word goes, I haven't seen the film (not really the kind I go to the theater for, something I usually wait for cable), and I've never read "The Wastelands"....well I have, but it wasn't T.S. Eliot, it was Stephen King. The only poet I read is Poe. But, I noticed it's already in the "Themes" section, so it isn't like it's been removed from the page entirely. Or did you add that to the Themes section just recently, and Viri hasn't reverted it yet? Since I haven't seen or read the two works involved, I can't make an opinion on something so subjective. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 12:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Erik, I would prefer if <i>you</i> reverted yourself. I would not like to revert two editors in as many days, and as you previously said you had wanted to stay neutral in this matter, this leaves it to Viriditas to evaluate the new, unreverted edit. Maybe Viriditas may find that which upset him about the entry gone now. He might still have a problem with it, but I did try a different, more thoughtful edit, using a better source for the word that might be unfamiliar to the Western ear and tying it better to dialogue between the major characters (Jasper having said in the movie, and Miriam in passing), making the statements not so anachronistic. So with you reverting it back, it gives Viriditas an ooportunity to see the changes with fresh eyes. I may be giving him too much credit, but I am going to err on the side that he is better, andnot smaller than he has come across.</dd>
<dd>I have been contributing more to the piece, Erik. That this piece sticks out is unfortunate, but misleading as it overshadows the smaller edits I have done. Good luck on exams.

<p>He doesn't like that I've reverted him when he tries to claim that "Clark" has flown, and that "hovering" isn't an ability, nor an established power. The reason I've removed those things is because of their minor attribution, and that we can't detail every grain of salt from the show. Other times people have confused him jumping with him flying (i.e. like in Reckoning, or Mortal). I was going to leave it removed (even though I think it adds depth to the fact that they haven't really violated their No Flight rule), since that would end the argument with Fred, but since someone else agrees it should be there then I stand by that. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 20:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Him, and another user (called Researcher) whom I believe are probably the same person, believe that him jumping to catch the rocket was in fact flying (though the act of gravity on his jump says otherwise), and when he picked up Lana in Reckoning, that he was in fact flying to the top of the cliff. It's interpretations I guess, and some people get really giddy when they see him jump extremely high (like in the recent "Crimson" episode). My immediate reaction is usually, "oh great, now I have to defend against all the new 'yes he has flown' additions when they see him make a new jump." <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 20:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, WP takes all kinds. I think it would be nice if Gough or Millar just came out and clearly stated what I have alluded to (the metaphorical fear of flying) and stifle all the flying misinterpretations. I mean, the series can't really have all that much more in the way of steam - Clark needs to be able to distance himself from the non-bespectacled Clark so as to not be recognized when he finally goes Big Blue. The guys are slowly painting themselves into a corner, I think.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 20:39, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>and count me in on defending the non-flying thing if it comes up again. A question: how do you spot a sock-puppet, as you've suggested that Researcher is?<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 20:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, Gough and Millar, while addressing questions, have stated that when Clark does go to finish his training it will probably lead to years of solitude (e.g. Superman the movie), which would distance him from people like Lex. I mean, when you are 21 years old, and you see someone after 10 years (just a number) and you have glasses and are slouching all about (plus that nice little thing of "suspension of disbelief"). Anyway, to identify a sock the best resource is to look at their contributions. Researcher hasn't edited in a bit, and he was just created. The reason I suspect him as being Fred is because Fred came by right after I notified Researcher of Clark's lack of flying. Fred made the same edits. If there is a clear connection (which this wouldn't be the case) then you can report him on the sock puppet notice boards. As a last resort, if you think someone is a sock, but cannot prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt just by their contributions, then you can do a "user check" request. There is a page for that where (I think they are Admins) people will run the IP addresses (I think, could be more complicated than that) on each user to identify them. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 20:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see, but I know for a fact that IP addresses can be faked or spoofed (been a victim of someone pretending to be me via IP address a few years ago). As well, to through off IP sniffers, can't they just go to a few different public terminals, like universities and net cafés? It all seems more of a gut hunch sort of method...<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 20:54, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If they are registered, then I think they track every IP that account logs into. I know that when I was busted on a 3RR violation, that I was blocked at every terminal that I logged into my account from (I mean the IP's were blocked), even my work one which is a state sever. But, I'm not entirely sure how they identify the user, I think the page explains it but I can't recall the exact name of it. Erik might know if you are interested, or you could ask an Admin if it ever comes to that. Usually try and follow the contributions, and when you post on a Sock noticeboard the Admins doing the blocking will review and verifiy if it's legitimate. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 21:01, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You were nabbed for 3RR? Well, now I don't feel so bad about having screwed up with my own 3RR.

<dl>
<dd>I've been nabbed a couple times for 3RR. When you get into heated arguments about things, it's easy to forget to pay attention to how many times you revert. I've even had contraversial blocks where some of the Admins disagreed with my blocking, because of the history behind the reverts, but to be fair I had to be blocked along with the other individual. There was one where an editor refused to discuss it on the talk page, but just kept reverting. He wouldn't acknowledge even personal talk page comments. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 21:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Aaah...you said "main" page and I thought you meant <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28TV_series%29_b037.html" title="Smallville (TV series)">Smallville (TV series)</a>, not <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Smallville_episodes_be88.html" title="List of Smallville episodes">List of Smallville episodes</a>. Well, that's an interesting observation. One of the users there, well some of the users, but one in particular (<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a>, believes that every episode should have it's own page and that the season pages should be deleted. It's his contention that the "List of" page is better, even though the WikiProject Television article says that you should start with a main page (TVseries) and then branch off into sub pages, like seasonal pages OR list pages, and the very last thing to do is create an episode page and that is only when you have all the information to support it as an article which doesn't include fancruft like quotes and lists of music to "fluff" the page up. He's gone out of his way to create individual episode pages and try to redirect the season pages. When he couldn't do that he tried to "fluff" the season pages with nonsense and then add a tag saying they were "too large" at 31kb. The hypocrisy is that the "List of Smallville episodes" is something like 70kb, which is grounds for immediately division of the page. I noticed that he started redirecting the titles to the individual episode pages, and I wasn't in the mood to fight him on it. They really need to be put on AfD. An individual episode page should look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman_%28TV_series%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman_%28TV_series%29" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but I guarantee you that none of them do.

<p>Well, the Dr. Who series does a pretty bang-up job of that. From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_who" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_who" rel="nofollow">series</a> to the list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials" rel="nofollow">episodes and serials</a> (each season is called a series in the UK and France) in that article, the viewer can go to the page and click on specific episodes say, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek_%28Doctor_Who_episode%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek_%28Doctor_Who_episode%29" rel="nofollow">this</a> one or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shakespeare_Code" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shakespeare_Code" rel="nofollow">this</a> one. However, I think that this is the best example of episodic treatment of a series that i have seen thus far on WP. Then again, there are three or four generations of dedicated Dr. Who fans on two continents to work on it.

<dd>The plot on the first episode is way too long, it's longer than most film plots. Other than that it has some good information. Some of it seems to be fannish, but the majority is good for "out of universe" things that are needed. List wise <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Simpsons_episodes_695c.html" title="List of The Simpsons episodes">List of The Simpsons episodes</a> is actually featured. I think the problem with the Smallville List is that Peregrine as the others basically want it to have plots and stuff that are mini, and then have each episode have an expanded plot that is much too large for an encyclopedia. He was told by several editors to not make episode pages if he couldn't find the out of universe information to support them, but he didn't really listen. If you go through the first season on that list page, those eps are pretty bad as far as encyclopedic information goes. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 19:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I had another one, but it was a bit long and I just wanted to keep it simple (since it was vandalism). It was along the same lines just a little more detailed about the jealousy. I think we really need to find some sources for those allusions and definitely for the Chris Reeve appearance. The appearance is like the ultimate slap in the face allusion for the show, and we should definitely include it.

<p>Answers.com has not "answers", they literally take exactly what's on Wikipedia. I'll do dozens of searches for any number of topics, and I always get at least 1 "Answers.com" source, and it's the Wikipedia article. If you look, all the images will be in the same place as the WP article. I think I mentioned that to you once before with a source you provide for that rifle. Never use Answers.com, even if they aren't photocopying WP, you would need to go to who they do cite as their source. Now, they don't "steal" per say from WP, because they tell you where they get their info, and it isn't hard to recognize a WP page when you see one, as you did with Guy Gardner. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 05:56, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Storm article is very well-written, and seems like a very good example to use. Most of my comic book familiarity completely capped off once I went into the military, after college. So I missedmost of the Crisis on Infinite Earths stuff (DC's way of retconning their entire universe into a more manageable thing,and to make the characters within them more approachable and less iconic). I certainly don't have all the comic books.</dd>
<dd>That being said, I can probably find the actual individual issues online. There seems to be a thriving community of folk trading e-comics. I am unsure as to the format for utilization. I will look at the Storm images, to see how they are licensed. That's rather why I thought our partnership would work well here. I know or can find the comics, and have some familiarity, but you know the rules and procedures a lot better than I (though I am learning). It's the same thing with the Nancy Reagan article.

<p>Not sure what you want me to observe specifically, but "children" is mentioned as prominent by the reviewer. That would tie into <a href="http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1367622006" class="external text" title="http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1367622006" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which says: "Cuarón, who is 44 and has three children, says it is no accident that young people have been central to his work, in films such as A Little Princess, Y Tu Mama Tambien and Harry Potter, because children are very 'important in my own notions of hope. And Children of Men is a film about hope'." Seems like something to explore for the Themes section, you could combine it with the "Shantih" paragraph, as it's sort of about the thematic ending. Hope you're not trying to make a new case for inclusion in the Plot section, dude.&#160;:-P —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 15:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>LOL! I think Viri would have a stroke. No, even though the statement from there:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>At one point in Children of Men, Miriam comments how the voices of children are what keep the world from tipping into self-destruction. That sentiment is borne out precisely and perfectly in Cuarón's final scenes.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>implies that the end part where the children are laughing (and therefore the Shantih) are actually considered scenes, something more concrete would be needed to warrant revisiting that particular subject. Actually, I was thinking about how to tie Jasper's statements of the Shantih as well as his comments regarding how Kee's baby was the miracle the world was waiting for' into the thematic statements surrounding the meaning of the Shantih. I think it would be hard to avoid OR.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 15:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, even if it qualifies as a scene, it's not a "plot driver" in any sense. It's a "theme driver" and could definitely be developed in the Themes section. Additionally, you should try to find some reference referring to Jasper saying "Shantih" and "the miracle the world was waiting for" to avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. There's a lot of visible themes in the film, but citation's needed to make it verifiable. Viriditas has a lot of thematic ideas up the wazoo, and I'm sure he's trying to back all of it (such as adding the Nativity reference recently). Can't imagine what could be said in the DVD commentary. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 15:57, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I think it is going to be hard to find the Jasper statements (even though it is in YouTube - which is a pretty crappy source; it has an ending scene from CoM which is completely inaccurate), as it is to verify many of the plot points. I've noticed some of Viri's more....unorthodox thematic ideas, like the "mythic thunderbolt of fertility." I am sorry, man - that still makes me laugh. When he first put it out there, I was sure he was goofing off. It will certainly be interesting to see how he cites the stuff while avoiding OR. I don't think I'd be out of line making sure citations for such stuff be of the online, easily verifiable sort. He's certainly an odd bird, he is.

<dl>
<dd>Well, with all the cross-references the director threw in (<i>Animals</i>, for god's sake), I wouldn't be surprised by how many easter eggs were in it. Also, for citations being online or not, it's not always possible to find a link. Books are referenced, but these books are highly unlikely to be available online (if they are, probably copyright violations). Of course an attempt should be made to fetch a link, but sometimes these things are subscription-only or just aren't online (especially older sources). I haven't seen the film, so I'll probably have to check it out on DVD. It's not so bad to work on the film article without having seen it, though. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 16:16, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think a lot of the referencing of books is going to tie directly to the Wastelands stuff exclusively, which is good, considering all the online content for it that is already onle. I can dig the use of scholarly works for literature or more static subjects, but current film doesn't really seem to apply. Not even <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, which is sort of 1984 1/2. Also, one of the guidelines of the Manual of Style <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> specifically says to avoid Sites Requiring Registration (including paid membership sites). I think that applies much more in the case of an FA article, something that has to stand the test of time for stability.

<dd>Point taken. It is kinda frustrating that advice - even when offered by you - is simply ignored, still warrants better treatment than someone who owns up to mistakes when he makes them, and apologizes publicly for them as well (in the interst of proviiding a better working environment). I know you aren't playing favorites or anything, but his comments are not designed to be helpful, and haven't for awhile now. Look back over his edit history.

<dd>I don't disagree with you. He's not a team player, as I know from our collaboration (or lack there of) on <i>The Fountain</i>. He produces good results, but his cooperation with other editors leaves a lot to be desired. Don't take personal offense at the stuff he says; he's not really scoring any points with anyone in the long run. Just remember to be curt with your responses; don't fight back, just ask if he could desist speaking in a certain manner and ask him to provide constructive criticism (as you did in a recent comment, I noticed, keep that up). —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 21:30, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I know I had brought this citation to you in the first place, but in reviewing it, I realize I was reading it in a different way. He's not talking about how he used children to convey the message of hope; it's the other way around. His children help him convey the message of hope. Read it again with that in mind: "Cuarón, who is 44 and has three children, says it is no accident that young people have been central to his work, in films such as A Little Princess, Y Tu Mama Tambien and Harry Potter, because children are very important in my own notions of hope. And Children of Men is a film about hope." —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 22:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wouldn't that statement be saying that because CoM is a film about hope that it is about Children? I don't think he's talking about <i>his</i> children; that was an observation by the interviewer. It was not him saying, 'I am 33 and have three children, and they are important to my notions of hope.'He was instead saying that children - as a plural noun and as a concept - are important to his notions of what hope is, and what sustains it. This is clarified as he later in the article describes how "the prospective baby offers a small ray of hope for a new beginning."</dd>
<dd>It is accurate to describe him as using children to convey his message of hope. Otherwise, the sounds of children laughing and playing are idiosyncratic, and the insertion of the Shantih in accordance with those sounds are even more distanced from the point of the film. While I have come around somewhat to the idea that the laughter of children and the Shantih are not parts of the plot, they are without a shadow of a doubt a manipulation by the director towards an end. If not to give the audience hope, then what?<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 22:44, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thought I would also add that the statement by Miriam about children is not in the book, so it is specific to the movie. When we consider that this closely mirrors Cuaron's own views on children, and that he was heavily involved in the screenplay/script, there is further motive for using children as thematic pyschopomp of hope.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 22:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know, I don't deny that there isn't a theme of children in the film. That's most obvious with the whole story arc with Kee's child. You're right, it's not <i>his</i> children, but the citation still says it's children in general that convey hope for him, and he produces that hope in the film. I don't think it belongs with the examples of children-related thematic examples. If he had went on to say that he did this and that to emphasize children as a vessel of hope, then it would work as a transition to the rest of the passage. I think that the construction of the two barely-separated notions is borderline OR, and I concur with Viriditas on the lack of meshing. If there was another interview in which the director emphasizes direct application of the children theme, that would work better. It's just too much, "Oh, oh, this is what he means," to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">originally</a> clarify this vagueness with follow-up specifications. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 23:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, while it may borderline OR, I think that it is on the correct side of it. We cannot afford to submit an article for FA evaluation that sidesteps completely the thematic elements described above. Maybe you could ask Raglan or the Filmmaker what they think.</dd>
<dd>I am sure you have noticed by now that since he isn't getting his way, he's tried adding the OR tag to the article, to express his displeasure with all of us for being too stupid to follow his blueprint for the article. I know it was unfair to bring up in the Discussion area the accusation of WP:OWN, but I am not at all sure it was an inaccurate application of the term. His comment history for CoM and resistance to any change (and I am not talking about just mine) has been higher than anything else he has edited over the past 3 years. I know he contributes good stuff, but it looks like he is far too close to this for an objective handling of the matter.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 23:30, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that the key reason for not having the "Shantih" phrase in the Plot section was its thematic nature, which was not suitable for the straightforward description of the film's storyline. I think the redundancy reasoning was invoked before when you had persisted on including the "Shantih" phrase and we said, "It's already mentioned in the Themes section, what's the big deal?" I'm not trying to be ambivalent here; there is always some redundancy to be encountered. If a key plot point mentioned in the Plot section also has some thematic weight, then I think the redundancy is acceptable so the reader can get all his/her information in that one passage. I admit, I didn't look at the reference for the song; I only removed the Nazi concentration camp mention because it seemed like an extended observation, which constitutes OR. Let me review the song reference again. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 18:12, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've revised the song reference because the reviewer was not observing the bus's entry to the camp, but instead the stripping/beating that was encountered by the main characters. Hope my reasoning on the redundancy makes sense; the primary reason that the "Shantih" phrase wasn't included is that it's simply not a plot driver. It's insignificant in terms of the overall plot, but it's a definite thematic driver. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 18:17, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate your request for me to remain with the article, but I must respectfully decline. What I enjoy about Wikipedia are two things: increasing my personal knowledge of films, especially upcoming ones, as a hobby, and to be able to present that same knowledge for an audience. However, I don't care to present that knowledge if it means dealing with a difficult environment. It's not worth the time or energy. I would rather build up articles on my own or in a cooperative manner with editors who are respectful and helpful to each other. I have other film articles in mind, articles to bring to life with in-depth information, and I want to do that without running into hostility. You can still ask questions of me, but I request that none of them be based on the circumstances at <i>Children of Men</i>. If you plan to get involved with any other film articles, I would gladly assist you in improving them. I'm happy that you've learned from me, and I hope you continue to do so. Let me know if there's anything you need. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 03:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arcayne, I do not feel you were in any way attacking me, and I also think Viriditas was somewhat rash in suggesting that you were. (We will have to agree to disagree, however, about his merit as an editor.) That said, there are only so many times that I will repeat myself, especially when it comes to guidelines and OR. You believe you're correct, I believe I'm correct; there's nowhere to go at the moment. I don't wish to remove myself from the discussion completely, but I do need to step away. I do urge you, again, to rethink your suggested thematic elements. Perhaps bring it to the attention of the Film WP and see what they think about its place in the article. <span style="font-family: verdana"><a href="../../../y/l/l/User%7EYllosubmarine_e632.html" title="User:Yllosubmarine">María</a>: <small>(<a href="../../../y/l/l/User_talk%7EYllosubmarine_57e8.html" title="User talk:Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">habla</span></a> ~ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yllosubmarine_42d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">cosas</span></a>)</small></span> 21:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
