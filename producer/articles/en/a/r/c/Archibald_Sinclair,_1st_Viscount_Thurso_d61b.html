<p>Sinclair was the son of a Scottish father and an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> mother. Educated at <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandhurst.html" title="Sandhurst">Sandhurst</a>, he was commissioned into the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_Guards_ca91.html" title="Life Guards">Life Guards</a> in 1910. He served on the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_b785.html" title="Western Front">Western Front</a> during the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> and rose to the rank of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> in the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guards_Machine_Gun_Regiment_152d.html" title="Guards Machine Gun Regiment">Guards Machine Gun Regiment</a>. He served as <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-in-command.html" title="Second-in-command">second-in-command</a> to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> when Churchill commanded the 6th Battalion of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Scots_Fusiliers_33ac.html" title="Royal Scots Fusiliers">Royal Scots Fusiliers</a> in the <a href="../../../p/l/o/Ploegsteert_Wood_b6b2.html" title="Ploegsteert Wood">Ploegsteert Wood</a> sector of the Western Front in 1915, Churchill having been disgraced after <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli.html" title="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>. They formed a lasting friendship that would become a significant political alliance in later decades. From 1919 to 1921 he served as Personal Military Secretary to Churchill when he returned to the Cabinet as <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_War_aa73.html" title="Secretary of State for War">Secretary of State for War</a>, then accompanied him to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies_b265.html" title="Secretary of State for the Colonies">Colonial Office</a> as Private Secretary.</p>
<p>In 1922 he entered the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> as a Liberal <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caithness_and_Sutherland_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_390c.html" title="Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)">Caithness and Sutherland</a>, supporting <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lloyd_George_0b0a.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a> and defeating the incumbent Liberal supporter of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Henry_Asquith_45f9.html" title="Herbert Henry Asquith">Herbert Henry Asquith</a>. His constituency was the largest, in terms of area, in the United Kingdom. He rose through the Liberal ranks as the party shrank in Parliament, becoming <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Whip_596c.html" title="Chief Whip">Chief Whip</a> by 1930. In 1931 the Liberal Party joined the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_National_Government_c29e.html" title="UK National Government">National Government</a> of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsay_MacDonald_9a2f.html" title="Ramsay MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> and Sinclair held the post of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland_682d.html" title="Secretary of State for Scotland">Secretary of State for Scotland</a>. The following year he, together with other Liberal ministers, resigned from the government in protest at the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Conference_27cc.html" title="Ottawa Conference">Ottawa Conference</a> introducing a series of tariff agreements. Sinclair and the Liberal leader, Sir <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Samuel_9ad2.html" title="Herbert Samuel">Herbert Samuel</a>, were thus the last Liberal politicians to sit in the Cabinet.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1935_99c6.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1935">1935 general election</a>, Samuel lost his seat. Sinclair became the party's leader at the head of only twenty MPs. With the party now clearly marginalised as a third party on the fringe, with few distinct domestic policies, with a parliamentary party that was primarily a collection of individuals elected as much for themselves as for their party, and with the separate <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_5e8e.html" title="National Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Nationals</a> offering competition amongst Liberal inclined voters, Sinclair fought to make the Liberals once more a relevant force in British politics, taking up the issues of opposition to the continental dictatorships and working worked closely with <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> who was a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backbencher.html" title="Backbencher">backbencher</a> at that time and generally shunned by his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>. When Churchill formed an all-party coalition government in 1940, Sinclair became <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Air_8e49.html" title="Secretary of State for Air">Secretary of State for Air</a>. However he did not sit in the small <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Cabinet_4643.html" title="War Cabinet">War Cabinet</a>, though he was invited to attend meetings discussing any political matter. As Secretary for Air, he played a leading role in planning the firebombing and destruction of <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dresden.html" title="Dresden">Dresden</a>. He remained a minister until May 1945 when the coalition ended. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">1945 general election</a>, he narrowly lost his seat. His margin of defeat is one of the tightest on record - he came third, even though the victor had only 59 votes more than him.</p>
<p>There was speculation that he might return to the Commons and the leadership, as the Conservative victor in his seat had promised to only serve in parliament until the end of war with Japan, a pledge he kept modifying to serving just one more year, every year. Sinclair awaited the imminent by-election, which never materialised. At the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1950_5ee5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1950">1950 general election</a> Sinclair again stood for his old seat and moved to second place, but in yet another close election, he was 269 votes away from victory. In 1952 he accepted elevation to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> as <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount_Thurso_6980.html" title="Viscount Thurso">Viscount Thurso</a>. He was expected to take up the leadership of the Liberal group in the House of Lords, but a series of strokes in the mid-fifties left him in a state of precarious health until his death in 1970.</p>
<p>Sinclair married Marigold Forbes in 1918. They had four children: Catherine (born 1919), Elizabeth (born 1921), Robin (born 1922), and Angus (born 1925). Sinclair was one of the largest landowners in the United Kingdom, owning an estate of about 100,000 <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">acres</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caithness.html" title="Caithness">Caithness</a>. He was handsome and charming and regarded as a daredevil, but in private life was rather shy, reserved and antisocial, with a slight <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_impediment.html" title="Speech impediment">speech impediment</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, his grandson, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sinclair%2C_3rd_Viscount_Thurso_555f.html" title="John Sinclair, 3rd Viscount Thurso">John Thurso</a>, entered politics and now sits as a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_8c75.html" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> MP for his grandfather's seat, now called <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caithness%2C_Sutherland_and_Easter_Ross_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_7fb3.html" title="Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (UK Parliament constituency)">Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross</a>. Sinclair's granddaughter, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veronica_Linklater_f2c9.html" title="Veronica Linklater">Veronica Linklater, Baroness Linklater of Butterstone</a>, is also a Liberal Democrat politician.</p>
