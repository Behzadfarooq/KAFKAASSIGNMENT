<p>The Archdiocese owes its foundation to <a href="../../../j/o/g/Jogaila.html" title="Jogaila">Jogaila</a>, who Christened <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> in <a href="../../../1/3/8/1387.html" title="1387">1387</a> and sent Dobrogost, Bishop of <a href="../../../p/o/z/Pozna%C5%84.html" title="Poznań">Poznań</a> as ambassador to the Pope <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_VI_8bf2.html" title="Urban VI">Urban VI</a> with a petition for the erection of an episcopal see at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> and the appointment of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrzej_Wasilko_4f56.html" title="Andrzej Wasilko">Andrzej Wasilko</a> (former Bishop of <a href="../../../s/i/r/Siret.html" title="Siret">Siret</a> and confessor of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_of_Poland_dc3f.html" title="Elisabeth of Poland">Elisabeth of Hungary</a>) to fill it. This was granted and the foundation of a collegiate church of ten canons authorized. Under Wasilko's rule, the churches of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John_6591.html" title="St. John">St. John</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Martin_8a8b.html" title="St. Martin">St. Martin</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Anne_ed16.html" title="St. Anne">St. Anne</a> were erected in Vilnius. Upon Wasilko's death in 1398, he was succeeded by a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>, Jakub Plichta (1398-1407), in whose time the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_Cathedral_6711.html" title="Vilnius Cathedral">Cathedral</a> perished in fire. Among his successors were: Piotr Krakowczyk of Kustynia (1414-21), whom <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_V_1743.html" title="Martin V">Martin V</a> invested with full powers to bring back the Orthodox of Lithuania to the Catholic Church; Matthias of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trakai.html" title="Trakai">Trakai</a> (1421-53), a Lithuanian, who sent representatives to the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Florence_81b1.html" title="Council of Florence">Council of Basel</a> and set up the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> to combat the <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hussites.html" title="Hussites">Hussites</a>, founded many churches and strenuously defended the rights and privileges of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanians.html" title="Lithuanians">Lithuanians</a>. Under Jan Łosowicz (1467-81) many <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenians.html" title="Ruthenians">Ruthenians</a> were converted to Catholicism and the Franciscan <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernardine.html" title="Bernardine">Bernardines</a> were established at Vilnius. Albert Tabor, a Lithuanian, invited the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominicans.html" title="Dominicans">Dominicans</a> to Vilnius and entrusted to them the Church of the Holy Spirit; Albert Radziwiłł (1508-19) died in the odour of sanctity; John the Lithuanian (1519-37) held the first diocesan synod at Vilnius in 1526; Prince <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawe%C5%82_Holsza%C5%84ski_4549.html" title="Paweł Holszański">Paweł Holszański</a> (1534-55) restored his cathedral in the Gothic style and held a synod in 1555; Walerian Protasewicz Suszkowski (1556-80) had to contend for the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a> of the clergy and the use of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> in the Liturgy; he brought the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuits.html" title="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>, among whom was <a href="../../../p/i/o/Piotr_Skarga_e377.html" title="Piotr Skarga">Piotr Skarga</a>, to Vilnius.</p>

The chapter then entrusted the administration of the diocese to the suffragan bishop, Ciprian. At his death in 1594, the clergy were divided into factions on the choice of a successor, until <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigismund_III_b9d6.html" title="Sigismund III">Sigismund III</a> nominated Benedict Wolna (1600-15), who exerted himself efficaciously for the canonization of King <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Casimir_b0d9.html" title="Saint Casimir">Saint Casimir</a> Jagiellon, in whose honour the first stone of a church was laid it Vilnius in 1604. He succeeded in his efforts to have St. Casimir regarded as <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patron_saint.html" title="Patron saint">patron saint</a> of Lithuania. His successor, Eustachius Wollowicz (1616-1630), founded hospitals, invited the Canons Regular of the Lateran to Vilnius, and energetically combated the Protestants and the Orthodox. <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Woyna_795e.html" title="Abraham Woyna">Abraham Woyna</a> (1631-49) introduced the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brothers_Hospitallers_of_St._John_of_God_31a2.html" title="Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God">Fatebene Brethren</a> and strenuously opposed <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>. George Tyszkiewicz (1650-1656) annexed the whole of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courland.html" title="Courland">Courland</a> to his diocese.

Constantius Casimir Brzostowski (1687-1722) brought the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piarists.html" title="Piarists">Piarists</a> to Vilnius and encouraged the development of the religious orders. In the episcopate of Michael Zienkowicz (1730-1762), conflicts between the Jesuits and the Piarists arose, resulting in the closing of Piarist schools.

<p>After the annexation of Lithuania by the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>, the Diocese of Vilna no longer enjoyed freedom of relations with the Holy See. In 1795 the chapter nominated David Pilchowski vicar in spiritualibus. <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livonia.html" title="Livonia">Livonia</a> was added to the diocese, and John Nepomucene Kossakowski (1798-1808) was appointed bishop. He did much for the prosperity of the seminary. After his death the chapter became involved in a conflict with Siestrzencewicz, the Catholic Metropolitan of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, who usurped rights exclusively belonging to the Holy See. Siestrzencewicz forced upon the chapter, as administrator of the diocese, Geronimo Strojonowski (1808-15), upon whose death he arrogated to himself the government of the diocese with the title of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_%28religion%29.html" title="Primate (religion)">primate</a> of Lithuania.</p>
<p>In 1827, after Siestrzencewicz's death, the vicar capitular, Milucki, ruled the diocese for a short time. In 1828 Andreas Klagiewicz was appointed administrator; he was sent to the interior of Russia during the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_Uprising_49a4.html" title="November Uprising">Insurrection of 1831</a>, returned in 1832, was preconized Bishop of Vilnius in 1839 and took possession of the see on 28 June, 1841. He died the same year, after witnessing the ruin of the <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenian_Uniat_Church_8be7.html" title="Ruthenian Uniat Church">Ruthenian Uniat Church</a> in his diocese and a most ferocious persecution of Catholicism. The chapter elected John Cywinski as vicar suffragan; he had the grief of seeing the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Vilnius_802c.html" title="University of Vilnius">University of Vilnius</a> closed, the clergy and churches of his diocese completely despoiled of their property, and died on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">17 November</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>. In 1848 he was succeeded by Wenceslaus Zylinski, who was transferred in 1856 to the metropolitan see of <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohilev.html" title="Mohilev">Mohilev</a>, but continued to govern his former diocese until 1858.</p>
<p>Adam Stanislaus Krasinski was expelled from the diocese in consequence of the <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_Uprising_d8bc.html" title="January Uprising">Insurrection of 1863</a>, but nevertheless continued to govern the diocese until 1883, when he withdrew to <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracow.html" title="Cracow">Cracow</a>. His successor, Charles Hrynieweki, was exiled to <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaroslav.html" title="Jaroslav">Jaroslav</a> after two years of the episcopate, and in 1890 abdicated and withdrew to <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galicia_%28Central_Europe%29_3dcc.html" title="Galicia (Central Europe)">Galicia</a>. During his exile Ludovic Zdanowicz governed the diocese as vicar patriarchal. In 1890 Anthony Francis Audziewicz, a canon of Saint Petersburg and a learned theologian, was appointed Bishop of Vilnius. He died in 1895; the diocese was then governed by Louis Zdanowicz, <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_Bishop_d6ee.html" title="Titular Bishop">titular Bishop</a> of <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysias.html" title="Dionysias">Dionysias</a>. In 1897 Canon Stephen Alexander Zwerowicz succeeded, and was transferred in 1902 to the See of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandomir.html" title="Sandomir">Sandomir</a>. His place was taken by Baron Edward Ropp, who set about organizing the Catholic movement in the diocese, thereby incurring the hostility of the Russian Government. Bishop Ropp having been banished to <a href="../../../p/s/k/Pskov.html" title="Pskov">Pskov</a>, the diocese was entrusted to Casimir Nicholas Michalkiewicz as <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrator_Apostolic_ef36.html" title="Administrator Apostolic">administrator Apostolic</a>.</p>
<p>The bishops of Vilnius, presiding over a vast diocese and being <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senator.html" title="Senator">senators</a> of Lithuania, could not give all their attention to the spiritual necessities of their flock; hence, from the fifteenth centuries they had <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coadjutor.html" title="Coadjutor">coadjutors</a> or suffragans. Many of these, particularly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were titular bishops of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methone.html" title="Methone">Methone</a> (on the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesus.html" title="Peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</a>). Among the most famous may be mentioned George Casimir Ancuta (d. 1737, author of "Jus plenum religionis catholicae in regno Poloniaw", showing that the Protestants and Orthodox had not the same rights as the Catholics. Beginning from the seventeenth century there were also suffragans for <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>. In 1798 <a href="../../../p/i/u/Pius_VI_86c6.html" title="Pius VI">Pius VI</a> recognized the ancient See of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brest-Litovsk_943e.html" title="Brest-Litovsk">Brest-Litovsk</a> as suffragan of Vilnius. So also the ancient Diocese of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livonia.html" title="Livonia">Livonia</a>, suppressed in 1797, had become suffragan to Vilnius, and in 1798 had for its first bishop Adam Kossiafkowski (died 1828) but in 1848 was annexed to the Diocese of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samogitia.html" title="Samogitia">Samogitia</a> (in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania_proper.html" title="Lithuania proper">Lithuania proper</a>) or see of <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kaunas.html" title="Kaunas">Kaunas</a>.</p>
<p>The flourishing Catholic life of the Diocese of Vilnius is attested by the large number of <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synod.html" title="Synod">synods</a> held there. The first of these was in 1502, under Bishop Tabor. Then followed the synods of 1526, for the reform of manners and the organization of the parochial schools; of 1528, to collect funds for the restoration of the cathedral; of 1555, to oppose the spread of <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheranism.html" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>; of 1582; of 1607, which made many regulations for the administration of the sacraments and the discipline of the clergy; of 1630, regulating the administration of ecclesiastical property; of 1654, to aid the state with new imposts; of 1669 with its disciplinary regulations; of 1685, with ordinances relating to the administration of the sacraments and the life of the clergy; of 1744, with regulations in regard to the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catechism.html" title="Catechism">catechism</a>, mixed marriages and spiritual exercises. After the synod of 1744, under Bishop Michael Zienkowicz, no others were held, but the bishops addressed to their clergy pastoral letters, some of them of notable import.</p>
<p>The diocese possesses splendid churches and venerable sanctuaries. Of the former the largest and most beautiful are at Vilnius, although many, violently wrested from the Catholics, became Russian Orthodox churches. The cathedral, dedicated to the Blessed Trinity, St. Stanislaus and St. Wladislaus, was erected in virtue of a <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Bull_98d9.html" title="Papal Bull">Papal Bull</a> of 12 March, 1387. Burned down in 1399, it was rebuilt in the Gothic style in 1399 by Grand Duke <a href="../../../v/y/t/Vytautas.html" title="Vytautas">Vytautas</a>; again destroyed in 1531 and 1662, its restoration was begun in 1769 and finished in 1801. It contains splendid chapels, especially those of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Casimir_b978.html" title="St. Casimir">St. Casimir</a> and of the Immaculate Conception. Other important churches are those of Holy Cross, founded in the fourteenth century on the spot where, in 1366, fourteen <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscans.html" title="Franciscans">Franciscans</a> were martyred by the pagans; the Church of St. Martin, founded by <a href="../../../j/o/g/Jogaila.html" title="Jogaila">Jogaila</a> in 1380 on the ruins of an ancient pagan temple; St. Anne, founded for the Germans by Anna, the consort of <a href="../../../v/y/t/Vytautas.html" title="Vytautas">Vytautas</a>, in 1392; St. John the Evangelist, founded in 1386 and enriched with privileges by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_X_d1bb.html" title="Leo X">Leo X</a>; Corpus Domini, founded by the Archconfraternity of the Blessed Sacrament in 1573; and the Church of the Guardian Angels.</p>
<p>To these must be added the numerous churches of the religious order, which flourished in Lithuania, but of which few traces remain. The <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominicans.html" title="Dominicans">Dominicans</a>, who in the fifteenth century had a church dedicated to the Holy Spirit, built in 1679-88 another, which in 1844 was given up by them and transformed into a parish church. The <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernardines.html" title="Bernardines">Bernardines</a> undertook at Vilnius, in 1469, the construction of a wooden church, rebuilt in stone in 1500; it was burnt down in 1794 and restored in 1900; this order was forced to leave the diocese in 1864. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul was given to the Lateran Canons in 1638; they abandoned it in 1864. St. Casimir, with the annexed Jesuit college, founded in 1604, was turned into an Orthodox church in 1832. St. Ignatius Loyola, founded by the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuits.html" title="Jesuits">Jesuits</a> in 1622, became the club of the officials. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmelite.html" title="Carmelite">Carmelite</a> Church of St. Teresa has a miraculous image of the Madonna. The <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustinians.html" title="Augustinians">Augustinians</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarians.html" title="Trinitarians">Trinitarians</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigittines.html" title="Brigittines">Brigittines</a>, Carmelite Sisters, Piarists, Visitandines and others also had churches, to which must be added numerous chapels.</p>
<p>After the Polish Revolutions of 1863, the diocese saw all its religious violently expelled. The monasteries were converted into barracks, the churches given to the Orthodox or the secular clergy, the libraries dispersed, the possessions of the religious confiscated. In 1910 there remained only one monastery of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> Sisters (connected with the Church of St. Catherine at Vilnius) with six septuagenarian nuns, a Bernardine convent at Slonim with four septuagenarian nuns, a Franciscan monastery at Grodno with a single friar and in the same city a convent of Brigittine Sisters with two religious.</p>

<p>In the early 20th century the Roman Catholic diocese of Vilnius had 1,4200,000 faithful distributed among 23 rural deaneries as follows: <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bia%C5%82ystok.html" title="Białystok">Białystok</a>, 20 parishes and stations, 101,761 souls; Bielsk, 20 parishes, 66,125 souls; <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brest%2C_Belarus_4781.html" title="Brest, Belarus">Brest</a>, 3 parishes, 14212 souls; Dzisna, 15 parishes, 66,536 souls; <a href="../../../g/i/e/Giedrai%C4%8Diai.html" title="Giedraičiai">Giedraičiai</a>, 13 parishes, 58,813 souls; <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grodno.html" title="Grodno">Grodno</a>, 20 parishes, 58,116 souls; <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobryn.html" title="Kobryn">Kobryn</a>, 2 parishes, 7925 souls; <a href="../../../l/i/d/Lida.html" title="Lida">Lida</a>, 14 parishes, 65,100 souls; <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merkin%C4%97.html" title="Merkinė">Merkinė</a>, 20 parishes, 82,948 souls; Nadwilejski, 8 parishes; 41,053 souls; <a href="../../../o/s/z/Oszmiana.html" title="Oszmiana">Oszmiana</a>, 11 parishes, 61,032 souls; Prwjany, 7 parishes, 11,648 souls; Radun, 15 parishes, 83,451 souls; <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slonim.html" title="Slonim">Slonim</a>, 7 parishes; 30,337 souls; <a href="../../../s/o/k/Sokolka.html" title="Sokolka">Sokolka</a>, 14 parishes, 75,709 souls; <a href="../../../%C5%A1/v/e/%C5%A0ven%C4%8Dionys.html" title="Švenčionys">Švenčionys</a>, 19 parishes, 93,716 souls; Swir, 11 parishes, 48,266 souls; <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trakai.html" title="Trakai">Trakai</a>, 20 parishes, 88,856 souls; Vilna (city), 30 churches and chapels, 141,104 souls; Vilnius itself (district), 9 parishes, 52,690 souls; <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilejka.html" title="Vilejka">Vilejka</a>, 10 parishes, 35,783 souls; Wisniew, 15 parishes, 83,900 souls; <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolkowysk.html" title="Wolkowysk">Wolkowysk</a>, 16 parishes, 58,825 souls. Besides the cathedral parish the city of Vilnius contains those of St. John Baptist, the Holy Spirit, St Teresa, Saints Philip and James, St. Raphael the Archangel, St. Francis of Assisi, All Saints, the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. The Catholic population of the city was only 96,000 souls. Dependent upon the parish of St. Teresa is the chapel of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Ostrobrama, the centre of many pilgrimages in Lithuania, and venerated also by the Orthodox; its miraculous image stands upon an arch, and the street which passes under this arch is occupied at all hours of the day by a crowd of prostrate suppliants; anyone passing under the arch -- even Hebrews -- traditionally uncovers the head in token of reverence.</p>
<p>The secular clergy numbered about 440 priests; the cathedral chapter 5 prelates and 3 canons. The secular clergy are educated in the seminary, which has 15 professors and 160 students when founded in 1582, closed in 1862; reopened in 1872, and had but two students, but their number gradually increased. At Brest there was a petit seminaire, which was closed in 1830; the seminary at Białystok was closed in 1842. The clergy always exerted a beneficial influence upon popular education. At the beginning of the nineteenth century twenty-five parochial elementary schools were in operation at Vilnius; schools and colleges were conducted by the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuits.html" title="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniat.html" title="Uniat">Uniat</a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilians.html" title="Basilians">Basilians</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piarists.html" title="Piarists">Piarists</a> and other religious orders. The monastic libraries were centres of culture; as late as the seventeenth century there were 101 monasteries in Lithuania. The library of the Missionaries of Vilnius contained 8284 volumes; that of the Piarists, 7000; that of the Bernardines, 4142. The University of Vilnius possessed 20,000 volumes of theology, part of which were given to the Theological Academy of St. Petersburg, to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Kiev_0fa2.html" title="University of Kiev">University of Kiev</a> (Ukraine) and to the Public Library of Vilnius.</p>
<p>In consequence of the fierce persecution stirred up against Catholicism, the scientific fame of the Diocese of Vilnius became obscured; but Catholicism remained firmly rooted in the hearts of the people. Vilna was perhaps the most devout city in the Russian Empire, despite the paucity of secular clergy and the complete lack of religious orders rendering it difficult for the people to fulfil their religious duties. Yet the bitter quarrels between the Polish and Lithuanian Nationalists led to divisions in the Catholic camp. The Lithuanian clergy that in all the churches of the diocese Lithuanian shall be equally considered with Polish in religious instruction and in supplementary devotions; a portion of the Polish clergy opposed these claims but wise measures taken by the ecclesiastical authorities allayed the animosity, and opportune concessions to the Lithuanians have, at least in appearance, removed the causes of discord.</p>
