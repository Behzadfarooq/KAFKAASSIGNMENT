<p>second of all, I don't need some random person I don't even know freaking out at me. Yeah, I saw your note. But did you know that calgary's in-city population has just hit one million? did you? DIDN'T THINK SO! I live in calgary, I HEARD the news, there WAS a census. like you said, information should be accurate, and according to a recent census, your information was outdated.</p>
<p>Third of all, your page clearly states that you want people to be polite. Well, why not be polite too? Sorry that I offended you by changing it, but your data needed the change. If you saw vancouver's population record was outdated, you'd want to update it too, right? don't persecute someone who knows what they're doing, PLEASE.</p>

<p>Sup Arch, I myself am from montreal. the only reason why I removed and will continue removing Canada from articles and put postal abbreviations (only after the name of a city, I'm sure you've noticed) it's because I'm jalous of the States where its common to pinpoint a city only by giving its state and some time only its abbreviation (i.e. New Orleans, LA). we do so because most people know where is south dakota or connecticut. I strongly believe people should know that much about Canada too (I'm sure you agree). plus, Canada being a federation we should put the emphasis on the provinces, because Canada is nothing without them. call it propaganda if you want, you might be right, but i don't care, it's for my homeland sake. all the best ps if someone don't know where is Nunavut, he'll click on the link and learn, ain't that what wikipedia is all about? peace Alex</p>

<p>Actually, I thought that saying the streets are well maintained wasn't NPOV, so I removed it. I don't think lack of that statement is non NPOV, and I guess as a Calgarian your POV would be slightly less N? However, I'll let it go 'cos you are probably better informed and more experienced at this Wikipedia thing! Cheers, 88.108.51.86!</p>

<p>You are right the map is not the most attractive, but it does a couple things. It avoids the copyright problem since I drew it myself. The color was selected by <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">User:Qyd</a>. I liked the pink color better, but the light yellow is much better than his first choice of dark yellow. Qyd had uploaded a number of maps of the Alberta villages, but he used the controversial map which was canted to one side. The map is fairly accurate -- at least a lot better than some of the previous attempts.</p>
<p>As far as changing all the maps, that does take a little bit of time. Both Qyd and I have been making the chages as quickly as we can. Do you want to help? <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadillac_b884.html" title="User:Cadillac">Cadillac</a> 02:52, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually the grey-color-areas-with-white-borders are used in a lot of world maps. I uploaded census division maps with this color scheme on commons <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Locator_maps_of_census_divisions_in_Alberta" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:Locator_maps_of_census_divisions_in_Alberta">commons:Category:Locator_maps_of_census_divisions_in_Alberta</a>. Didn't use them in the en articles, I'm waiting for your opinion.

<dd>Hi Arch, I've stated my position regarding the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Image%7EAltacal.png_9f25.html" title="Image:Altacal.png">Calgarymap</a> on <a href="../../../q/y/d/User_talk%7EQyd_815e.html" title="User talk:Qyd">my talk page</a>. Your map looks great, but I prefer mine (I would especialy hate to upload all ~300 comunity locator maps again). Something intrigued me at your alberta image: the southern border is straith, and the northern one is curved; what kind of projection did you use. cheerrs. <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 01:46, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I should make it clearer: Idon't think the map is wrong, it's just that I obtain straight lines (orthographic projection) for E-W and N-S poli-lines, so I'm just curious how you get the curved lines (you're right, on a closer look the south border looks curved too). It's probably a setting in the GIS software that you use. (I'm not talking about the coordinate system and datum of the vector data; if you use statcan, that's probably WGS84 or NAD84). Can you try a grey-with-white-borders map? Thanks. <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a><a href="../../../q/y/d/User_talk%7EQyd_815e.html" title="User talk:Qyd"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:23, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>new <a href="../../../a/l/t/Image%7EAltacal.png_9f25.html" title="Image:Altacal.png">Calgary map</a> looks great.

<p>Good work, looks great (the red title bar is especially appropriate for Calgary, considering the playoffs). The example code needs a little tweaking, as it was tailored for BC (regional district vs census division, etc). how different are the parameter names form the canadian city template (ie can part of the parameteres be re-used? <a href="../../../q/y/d/User_talk%7EQyd_815e.html" title="User talk:Qyd">Qyd<sup>(talk)</sup></a>00:22, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you're an architect....BUT what I had there about the BC Hydro building was very true; it was (supposedly, according to the local nostrums) a revolutionary open-floor concept when it first went up, and did win several design awards. It was also notable for leaving its lights on all night as promotion for the province's newly-abundant hydroelectric power. Part of the controversy in transforming it into the Electra is that its original architectural concept - the then-revolutionary open-space floor design, with elevators in the centre - was to be forever changed by the introduction of the new condo-apartments' walls. True enough that your distillation of this to "modernism" fits with the <i>dicta</i> of the academic-architecture stylebook; at the time I recall it as being part of the "futurism" with which Social Creditism in BC was obssessed; although clearer examples of that are BC Place/Plaza of Nations, that ugly glo-ball thing called Science World (or whatever it's called now) and the WAC Bennett Powerhouse.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:37, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It didn't say "pleasant" simplicitur. It said "surprisingly pleasant" given its insalubrious location. The University of Regina *is* singularly lacking in the amenities referred to; it is also the reason why many people visit the city. These are not matters of point of view; nor are they particularly subjective since they are points of comparison with other places and institutions. Regina is indeed the metropole for southern Saskatchewan; it is not unknown for Reginans to hop in the car and rush off to Winnipeg or Minneapolis for a concert or to go shopping but it is Regina to which people in its hinterland normally go for such purposes; it is also the provincial capital. That is what a metropole is: perhaps you should take a look at the dictionary -- a metropole is not necessarily a metropolis; Canada really has only one of those. You should raise your points of concern before editing with such a heavy hand, for your edits *do* introduce a point of view. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 03:20, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I like several of your edits concerning Regina, to just go in and edit carte blanche what you think is a POV is not necessarily a good thing. I see you have on your wiki page that you think Vancouver is a nice place, and I see that you dont live in Regina so passing judgement on whether it is nice or not here should be left to those who know. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriesguy_f6b0.html" title="User:Friesguy">Friesguy</a> 14:41, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps as you say Regina is thought of by many by reputation as not a nice place by those who have never been here or by those that haven't been here for a decade or more, well, things have changed by leaps and bounds and that is why I believe the "surprising pleasantness" remark was put in. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriesguy_f6b0.html" title="User:Friesguy">Friesguy</a> 22:23, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am puzzled that you consider that making a comment on Fries's page constitutes going behind your back and attempting to muster a cabal of supporters for Regina's "surprising pleasantness" (in the context of its insalubrious location and invidious origins). It is a pity that you didn't make your thoughts known on the Regina discussion page before peremptorily making your draconian edits. Some of them are entirely unobjectionable but it is an onerous task to go through them one by one, keeping this and altering or deleting that. Subject to any objections here (I apologise to Friesguy who has made edits subsequent to your massive intervention) I am going to revert to the last version before your editorial slaughter. Further -- indeed, be it said, the description of Regina as being a city of "surprising pleasantness" is hardly to be criticised as civic boosterism. If anything it is praising with faint damns. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 11:17, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many municipalities listed in the template "BritishColumbia" are not cities. The District of North Vancouver, for example. Why single out Saanich, which is also a district municipality?

<dd>Perhaps the template title should be changed? For example, it seems odd to exclude Saanich (and the District of North Van, for that matter), which are huge - while legitimately including incorporated cities such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_St._John%2C_British_Columbia_fb64.html" title="Fort St. John, British Columbia">Fort St. John</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson%2C_British_Columbia_6371.html" title="Nelson, British Columbia">Nelson</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrace%2C_British_Columbia_f950.html" title="Terrace, British Columbia">Terrace</a>, which are much, much smaller.

I realize that you have a strong interest in this article, but please see <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, your interest and work doesn't give you the ability to unilaterally revert like that without the courtesy of at least an explanation.

<dd>If you'd like to see the talk page archived through another method, that's fine, make a note on the discussion, and archive it that way. Don't revert the discussion. I just set it up the easiest way I knew possible to make it so that there was little interaction on the part of the users (other than switching the tag to a new archive when that one gets too big and adding the new tag to the archive list). An archive exists, you can label it however you want (Pre-July 2006 for example) and remove the automatic archival if you don't think it will be helpful.

<p>1. Regarding direct, non-stop SCHEDULED flight connections to Europe.</p>
<p><b>YYC has 2</b>, to Heathrow and Frankfurt serviced by Air Canada. The other 7 are charters, generally you do not include charter flights in as they are on-demand and can be cancelled at any time. Plus some Calgary charters stop in other Canadian cities before reaching their destination.</p>
<p>2. Calgary is considered a minor regional hub airport for both passengers and cargo. It does NOT rank as a major passenger or cargo hub in North America. All major Canadian Airports have DHL, UPS, Purolator etc.</p>
<p><b>In fact YYC does not fall within the top 40 busiest North American airports for either cargo or passengers.</b></p>

<p>I don't think I was misonforming anyone, but if you think I was I'm sorry. However I found it really unescessary for you to reprieve me on edits that "incorrectly favour Edmonton" because if anything you have a blatant favouritism of Calgary. Edmonton's Fringe Fest, Heritage Fest, Taste of Edmonton, and any other festivals Edmonton has that other cities try to imitate, but never duplicate, are all bigger, more attended, and more well-known. We have over 30 all year, yet for some reason this wasn't included. I'd appreciate it if you could be just a BIT impartial when you decide to edit pages, because I have sources/citations for the edit I made.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Arch, I have not been putting in the pov comments. I have been editing for length and trying to keep what was there while getting rid of lists and what not. Even the Calgary article is slightly full of 'best-know,' etc, etc, etc. Feel free to take out any pov points you don't agree with instead of blaming me, who didn't put them in to start with. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERendar_731a.html" title="User:Rendar">Rendar</a> 05:36, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just so you know, I was already very well aware of Ottawa's land area situation even before I heard of Wikipedia. I was there in 2002 - take a car or BRT out to Kanata and you'll see what I mean! Before Ottawa's amalgamation, its area was only 110 km<sup>2</sup>. With a population of 323,340 as of the 1996 federal census, this worked out to nearly 2,940 people per square km - closer to Vancouver's density than Edmonton's. Speaking of communities like Nepean being still thought as separate entities - I would not be terribly surprised if in Toronto (though I cannot say for sure myself), the annexed communties of Scarborough or Etobicoke are still being thought as separate, as Toronto's amalgamation wasn't very long ago! In other words, that's not unexpected at all of a lot of cities having recently undergone large annexations of surrounding cities. Also, I'll let you know I'm just as aware how deceptive that kind of data can be - I was compelled to point out Edmonton's density as compared to NYC's (see discussion in <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton.html" title="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>). Since you want something like a reference or explanation, I've added a reference in <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton.html" title="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>'s Wikipedia article to back this up, which wasn't hard to do. (I know - I should've done that before, anyway). <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthernFire_700c.html" title="User:NorthernFire">NorthernFire</a> 08:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have decided not to reinclude the Ottawa comment since it was removed by TelusFielder (btw, his actions in editing Edmonton's article are beginning to sound like an edit war, and I don't like this anymore than you do), unless I asked you first. Although I usually see cold hard facts as I see them and don't care much for arguments on details, you did indeed provide a strong argument for Ottawa's situation regarding its density before and after annexation in 2000(?). I want to know if it's still alright with you if I put it back in, as I did put a reference to its land area. If not, I will honor your decision. Remember, I'm going by <i>your</i> decision, not TelusFielder's. Please reply in my user talk page. It's up yo you. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthernFire_700c.html" title="User:NorthernFire">NorthernFire</a> 19:08, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
