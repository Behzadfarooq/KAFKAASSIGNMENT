<p>Archy is the best person to correct errors, and although Wiki discourages people from editing their own entries, they can do so to correct errors. On an edit he made he corrected text to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Fusion Barrier Principle. Fission energy is the highest form of energy that is able to be controlled and surpass breakeven. A Tokamak such as JET or ITER can only reach 2/3 breakeven because 1/3 of the input energy is forever lost in controlling the device."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The last sentence was deleted in a revert by someone, making the claim look completely stupid. Also points of view that "Plutonium reportedly discovered this theory in a graveyard on the Dartmouth campus" are forbidden unless evidence is provided. Anybody could falsely add a sneer of this type. Either you have reliable evidence, or leave it out of Wiki, or the encyclopedia will be a disgrace of unsubstantiated opinions, points of view, and innenundo.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Unification of the Forces of Physics as a Coulomb Unification. Unification logically and obviously means one force and the only force that is perfect is the Coulomb force, which means the strong-nuclear-force combines with the weak-nuclear to make a nuclear-coulomb-force and that gravity is a fictional force."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Archy added the above correction and it has disappeared in a revert. If you are going to mention theories of Archy, be concise and allow the facts. If you don't want these facts, then don't mention the theory. You can't have it both ways, without degrading Wiki's standards.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Stonethrowing theory. This theory states that every planet that has intelligent life all came through one and the same channel of events where a creature began throwing of rocks and stones and that throwing behaviour will catapult that species to intelligence and civilization. The likelihood is that every alien intelligent lifeform had ancestors that lived in trees because treeclimbing bone anatomy is a short distance in change to bone anatomy of stonethrowing. And Stonethrowing theory says that throwing created bipedalism, so throwing came first and created bipedalism. This activity gave the ape advantages in getting food and more females for mating purposes by killing other rivals using throwing."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above correct summary explanation added by Archy has also been removed by a revert, and what is now on the Wiki page looks stupid due to missing out what Archy says and just leaving the points of view of someone who evidently doesn't possess an ancestor who went through the stone throwing phase. You are NOT allowed such points of view on Wiki. Learn the rules! You must be accurate, stuck to what the theory is, and remove your personal pathetical POV.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Human Overpopulation is the number one major factor that causes most wars and is the number one social evil on this planet Earth. Wars occur periodically of about a 30 years spaced apart due to human generational birthing. USA Civil WAr and Franco-Prussian War and WW1 then WW2 are examples of where human population is beyond its means and violence and war erupt due mainly to human overpopulation. We must correct ourselves of human overpopulation because if we do not then we extinct many species of animals and lessen diversity. We run the risk of nuclear war and thus nuclear pollution. We have conquered Earth's physical environment to lend us comfort but we have yet to conquer our own greed of filling this planet chock full of people. As long as we do not control human population we have the recurring and increasing evils of wars, pollution, terrorism, starvation, crime etc. When we do not solve overpopulation then wars, disease, starvation, pollution, crime, terror ensue and solve it for us. Until we solve human overpopulation we should not call ourselves Homo sapiens but Homo dumbo and we should not be called an intelligent species but a reckless species. I believe this problem is best tackled with a combination of laws restricting the number of babies and a incentive of human cloning to those that obey the law."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above addition of Archy which was also deleted in a revert does contain a first-person sentence which is against Wiki rules. So it should have been put in quotation marks or the offending sentence removed or rewritten. Simply reverting factual edits which clear up unsubstantiated POV is against the rules. Everyone has a right to edit, don't think you alone have the right to delete other people's corrections. That's against Wiki rules. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.212.74.16.html" title="User:172.212.74.16">172.212.74.16</a> 20:02, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure I like the idea of including any of this in. But Plutonium is to some extent a cultural icon of the internet and some of these claims are so bizarre and intriguing that not including it would be negligent. Maybe a summary as folows would be approprtiate</p>
<p>Plutonium recently proposed a list of what he termed his most important discoveries. Among these are</p>
<ol>
<li>Plutonium Atom Totality theory. There was no <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>, but rather growth from a Hydrogen Atom Totality into our present day Plutonium Atom Totality, in which the galaxies are dots of the electron dot cloud.</li>
<li>Stonethrowing theory. This states that the difference between <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">apes</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> resulted some 8 to 10 million years ago from a solo quadraped ape that started throwing rocks overarm and overhead. This activity gave the ape advantages in getting food and getting more females to mate by killing other rivals using throwing.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This does make a lot of sense, it explains why males can through yet girls can't. Because it was the males which needed to to throw to kill the other potential rivals. At last this mystery has been explained! Thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> 18:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

That and the contemporanious posts to alt.conspiracy about <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_in_black.html" title="Men in black">men in black</a> and the fact that the US Govt. was breeding humans half-the-height in <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">area 51</a> make up some of my fondest memories of the internet. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 02:27, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Who cares about this loser? Wikipedia does not need articles like this. Even though they can be ignored that isn't the point. Everything single thing that happens in the world does not need a Wikipedia article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I could not agree more. This is a sorry excuse for a subject for a Wikipedia article, and as has been shown repeatedly, attention of any kind just encourages this subject to do unfortunate things. (To verify this, just go on Google groups sci.math and search for articles posted by subject using his current (A.P.) or former (L.P.) name.) Even worse, he has posted many overtly racist comments over the years. The last thing such subjects need is *more* attention.</dd>

<dd>so you are saying that only people who have no interest in a subject should decide on whether an article should be kept? Is Usenet not worth documenting?

<dd>And I'd certainly oppose it, same reasoning as before. The primary problem with this article is that the article's subject is repeatedly re-editing it.

However I suspect that semi protecting it you've probably solved the problem for the time being. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreglocock_2608.html" title="User:Greglocock">Greglocock</a> 04:53, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "reasoning as before" is totally inadequate for a biography page and arguably inadequate for any Wikipedia page. Content in the article without reliable references should be removed.

It's one thing to mention Archie's entry on killfile.org—it seems somewhat notable to me that he appears there. It's another thing to rely on killfile.org as a source for other aspects of Archie's life.

AP is a usenet kook, of similar notoriety (or notability), albeit for totally different reasons, to James "<a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibo.html" title="Kibo">Kibo</a>" Parry. Since Usenet is fluid and self documenting it is a waste of time looking for formal references, the only formal reference to AP would be in a book about delusional psychology. Nonetheless he is a real part of the history of the Intertubes, and was around when it was small enough that there was an actual sense of community, singular.

<dd>I feel I understand well enough. i.e. it sounds like there are not any of the kinds of resources that I am looking for, and thus, my perspective would be that the topic/person is not notable. Maybe there are semi-unspoken different standards for what can survive as a Wikipedia article under these (i.e. exists only in the world of Usenet) circumstances.

:Date: 19 Mar 2007 11:16:00 -0700

[...] It demeans and defames the person. The only reason Archimedes
Plutonium warrants a Wikipedia page is because of his original idea of
the Atom Totality and yet in that information alone, no-one reading
his page would understand why it is there. A proper page of Archimedes
Plutonium would spend the first paragraph explaining what the ATom
Totality is. Instead, Wikipedia spent 10 years discussing what fruit
and candy I eat and what obnoxious nicknames can be used to mock me.
Wikipedia is the furthest away from a true encyclopedia such as
Britannica of the 19th century when James Clerk Maxwell was the
editor. Wikipedia is mostly a gaggle of biased, unreasonable novice
editors.

Example: their bipedalism page has 7 to 12 crackpot theories as to how
bipedalism originated and yet the theory that probably is the true
one-- Stonethrowing was dismissed because Archimedes Plutonium
discovered it. Instead they list crackpot theory of Wading and the
Water Ape. The editors say Stonethrowing is a new idea, yet they
blithely gloss over the fact that Wading and Water Ape is not only a
new idea but a crackpot idea.

So, because Wikipedia is a gaggle of novice editors who have little to
no logical reasoning and science minds, there is nothing but
frustration for anything of Archimedes Plutonium for any entry into
Wikipedia.  It is not worth my time.

PLEASE REMOVE THE Archimedes Plutonium Wiki page.

Thank you, Archimedes Plutonium

Plutonium's autobiography reveals that it contained nothing about nicknames as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">03-13</a> 09:27:40 +0000. The content about nicknames was added by M. Plutonium to his autobiography within the past 12 hours (It certainly wasn't there when I consulted it for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Archimedes_Plutonium&amp;diff=117085347&amp;oldid=117081602" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Archimedes_Plutonium&amp;diff=117085347&amp;oldid=117081602" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>.), in order to support then adding it to this article. Wikipedia does not work that way. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've separated the article into sections, "Biography", "Theories", and "Controversies", and rearranged the text accordingly. This makes the article more coherent, and separates the autobiographical info from the citable facts a little better. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 16:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've stitched the biography back together again, for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>The biography as split up was no longer in chronological order. To read a chronological account one had to skip back and forth across three sections.</li>
<li>Moving the paragraph, explaining about Plutonium's realization, out of chronological order removed the context for the following paragraphs.</li>
<li>It does readers a disservice for the only things in a "Biography" section to be things sourced from the subject's autobiography, and for things sourced from actual biographies of the subject by other people to <i>not</i> be in such a section.</li>
<li>It does M. Plutonium a disservice for the overwhelming majority of the biographical content about him to be in a section entitled "Controversies".</li>

<p>Well, the whole point of this article's existence is the controversial nature of AP. Which I think should be spelled out in a section separate from his biographical info. Besides, biographical info is supposed to be relatively brief and cover only the essentials of the person, specifically what that person did, <i>not</i> what others did to him. The more noteworthy items of his life (the point of the article) deserves its own section. It just doesn't seem right to mix all of that historical controversy info in with his biographical details. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 23:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>We don't have any rule that "biographical info is supposed to be relatively brief". It is a disservice to the article's subject that you are doing by presenting everything his biography as "controversy". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:19, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Exactly the opposite, actually. I wanted to separate the purely biographical info from the events surrounding his notoriety. A simple test applies: does a given sentence support the contention that he's a controversial Usenet writer or not? If so, it can be labeled "controversy"; if not, it can be labeled "biographical". I don't think both belong together under "biography". But, hey, you've got the last edit. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 17:15, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's fair to call the section "Controversies" because that's what it covers: the controversies surrounding AP and his Usenet postings. The section title itself is a neutral term and does not disparage AP, but rather serves to put a label on the events that transpired. Again, if the historical events of the controversy could be separated from the purely biographical facts about the person, this would make for a better article. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 23:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The correct label is "biography", because that it what it is, a <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biography</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:19, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Square brackets around an ellipsis is a standard typographical convention for indicating omitted text. <i>It is not a punctuation error.</i> Similarly, "from A, through N, to Z" is a perfectly normal construction. <i>It is not a grammatical error.</i> I suggest, to any editor thinking of "correcting" these again, that a good look at a book on copyediting is in order first. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:23, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bracketed ellipses are standard convention in newgroups, but unbracketed ellipses have been the convention in printed text for hundreds of years now (see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Ellipses" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Ellipses</a>). I made the correction because the original wording sounded awkward. Correct or not, it just didn't sound right, and a simple rewording made it sound better. But be my guest to revert to the original. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 17:09, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
