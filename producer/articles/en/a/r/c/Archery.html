Arrows proved exceptionally destructive against massed formations, and the use of archers often proved decisive.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, archery in warfare was not as prevalent and dominant in Western Europe as popular myth dictates. Archers were quite often the lowest-paid <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier.html" title="Soldier">soldiers</a> in an army or were conscripted from the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peasantry.html" title="Peasantry">peasantry</a>. This was due to the cheap nature of the bow and arrow, as compared to the expense needed to equip a professional <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man-at-arms.html" title="Man-at-arms">man-at-arms</a> with good <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armour.html" title="Armour">armour</a> and a <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a>. Professional archers required a lifetime of training and expensive bows to be effective, and were thus rare in Europe (see <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_longbow.html" title="English longbow">English longbow</a>).</p>
<p>Archery was highly developed in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and in the Islamic world. The horse archers were the main military force of most of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_advances_of_Genghis_Khan_852a.html" title="Military advances of Genghis Khan">Equestrian Nomads</a>. In modern times, horse archery continues to be practised in some <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian.html" title="Asian">Asian</a> countries but is not used in international competition. Central Asian tribesmen were extremely adept at archery on <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horseback.html" title="Horseback">horseback</a>.

<p>The advent of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearm.html" title="Firearm">firearms</a> rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Early firearms were vastly inferior in range, rate-of-fire, and armor <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penetration.html" title="Penetration">penetration</a> to high-quality bows, but required significantly less training to use properly.

<p>A <b><a href="../../../l/o/n/Longbow.html" title="Longbow">longbow</a></b> is a type of bow that is tall (roughly equal to or greater than the height of a person), is not recurved, and has relatively narrow limbs that are circular or D-shaped in cross section. The traditional English longbow is made so that its thickness is at least ⅝ of its width. If the thickness is less than ⅝ of its width then the bow would be considered a <b>flatbow</b>. Typically a longbow is widest at the handle. Longbows have been used for hunting and warfare, by many cultures around the world, a famous example being the English longbow, during the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>A <b>shortbow</b> is a much smaller version of the longbow. While it is lighter and more maneuverable, it also stores less energy and hence has a shorter maximum range. However, it is less skill-intensive than the longbow and was sometimes used by rank-and-file soldiers with some training.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="../../../r/e/c/Recurve_bow.html" title="Recurve bow">recurve bow</a></b> is the only class of bow that is shot at the Olympic Games. Its basic working principals are similar to that of a traditional longbow. Its defining feature is that the ends of the limbs curve forwards slightly, which increases the power gained from the bow and smoothens the draw.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="../../../c/o/m/Compound_bow.html" title="Compound bow">compound bow</a></b> is designed to reduce the force that an archer must hold, yet increase the overall energy stored by the bow. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to optimize the leverage exerted by the archer and to reduce the holding force of the bow at full draw in what is known as the "let-off". With less force required to hold a compound bow at full draw, the muscles take longer to fatigue, thus giving a compound archer more time to aim. A compound bow must be adjusted so that the let-off occurs at the correct draw length appropriate to the archer.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a></b> is a variation on the general bow design. Instead of the limbs being held vertically, they are mounted horizontally on a stock much like that of a rifle. The limb design can either be compound or a recurve but the basic concept of firing is the same. The string is pulled back either manually or with a <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windlass.html" title="Windlass">windlass</a> and locked into place. The string remains in this locked position, held soley through mechanical means until the energy stored in its limbs is released by a trigger mechanism, which launches the loaded missile. The energy stored in the shortened limbs is comparable to the longbow but packed into a smaller design that is also much easier to aim. Crossbows are not capable of firing the arrows of bows, but instead use shortened versions, called <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarrel.html" title="Quarrel">quarrels</a> or bolts.</p>

<p>A normal arrow consists of shaft with an arrowhead attached the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other. Shafts are usually made of solid <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood.html" title="Wood">wood</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiberglass.html" title="Fiberglass">fiberglass</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminum_alloy.html" title="Aluminum alloy">aluminum alloy</a>, or <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_fiber.html" title="Carbon fiber">carbon fiber</a>. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but are more easily produced to uniform specifications. Aluminum shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the later half of the 20th century due to their light weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990s</a> and are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminum arrows.</p>
<p>The arrowhead is the primary functional part of the arrow, and plays the largest role in determining its purpose. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but it is far more common for separate arrowheads to be made, usually from metal, horn, or some other hard material. The most commonly-used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, like bodkin, judo, and blunts.</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/l/e/Fletching.html" title="Fletching">Fletching</a> is traditionally made from bird <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feather.html" title="Feather">feathers</a>, but solid <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic.html" title="Plastic">plastic</a> <b>vanes</b> are also used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The fletching is equally spaced around the shaft with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string. This fletch is called the index fletch and is a reference for the nocking of the arrow. Three fletches is the most common configuration, though more may be used. The fletching is sometimes attached at a slight angle , to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight. Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called <i><a href="../../../f/l/u/Flu-Flu_Arrow_52ea.html" title="Flu-Flu Arrow">flu-flus</a></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Technique and form">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technique and form</span></h2>
<p>The bow is held in the hand opposite to the archer's <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_dominance.html" title="Eye dominance">dominant eye</a>, though holding the bow in the dominant hand side is advocated by some. This hand is referred to as the <b>bow hand</b> and its arm the <b>bow arm</b>. The opposite hand is called the <b>drawing hand</b> or <b>string hand</b>. Terms such as <b>bow shoulder</b> or <b>string elbow</b> follow the same convention. Right-eye-dominant archers hold the bow with their left hand, have their left side facing the target, sight towards the target with their right eye and handle the arrow and string with their right hand.</p>
<p>Generally one wears a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bracer_%28archery%29.html" title="Bracer (archery)">bracer</a> (more commonly known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm and a <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finger_tab.html" title="Finger tab">tab</a> to protect the fingers of the drawing hand. Some archers also wear protection on their chests, called chestguards. Chestguards are to prevent the bowstring from being obstructed by the archer's physique or clothing as it is released. Of course, it also protects the archer.</p>
<p>To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level an 'open stance' is used/developed. Each archer will have a particular preference but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line will be a half to a whole foot-length in front of the other, on the ground.</p>
<p>To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground and the shaft of the arrow is placed on an arrow rest which is attached in the bow window. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the 'nock' (a small plastic component which is typefied by a 'v' groove for this purpose). This is called <i>nocking the arrow.</i> Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane is pointing away from the bow. This vane is often coloured differently and has numerous names such as <i>index fletch</i> and <i>cock-feather.</i></p>
<p>The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers. When using a sight, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below. The string is usually placed in either the first or second joint of the fingers.</p>
<p>The bow is then raised and drawn. This is often one fluid motion which tends to vary from archer to archer. The string hand is drawn towards the face, where it should rest lightly at an <i>anchor point</i>. This point is consistent from shot to shot and is usually at the corner of the mouth or on the chin. The bow arm is held outwards toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is not hyper-extended as this leads to a tendency for the bowstring to scrape the inside of the wrist or to catch on the arm guard when released. The bow should always remain vertical.</p>
<p>In proper form, the archer stands erect, forming a 'T'. The archer's back <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle.html" title="Muscle">muscles</a> are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some bows will be equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length.</p>
<p>The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand. An archer should pay attention to the recoil or <i>follow through</i> of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Compound Bow Technique">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Compound Bow Technique</span></h3>
<p>Archers using compounds sometimes use a release aid to hold the string steadily and release it precisely. This attaches to the bowstring at the nocking point and permits the archer to release the string by pulling a trigger. The "trigger" may be an actual trigger lever which is depressed by a finger or thumb (or held then released) but it may also be some other mechanism. Hydraulic and mechanical time delay triggers have been used, as have "back tension" triggers which are operated by either a change in the position of the release or "true back tension"; that is to say the release triggers when a pre-determined draw weight is reached. A mechanical release aid permits a single point of contact on the string instead of three fingers. This allows less deformity in the string at full draw, as well as providing a more consistent release than can be achieved by human fingers.</p>

<p>Using archery to take game animals is known as <b>bowhunting</b>. Bowhunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms as the distances between the hunter and the game are much shorter in order to ensure a humane kill. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as <b>bowfishing</b>.</p>
<p>Modern equipment, such as compound bows, are generally preferred today over traditional equipment and materials. <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">Crossbows</a> are sometimes permitted, at least for disabled hunters.</p>
<p>Legal and cultural differences must be taken into consideration by the hunter. Bowhunting often has different season and game restrictions than does firearm hunting, and they differ significantly between countries, and even between states/provinces.</p>

<p>Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of archery worldwide and is called <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_archery.html" title="Target archery">target archery</a>. A form particularly popular in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">America</a> is <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_archery.html" title="Field archery">field archery</a>, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games. Competitive archery is a sport of precision, and is as much a mental as it is a physical game.</p>
<p>Note the tournament rules vary from organization to organization. <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Archery_Federation_6852.html" title="International Archery Federation">FITA</a> rules are often considered normative, but large non-FITA-affiliated archery organizations do exist with different rules.</p>

Outdoor target competition.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Modern competitive target archery is often governed by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Archery_Federation_6852.html" title="International Archery Federation">International Archery Federation</a>, abbreviated FITA (Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc). Olympic rules are derived from FITA rules.</p>
<p>Target archery competitions may be held indoors or outdoors. Indoor distances are 18&#160;m and 25&#160;m. Outdoor distances range from 30&#160;m to 90&#160;m. Competition is divided into <i>ends</i> of 3 or 6 arrows. After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows. Archers have a set time limit in which to shoot their arrows.</p>

<p>Targets are marked with 10 evenly spaced concentric rings, which have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them. In addition, there is an inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring. This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, it serves as a tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most X's winning. Archers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. Line breakers, an arrow just touching a scoring boundary line, will be awarded the higher score.</p>
<p>Different rounds and distances use different size target faces. These range from 40 cm (18 m FITA Indoor) to 122 cm (70 m and 90 m FITA, used in Olympic competition).</p>

<p>Field archery involves shooting at targets of varying (and sometimes unmarked) distance, often in rough terrain.</p>
<p>Three common types of rounds (in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Field_Archery_Association_%28USA%29_b3b8.html" title="National Field Archery Association (USA)">NFAA</a>) are the field, hunter, and animal. A round consists of 28 targets in two units of 14. <b>Field rounds</b> are at 'even' distances up to 80 yards (some of the shortest are measured in feet instead), using targets with a black bullseye (5 points), a white center (4) ring, and black outer (3) ring. <b>Hunter rounds</b> use 'uneven' distances up to 70 yards, and although scoring is identical to a field round, the target has an all-black face with a white bullseye. Children and youth positions for these two rounds are closer, no more than 30 and 50 yards, respectively. <b>Animal rounds</b> use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round. The rules and scoring are also significantly different. The archer begins at the first station of the target and fires his first arrow. If it hits, he does not have to fire again. If it misses, he advances to station two and fires a second arrow, then to station three for a third if needed. Scoring areas are vital (20, 16, or 12) and nonvital (18, 14, or 10) with points awarded depending on which arrow scored first. Again, children and youth shoot from reduced range.</p>
<p>One goal of field archery is to improve the technique and abilities required for bowhunting in a more realistic outdoor setting, but without introducing the complication and guesswork of unknown distances. As with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a>, fatigue can be an issue as the athlete walks the distance between targets across sometimes rough terrain.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Other modern competitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other modern competitions</span></h3>
<p>The following are listed on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Archery_Federation_6852.html" title="International Archery Federation">FITA</a> website. These competitions are not as popular as the two listed above, but they are competed internationally.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: 3D Archery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">3D Archery</span></h4>
<p>3D archery is a subset of field archery focusing on shooting at life-size models of game, and is popular with hunters. It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition.</p>
<p>On these animals there are 4 rings, only 3 of these are used in ASA shoots. The one that isn't used very often is the 14 ring. This can only be scored if you call it before you shoot, and even then it may not be allowed. Next is the 12 ring inside of the 10 ring, inside of the 8 ring. Anything on the target that is outside of the 8, 10, 12, or 14 rings is a 5. If you miss the target, you score a zero.</p>
<p>Though the goal is hunting practice, hunting tips (broadheads) are not used, as they would tear up the foam targets too much. Normal target or field tips, of the same weight as the intended broadhead, are used instead.</p>
<p><a name="Clout_Archery_.28G.N.A.S._rules_in_the_United_Kingdom.29" id="Clout_Archery_.28G.N.A.S._rules_in_the_United_Kingdom.29"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Clout Archery (G.N.A.S. rules in the United Kingdom)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clout Archery (G.N.A.S. rules in the United Kingdom)</span></h4>
<p>Similar to target archery, except that the archer attempts to drop arrows at long range (180 yards / 165&#160;m for the men and 140 yards / 128&#160;m for women; there are shorter distances for juniors depending on age) into a group of concentric circular scoring zones on the ground surrounding a marker flag. The flag is 12 inches (30&#160;cm) square and is fixed to a stick. The flag should be as near to the ground as is practicable. Archers shoot 'ends' of six arrows then, when given the signal to do so, archers proceed to the target area. A Clout round usually consists of 36 arrows. Clout tournaments are usually a 'Double Clout' round (36 arrows shot twice). They can be shot in one direction (one way) or both directions (two way). All bow types may compete (longbows, recurve, barebow and compound).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scoring.</b> A 'rope' with a loop on the end is placed over the flag stick. This rope is divided into the scoring zones of the target: Gold (5 points), Red (4 points), Blue (3 points), Black (2 points) and White (1 point). The rope is 'walked' around the target area and arrows falling within a particular scoring zone are withdrawn and, on completion of the full circle, are laid out on the rope on the corresponding colours. The designated scorer would then call out the archers' names and the archers would (in turn) call out their scores as they pick up their arrows. The scores must be called in descending order as with target archery.</li>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Flight Archery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flight Archery</span></h4>
<p>Flight Archery can only take place where space permits usually in a protected area such as an aerodrome, subject to approval and access, since archers compete by shooting for maximum distances. Flight Archers shoot in various classes and weights and shoot six arrows at each "end" and then search for all of them marking the one which has been shot the furthest parallel to the datum line then marking this furthest one with an identifiable marker, the arrows can then be draw from their landing sites. Alternative bows may be shot on subsequent "ends" and also marked as above with their bow types and weights. Only four ends are usual in one shoot. At the end of the shoot, archers stand or sit by their furthest arrows while judges and their assistants measure the distances they were shot. There are many bow classes and bow weights that one can shoot in. The archer who shoots the furthest in their class is the winner.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Ski archery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ski archery</span></h4>
<p>An event very similar to the sport of <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biathlon.html" title="Biathlon">biathlon</a> except a recurve bow is used in place of a gun. The athletes ski around a cross-country track and there are two stances in which the athlete must shoot the targets: kneeling and standing. During competition the skis must not be removed at any time. The athlete may unfasten the ski when shooting in the kneeling position but must keep the foot in contact with the ski. The shooting distance is 18 meters and the targets 16 cm in diameter. In certain events, for every missed target, the athlete must ski one penalty loop. The loop is 150 meters long.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Beursault">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beursault</span></h4>
<p>A traditional northern French and Belgian archery contest. Archers teams shoot alternatively at two targets facing each other, 50 meters away. A perpendicular array of wooden walls secures a path parallel to the shooting range. After each round, the archers take their own arrow and shoot directly in the opposite direction (thus having opposite windage). One shoots always the same arrow, supposedly the best built, as it was difficult in medieval times to have constant arrow quality. The round black-and-white target mimics the size of a soldier: its diameter is shoulder-wide, the center is heart-sized.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Popinjay (or Papingo)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Popinjay (or Papingo)</span></h4>
<p>A form of archery originally derived from shooting birds on church steeples. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popinjay.html" title="Popinjay">Popinjay</a> is popular in Belgium, but little known elsewhere. Archers stand within 12 feet (3.7 m) of the bottom of a 90 ft (27 m) mast and shoot almost vertically upwards with 'blunts' (arrows with rubber caps on the front instead of a pile), the object being to dislodge any one of a number of wooden 'birds'. These birds must be one Cock, four Hens, and a minimum of twenty-four Chicks. A Cock scores 5 points when hit and knocked off its perch; a Hen, 3; and a Chick, 1 point.</p>
<p>A Papingo is also hosted during the summer in Scotland by the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. The archers shoot at a wooden bird suspended from the steeple of Kilwinning Abbey. Here only one bird is the target, and the archers take it in turn to shoot with a longbow until the "bird" is shot down.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Roving Marks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roving Marks</span></h4>
<p>The oldest form of competitive archery, as practiced by Henry VIII. The archers will shoot to a "mark" then shoot from that mark to another mark. A mark is a post or flag to be aimed at. As with clout a rope or ribbon is used to score the arrows. In the Finsbury Mark the scoring system is 20 for hitting the mark, 12 for within ~3ft, 7 points for within the next ~6ft and 3 points for within the next ~9ft.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Wand shoot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wand shoot</span></h4>
<p>A Traditional English archery contest. Archers take turns shooting at a vertical strip of wood, the wand, usually about six feet high and three to six inches wide. Points are awarded for hitting the strip. As the target is a long vertical strip this competition allows for more errors in elevation, however since no points are awarded for near misses the archers <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windage.html" title="Windage">windage</a> accuracy becomes more important.</p>

<p>Archers often enjoy adding variety to their sport by shooting under unusual conditions or by imposing other special restrictions or rules on the event. These competitions are often less formalized and are more or less considered as games. Some forms include the broadhead round, bionic and running bucks, darts, archery golf, night shooting, and turkey tester.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Edit section: Archery education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Archery education</span></h3>
<p>A relatively new program has developed in U.S. schools called the National Archery in Schools Program (NASP). In this students use Genesis bows (a compound-style bow without a let-off). This is similar to a physical education programmes, and students who want to can also go to state and national shoots to compete against other schools. Though started in the United States, it has begun to spread to other countries.</p>
<p>Many sportsman's clubs and similar establishments throughout the US and other countries offer achery education programs for those under 18. These programs are commonly referred to as Junior Olympic Archery Development Programs, or simply JOAD. There are over 250 JOAD Clubs recognized by the National Archery Association.<sup id="_ref-JOAD_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JOAD" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
