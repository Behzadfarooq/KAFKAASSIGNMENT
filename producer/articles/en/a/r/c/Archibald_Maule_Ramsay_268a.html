<p>Ramsay was from an aristocratic family (he was a descendent of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Dalhousie_cda2.html" title="Earl of Dalhousie">Earls of Dalhousie</a>). He attended <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst_dc3d.html" title="Royal Military Academy Sandhurst">Royal Military Academy Sandhurst</a>, joining the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldstream_Guards_7840.html" title="Coldstream Guards">Coldstream Guards</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>. On the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> he served in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> for two years before being transferred to the War Office in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. Here he met and married Hon. Ismay Preston, daughter of <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenico_William_Joseph_Preston%2C_14th_Viscount_Gormanston_4269.html" title="Jenico William Joseph Preston, 14th Viscount Gormanston">Viscount Gormanston</a> and widow of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Ninian_Edward_Crichton-Stuart_6000.html" title="Lord Ninian Edward Crichton-Stuart">Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart</a> MP, who had been killed on active service in the war.</p>
<p>As the war was coming to an end, Ramsay served at the British War Mission in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. He retired from the Army with the rank of Captain in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>. He spent the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> as a company director, living in Kellie Castle near <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbroath.html" title="Arbroath">Arbroath</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus.html" title="Angus">Angus</a>, and became active in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1931_1edb.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1931">1931 general election</a>, Ramsay was elected as MP for <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peeblesshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_ce90.html" title="Peeblesshire (UK Parliament constituency)">Peebles and Southern Midlothian</a>. He was regarded as a likeable and charming man (he was nicknamed 'Jock' among friends), who had a sincere and earnest approach and was an engaging and persuasive public speaker. However, Ramsay was not considered as a potential candidate for high office: the most senior appointment he obtained was as a Government member of the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html" title="Potato">Potato</a> Marketing Board.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Maule_Ramsay_268a.html" title="Edit section: Spanish Civil War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spanish Civil War</span></h2>
<p>When the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> broke out, Ramsay was a strong supporter of the Nationalists under <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Franco</a>, largely arising out of his opposition to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-clericism.html" title="Anti-clericism">anti-clericism</a> of the Spanish Republicans and their alleged attacks on the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Church. In the early months of the war he objected in Parliament to what he saw as bias in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Broadcasting_Corporation_b1c0.html" title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</a> news reports on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and pointed to links between Spanish Republicans and the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Late in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, Ramsay formed the 'United Christian Front' to combat attacks on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> 'which emanate from Moscow'. Many distinguished peers and churchmen joined, but the organization was criticized in a letter to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> by senior religious figures including <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Temple_%28archbishop%29_0d8f.html" title="William Temple (archbishop)">William Temple</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_York_2903.html" title="Archbishop of York">Archbishop of York</a>) and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Soper_bcf3.html" title="Donald Soper">Donald Soper</a>. The objectors said that, while they supported Christian unity, they could not support the United Christian Front as it was mainly concerned with the Spanish Civil War and "adopts a view of it which seems to us ill-founded".</p>
<p>Ramsay became aware of a plan to hold a conference of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">freethinkers</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, which was being organized by the International Federation of Freethinkers. Together with his supporters in Parliament, he denounced this as a 'Godless Conference' which was organized by a Moscow-based organization. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> he asked for permission to introduce as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Member%27s_Bill_7249.html" title="Private Member's Bill">Private Member's Bill</a> the 'Aliens Restriction (<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy.html" title="Blasphemy">Blasphemy</a>) Bill' (which would have prohibited conference attendees from entering Britain); he won the vote by 165 to 134.</p>

<p>Ramsay's opposition to Communism led him to look to other countries for examples. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">January 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> he had given a speech to the Arbroath Business Club in which he observed that <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>'s antipathy to Jews arose from his knowledge "that the real power behind the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_International_5c0a.html" title="Communist International">Third International</a> is a group of revolutionary Jews". Some time later in 1938 he read 'The Rulers of Russia' by Rev. Denis Fahey CSSp which contended that of 59 members of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union_5ea4.html" title="Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, 56 were Jews and the remaining three were married to Jews. At the same time, Ramsay was also becoming more sympathetic to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>: in September he wrote to <i>The Times</i> to defend the right of the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudetenland.html" title="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a> to self-determination.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, Ramsay was invited to a luncheon party at the German Embassy in London where he met some noted British sympathizers with Nazi Germany, including <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Domvile_458c.html" title="Barry Domvile">Barry Domvile</a>. In December he introduced another Private Member's Bill called the 'Companies Act (1929) Amendment Bill' which would require shares in news agencies and newspapers to be held openly and not through nominees. In his speech promoting the Bill, Ramsay claimed the press was being manipulated and controlled by 'international financiers' based in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> who wanted to "thrust this country into a war". Ramsay was given permission to introduce his Bill by 151 to 104. In December <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, 'The Fascist' (journal of the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Fascist_League_0a3b.html" title="Imperial Fascist League">Imperial Fascist League</a>) declared that Ramsay had 'become Jew-wise' (a term which indicated someone who had come to believe in a Jewish conspiracy).</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> Hon. Mrs. Ismay Ramsay gave another speech to the Arbroath Business Club at which she claimed the national press was "largely under Jewish control", that "an international group of Jews .. were behind world revolution in every single country" and that Hitler "must .. have had his reasons for what he did". The speech was reported in the local newspaper and attracted the attention of the Chief Rabbi for Scotland, Dr. Salis Daiches, who wrote to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scotsman_5f9c.html" title="The Scotsman">The Scotsman</a> challenging Mrs Ramsay to produce evidence. Ramsay wrote on her behalf citing Rev. Fahey's booklet, and the resulting correspondence lasted for nearly a month - including a letter from 11 Ministers of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> in the County of Peebles repudiating the views of their MP.</p>
<p>Some members of Ramsay's local Conservative Association in <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peebles.html" title="Peebles">Peebles</a> were not pleased by what they considered negative publicity. However, Ramsay reassured them that he would continue to be a supporter of <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Chamberlain_8a10.html" title="Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> and the National Government. Ramsay made attempts to make controversial speeches to private meetings rather than in public. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_27.html" title="April 27">April 27</a> he spoke to a branch of the (anti-semitic) <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic_League_0966.html" title="Nordic League">Nordic League</a> in <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilburn.html" title="Kilburn">Kilburn</a> which attacked Neville Chamberlain for introducing <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">conscription</a> "at the instigation of the Jews" and claimed that the Conservative Party "relies on .. Jew money".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Maule_Ramsay_268a.html" title="Edit section: The Right Club">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Right Club</span></h2>
<p>After the controversy over the January speech died down, Ramsay decided that he needed to make others aware of the threat so that they would rid the Conservative Party of Jewish control. To this end he set up 'The Right Club' in May <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, noting down those who had joined in a red leather-bound and lockable ledger (the 'Red Book'). There were 135 names on the men's list and 100 on a separate Ladies list; the members of the Right Club include a broad spectrum of those known to be anti-semitic (including <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Joyce_f6d9.html" title="William Joyce">William Joyce</a>), those who were in some respects 'fellow travellers' with anti-semitism, and some friends of Ramsay who may have joined without knowing the actual functions of the Club. At its early meetings, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_5th_Duke_of_Wellington_03a0.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 5th Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> took the chair. The logo of the Right Club, seen on its badge, was of an <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle.html" title="Eagle">eagle</a> killing a <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake.html" title="Snake">snake</a> with the initials "P.J." (which stood for 'Perish Judah').</p>
<p>While Ramsay was attempting to launch the Right Club, he spoke at a meeting of the Nordic League at the <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigmore_Hall_bd33.html" title="Wigmore Hall">Wigmore Hall</a> at which a reporter from the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Morning_Star_6c1c.html" title="The Morning Star">Daily Worker</a></i> was present and reported Ramsay as saying that they needed to end Jewish control, "and if we don't do it constitutionally, we'll do it with steel" (a statement greeted with wild applause). The popular magazine <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bull_%28disambiguation%29_2034.html" title="John Bull (disambiguation)">John Bull</a></i> picked up on the report and challenged Ramsay to contradict it or explain himself. Ramsay's local constituency newspaper, the <i>Peeblesshire Advertiser</i>, made the same challenge and Ramsay responded by admitting he had made the speech, citing the fact that three halls had refused to host the meeting as evidence of Jewish control.</p>

<p>On the second day of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_4.html" title="September 4">September 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>), Ramsay sat in the Library of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> writing a poem which was later to be printed and distributed by the Right Club. It ran:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Land of dope and Jewry</dd>
<dd>Land that once was free</dd>
<dd>All the Jew boys praise thee</dd>
<dd>Whilst they plunder thee
<dl>

<p>When the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_War_aa73.html" title="Secretary of State for War">Secretary of State for War</a> <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Hore-Belisha%2C_1st_Baron_Hore-Belisha_c3f7.html" title="Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha">Leslie Hore-Belisha</a> (a frequent target of antisemitism) was forced out of office, Ramsay distributed in the House of Commons many copies of <i>Truth</i> (a magazine closely connected to Neville Chamberlain) which argued that Hore-Belisha was no loss to the government. He also put down a motion which cited the regretful reactions of many newspapers to Hore-Belisha's sacking as evidence of Jewish control of the press.</p>
<p>Privately, Ramsay had been invited to some of the 'Secret Meetings' at which right-wing opponents of the war discussed tactics. However, after they grew to be dominated by <a href="../../../o/s/w/Oswald_Mosley_abcc.html" title="Oswald Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a> and his supporters, Ramsay withdrew. The Right Club spent the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phony_war.html" title="Phony war">phony war</a> period distributing propaganda in the form of leaflets and 'sticky-backs' (adhesive labels containing slogans), with Ramsay later explaining that he wanted "to maintain the atmosphere in which the 'phoney war', as it was called, might be converted into an honourable negotiated peace." In addition to Ramsay's "Land of dope and Jewry" rhyme, the slogans included "War destroys workers" and "This is a Jews' War"; some of the leaflets asserted "the stark truth is that this war was plotted and engineered by the Jews for world-power and vengeance".</p>

<p>In Parliament, Ramsay attacked the internment procedure of <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defence_Regulation_18B_0a4c.html" title="Defence Regulation 18B">Defence Regulation 18B</a> and opposed the arrest of anti-semitic speaker 'Jock' Houston under the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Order_Act_of_1936_b40b.html" title="Public Order Act of 1936">Public Order Act of 1936</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, he asked a question about a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> radio station set up by Germany which gave its precise wavelength, which was suspected by both his allies and opponents as a subtle way of advertising it. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_9.html" title="May 9">May 9</a>, he asked for an assurance from the Home Secretary "that he refuses to be stampeded .. by a ramp in our Jew-ridden press?" His increasingly open anti-semitism was picked up by <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> and other MPs and referred to in debate.</p>

<p>One of the last members to join the Right Club was <a href="../../../t/y/l/Tyler_Kent_f013.html" title="Tyler Kent">Tyler Kent</a>, a cypher clerk at the American Embassy in London. Ramsay gave Kent the ledger containing the list of Right Club members for safe-keeping. Unfortunately for Ramsay, Kent was stealing top-secret documents from the embassy and had already fallen under suspicion for so doing. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, Kent's flat was raided and he was arrested; the locked 'Red Book' was forced open. Ramsay's involvement with Kent was extremely concerning to the authorities as Ramsay enjoyed Parliamentary privilege: if Kent had given his stolen documents to Ramsay, it would have been impossible to prevent their publication, which may have seriously damaged the war effort. The Cabinet decided to extend Regulation 18B to give more power to detain people suspected of disloyalty.</p>
<p>Ramsay was arrested and lodged in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brixton_prison.html" title="Brixton prison">Brixton prison</a> on an order under <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defence_Regulation_18B_0a4c.html" title="Defence Regulation 18B">Defence Regulation 18B</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. From the start he engaged solicitors (Oswald Hickson, Collier &amp; Co.) through whom he attempted to defend his reputation. When Lord Marley said in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> that Ramsay was Hitler's chosen <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauleiter.html" title="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a> for Scotland in the event of an invasion, Oswald Hickson, Collier immediately sent off a letter of complaint.</p>
<p>As an 18B detainee, Ramsay's only legal method of challenging his detention was to appeal to the Advisory Committee under <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Norman_Birkett%2C_1st_Baron_Birkett_e435.html" title="William Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett">Norman Birkett</a> which recommended continued detention. However, as a Member of Parliament, some of Ramsay's colleagues argued that his detention was a breach of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_privilege.html" title="Parliamentary privilege">Parliamentary privilege</a>. The detention was referred to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_of_Privileges_93e9.html" title="Committee of Privileges">Committee of Privileges</a>, but on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">October 9</a> it reported that detention was not a breach of privilege.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> published an article on "Britain's Fifth Column" in July 1940 which claimed "informed American sources said that he had sent to the German Legation in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> treasonable information given to him by Tyler Kent". Ramsay sued for <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander_and_libel.html" title="Slander and libel">libel</a>, resulting in a trial in July <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> in which he asserted his loyalty to Britain. However some of Ramsay's answers did him extreme damage, for example when he was asked if he wanted Nazism to be defeated, and replied, substituting 'Germany' for 'Nazism': "Not only Germany, but also the Judaic menace". In summing-up the Judge said he was convinced Hitler would call Ramsay 'friend' and that Ramsay was disloyal in heart and soul to his King, his Government, and the people.</p>
<p>However, the New York Times could not defend its story, having found no evidence that Ramsay had communicated anything to the German Legation in Dublin, and it was found guilty. The Judge awarded a <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_farthing.html" title="History of the farthing">farthing</a> in damages, the customary award for a libel plaintiff adjudged to have brought it on themselves; as the New York Times had already paid £75 into court, Ramsay became liable for both prosecution and defence costs. Another consequence of the trial was that Ramsay's local Conservative Association disowned him completely. They recruited <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Robertson_%28UK_politician%29_63f8.html" title="David Robertson (UK politician)">David Robertson</a>, the MP for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streatham_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_f6d1.html" title="Streatham (UK Parliament constituency)">Streatham</a> who was from Scotland, to represent the constituency; however Robertson found it too expensive to do so and soon gave up.</p>

<p>Ramsay continued occasionally to put down written Parliamentary questions from jail, sometimes taking up the cases of fellow 18Bs. His eldest son Alec, serving in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_Guards_b069.html" title="Scots Guards">Scots Guards</a>, died of <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> on active service in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> in August <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>.

He immediately returned to Westminster to resume his seat in the House of Commons, causing at least one member to storm out of the chamber. His only significant action in the remainder of the Parliament was a motion calling for the reinstatement of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_England_9b54.html#The_.22Statutum_de_Judaismo.2C.22_1275" title="History of the Jews in England">Statute of Jewry</a> passed under <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">King Edward I</a>. He did not defend his seat in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">1945 general election</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> Ramsay wrote <i>The Nameless War</i>, as an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> and a plea to justify his actions.
