<p>Please stop changing pharmacology-related templates to conform to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is much harder to read and serves little purpose.</p>
<p>Also, please verify additions to medical articles before you make changes. For example, you added a stimulant template to the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomoxetine.html" title="Atomoxetine">atomoxetine</a> article, however it is NOT a stimulant; in fact the non-stimulant nature of <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomoxetine.html" title="Atomoxetine">atomoxetine</a> has been its trademark feature since its approval.</p>

<p>Yes, I would be willing to discuss this issue through mediation.

<p>As I've stated on the dispute page, I am not opposed to a more formal taxonomy, my main concern is making the template as easy to read and understand as possible.</p>

<p>I think it's just more important that we don't work on it at the same time, and I should have remembered how much work you'd been doing on it. We're both contributing. And to paraphrase Alfred Einstein, the Italian and German form of the symphony at that time differed mainly in the presence or absence of the minuet, and that was no real difference at all — until Mozart and Haydn came around, in his opinion. So that when the Prague sym 38 is also without a minuet it's not that much different in substance from sym 36 or 39( well, 39 - he likes 36 somewhat less.&#160;:) More recent musicologists, etc. probably disagree about Mozart and Haydn's total contribution to the form and its development, if not very much, I'm guessing; I have some reading to do. I've had some reading to do for awhile now.

<p>I do think I see what you were trying to do with the Brahms compositions list by analogy with the list of K._x redirects. I'm not sure it's a great idea (yeah, grump grump grump&#160;:) I just think with both cases all those extra redirect pages take up extra space and bandwidth; Wiki is not paper yes but there's only so much space and bandwidth and it has to be paid for ) but I "get" it better than I did; and <b>certainly</b> shouldn't have flown off the handle which I have been doing too much of lately (generally). And your hard work in setting up the list is to be thanked — there's less of a confusing op # or w/o op # problem with Brahms than w Dvorak or Mozart (the main work w/o op #, if I remember, is not - ok, to my mind! - not so much the Hungarian Dances as the A major piano trio, of dubious but probable attribution. In my opinion probable.&#160;:) The organ fugues w/o op # — minor in length but not in quality, so I gather, must hear them, then repeatedly&#160;:). But that all distracts from the point: thanks! <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">Schissel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchissel_dfe5.html" title="User talk:Schissel"><i>bowl listen</i></a> 11:43, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On Jacob Wrestling with the Angel, you wrote that the HBO version of Angels in America referenced the Gustave Doré version of the painting (see right). This is simply not true. When I uploaded the picture, I looked for the one used in the HBO version, and I found it <a href="http://members.aol.com/jocatholic/otp4.jpg" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/jocatholic/otp4.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I have no idea who painted it.

<dd>I really like the new template on these pages! By the way, I'm not an expert on the topic; I just saw the need for the article so I adapted the material from the French Wikipedia the best I could. Anyways, per your questions -- for pages like Roku (kanji), I don't want to express too strong an option, because I didn't work on those pages, but I'd lean towards keeping them in Wikipedia. Other characters (for example, <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a>) have their own pages in Wikipedia. But for your other question, I agree with you that they're inconsistently linked, but I'm not sure what to recommend. One problem is that the page is already so long that it gets warnings when saved, so if more links are included, the problem will only get worse. I know this probably wasn't too helpful of a response, but I didn't want you to think I was ignoring you. Thanks for all your hard work on the pages, and I'm sure our paths will cross again soon. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 13:45, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First: I am very happy that you liked the template! Then you made a strong argument by providing the links. There IS a lot of information that can be/should be on this kind of pages. As for the size of the pages, it doesn't matter (and anyway some [[ and ]]make just several kbs more). The size warning is a consideration for people with very slow connections and strange browsers. Most people here (my impression) think it's not really important, in fact many articles are much bigger. So, CU soon, when our paths will cross again. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">(talk)</a> 14:38, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Arcadian, well done for this template. I'm not sure about its use though. It presumes that every disease has causes and diagnostic tests that can be fitted on the space of one or two lines. It would impose a rather reductionist view on the Wikipedia medical articles, something I'd rather avoid. It is also open to all sorts of chaos, as can be seen on <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditory_processing_disorder.html" title="Auditory processing disorder">auditory processing disorder</a>.</p>
<p>Without criticing you in any way, perhaps you should have discussed the use of the template at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Clinical_medicine_56e7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine">Wikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Psychopathology_8cbb.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Psychopathology">Wikipedia:WikiProject Psychopathology</a> before inserting it into articles of broad scope.</p>
<p>Finally, it has no referencing apparatus, and it therefore very hard to see what the origin is for incidenc/prevalence numbers. This is especially so in cases where there is regional variation (e.g. hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in Southeast Asia). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 23:15, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arcadian, if you look more carefully on that site, you'll see that not all of those numbers are used. This is what I posted on the article's talk page: The article states that there are 5624 Greek words in the new testament, but I do not believe that this is accurate. Indeed there are 5624 Strong's numbers for the Greek, however, only words with the same root were numbered, so αγαπησεις appears the same as αγαπατε, for example--both are listed as Strong's #25 "αγαπαω". Even disregarding different stems for these words, however, there are not even 5624 root words, as numbers 3203-3302 are simply not used. See <a href="http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstrongs/STRINDEX.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstrongs/STRINDEX.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstrongs/STRINDEX.htm</a>. I would love to change this to the proper number, but I'm not sure what it is. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymondofrish_1468.html" title="User:Raymondofrish">Raymondofrish</a> 01:14, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! Thanks so much for placing the excellent InfoBox template on the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">epilepsy</a> article. You should be aware, however, that many patients with epilepsy are coded via ICD-9 under 784.0, "Other convulsions." Is it possible to insert 784 into the template as well, or will this break it?</p>
<p>I am not familiar with ICD-10 at all, so I am concerned that it may have another convulsion category floating around (although this was one of the things people like me were hoping it would fix) - I'll look into it. --Ikkyu2 22:13, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm new to Wikipedia, and I'm confused. You're an admin and spend time on the Cleveland pages. A wikipedian keeps moving, or deleting text, I add re the Metroparks on the Cleveland page to the Metro Cleveland page or oblivion. I don't want to get into a revert war, but several reservations are in, or cross, the city, and the Zoo is entirely inside the City. There's no reference to these otherwise, except in briefest passing. Why would references to these be dumped to the Metro page? I've already put these back only to have them dumped without comment. I thought that this space was a collaborative? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 15:33, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Mille Grazie</i>! Excellent advice. I was going to try to start a Metroparks page myself as time permitted.</p>
<p>FYI The Cleveland, Summit, Lorain and Lake Metroparks are each independant political subdivisions of the state, but generally serve Cuyahoga, Summit, Lorain and Lake counties respectively. They have taxing authority and their own sworn police forces (rangers). Each have robust conservation, education and preservation programs. The Cuyahoga Valley National Park is federal, but they all collaborate. Outdoorsy Clevelanders really have it good.</p>

<p>Pleased to make your acquaintance. I've finished the merge, per Talk:Intraparenchymal hemorrhage. However, this probably only should be a temporary merge, and once there's some significant content for Intraventricular hemorrhage, we could split them out onto two pages again. I just put a few sentences at Intra-axial_hematoma#Intraventricular_hemorrhages to get the ball rolling, but you might want to take a look at it when you get a chance. --Arcadian 21:20, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good meeting you too. I had a look and added a small amount on intraventricular bleeds. You must have made a redirect from intraventricular hemorrhage, and I did one from intraventricular hematoma. You think we should remove the stub template?</dd>

<dd>Hey, question: do you know where I can find a page on conventions about the references section? e.g., whether to put the date after the name or at the end, whether to put the name of the article in quotes, whether to capitalize every word in the article name or just the first letter, etc?

<p>Edwardian has run away from the matter. If you have any advice on this dispute, it could be used. The whole point of me getting involved in this dispute and bringing it to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> was specifically so that I could help the matter through the proper process, not get stuck in the middle of something I don't have any familiarity with.

<p>Thanks! Really, even if I'm a pathologist, my present, main interest into wiki are horses and nature; I'm working mainly into it.wiki, and I come into en.wiki sometimes (Neuroma was mentioned into the Navicular disease article...). I think, my contributions to en.wiki will not be so many, since (as you can see &#160;;-) ) my English is not so good. Nevertheless, I created two new categories into Commons (Normal Histology and Histopathology) and (when I'll can...) I'll upload there some microscopic pictures from my daily work. Take a look sometimes, just to see there is something useful.</p>
<p>Please: there is a template saying "Please, edit this bad English if you can" into en.wiki? I'll use it often!</p>

<p>Hi, Arcadian. I suspect that Complications of cataract surgery is a recreation of material previously deleted due to copyright violations (i.e. Atonic pupil after cataract surgery, Atonic pupil after cataract surgery/Temp), but I have no way to verify this. Are you able to view the previously deleted articles and let me know how similar they are? I believe the new one may warrant a speedy delete if my suspicions are true. (FYI, the second listing from the top in the following link cites the violation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACopyright_problems&amp;diff=20733183&amp;oldid=20653532#August_10" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACopyright_problems&amp;diff=20733183&amp;oldid=20653532#August_10" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.)

<p>Hi. Thanks for adding some references to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy.html" title="Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy">Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</a>! I expanded them from just PubMed numbers to full citations. However, right now they're not being used specifically for anything in the article itself, and I'd like to know what they actually say. Do you have access to the articles, or just the abstracts? If we're not citing any particular facts, I'm a little nervous about including something like "Sustained recovery of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy after treatment with IL-2" because that's just a single study - it would be misleading to give people the impression that IL-2 is a proven treatment. I have a long list of journal articles which I'm hoping to dig through soon, to make this a solider article. ←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 04:08, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, thanks - I need to read up anyway. The eMedicine article looks really good, so probably we just want to cherry-pick its references and add a few more recent ones. As for HAART making PML worse, it's more specifically IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome), an occasional complication of effective HAART, that's the problem; as far as I can tell, there's nothing about this on WP yet except in a <a href="../../../i/r/i/IRIS_5999.html" title="IRIS">disambiguation page</a>, so I guess I'll put that on my list too. ←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 04:39, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Never mind, it looks like I got it. I also made another big change - I remove the fixed-width constraint on the box. I noticed that if one of the parameters was a really long string (like a long birthplace or 5+ probowl years without a break), it would sometimes be fit into the box by breaking-up the <b>left</b> column into multiple lines, making a complete mess. With the new setup, it's up to the user to insert &lt;BR&gt;s to keep the box from growing ridiculously wide.

<p>We've both been deleting unused optional fields (Image, DraftedYear, DraftedRound, ProBowls, HOF) when they're not used, but I think it'd be better if we always left them in (with nothing after of the equals sign).

<p>Hi. Sorry for picking on you out of the blue from admins on at the minute, but could you help me with the pages: Gutslice and Cut Yourself. They're vanity articles written by a member of a non-notable band (under WP:Music) who only started up in June of this year. I have marked them for speedy deletion so many times now, but this boy keeps on removing my deletion notices, incessantly. I am sure that my call is right on its lack of notability, so it would be really helpful if you could call this one... Thanks, and sorry for this strange approach. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">Iinag</a> 18:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ok: thank you for your advice (and your revert on my user page). I apologise for pestering you; I had thought, since the article was self-promotion of a band who listed none of the music guidelines, it would have been a speedy delete. It was not out of a particular impulsion against the band; I just keep my eyes out for self-aggrandisement, and I dislike English bands who try to take advantage of the fact that the plurality of anglophone Wikipedians are probably North American to try to make themselves seem more significant than they actually are. I have listed the articles that I mentioned under AFD; thanks again for your advice. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">Iinag</a> 20:32 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I want to point out inconsistencies in the Newborn Screening article. In particular, please read the third paragrpah on the section "Expanded screening and expanded controversies" and compare:</p>
<p>1) "Cost to detect each case has risen dramatically" vs. "$Millions saved nationally by newborn screening per Delaware DPH" (external link). Also see page 94-95 of the linked ACMG report discussing cost effectiveness of Newborn Screening.</p>
<p>2) "1-in-a-million diseases" vs. "Perhaps one in 5,000 infants will be positive..." found in the Conditions and Disorders section. Look also at the full list of disorders where the rarest individual occurance is 1 in 100,000.</p>
<p>I can see including a section about the actual debate on NBS issues but the paragraph in question reads like pure opinion rather than objective debate. It is certainly not sourced by any facts and is directly contradicted by other sources listed in the remainder of the article.</p>

<p>JFW says I should address this to you:</p>
<p>While attempting to edit the ribavirin and viramidine articles I've noticed a problem the standard drug template which includes external links for things like CAS number, Pubchem, chemID and so on. The ChemID works fine because it plugs back to the <a href="http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/" class="external free" title="http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/" rel="nofollow">http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/</a> database. However, the CAS# external links don't work because they attempt to plug the CAS# into the European ECB-ESIS database, and they naturally are not recognized. I think that the nih pubchem database would take CAS numbers, and would work fine if the link attempted that. So this CAS# external link needs to target to the NIH site. Sbharris 03:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This should really be addressed to Arcadian (talk • contribs), who has modified the template to allow these functionalities. He may have more information on why the ECB-ESIS databank was chosed over Pubchem. JFW | T@lk 20:22, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is some thought about reworking the inflammation page. I don't think all the organs of the body with -itis appended is really that useful in the article. How about an article which is a list of all names for various types of inflammation, and a general entry in the inflammation page about how the terminology of medicine uses -itis as a suffix?

<p>Can Arcadian tell me why he/she included the leukemia classification to this lymphoma page? It is not even listed in the leukemia page! I vote for dividing the WHO classification into 4 parts in 4 distinct pages: leukemia, lymphoma, histocytic and mastocytic neoplasms. Only the relevant part of the classification should be listed in each page. Wiki links will lead to the other pages. Remember, Wikipedia is not a technical text, it is meant to be readable by all.

<dd>They exploit isn't too bad, but it limits the deep linking to the specific round, which isn't a huge problem, but I'd rather see a field like "DraftNotes" or something like that, which could handle odd cases like the supplemental drafts for the <a href="../../../u/s/f/USFL_1d20.html" title="USFL">USFL</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Kosar_0f6e.html" title="Bernie Kosar">Bernie Kosar</a>, etc. And I agree with your judgement on the infoboxes - I like the one in the lower left the best. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 15:31, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I actually think deep linking into the draft pages is a bad idea anyway (even if we had all the rounds of all the drafts) since there's probably more interest in the top of the article than at seeing that <i>yes, indeed, such and such was picked 171st overall</i>.</li>
<li>For Kosar, et al., we could make a something like a "DraftFreeform" parameter that accepts arbitrary text to appear next to the Draft row header, and could be used as a substitute for what we already have. It would have to be used in place of the "DraftedYear" and "DraftedRound" pair, since using both would result in two Draft-headed rows. The downside is the potential for misunderstanding and misuse. If this is what you had in mind, go ahead and implement it, or give me the word.</li>
<li>For the stats links, it's too bad the lower left one is impossible. I advocate sticking with what we've got and trying to encourage one link per box: ESPN / NFL / SI for active players, DF / PFR for retirees.</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your edits are throwing off the endnote references. If you take a close look at the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_saphenous_vein.html" title="Great saphenous vein">Great saphenous vein</a> (GSV) article - and compare the pre- and post-infobox versions you'll notice the infobox breaks the references -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_saphenous_vein&amp;oldid=37107931" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_saphenous_vein&amp;oldid=37107931" rel="nofollow">GSV version with endnotes correct</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_saphenous_vein&amp;oldid=38717542" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_saphenous_vein&amp;oldid=38717542" rel="nofollow">GSV version with endnote numbering broken</a>. I think some more thought has to be put into how the infobox is done... or the references redone. A large number of the artery and vein articles are like that-- 'cause I've done a lot of editting on 'em.</p>
<p>I haven't found a good way to do the references-- where the numbering is automated-- aside from what you see in the GSV article. I find it loathsome to number the references by hand (something I've seen in other articles)-- not least 'cause it seems like a waste of time and second because I think the software ought to be able to do that... like any half decent reference manager in OpenOffice.org and MS-Word.</p>
<p>The problem with numbering the reference by hand is it is a total pain in the butt to insert a reference in the middle of an article... as it necessitates re-numbering half the references.</p>
<p>As for the scheme I've used-- I think the problem is it doesn't match the references to the numbering. If one re-uses a reference the numbering in the text doesn't match the reference number-- see the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_hemodialysis.html" title="Home hemodialysis">home hemodialysis</a> article... if you want to know what I mean. I re-use some references in that article and the hyperlinks in the text jump to the first appearance of the reference in the <i>references</i> section. <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENephron_555e.html" title="User:Nephron">Nephron</a> 20:52, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Arcadian,</dd>
<dd>I found a solution to the problem. There is a more intelligent way to do references. I fixed the GSV article. The only question now is-- how do you adjust the size of figure? I think the figure is way too big. <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENephron_555e.html" title="User:Nephron">Nephron</a> 07:53, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very nice work. Much better than it was a week ago. You may want to consider submitting it for peer review. There could be a featured article in there. A quibble: <i>leaving his approval in a sense "formal"</i> -- this phrase confused me, since the word 'formal' seemed to emphasize Leo's approval, while the prior phrase de-emphasized it. Also, the phrase <i>Following a publication practice still seen today</i> seems unnecessary. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 12:42, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I agree on the "formal" bit; I don't know the best way to convey what <i>in forma specifica</i> connotes. Perhaps "token" would be the better word.

<p>Thanks for finding and tagging additional human anatomy stubs. May I suggest (since you are finding so many) that you take a look at the sub-categories of {{<a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnatomy-stub_7a6a.html" title="Template:Anatomy-stub">anatomy-stub</a>}}, such as {{<a href="../../../c/i/r/Template%7ECirculatory-stub_79c2.html" title="Template:Circulatory-stub">circulatory-stub</a>}} which is used for articles about the circulatory system and {{<a href="../../../n/e/u/Template%7ENeuroscience-stub_8a2f.html" title="Template:Neuroscience-stub">neuroscience-stub</a>}} which is used for articles about the anatomy as well as the physiology of the nervous system. These additional sub-category stubs were created to make it easier to find and sort stub articles so that {{<a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnatomy-stub_7a6a.html" title="Template:Anatomy-stub">anatomy-stub</a>}} would not contain such a huge collection of varied articles. --<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncycloPetey_19b4.html" title="User:EncycloPetey">EncycloPetey</a> 05:48, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you moved the image into the infobox. That's fine, but I'm just wondering ...</p>
<p>I'm new at adding images, so looked at several medical pages to find examples of accepted format. In most cases where an image is at the top of the page, it's just after the infobox rather than inside it. Could you point me in the direction of guidelines about this?</p>
<p>Also, is it possible to retain the thumbnail indicator when the image is inside the infobox? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardin_MD_2d86.html" title="User:Hardin MD">HMD</a> 18:07, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a tricky question, but I'll answer the best I can. For almost every other type of page on Wikipedia (movies, albums, countries, medicines, world leaders, chemicals, etc.) the first image appears within the infobox, not after it. However, the infobox for diseases is relatively new and undeveloped compared to these other categories. The template only dates back to June 5 2005, and the image field ony dates back to January 6 2006. Most of the discussions about it in the past have taken place at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Clinical_medicine_30a3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Clinical medicine">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Clinical medicine</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Disease_b456.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Disease">Template talk:Infobox Disease</a>. So for the general case of how it should be handled, I'd recommend that you post a message there. For your specific case of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strep_throat.html" title="Strep throat">strep throat</a>, I have moved the image back out of the infobox to your original location. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 20:36, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the infomative reply -- I wasn't really questioning your putting the image in the infobox; appearance-wise I don't think it makes much difference. It is better, though, I think, to have the thumbnail indicator -- Is it possible to have that inside the infobox? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardin_MD_2d86.html" title="User:Hardin MD">HMD</a> 20:48, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to be dense -- I still don't see the thumbnail indicator in your example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Strep_throat&amp;oldid=40857125" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Strep_throat&amp;oldid=40857125" rel="nofollow">use</a>. Could you just go ahead and put the image with thumbnail indicator inside the infobox.

Unfortunately you have used a wrong chapter numbering (A-Z instead of roman numbering) changing the structure. Chapters in several cases do not correspond to the first character of the code. I was able to correct the titles of the chapters in part but the links have still to be reset.</p>

<p>What is the best way to complete the infobox when an article, such as <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemaline_myopathy.html" title="Nemaline myopathy">Nemaline myopathy</a>, has three OMIM and three DBB references? (They list three types: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and Amish.) I also found two eMedicine articles; can I link to both in the box?

<dd>That's a tough one. I'd lean towards a keep, but a more sustainable solution might be to split it off into a new page, History of ophthalmology. Focus upon the advances rather than the personalities (though giving credit to the people involved), and arrange the achievements chronologically. Then, instead of trying to define some arbitrary criteria for inclusion on an unordered list, you could rely upon general principles of proportion to determine what merited inclusion. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 11:19, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Arcadian. I was wondering if you might put <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonometry.html" title="Tonometry">Tonometry</a> on your watchlist for a short time. In short, 1) User:^DevelopAll recently added an external link for, and information about, a particular kind of tonometer (a Diaton transpalpebral tonometer whose webpage notes, "Powered by ^DevelopAll"), 2) another contributer added some information regarding the drawbacks about the instrument, 3) I reworded and formatted both contributions to fit Wiki guidelines on verifiability and NPOV, and 4) User:^DevelopAll has removed the "negative" information three times without comment. I suspect that User:^DevelopAll and User:69.22.199.91 might be one and the same in that User:69.22.199.91 has attempted to reinsert the linkspam that is ""Powered by ^DevelopAll".

<p>Hi, Arcadian.</p>
<p>The Nomina Anatomica sometimes does give 2 names. Then there's no consensus. If you want to find out which name is preferred, you need to go to journals. Often the name given in anatomy textbooks is different to the name in surgical textbooks, and so on. It's not easy!</p>
<p>I would use the paper-based versions of the NA, which are in my university's library. I don't know of any online version that is reliable enough to be used as a source for wikipedia. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 23:39, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're glad to have you here! Thanks for the URL -- I was not familiar with that website. Currently, SNOMED is not one of the parameters available for the disease infobox.

ok, I just did that (added a request for SNOMED in the template on the Template talk:Infobox Disease page). I also noticed that the external link I'd added wasn't necessary since it was in the infobox. Sorry for the revert, I thought it had been deleted accidently.</p>

Also, I have contacted Btarski and asked that he continue to take every opportunity to be civil and assume good faith in this matter. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 22:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Side note - how do you think the mediation went? Are you happy with the result, and with my methods? This was my first case, and even though non-admins are discouraged from taking cases involving admins, I decided to be bold. Any feedback you have would be appreciated. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 16:39, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently, you seem to have been creating many articles with plural names, e.g. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatal_muscles.html" title="Palatal muscles">Palatal muscles</a>. Please read <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#Prefer_singular_nouns" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions#Prefer_singular_nouns</a>; Wikipedia policy suggests that articles should usually have singular names. In the case of these articles in particular, which seem to be list-like, the article should either be named <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatal_muscle.html" title="Palatal muscle">Palatal muscle</a> (as a disambiguation page), or List of palatal muscles (as a list). You can always create a redirect from the plural page.

<p>Good work on splitting up the elbow joint article. You've split out some of the text into the articles entitled <a href="../../../u/l/n/Ulnar_collateral_ligament.html" title="Ulnar collateral ligament">ulnar collateral ligament</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radial_collateral_ligament.html" title="Radial collateral ligament">radial collateral ligament</a>. Please beware that other joints have ligaments which may also have these names. IIRC the condition called Gamekeeper's Thumb is a traumatic rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb. Please consider retitling the articles "Ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow" and so on. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreacherdoc_067c.html" title="User:Preacherdoc">Preacherdoc</a> 14:31, 15 July 2006 (UTC)Preacherdoc</p>

<p>Great job with Gray's Anatomy port. I think the current set of anatomy templates might could use a division, so that the text (attachments, branches of arteries, etc.) isn't hiding in the shadow of the Gray's diagram in the margin. I think diagrams are great in their current location, but maybe the crucial info should assume a more front-and-center position in the article. Of course, this is easy for me to say because I have no idea how to do wiki templates. --<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauvila_73ee.html" title="User:Mauvila">Mauvila</a> 05:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Another mediator recommended that I ask for help from an admin on something, so I am asking you. The mediation has been rough, mostly due to anon edit wars on both the article and talk page, which include accusations of vandalism and other nastiness.

<p>Hi Arcadian, sorry to bug you. Is there a convention on naming in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatomy.html" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a>?

<dd>The official TA names are all in Latin, but for the quasi-official names (i.e. those listed in TA English reference), some names are anglicized and some aren't (e.g. flexor digiti minimi brevis). I looked it up, and the quasi-official name is 'hepatopancreatic ampulla', but also listed as official but "less preferred" was the biliaropancreatic ampulla. The trend is to move away from eponyms, and medical school texts have virtually eliminated them from texts. For that reason, Wikipedia should probably do so as well, but continue to mention the eponyms as synonyms. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauvila_73ee.html" title="User:Mauvila">Mauvila</a> 22:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could support adding new fields.

Then if no one objects after a week or so, go ahead and add the field. (If you're not sure how to add the field to the template, I'd be happy to help.) You may also want to get feedback from <a href="../../../d/i/b/User_talk%7EDiberri_54fd.html" title="User talk:Diberri">User talk:Diberri</a>. I rely upon his excellent <a href="http://diberri.dyndns.org/wikipedia/templates/?type=pubmed" class="external text" title="http://diberri.dyndns.org/wikipedia/templates/?type=pubmed" rel="nofollow">tool</a> to help create these infoboxes. It probably isn't realistic to expect that a new molecular weight field would be automatically populated by that tool, but perhaps he could add lines with unpopulated values to support the new field(s) you're proposing. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 16:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You aware of any official source for naming?</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Federation_of_Associations_of_Anatomists_b188.html" title="International Federation of Associations of Anatomists">International Federation of Associations of Anatomists</a> looked promising-- but it doesn't seem they have their catalogue online.

AFAIK, <i>fibular</i> is not the prefered name-- but I wondered if there was some sort of "official" guide that this anonymous person knows about and I am unaware of. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENephron_555e.html" title="User:Nephron">Nephron</a> <small><a href="../../../n/e/p/User_talk%7ENephron_679d.html" title="User talk:Nephron">&#160;T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nephron_3dab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nephron">C</a></small> 03:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I renamed it in accordance with the preferred name of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminologia_Anatomica_a806.html" title="Terminologia Anatomica">Terminologia Anatomica</a> (TA), which is the joint IFAA/FCAT (1998) standard for naming. And according to IFAA, <i>fibular</i> IS the preferred name and for good reason. While they say that peroneal is acceptable, it is not the preferred term. <i>Peroneal</i> is the Greek derived version of <i>fibular</i> (a Latin term). They used to call the <i>fibula</i> by its Greek version <i>perone</i>. But eventually, the Latin term <i>fibula</i> became the standard (<i>tibia</i> is also Latin). So <i>fibularis</i>, <i>fibular artery</i> are consistent with the bone, and thus the terms won the committee vote. But there is also a very practical reason for <i>fibular artery</i>, and that is because <i>peroneal artery</i> sounds very much like <i>perineal artery</i>, and this can lead to confusion in a clinical setting. So most modern textbooks eschew the <i>peroneus</i> designation all together. The English version of the TA publication can be purchased from Amazon, but I think Mercksource-Dorland's has the Latin TA versions. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauvila_73ee.html" title="User:Mauvila">Mauvila</a> 23:14, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>A quick thank you for originating the <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopard_syndrome.html" title="Leopard syndrome">Leopard syndrome</a> article. As you can see I have worked hard on the expansion of it, and certainly appreciate the fact that it was here. Strange but true coincidence, the day you initiated the article is my birthday! I do happen to have been diagnosed with the condition in 1987 with the condition, my father was retro-diagnosed from me, and my daughter recieved a confirmed diagnosis from the test they have now.<a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnseemlyWeasel_c02c.html" title="User:UnseemlyWeasel">UnseemlyWeasel</a> 20:22, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Arcadian, I noticed some of the recent expansions on <a href="../../../n/e/r/Template%7ENervous_tissue_83da.html" title="Template:Nervous tissue">Template:Nervous tissue</a>. There are a lot of other things that could be inlcuded like <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purkinje_cell.html" title="Purkinje cell">Purkinje cells</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renshaw_cell.html" title="Renshaw cell">Renshaw cells</a>, etc. However I was wondering, how big can these templates get? Should they be as all-inclusive as possible or include only some key articles? Is there some guideline for this? My view is the bigger the better, but wanted to check before continuing to expand its scope. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets"><font color="gray"><u>Nrets</u></font></a> 01:19, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arcadian, I have looked at your entry on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_translation_of_crisis.html" title="Chinese translation of crisis">Chinese translation of crisis</a> a number of times. Each time I have thought how it could be cleaned up; each time I've drawn back because it's difficult to know where to even start. The problem is that the article as it stands is flawed from start to finish -- starting with the title.</p>
<p>The problem is not the 'Chinese translation of crisis'; it is the assignment of a false etymology to the Chinese word for 'crisis'. The title should really be, 'Etymology of the Chinese and Japanese word for crisis'.</p>
<p>(In one sense it is about the Chinese translation of crisis, in that weiji probably started life as an <i>equivalent</i> to the English word for 'crisis', but even there you are on rather shaky ground because it's quite likely that the word was invented by the Japanese -- which would have to be substantiated, of course).</p>
<p>So the start of the article, "While there is ambiguity present in any translation..." is somewhat off the track, as the problem is not one of translation but of etymology and word-building. Thus, "the translation of the Mandarin word weiji (危機) has proven particularly controversial" is also off the mark; the problem is the ex-post-facto assignment of a false etymology to weiji (危機).</p>
<p>The statement, "The controversy is mostly due to differing interpretations of how much optimism should be associated with the character 機", is also a rather strange approach to the issue. There is no 'sliding scale' of optimism in the interpretation of the character 機. The problem is that 機 has quite a few meanings, some of which bear no relation to 'opportunities', 'junctures', 'optimism', or anything of the sort. The error is not one of calibrating the amount of 'optimism' to be attributed to 機; it is the incorrect interpretation of 機 as meaning 'opportunity' in the word 危機.</p>
<p>That said, it is not actually incorrect to point out that 危機 <i>happens to be made up of characters meaning</i> 'danger' and 'opportunity', and using this fact to point up a lesson about crises. What is problematic is the assertion that word 危機 etymologically <i>means</i> 'danger + opportunity'. It doesn't. Etymologically, it means 'dangerous juncture'.</p>
<p>(I would like to add that the fanciful folk etymology that has taken root has its legitimate uses. It is ideal for pep talks and motivational lectures, and there is no particular reason to kill it off. The etymology yields a valid psychological insight into change as an opportunity, not just a threat. The only problem is that fortuitous combination of 'danger + opportunity', however appealing superficially, is not the actual etymology of the word.)</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to take issue with the word 'controversy'. I do not believe that any real controversy exists, outside the one you have conjured up in this article. This is a simple case of an erroneous etymology that has gained wide currency. The facts are clear and uncontroversial. What might conceivably be considered controversial is the fact that some people have correctly pointed out that this analysis misrepresents the etymology of the word 危機.</p>

<p>Hi Arcadian! First I want to thank you for uploading images from Grey's. I'm a first year student (my final gross anatomy exam is on friday) and they've been a tremendous help in learning the material. I have a few things I wanted to ask you about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, please, archive this talk page. It's 124kb and my browser slowed to a crawl when I tried to type this into the page directly (I had to use my sandbox to write it)</li>
<li>I'm trying to find ways to make my contributions to the wiki anatomy and embryology articles more efficient. I know about WP:Anatomy, but do you have any other ideas or specific areas you think are deficient on wikipedia?</li>
<li>I've been finding errors in the seer.cancer.gov images you uploaded, one trivial and one serious. I don't know what to do about them... I don't know anything about deleting images and wanted to ask you about it.
<ol>
<li>The trivial one is <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Illu_lower_extremity_muscles.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Illu_lower_extremity_muscles.jpg">this image of the thigh extensors</a>, where the rectus femoris muscle is drawn lying deep to the vastus lateralis and vastus medius. It actually lies anterior to these muscles... the vastus intermedius would appear to run between the V-shaped arch formed by the fibers of the lateralis and medius, but only once the rectus femoris has been removed.</li>
<li>The serious error is at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brachioradialis.html" title="Brachioradialis">brachioradialis</a>, where <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Illu_upper_extremity_muscles.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Illu_upper_extremity_muscles.jpg">the seer image</a> shows the brachioradialis attaching to the medial epicondyle of the humerus and inserting on the ulna. Wrong! This appears to be an image of the flexor carpi ulnaris, though I haven't checked to make sure the insertion is right. There is an <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Gray528.png" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Gray528.png">alternate image of the muscle from Grey's</a>, but I don't like that it doesn't show the relative position of the thumb and doesn't have a medial-lateral label.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
