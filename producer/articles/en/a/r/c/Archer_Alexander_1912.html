<p><b>Archer Alexander</b> (<a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a>?) was a former black slave who served as the model for the slave in the statue, variously known as <i>Freedom's Memorial</i> and the <i>Emancipation Memorial</i> located in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Park_%28Washington_D.C.%29_be1e.html" title="Lincoln Park (Washington D.C.)">Lincoln Park</a>. He was also the subject of a moving biography, <i>The Story of Archer Alexander</i>, written by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Greenleaf_Eliot_9414.html" title="William Greenleaf Eliot">William Greenleaf Eliot</a>.</p>
<p>According to Eliot, Alexander was born in 1828 on the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> of a man known as Revered Mr. Delaney. Alexander's father was sold by Delaney to pay off debts while Alexander was still a child. Shortly thereafter, Delaney died and left Alexander to his son, Tom Delaney. Tom Delaney moved shortly thereafter, taking his slave with him. Alexander's mother, left behind in Virginia, died only a few months later. Alexander himself was hired out by Delaney to local brickyards in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, until he needed even more money, when he sold Alexander to a farmer named James Hollman who lived in the area on the border of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Charles_County%2C_Missouri_e233.html" title="St. Charles County, Missouri">St. Charles County, Missouri</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_County%2C_Missouri_f53b.html" title="Warren County, Missouri">Warren County, Missouri</a>. Alexander had married before this a slave woman named Louisa, and she accompanied him.</p>
<p>Alexander worked for Hollman for more than twenty years, and was sufficiently respected by Hollman that he gave Alexander the job of functioning in an overseer capacity on the farm. During this time, Alexander and Louisa became the parents of several children, some of whom Hollman sent away because of their behavior.</p>
<p>Before the onset of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, Alexander listened to the political discussion and determined that he would flee from his life as a slave if the opportunity arose. In 1863, Alexander covertly notified a group of Union troops that a bridge they intended to use had been sabotaged by Confederate sympathizers. He was shortly thereafter suspected of being the source of this information, and had to flee the farm. He was shortly later captured by slave catchers, but broke free from them and returned again to St. Louis.</p>
<p>He went downtown to look for work in one of the public markets. Eliot's wife was there as well, having come to hire a servant. She hired Alexander, and brought him home. Alexander proved to be reticent about his recent history, leading Eliot himself to suspect that Alexander was an escaped slave, which left him in an uncomfortable situation. He had some years earlier stated that he personally would never return a fugitive slave to his former master, and he nowed faced that very situation. He obtained a certificate to keep Alexander for 30 days, and quickly wrote Hollman, offering to pay Alexander from him. Hollman turned down the offer, vowing he would have the slave back.</p>
<p>Two day's before the expiration of his certificate, Alexander was found by some slave catchers Hollman had evidently hired. Eliot managed to find Alexander and keep him save until the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emancipation_Proclamation_d12b.html" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> was issued. Alexander and his wife were reunited, if only for a short time. In 1866, Louisa decided to return to Hollman's house for some things she had left there. Alexander would later find out that Louisa had died, two days after her arrival, of a mysterious disease.</p>
<p>In 1869, Eliot was working with a group to build a statue of Lincoln. Thomas Ball had an acceptable model made, but Eliot's group wanted to have a real freedman pose for it. Eliot gave Ball a photo of Alexander, and he was chosen as the model.</p>
<p>In 1876, the statue was unveiled, with several notable people, including <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, members of his cabinet, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Supreme_Court_e75f.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> and other notable government figures, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Douglass_7ab5.html" title="Frederick Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, another former slave, in attendance. However, neither Alexander nor Eliot were present.</p>
<p>Eliot was with his friend Alexander when the latter died in 1880. Eliot noted that Alexander died thanking god that he had died in freedom.</p>
