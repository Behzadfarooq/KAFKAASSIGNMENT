<p>Wikispam. The PMachines website looks impressive, there are 90000-odd Google hits on "ExpressionEngine," they look legitimate, I think it's a real product... but this article is still wikispam. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 01:33, 24 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: I'm on the fence about this one. Yeah, it's an advert, but the product very well may be encyclopædic.

<li>Keep - Comment: it absolutely is not an advert. I'm a user on said application, and upon finding very little information on it around the internet, I added it to the wikipedia. please note that there is also a movable type entry, which is not considered spam. is this simply because MT is a free product? <a href="../../../j/u/u/User%7EJuusan_7c07.html" title="User:Juusan">Juusan</a> 08:57, 24 May 2004</li>
<li>Looks fairly notable, comparison to <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movable_Type_1107.html" title="Movable Type">Movable Type</a> seems reasonable. I think this article could be salvaged.

<li>Lean towards delete. If you start excluding unrelated products, the 90K starts dropping rapidly; <i>"Expression Engine" -regular -advantage -tales</i> is down to 15K. Movable Type, on the otherhand, get4 MILLION hits. I am fairly anti-Borg, and in a forum where NPOV doesn't matter, would shamelesly plug alternatives. However, this is a self-admittedly new product, whose currency in the marketplace seems yet unproved. I guess I see the question as being, does WP want to be leading edge, or bleeding edge. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 20:54, 24 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Something is needed. Just hold all application reviews to a minimum standard whether open source or fee based. Specifically I turned to wikipedia for comparisons between MT, ExpressionEngine and Drupal. I did not see the original EE entry. My only question - is nothing better than something that is not perfect?</li>

No, we don't really <i>need</i> it, but I don't think we need to delete it. My first reaction was that this was some rank amateur who couldn't afford the webspace for a resume, but I don't think that's true. Under the name "Kim Kay Smith" she does show up as a model of apparently some note. We need to figure out which is <a href="http://www.webwombat.com.au/lifestyle/fashion_beauty/smith.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.webwombat.com.au/lifestyle/fashion_beauty/smith.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webwombat.com.au/lifestyle/fashion_beauty/smith.htm</a> , an Australian site, has a non-sock-puppety article praising her as the next IT girl. She's been on the cover of Maxim, as documented on the not-its-own-domain fan site <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/internet41/bio.html" class="external free" title="http://members.fortunecity.com/internet41/bio.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.fortunecity.com/internet41/bio.html</a> , several other magazines, assuming the magazine covers haven't been faked/Photoshopped and I don't think they are. Both sites say she (was) in the Victoria's Secret catalog, circa 2001. Whoa! <i>"Kim Smith" Maxim</i> yields a bunch of hits. 44,000 and most of them seem to be to her. The word "supermodel" seems to be being thrown around quite a bit. No, I'm not influenced at all by the fact that I find her pictures very attractive, no sir. Well, maybe just a little influenced. Oh, by the way, she's no relation. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 03:19, 23 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>The word "circumfetishism" is not in the American Heritage dictionary, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61" class="external free" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61" rel="nofollow">http://www.bartleby.com/61</a> and it only gets two Google hits (as of this writing... Google will probably pick up the Wikipedia article and its mirrors soon!). I don't believe there is such a paraphilia; if there is, the burden of proof should be on the article contributor to convince us that it exists. I believe the article is hopelessly POV, and cannot be rendered neutral. (I read it as implying a discreditable motive to advocacy of circumcision).</p>

<dd><i>circumfetishism:</i> Deriving sexual pleasure from the act of circumcision (hence also "circumfetishist"). Circumfetishism involves fantasies of power and control, which may be ritualistically acted out (so it should be distinguished from just eroticising the circumcised penis, as many women and gay men may do just for want of knowing any other). They may be active (sadistic) fantasies of circumcising, or passive (machochistic) fantasies of being circumcised, and the rituals, when they occur, of course involve both. Circumfetishists have at least one website and three clubs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are certainly a significant number of people of both persuasions. For example, letters to Forum magazine talk of using fantasies of the wife circumcising the husband (not carried out) for arousal, even going so far as to lay out a knife on the bedside table. A writer on alt.circumcision challenged all comers to wrestling matches, the winner to circumcise the loser - in front of the audience. Such people need a name.</dd>

<p>First things firstly, I have no sockpuppets. I despair, I commented about circumfetishists trying to censor reality on WikiPedia.Org. Three of my friends decided to help. the American Jerry Wayne Norton is the IP-address, Ixbalamis I believe a Newyorker, while Hugh Young is a Newzealander. If anything else, intactivists want to keep the article.</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid graphic images, but if any doubts that circumfetishists is a paraphilia, one should see <a href="http://SexuallyMutilatedChild.Org/" class="external text" title="http://SexuallyMutilatedChild.Org/" rel="nofollow">Sexually Mutilated Child</a>. <a href="http://SexuallyMutilatedChild.Org/" class="external text" title="http://SexuallyMutilatedChild.Org/" rel="nofollow">Sexually Mutilated Child</a> documents what circumfetishists do to boys girls and intersexuals. As an example, this is a <a href="http://sexuallymutilatedchild.org/mohel-1a.jpg" class="external text" title="http://sexuallymutilatedchild.org/mohel-1a.jpg" rel="nofollow">picture</a> about a circumfetishist fellating an infant whom the circumfetishist just mutilated. ¿Is mutilating and fellating infants normal? ¿Is this a paraphilia? ¿Do you wish to allow people with this paraphilia to move around our society invisibly, choosing their victims at will, or do you believe that we should expose them for what they are?</p>
<p>Circumfetishists like to reshade society in their own image:</p>
<p>Up until about three thousand years ago, Jews did not sexually mutilate. Then circumfetishists rewrote the story about Abraham. Sexual mutilation violates six Jewish laws:</p>
<ol>
<li>It causes unnecessary pain.</li>
<li>It is against Jewish law to attack others unprovoked.</li>
<li>It marks, mutilates, the body.</li>
<li>Theft is against Jewish law.</li>
<li>It is a homosexual act.</li>
<li>It violates the Sabbath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mohammed never mentioned circumcision, yet circumfetishist have most moslems believing that the Qoran requires sexual mutilation.</p>
<p>In the United States of America, circumfetishists made Americans believe that masturbation causes blindness and insanity, and the best way for preventing masturbation is genital mutilation.</p>
<p>Notice that in the Mideast, sexually mutilated Americans, Jews, and Moslems have nothing better to do than kill each other.</p>
<p>Circumfetishist have also convinced some Australian Aboriginies, Filipinos, Oceanians, and Africans that sexual mutilation is good.</p>
<p>Circumfetishism is an insidious threat to the children of the world.</p>

<p>I believe that we have seen plenty of evidence that circumfetishism exists.</p>
<p>Some of you do not like the way I write, I am an intactivist and an Esperantist. When I first tried to log into the WikiPedia.Org, the system changed my handle to&#160;?alabio. It should be Ŭalabio. Ŭalabio is Esperantic version of wallaby. If I knew that WikiPedia.Org could not handle UTF-8, I would have set up an account as Walabio, which is a transliteration of Ŭalabio.</p>

<p>"Circumfetishism" is a new word to describe something that has been noted since Biblical times, namely, that some people have a sexual involvement in circumcision.</p>
<p>Examples from the Bible</p>
<p>1 King Saul accused his son Jonathan of having a shameful relationship with David (1 Samuel 20:30). He tried to get David killed (1 Sam. 18:25). His method was to set him the task of collecting 100 Philistine foreskins as a dowry for his daughter(1 Sam. 18: 25). The fact that King Saul chose such a macabre task and his accusation that David and Jonathan had a shameful relationship is strong evidence that the dowry was sexual bait that Saul chose because he thought it would appeal to David's sexual tastes.</p>
<p>2 In the New Testament, the apostle Paul accused circumcision enthusiasts in the early church of a carnal involvement in circumcision (Galatians 5:13).</p>

<li>Keep, provisionally. Googling on "guff fart" yields 954 hits, mostly looking relevant and suggesting that the word really does have that meaning. As to where, the article says it's Scottish, and the Google hits seem to have reference to usage in the UK and Australia. Someone needs to check a reliable slang dictionary. I removed the unnecessary reference to the danger of ignition, since this is covered adequately in <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fart.html" title="Fart">fart</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighting_farts.html" title="Lighting farts">lighting farts</a>. We're left with a slang dicdef but, if verifiable, it's an interesting one which I hadn't known and am therefore reluctant to delete. Is this, in fact, the taboo origin of the legitimate word "guff, n, 1. Nonsense; baloney. 2. Insolent talk; back talk?"

<li>I vote against deletion of this genre because it obviously has some merit if it insights negativity towards it. I vote for keeping the genre as listed because there is nothing that suggest it doesn't exist. The explaination for fartcore has technicality to it and it shows the limited perspectives of other users who claim that "it doesn't exist". It is obvious that the entry was made to categorize a real group of genres, that were previously undefined. If grouping genres into a new genre is wrong, why are entries like Nu-Metal allowed to exist? Because you "Say" it is real? Again, I see no votes to remove many other musical genres which I find by default don't exist in of themselves. Some of those genre entries are based on misnomers and fallacies! Nu-Metal is not actually Metal for example. Fartcore, goes to describe something that "is as it is" instead of misleading someone to thinking its something else. <a href="../../../s/k/u/User%7ESkunkHunt_1f4d.html" title="User:SkunkHunt">SkunkHunt</a> May 25, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you mean the entry into wikipedia is not an article of itself? There must be an outside reference to a document talking about Phartcore somewhere? If there was an article of such nature, then what? Is voting against this genre mainly due to negativity in realizing that it might actually be true? Should example bands be mentioned in the wikipedia entry of Phartcore? I still retract to my original vote against deletion on the basis that it actually categorizes without misleading, where as some genres are misleading even in their own naming. Misnomer, or fallacies aside, I think its funny to be so offended by the rationality behind it, however silly it may seem, I take it seriously to defend this entry. I however, conceed to the Wikicommunity if it were to be voted out. I did not intend the entry to be a joke, but if it can't be updated to be compliant with "merit for retention", and get some kind of positive response from someone, go ahead and delete it.

I didn't just make it up at the spir of the moment. It was something I heard someone talking about at a music store.

You are merely a product of your own imagination, but since an imagination can only be a product of a concrete intelligence, then even your illusion of existence is only an illusion. You are, in fact, nothing more than the projection of an article composed entirely of moving electrons, insubstantial in and of themselves, which have coalesced to form the illusionary words phartcore and skunkhunt. When this article has been deleted, your illusion of your illusion will also cease to exist, but you, being nonexistent, will be unaware of that moment.
