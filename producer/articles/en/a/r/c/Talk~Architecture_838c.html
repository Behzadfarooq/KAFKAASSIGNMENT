<p>One thing that surprised me about the destruction wrought by hurrican Katrina on the Gulf Coast is that despite the fact that there were supposedly million dollar plus homes, they did not survive the tidal surge. Was that just negligence on the part of the architects? Aren't there reasonable ways to design survivable homes, at least in this price range? Do we really have to stop building in these coastal areas? Perhaps a section in this article that could point architects to the resources describing how this is done would be helpful.</p>
<p>On the subject of New Orleans, is there a way to construct buildings and infrastructure so it is less vulnerable to the flooding when it occurs? Perhaps on pilings or with 1st floor garages so that the damage is less? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 14:53, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps a better solution would be to live a less wasteful lifestyle? maybe consider living in a simple home, and using the rest of the resources as an emergency back up for such situations? I see architecture as well outside the reality loop when it comes to resource use. this is to some extent mirrored in society, where the rich minority of us (you have a computer? then you are one) use excessive amounts of resources, most of which we waste. --<a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENaught101_5571.html" title="User:Naught101">Naught101</a> 05:18, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Do we really have to stop building in these coastal areas? Perhaps a section in this article that could point architects to the resources describing how this is done would be helpful.</p>
<p>On the subject of New Orleans, is there a way to construct buildings and infrastructure so it is less vulnerable to the flooding when it occurs? Perhaps on pilings or with 1st floor garages so that the damage is less? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 14:53, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps a better solution would be to live a less wasteful lifestyle? maybe consider living in a simple home, and using the rest of the resources as an emergency back up for such situations? I see architecture as well outside the reality loop when it comes to resource use. this is to some extent mirrored in society, where the rich minority of us (you have a computer? then you are one) use excessive amounts of resources, most of which we waste. --<a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENaught101_5571.html" title="User:Naught101">Naught101</a> 05:18, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are more environmental concerns than just CO2, which some have also considered a fertilizer of sorts. Horses were considered a major environmental hazard at the time partially due to the short working life in heavy duty, and thousands of carcasses often left on the streets. The dung attracted flies and generated terrible odors, and created runoff water polution. The din of noise from iron horse shoes and the damage they caused to roads were also problems.

<dd>One of the implications of wealth usually is an increased ability to survive or protect against environmental insults. Are there reasonable engineering/architectural solutions to building and living in a storm surge zone. It is perhaps similar to the situation with earthquakes in the San Francisco area. The hills around there are undeveloped ostensibly due to the earthquake risk, which on the face of it, given the price of real estate and homeless problem (I would probably be homeless there despite my apparent riches), is obscene. With the wealth of their population, they SHOULD be able to develop those hills and relieve some of the housing pressure on the lower and middle classes, by letting those that can afford to, safely develope there. Are the engineering problems that intractable, that we have to leave these areas undeveloped, or is it cheaper to just simply rebuild after destruction in these areas? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 21:35, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not sure about the water pollution, it does sound pretty bad, but proper storm water collection, retention and reed-bed/mop crop filtration should ba able to sort this out. CO2 hangs around for about 100 years, and is only slowly re-converted into oxygen and carbon molecules. and this rate may be <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7964" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7964" rel="nofollow">less than previosly thought</a>. and if you are worried about hurricanes, storms, floods, heatwaves, cold snaps, firestorms, or any other climate-affected natural disaster, you should be worried about climate change, cause it's only going to get worse.</dd>

<p>Architecture in the context of the built environment surely has to include the fact that it is for human occupation in some way -- i.e., it is the subject of architects. While a cell might be used as a structural component by an architect, it is not going to form a liveable environment of itself, so I would disagree strongly with its inclusion. Furniture is on the border -- it can in some way be occupied by people. Designing cells should surely come under other uses of the word architecture. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStochata_acff.html" title="User:Stochata">stochata</a> 23:10, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>But I do not wish to engage you in a spurious metaphysical argument over whether a builder implies an 'intelligent' agent or not! Suffice it that <b>it is not how <a href="../../../b/u/i/Build.html" title="Build">builder</a> is defined by Wikipedia.</b> And there is also <b>a clear conflict with the definitions of <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built.html" title="Built">built</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built_environment.html" title="Built environment">built environment</a></b> which you seem to have chosen to ignore. The very next sentence contradicts your insertion. Since when does the <i>"Architectural design [of a cell] ... account for feasibility and cost for the builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the user"</i>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>In any case, it was merely to clear up the <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a>, and it's hardly mentioned later on.

</blockquote>
<p>But that's just the point— it clears up nothing; it just confuses things. I believe that at least 95 people out of a hundred would not assume that a cell had any intelligent builder other than God! Remember, this is for people looking for a definition of architecture who are not assumed to be conversant with modern cell biology.</p>
<p>DO YOU OBJECT TO MY CHANGING THE ARCHITECTURE PAGE TO THE DISAMBIGUATION PAGE? If you let me make that change, you can have the 'built' architecture all to yourself (except that I still think the reference to the cell as you have it is maximally <i>unesthetic,</i> and very confusing besides). <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormxxx_241f.html" title="User:Normxxx">normxxx</a> 00:21, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I object - I was simply presenting the context of the Greek word architecture. The Greek architects of their day, had they known about DNA and cells, would have very much considered structural biology architecture. Aesthetics indeed does not play so much a role in a cell, but is are not the structures precisely positioned? Do not let this dispute mess up the current page, I was just including it to define the scope of the <i>philosophy</i> of architecture in general. This leads up to any encyclopedic definition of architecture, which the article then points to the disambiguation page. I think that disambiguation headers should be made short and concise, and the instruction to look to the disambiguation for anything else other than building environments is implied beforehand.

<blockquote>
<p><b>I was simply presenting the context of the Greek word architecture.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I simply do not see that! Nor, apparently, does Stochata. The introduction of the phrase <b>artificial cell structures in structural biology</b> seems to come in from left field. If you really are trying to establish a context for <b>the Greek word architecture,</b> you'll have to provide a lot more explanation than these six words— which seems to strike everyone as inappropriately placed, <i>even after your explanation in the talk page.</i></p>
<p>Any arguments about the esthetics of a definition are purely subjective. Myself, I consider any definition that is confusing or wrong or inconsistent or incomplete to be unesthetic! That would also be the definition of esthetics from mathematics. And even a mathematical definition (much less a lexicographic definition) cannot be so concise it does not explain! <i>If concision were the sole criteria, even in mathematics, then there would be no need for mathematical proofs— the theorem would be assumed to immediately follow from the identification of the axioms from which it derives!</i></p>
<p>Moreover, you continue to ignore the clear conflict with the definitions of <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built.html" title="Built">built</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built_environment.html" title="Built environment">built environment</a>. <b><i>Do you intend to change those references or redefine those terms?</i></b></p>
<p>I was not planning to <i>mess up the current page;</i> I was only planning to make the opening page the <i>Disambiguation Page,</i> with this page being the page for "Architecture, built" or however you wish to qualify it. If you want it also to be Architecture, ancient" or "Architecture, philosophy" then you will have to expand on those latter topics. As it stands, it certainly does <i>not</i> offer sufficient coverage of the <i>philosophy of architecture</i> (the apparently arbitrary insertion of <b>six words</b> does not do it).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>This leads up to any encyclopedic definition of architecture, which the article then points to the disambiguation page.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that's a principal reason for my objections! It <i>first</i> points to the disambiguation page; <b>then</b> goes into an explanation which includes the phrase <b>artificial cell structures in structural biology</b> and no other references to any type of architecture other than <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built.html" title="Built">built</a> architecture or the architecture of the <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built_environment.html" title="Built environment">built environment</a>. <i>Your definition is maximally inconsistent.</i> An <b>encyclopedic definition</b> cannot be carried on the back of six (apparently) misplaced or inappropriately placed words!</p>
<p>Furthermore, <b>artificial cell structures in structural biology</b> follows the defining sentence, "Architecture (in Greek #### = start and #### = craftsmanship) is the art and science of <a href="../../../d/e/s/Designing.html" title="Designing">designing</a> <a href="../../../b/u/i/Buildings.html" title="Buildings">buildings</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structures.html" title="Structures">structures</a>."</p>
<p>The "art and science of <a href="../../../d/e/s/Designing.html" title="Designing">designing</a> <a href="../../../b/u/i/Buildings.html" title="Buildings">buildings</a> and structures." does not in any way relate to biological cells. Neither <a href="../../../d/e/s/Designing.html" title="Designing">designing</a> nor <a href="../../../b/u/i/Buildings.html" title="Buildings">buildings</a> in any way relate to the Wikipedia definitions of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> or <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell.html" title="Cell">cell</a> or <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_biology.html" title="Cell biology">cell biology</a>.If you look under <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structure.html" title="Structure">structure</a>, which has a very wide reference list, neither <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> nor <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell.html" title="Cell">cell</a> is listed. The list to which you append "<b>artificial cell structures in structural biology</b>" is meant to amplify the first part of that sentence which reads, <b>"A wider definition would include within its scope the design of the total built environment, from the macrolevel of town planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the microlevel of creating furniture"</b>. As <i><b>stochata</b></i> has pointed out, even <i>furniture</i> would be considered a stretch— but cells are beyond the pale. It does not fit with <i><b>any</b></i> of the preceding <i>definitional</i> words! (Also, you are not entirely free to introduce a few definitions which are entirely at variance to the Wikipedia definitions; you must modify all relevant Wikipedia definitions— even the disambiguation pages! Do you plan to go through the entire encyclopedia modifying definitions as you go? <b>Good luck!</b>)</p>
<p>(Moreover, you are taking liberties with the truth. We cannot as yet design, much less build <b>artificial cell structures</b> from scratch! <i>Although we can already mass produce viruses from scratch.</i> But viruses are little more than bundles of RNA or DNA; they contain no complex organelles. It took about a billion years or so just to get from prokaryotes to to eukaryotes. <i>And you can't get from viruses to either."

<p>We cannot, but that is the entire goal of structural biology. At present we can modify those structures, remove receptors, et al. I was just giving the example that architecture is the science and the art of creation and design of structures (which by the way, is listed under <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structure_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Structure (disambiguation)">structure (disambiguation)</a>. The entire thing about the built environment remains, and does not really conflict, because it focuses on the built environment, but the entire thing of furniture and cells was merely to define the scope of architecture <i>as an occupation</i>. This page suffices. We don't need separate pages (as of yet), especially since this architecture is so short. We might in the end, define architecture in general using <a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">Template:main</a>, focusing on construction, then having sections elaborating on the philosophy of design and construction that is architecture, as well as ancient. "Built" suits cells, whereas things like "information architecture" isn't really built (they are abstract systems) which is why it is listed as disambiguation. Perhaps, the dab header should be clarified to "this article is about the design of built structures", to which built structures may well range from the nanometric to the macroscopic. It is the introduction header, it can temporarily go off tangent from what the dab header precisely defines, because it says what it is <i>roughly</i> about, not what it is <i>precisely</i> about. Anyhow, thanks for your emphatic concern. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 20:47, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Normxxx, no I would rather see the disambiguation in the disambiguation page. The everyday usage of 'architecture' would seem to me the built environment architecture, and thus that is what the main architecture page should be about -- IMHO. I certainly wouldn't see cell biology as a part of the common conception. That the ancient Greeks may have thought differently (although we can never be sure) is not to my mind grounds for inclusion in a modern encyclopedia.

<dd>I think the opening on the disambiguation page is excellent -- you've done a thoroughly professional job. As for the <i>architecture portal</i>, I have the same reservations as you. I've avoided getting into discussion about it because I don't like portals in general, and so tend to ignore them completely!

<p>Let the disambig stay where it is - let me have a clarification: a disambig page is merely for ease of use for several topics with the same name. A lot of times, they are related. Therefore, they may be mentioned in the article, or even covered briefly in terms of "architecture", or perhaps how "architecture" has evolved with history. This would also add a feeling of comprehensiveness to the article, although yes we would have to modify it first. Perhaps, "this is about design and creation of structures" would be satisfactory, we could extend the modern definition of structure later (ie. transistors, organelles, etc.), while people who didn't want to go through all that would just skip to the disambig page. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 00:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the Main page should be left as the exclusive domain of the architecture of <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built_environment.html" title="Built environment">built environments</a> as currently defined by Wikepedia. Any changes to this definition would likely require a series of cascading definition changes!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the current article is unsatisfactory and actually just lists topics rather than discussing them in context of architecture as a whole. I feel this proposal would unify them, as well as providing a basis in which to integrate the topics. It would be mostly about the built environment, but mention other derived subjects <i>briefly</i>. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 03:54, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Feel free to re-do as you will; <b>but use the Architecture/sandbox until we have a consensus.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Earlier, I did not persue your comment about DNA not being a very "rough," step by isolated step instruction set, as I thought it inappropriate to persue that here. (And I remain firmly against the inclusion of any architecture in this Main page article not designed <i>by</i> humans or <i>for</i> human habitation— and no viable living cell has yet been designed by a human nor do humans inhabit cells.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Actually, the quaternary structure and the tertiary structure shape much of the cell. The plan is hardly very rough.</b></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But you have just proved my point! A blueprint contains virtually all of the information needed to construct a house. I doubt if 20% of the information needed to construct a cell resides in the DNA. Rather, the DNA relies on the laws of physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and protein physics and chemistry to supply the remaining information. (It is more like the plan of a city, which omits most of the details, and includes only a <i>very rough sketch</i> of the important stuff, e.g., the sewers and other infrastructure, since their placement need not be exact— only their relation to each other.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><b>DNA's correspondence to cell structure is highly intricate and shall I say, "beautiful", and is much an architectural science as it is a biological one.</b></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will not contest your vision of what is "beautiful" (though that's not NPOV), nor whether the structure of the cell has an <i>apparent</i> architecture. I would only point out that this page is otherwise exclusively devoted to the <i>purposefully planned</i> architecture of <i>human</i> architects and this inclusion is maximally confusing (unless, perhaps, you are a biologist).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Having thought about it, I see the merits of this revised proposal. So long as the derived subjects are dealt with in a subsection of their own, it makes sense for the overview to cover more than it does at the moment, and in more integrated fashion. I am sure this would make the overall content stonger. I am not sure that it needs much of a tryout elsewhere -- a self-contained section on derivations outside the built environment would probably be all that is required -- in fact, normxxx's intro to the disambiguation page might well be a starting point for it. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStochata_acff.html" title="User:Stochata">stochata</a> 16:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
