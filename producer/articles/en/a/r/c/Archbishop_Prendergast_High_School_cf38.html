<p>In September 2005 it was announced that the Office of Catholic Education of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia was implementing an administrative restructuring of Monsignor Bonner and the neighboring Archbishop Prendergast High School for Girls. Essentially, the schools would begin operating under one administration beginning in July 2006. Bonner's president, Rev. Augustine M. Esposito, O.S.A., Ph.D., was appointed president of the new co-institutional Monsignor Bonner-Archbishop Prendergast. The Principal of neighboring Archbishop Prendergast High School, Mrs. Mary Berner, was named Principal of the co-institutional school in January 2006.</p>

<p>The tract of land upon which sits <b>Monsignor Bonner and Archbishop Prendergast High Schools</b> was originally owned by Christopher Fallon, who in 1850 built an impressive octagonal mansion on the site. The house was named "Runnymede" from the Fallon family seat in Roscommon County in Ireland. In 1882, the unusual building was purchased by Colonel Anthony J. Drexel. Because of its grounds, gatehouse, and shape, it became a noted residence along Lansdowne Avenue. The mansion stood on what was called the hill of Drexel, and consequently the surrounding area became known as Drexel Hill. In 1908, the mansion tragically burned to the ground with only the gatehouse, which had served as servants' quarters, remaining.</p>
<p>In 1917, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia purchased the 33 acres for $57,000 and the Ordinary, Archbishop Edmond F. Prendergast, announced the construction of the new orphanage for five hundred orphans, to be run by the Sisters of Charity. The orphanage was to replace one which had been demolished because of the construction of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. It was to be called St. Vincent's Orphanage. Paul Monaghan was employed as architect and commissioned to build "one of the finest buildings in the diocese." Work on the project was slowed by the war, and Archbishop Prendergast died before the work was completed.</p>
<p>On May 9, 1920 the dedication took place. 40,000 people, accompanied by bands and musicians, walked from 69th Street to the dedication. Another 20,000 walked from the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in Lansdowne, and 65,000 more arrived by motorcar or by trolley from 69th Street. Archbishop Dennis Dougherty and Governor Sproul spoke to the 125,000 well-wishers gathered on the front lawn and along Garrett Road.</p>
<p>St. Vincent's functioned as an orphanage for over 30 years. By 1952 the number of children had dwindled. The Most Reverend John F. O'Hara decided to move the remaining orphans to a smaller building in Saint David's and to convert the home into Archbishop Prendergast High School for Boys.</p>
<p>In 1953, to meet the increasing demand for a Catholic high school in the expanding western suburbs, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia converted the vacated St. Vincent's Orphanage into a school for boys under the titled Archbishop Prendergast High School. Three years later a new building was erected on the same tract and named Monsignor Bonner High School in memory of Reverend John J. Bonner, the former diocesan Superintendent of Schools. Bonner then became a school for boys and Prendergast was designated as a school for girls.</p>

<p>The <b>Most Reverend Edmond Francis Prendergast (1843-1918)</b>, third Archbishop of Philadelphia, was born in Colonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland, on May 5, 1843. When he was 16, he immigrated to America and almost immediately entered the old Saint Charles Seminary at 18th and Race Streets. A talented student, he was ordained at the age of 22.</p>
<p>Father Prendergast served as assistant at Saint Paul's Philadelphia and in Susequehanna County. He soon became pastor of Saint Mark's, Bristol; Immaculate Conception, Allentown; and Saint Malachey's, Philadelphia. In 1895, he was named Vicar General of the Diocese and two years later Archbishop Ryan consecrated Monsignor Prendergast as Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia on July 6, 1911.</p>
<p>During his episcopate, which was short in years, his accomplishments were many. He was known as a master builder and a real estate genius. He increased parishes and parochial schools. He founded Saint Francis Country Home for Convalescents and Saint Edmond's Home for Crippled Children. Until his death in 1918, Archbishop Prendergast was esteemed by priests and laity as a friend and solicitous father.</p>

<p>Daughters true are we to Christ out King<br />
So in faith we hail His reign;<br />
And as subjects loyal, His praises strong we sing<br /></p>
<p>And allegiance pledge in refrain.<br />
In us traditions live, we eagerly display<br />
The colors the we raise aloft, the garnet and gray.<br /></p>
<p>Loyalty, devotion fill us everyone<br />
Purity of Mary, fairer than the sun;<br />
May our every action now pattern Mary's own.<br /></p>
<p>In our God and country, let us exult,<br />
Neath freedom's sheild advance.<br />
With His stength and teachings guiding the result<br /></p>
<p>Alma Mater fair enhance!<br />
To freedom's aid attend in forum or in fray.<br />
His soverign blessings fall upon the garnet and gray!<br /></p>
<p>May we, Alma Mater, faithful be to you<br />
As we tread life's pathways in thy radiance true,<br />
"Ut sim fidelis", our motto we renew.</p>
