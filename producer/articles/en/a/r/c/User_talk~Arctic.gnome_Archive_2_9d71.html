<dd>No problem. Articles like that don't work if people don't keep an eye on them. And what's this about the new season of Doctor Who starting?

<dd>The Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&amp;MA) which Harper is a member of is an Evangelical Protestant denomination. I have no proff if Harper actually is a member of the church, however, Harper was not raised in the United Church of Canada. In 1925, the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the Methodist Church of Canada merged into the United Church of Canada, however the Harper family remained in a Presbyterian only church while growing up in Leaside according to Lloyd Mackey's book, The Pilgrimage of Stephen Harper. <a href="../../../s/f/r/User%7ESFrank85_a96d.html" title="User:SFrank85">SFrank85</a> 18:13, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cheers. The temporary alternative would be to have Radio redirect to BBC Radio 2, and create Radio 2 (disambiguation). The top of the BBC Radio 2 page could then have <i>Radio 2 redirects here. For other stations named Radio 2, see Radio 2 (disambiguation)</i>. This might be better until all the links point directly to their correct articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple"><b>The JPS</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple">talk to me</font></b></a></sup> 16:14, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Only a few of the articles you assessed as such deserve the rating, and those should go throgh GA-review and peer-review first (that helps to smoothen out the articles too).

<dd>Sure, assessment is subjective (it's the reason why I told you about this instead of just changing the assessment).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Election timelines as a featured topic</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your comments on the above. My original plan was to nominate the federal, provinical and territorial lists together, but as more work has been done on the non-Federal lists, I was going to nominate those first. Good idea about the pre-Condfederation ones - they should definately be included. The main difficulty is finding sources on the net.</p>
<p>I'm wondering what to call the topic... I was planning on "Canadian provinical and territorial elections", but you're right, this would include articles on individual elections... I'm inclined towards just "Timeline of Canadian elections", but this doesn't feel quite right. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>While I remember: do you know of a potential reference for New Brunswick, PEI and Yukon lists? I haven't been able to find anything online, so I was wondering if you knew of any useful books/websites that could be used as references. (The orginal editor used a book from the library, which they don't know the title of).</p>
<p>For the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Canadian_elections_2b8a.html" title="Timeline of Canadian elections">Timeline of Canadian elections</a> article, I'm considering including federal elections (probably as a double-width column)... what do you think?

<p>I see that you're new to wikipedia and I don't want to be responsible for making your experience displeasurable. On wikipedia, we try to be careful about not violating copyright. In fact, the founder Jimbo Wales, has made a formal statement that we are to seek out free use images. In the case of this photograph, we have two sections of the same web site asserting different copyright. In this case, we need to make certain that one or the other is removed. Failing that, permission from both listed copyright holders would be appropriate. The ideal solution would be for a wikipedian to snap a photo of Stephen Harper and release it as their own work under a free license. You're not helping anyone by continuing this revert war with me. You're simply flooding the edit history of both the Stephen Harper article and the history of the image. This makes it difficult for future editors to make sense of the edit history and it will not achieve anything for you. Please be patient, let the admin staff review the deletion request and copyright information. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 23:26, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Timeline of Canadian elections</span></h2>
<p>Many thanks for your considerable input into the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Canadian_elections_2b8a.html" title="Timeline of Canadian elections">Timeline of Canadian elections</a> list, which has now made <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">Featured List</a> status :-) By the way, what was your source for PEI having 25 elections prior to joining the Confederation? It would be nice to get them listed at General elections in Prince Edward Island (pre-Confederation) or similar. (Although listing pre-Confed elections seperately causes problems of its own... see <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_list_candidates_List_of_New_Brunswick_general_elections_8a5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/List of New Brunswick general elections">Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/List of New Brunswick general elections</a>...).</p>

<dd>That's a rather backwards way of doing things. You should at least create an article stub. We have an article request list on our project.
