<p>This is a straw poll to see which proposals have high levels of support. The straw poll begins 00:32, 12 April 2006 (UTC) and ends seven days (168 hours) from that date and time. This is sort of like approval voting—you can support more than one proposal, and if more than one proposal has sufficiently high levels of support, we'll deal with that later.</p>

<li><b>Support</b>. There are so many subjects that are notable, but that do not have published sources verifying every fact. This proposal allows much <i>more</i> verifiability and citing sources. I just do not think that we are "...delete the WP:V policy while we're at it?"; indeed, I think that (given the information is (at least theoretically) publically available) it furthers the scope, whilst keeping within the spirit, of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<dd>Out-of-print sources are normally available in libraries, and thus through inter-library loans. If a source is very rare, then it shouldn't used in Wikipedia. The issue is how easy is it for editors and readers to chesck the sources for themselves. The availability of something that is found in major libraries, even if out of print, is orders of magnitude better than something that can be found only in one location. Reputable and reliable published sources have been through a vetting process, and have been available for reviewers and critics to point out weaknesses and problems. Material in an archive is unreviewed, not fact-checked by disinterested parties, and therefore unreliable. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 11:52, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I <b>strongly</b> oppose, yet with regret. The web is a wonderful vehicle for increasing the accessibility of knowledge, which is a good thing, and I can understand why some see Wikipedia as primarily a way of doing this. But the web has one huge problem: zero quality control. And quality control is absolutely essential for an encyclopedia. We do not avail ourselves of the mechanisms other encyclopedias rely on to ensure quality - such as an editorial board and requiring articles to be written by PhD.s and other widely acknowledged experts in a field - and I am glad we do not. Instead, we have our policies, and verifiability and NOR are absoluetly essential to this end. If we allow for original research, including drawing on material that is not easily verifiable, then we would have to turn to more conventional forms of quality control like editorial boards. I really do not want this to happen. And that means, vigorously adhering to our verifiability and NOR policies. NOR states that if someone wants their original research to be available for Wikipedia articles, they should publish it, and then it can be used. Same goes here. If someone wants to make material in an archive available, I suggest they seek a separate agreement with the archive to publish the archived material so that it is available to all.<a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:24, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I don't see the Hopkins material as <i>especially</i> problematic, I don't agree with changing policy in this manner. Material which has not been published has not, IMO, been adequately scrutinised. Primary source material is problematic enough in and of itself - it's easy to take an article in a technical journal out of context if you do not know the literature, and it's easy to misinterpret a historical source if you don't know enough about interpretation. Archival material needs expert interpretation in many cases. I could see the selective use of unpublished archival material being approved on a case-by-case basis, but I cannot agree with changing policy to allow anyone to do this. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:29, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong oppose</b>. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for new research and should not even be attempting to be on the edge of reliable knowledge.

I say this as someone who makes extensive use of archives in his personal research, but does not think that they are at all a viable model for Wikipedia articles.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. While there are occasions I wish I could do this myself, researching among unpublished primary source material is definitely Original Research in the Wikipedia definition. An encyclopedia is not supposed to be a place of first publication. For historical material, which it seems that this proposal is intended for, it is generally relatively easy to have a piece published in a local historical journal or the like, and I would suggest that this should be one's approach.

<li><b>Oppose.</b> I am sure there would be times and situations that would tempt me to support such a measure, but as others have said more eloquently than I can (I'll single out Slrubenstein's comments as particularly insightful, but I agree with many sentiments expressed above), Wikipedia by its nature depends on certain rules in order to function. Because of our unique position, the use of unpublished sources is simply unworkable, not because there is nothing good to be had from them (on the contrary, they might be very illuminating), but because the wiki model cannot accomodate them without raising problems that will quickly outweigh the benefits gained. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 04:46, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b>. (Aside to the above voter User:<s>Jwrosenzweig</s>Kaldari— Did you read <i>anything pertinent here</i>? If the information was important in the 'normal sense' it would have been published somewhere; this is important in a community sense and sensitive to and important to members of that small communitee.) Have to go with SlimVirgin and Mel on this in general, but the salient fact to me is <b>there is no editorial bar to surmount to archived data</b>. Some such papers could be the demented ravings of a discharged professor fired-for-cause because his work was so outré, but his papers would still be in the college archives. It could be something named the <i>Most Fabulous Cake Recipee Ever Invented</i> and a magazine editorial board would pant: "Great! Make us some." and the cookbook publishers editors would try it out the next weekend. Both would archieve it but never publish it as it tastes like warmed over dog turds. We badly need some sort of editorial board for certain types of articles hereon, but until we have a change of viewpoint from the Foundation level on downwards on that, the sword and shield of Wikipedia credability rests on published information meeting some reputable publisher's standards. I'm personally disinclined to accept most web cites out of hand, as many of those can't meet that test. And when they do, we can't guarantee they'll still be connected next week, much less in six months when someone comes along that knows more on the topic and casts the cite into question. I'd like to see all such excerpted and collected in a sub-page 'source materials' cross-referenced by the sentence they support in the article with matching footnotes, just because they do vanish, and if done properly, such extracts would have some context above and below the critical datum. Mel Etitis, SlimVirgin, and I have seen one such cite, on the surface a benign quote, but taken out of it's context, misconstrued and subsequently cause ten or so of us spend over a month of acrimonious edit wars and naming battles resulting in an unconscionable incalculable loss of man-hours. In closing, let me give kudos to the article and the hard work put in by it's creator, it is certainly high-quality. Perhaps a compromise thought, the better solution would be to allow certain subjects to meet a test of overt allowance—that is an RFC could be formulated, annoted with the research level performed, and request the body of editors as a whole to approve the article as the best attempt at compliance with WP:V, and that a specific waiver be allowed this article for it's subject matter versus WP:NOR, because, as in this specific case, the OR is the best kind— uncontroversial in fact, as well as the only available sources. At the least, the cited article will get some of the visibility it richly deserves.

<li>As someone pathologically fond of archives, it hurts to vote <b>oppose</b> but really there is no choice. This will cause more trouble than it is worth. However, I want to correct a statement made above several times. In the case of the major state archives, like the US National Archives, getting to see something is <i>easier</i> than finding an obscure book in a far-away library. Provided you have the precise catalog number, you can do it right from your desk (after fetching your credit card). So the obscurity of the material is not the right reason to oppose this proposal. I'm more concerned that there are too few editors who have the time and expertise to verify such a source, and also concerned about the fact that amateur interprettation of archival material is notoriously unsafe. We could think of some limited circumstances where it is fine, but defining them in general terms would be hard and this proposal is too broad. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 10:36, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that is precisely it: it is the amateur interpretation, and the fact that the authority of the archives themselves needs to be externally validated, which is the issue here. We use a lot of archives as root sources - Somerset House is the source for a lot of bvirth and death dates of notable Britons, for example - but we need to be sure that (a) it's the real deal and (b) we are not drawing unwarranted inference from those archives.

<li>In response to Northmeister's question, I would assume the controversy would be determined in the same way it is for other things on Wikipedia, community agreement. If one person reverts it without discussion, that's silly, but if a community thinks that citing "George Bush is a certified smelly-pants" with the <i>Archive of American Smellypants</i> then it should be reverted. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 01:10, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think I can support this unless it states that the cited material in the archive must be accessible (i.e., verifiable). It doesn't have to be online; doesn't even necessarily have to be open to the public. But if an individual requested to see the cited material, it should be accessible in some way. And I think it would help if it were made explicit that published materials on the same topic are preferred. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 01:15, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This poll seems premature. I can easily imagine that there may be cases where the use of unpublished archival materials may be fine to confirm or check some detail (such as a birthdate for a person), but mainly as a supplement to published sources and secondary sources. I think the proposal requires more discussion. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:42, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A comment: I do volunteer work at my alma mater Aquinas High School in La Crosse, Wisconsin with the archives. I just got finished moving 79 years worth of history in a room which became available. People do use the archives and it is accessible.

<li>Uppland, I'm always in favor of more discussion, but we just finished a slightly over a week long Request for Comment (open discussion) that was linked from all three involved policy talk pages and the CBB. What more discussion can be had (the RFC went stagnant at the end). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 11:42, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think this proposal is clear. What is "non-controversial" and what amount of "non-controversial" information is supposed to be allowed? I think verification of small pieces of data (such as a birthdate, as mentioned above) might be OK on a case-by-case-basis, but I am also afraid that this is a slippery slope. It is really better to publish stuff somewhere else first and then reference it in Wikipedia. I'm pretty sure most places will have a journal of local or regional history interested in a thoroughly researched article about some non-trivial aspect of the history of a school. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 06:28, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A question (after a long prologue...): without use of archives, many articles (particularly, but not exclusively, about schools) will have considerable problems finding enough verifiable sources to cite for their articles. Most schools are simply not important enough for someone to publish a book about them, particulary if they do not have an illustrious history. The best that one can often hope for - outside of archives - are internal school publications, such as school magazines, which often have low or non-existent historical research standards.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>One minor consequence of this is that they are unlikely to ever be able to become FAs, even though (in theory at least) any article that can survive an AfD should be potentially featurable. A major one is that these articles will often never be able to be as good as they could be at what they are meant to do: provide information. Now, I understand that Wikipedia is not a collection of truth, but rather notable, verifiable information. But what about things that are notable, true and verifiable if the archives were usable? I am thinking things like school histories. Some of the archival material requires no interpretation (eg a list of headteachers before 1900, say). But OK, some of it may require a degree of interpretation (eg a contradiction between two sources). And obviously, as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> says, these would not be allowed. So, my question is: <i>if not through unpublished archival materials, how are articles about schools et al. meant to find sources to cite? Or are they doomed to be short and non-FAble forever?</i> <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 00:15, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Ah, yes, an interesting question. I see a problem with your phrasing. My phrasing would be, if a school is not important enough for anyone to have published usable information about it, how can it be important (notable) enough to have an article in Wikipedia? A lot of our articles will never be featured articles. If you can't raise an article to FA status without OR and otherwise violating verifiability, then it shouldn't be an FA. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 00:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But that's a rediculously simplified version of how information works. Things can be notable enough to warrant articles that have <i>interesting features</i> that aren't published anywhere. For example, the major section sourced from the archives in Hopkins' school is the history of "The Hilltopper" mascot. It's too recent to be covered in the 1660-1935 chronicles, as the myth has far superceded the actual history so all the Hopkins' websites don't talk about it. Notability of subject does not mean all information on the subject will exist in published sources. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 01:07, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How do you prove notability without published sources? Remember, what is notable to the students and alumni of the Hopkin's school is not necessarily notable in the wider world.

There is a reason we have <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines</a>.

<li>Huh? Where have I pushed for such a thing? Once the arguement was made clear I removed every mention of the archives from the Hopkins School page. I don't want this for one article, I merely use this one article as an example as I am intimately familiar with it (especially for this topic). If <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_the_Goat_eb18.html" title="Bill the Goat">Bill the Goat</a> is notable enough for an entire article the Hopkins mascot is notable enough for a subsection mention under athletics. And given the mascot's recent but falsely remembered story there is no published source I can find despite searching that explains the actual history. The archive does. <i>This</i> is why the example is good, not because I have some feeling of ownership over the article or am too close to it, but because the archive provides accurate, uncontroversial information that is far more publicly accessible than some old out-of-print book (my link for the suggested requirement for proof of existence would be a page <a href="http://www.hopkins.edu/who/history/" class="external text" title="http://www.hopkins.edu/who/history/" rel="nofollow">like this</a> that provides a direct link to contact the archivist. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 01:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This whole <i>Notable</i> arguement is off target. If the article is well written, looks good, and feels realistic and reasonable, it's not going to be killed by Vfd (or Afd, whatever the fashion to call it now). That it can't be FA is a horse of another color, but hardly a reason to change a fundamental policy. But if it can't meet FA status so what? It merely joins most good articles herein. No one guaranteed me when I first logged in that every article I've started has a crack at FAC. It won't happen, because I have more interest in writing new one's than in polishing an older one to that high a state. Different strokes for different Folks, and all that. Too many editors to get in their two cents makes getting emotionally attached to any one body of work a self-flagelating loosing proposition. Easier on you to bang your head against the wall with great force for ten minutes—at least when you stop it will feel better! But fearing AfD for a good school article is borrowing trouble. As is changing policy because your heart and soul went into any one article. They're both much the same — unbalanced reactions without sufficient gravitas. <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 06:54, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
