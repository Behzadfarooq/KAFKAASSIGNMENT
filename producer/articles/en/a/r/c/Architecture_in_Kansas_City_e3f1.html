<p>The first <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">skyscraper</a> in Kansas City was the New York Life Building, completed in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>. It stands twelve floors tall at a height of 180 feet (54.8 meters). After the New York Life Building was completed, Kansas City followed the national trend of constructing a plethora of buildings above ten stories. Within fifty years of the building's construction, over fifty buildings over ten floors were built in and around downtown.</p>

<p>Kansas City underwent an early skyscraper boom between <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. During this time, notable skyscrapers such as the Power and Light Building, Oak Tower, City Hall, the Jackson County Court House, the Bryant Building, and the Fidelity National Bank building were constructed. The Power and Light Building became the sign of prosperity and was a known face of Kansas City for many years after its construction. Today, many of these buildings are being renovated for various uses, from <a href="../../../l/o/f/Loft_apartment.html" title="Loft apartment">residential lofts</a> to office spaces. Oak Tower was once a building filled with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_cotta.html" title="Terra cotta">terra cotta</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">gothic architecture</a>. In an effort to modernize the then-40-year-old building in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, however, <a href="../../../s/b/c/SBC_bffa.html" title="SBC">Southwestern Bell</a> tore down and placed <a href="../../../c/l/a/Cladding.html" title="Cladding">cladding</a> over its <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gargoyle.html" title="Gargoyle">gargoyles</a>.</p>

<p>Kansas City had a building boom in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> as the city geared up for what it hoped would be a glorious future based on <a href="../../../t/w/a/TWA_4722.html" title="TWA">TWA</a>'s plans to use the city as the world hub for its new fleet of <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a>'s and anticipated <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersonic_transport.html" title="Supersonic transport">supersonic transports</a>.</p>
<p>During this period <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_International_Airport_a6ae.html" title="Kansas City International Airport">Kansas City International Airport</a> was built to TWA's specifications so that <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gate_%28airport%29.html" title="Gate (airport)">gates</a> were within 100 feet of the street. <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallmark_Cards_eace.html" title="Hallmark Cards">Hallmark Cards</a> began construction of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Center_d05f.html" title="Crown Center">Crown Center</a>. The city also built the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartle_Hall_affb.html" title="Bartle Hall">Bartle Hall</a> convention center. Architect <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmut_Jahn_68a3.html" title="Helmut Jahn">Helmut Jahn</a>'s first major work was the revolutionary design for <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemper_Arena_b70b.html" title="Kemper Arena">Kemper Arena</a> which had no columns blocking sight lines and was built in 18 months in time to attract the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_Republican_National_Convention_0184.html" title="1976 Republican National Convention">1976 Republican National Convention</a>.</p>
<p>The optimism of this era came to a crashing end in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> when the Kemper Arena roof collapsed during a storm (although no one was injured) and when <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwalk.html" title="Catwalk">skybridges</a> at the new Hyatt Regency in Crown Center collapsed in the <a href="../../../h/y/a/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse_e6ee.html" title="Hyatt Regency walkway collapse">Hyatt Regency walkway collapse</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> in the worst non-natural disaster in the history of the state of Missouri. Both buildings were to be repaired and remain in use.</p>
<p>In addition to these disasters, TWA asked the city to extensively rebuild the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport_terminal.html" title="Airport terminal">terminals</a> at the newly opened Kansas City International Airport so that it could have central checkpoints. The airport renovations had already come in at $100 million over budget, so the city refused. As a result, TWA moved its hub to St. Louis. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the city finally announced plans for a $250 million overhaul of the terminals to accommodate the security issues.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the nation moved from the "<a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_architecture.html" title="Modern architecture">modern</a>" style of architecture (as inspired by architect <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe_fd65.html" title="Ludwig Mies van der Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>), building large, boxy structures, to a "<a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodern_architecture.html" title="Postmodern architecture">postmodern</a>" style. The two most noticeable postmodern buildings in the Kansas City skyline are the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_Pavilion_92fc.html" title="Town Pavilion">Town Pavilion</a> (built in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>) and <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Kansas_City_Place_c443.html" title="One Kansas City Place">One Kansas City Place</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>). One Kansas City Place is a taller, glass version of City Hall. The 632-foot-tall (192.6 meters) structure is the tallest habitable structure in Missouri (even taller than the <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gateway_Arch_0c56.html" title="Gateway Arch">Gateway Arch</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>).</p>

<p>Kansas City's most profound influence on national architecture is the Kansas City-style of stadium that first originated with the <a href="../../../k/i/v/Kivett_%26_Myers_3281.html" title="Kivett &amp; Myers">Kivett &amp; Myers</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> design for the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truman_Sports_Complex_d0a0.html" title="Truman Sports Complex">Truman Sports Complex</a> for the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Royals_78c3.html" title="Kansas City Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>. In an era when new stadiums were huge multiuse <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena.html" title="Arena">arenas</a>, Kivett &amp; Myers proposed <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> have their own arenas with dimensions most favorable to their sports and then covered with a rolling roof. Virtually all major league ballparks and stadiums since then have followed that model and most have been designed by one of two Kansas City architect firms that trace their stadium business roots to Kivett -- <a href="../../../h/o/k/HOK_Sport_%2B_Venue_%2B_Event_5b7d.html" title="HOK Sport + Venue + Event">HOK Sport + Venue + Event</a> and <a href="../../../h/n/t/HNTB_e5a9.html" title="HNTB">HNTB</a>. The firms' headquarters are a few blocks apart in <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Kansas_City_7bfb.html" title="Downtown Kansas City">downtown Kansas City</a>.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of any modern Kansas City building is its use of <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain.html" title="Fountain">fountains</a>. Kansas City calls itself the City of Fountains and has more than 200 fountains (with the claim that only <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome%2C_Italy_51f8.html" title="Rome, Italy">Rome, Italy</a> has more fountains). The <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logo.html" title="Logo">logo</a> for the city is a fountain. Virtually every major building showcases a fountain; probably the most famous fountains are the ones at <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauffman_Stadium_5f13.html" title="Kauffman Stadium">Kauffman Stadium</a>. Even car dealerships get into the act, sometimes showing off their <a href="../../../s/u/v/SUV_9cd0.html" title="SUV">SUVs</a> on top of a fountain.</p>

<p>Since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Kansas_City_7bfb.html" title="Downtown Kansas City">downtown Kansas City</a> has undergone a virtual <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a>. During the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, as many downtown residents moved south and north to Kansas City's sprawling suburbs, downtown's population dwindled. By the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, downtown Kansas City consisted mostly of office towers, with few thriving neighborhoods remaining. Today, however, major <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Kansas_City_Redevelopment_f6aa.html" title="Downtown Kansas City Redevelopment">downtown redevelopment</a> has brought back thousands of residents; with them has come a need for more buildings and more density.</p>
<p>In the winter of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, <a href="../../../h/%26/r/H%26R_Block_8c85.html" title="H&amp;R Block">H&amp;R Block</a> announced the construction of its new headquarters, a 17-story tower downtown. When completed, the tower will serve as the anchor of a six-block entertainment district neighboring the Central Business District. This project hopes to bring additional entertainment, jobs and housing to downtown; the project includes five new skyscrapers. At least five to six other new skyscrapers have also been proposed for downtown.</p>
<p>Local architectural firms have major contracts with these and other new proposals. The two biggest (currently under construction) are the Power and Light District, designed by Cordish Company of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_Maryland_9c87.html" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, and the 18,500-seat <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprint_Center_c05c.html" title="Sprint Center">Sprint Center</a> arena.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">October 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, ground was broken on the future <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauffman_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts_4d05.html" title="Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts">Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts</a> a 316,000 square-foot performing arts center.

<p>Along with downtown's redevelopment and revitalization, many older buildings are being restored to their former mystique. Below is a list of celebrated buildings from a variety of eras that have been or are being renovated.</p>
<p><a name="Landmark_Tower.2FOne_Park_Place" id="Landmark_Tower.2FOne_Park_Place"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_in_Kansas_City_e3f1.html" title="Edit section: Landmark Tower/One Park Place">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Landmark Tower/One Park Place</span></h3>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="../../../l/a/n/Image%7ELandmarktower.png_134e.html" class="internal" title="Landmark Tower, formerly BMA Building"><img src="../../../upload/d/d0/Landmarktower.png" alt="Landmark Tower, formerly BMA Building" width="300" height="292" longdesc="../../../l/a/n/Image%7ELandmarktower.png_134e.html" class="thumbimage" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Landmark Tower, formerly BMA Building</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This building is formerly known as the BMA Building. It is located south of downtown at the intersection of Southwest Tfwy and 31st Street, directly across from the <a href="../../../w/d/a/WDAF-TV_7aa0.html" title="WDAF-TV">Fox 4 News</a> building and towers.</p>
<p>Built in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, Landmark Tower was originally designed by architects at <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skidmore%2C_Owings_and_Merrill_19ee.html" title="Skidmore, Owings and Merrill">Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>, who also designed the Plaza Center Building at 800 West 47th Street. Its structural grid, which is clad in white <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgian</a> marble, is projected out in front of the actual building.</p>
<p>Landmark Tower also earned the First Honor Award in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> from the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Institute_of_Architects_51fe.html" title="American Institute of Architects">American Institute of Architects</a>. It was also featured in a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> exhibit by New York's <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Modern_Art_08fc.html" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>.</p>
<p>Renovation began in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. The only opposition occurred when developers wanted to build additional residential facilities inside the park adjacent to the tower. The developers from One Park Place have stated that the tower will hold between 150 and 200 residential units. Gastinger Walker Harden Architects is working with the developers on the renovations, respecting the original design, which was inspired by the "International" style.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_in_Kansas_City_e3f1.html" title="Edit section: The View">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The View</span></h3>
<p>"The View" is also known as the Vista Del Rio Apartments. Located at 600 Admiral Boulevard, it was originally completed in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. The architects of this building were John L. Daw &amp; Associates. The Vista del Rio was the first multi-story exposed concrete structural frame building allowed by federal specifications. It was also the first federally approved high-rise to use sheetrock for internal walls. It was originally built to inspire urban renewal in the previously dilapidated area; however, after a period of misuse, the building itself fell into deep disrepair. After much of its glass had been removed, it began to be used by more "troublesome" citizens. By the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, maintenance and care became so bad that graffiti appeared throughout the structure and, unfortunately, even human remains were found around the premises.</p>
<p>Many predicted the destruction of this neglected building, but at the beginning of current downtown redevelopment, its future became much brighter. The Vista Del Rio became the View, turning from a public nuisance to a magnet for people wishing anew to live downtown.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_in_Kansas_City_e3f1.html" title="Edit section: Fidelity Bank and Trust/909 Walnut">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fidelity Bank and Trust/909 Walnut</span></h3>
<p>This building is located at 909 Walnut Street (formerly 911 Walnut Street), in the north portion of downtown's Central Business District. Constructed in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> (at the same time as the Power and Light Building), it is 35 stories tall.</p>
<p>Originally built to replace the Fidelity National Bank and Trust Building that had formerly existed on that site, it was designed by Hoit, Price and Barnes Architects, the same firm that designed the Power and Light Building. It won a local American Institute of Architects award in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> during its construction. The twin towers that grace its top resemble those of famous buildings around the United States, such as <a href="../../../9/0/0/900_North_Michigan_0565.html" title="900 North Michigan">900 North Michigan</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> (built in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>), or the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel_f486.html" title="Waldorf-Astoria Hotel">Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> (built in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>).</p>
<p>The building once had a large clock in its north tower which has long since been removed.</p>
<p>In 2003, several proposals arose to turn this building into a residential tower. As of 2006, construction continues, but for the most part, the renovation is complete. The building now houses 150-180 residential units, complete with rooftop terraces for its two multimillion-dollar penthouses.</p>

<p>This Frank Lloyd Wright building sits across from the Country Club Plaza's main shopping district; it is located on Main at East 46th Street. In <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, the church came to Frank Lloyd Wright and asked him to design a new church building for them after their last building burned down. The design also had some features from his last building for the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnson_Wax_Company_0e77.html" title="Johnson Wax Company">Johnson Wax Company</a>, along with one additional unique feature planned for it: a spire of light.</p>
<p>This spire of light can be seen for miles around Kansas City, and even can be spotted 30 miles or more north of the Plaza, depending on conditions. It has been calculated to stop at least 3 miles up above the earth, about half the maximum height at which jet airplanes fly. The spire of light is one of the main features of the Plaza Lighting Ceremony; people can stand on the building's roof or balconies and overlook the Plaza and the light as they are all lit in unison. Unfortunately, Frank Lloyd Wright couldn't complete the Spire of Light due to conditions in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>. In the late 20th century, the Spire of Light was finally completed and it is now lit regularly, mostly on holidays, some Fridays, and during the Plaza Lighting Ceremony.</p>
