<p>As with other cities in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> has a history of great architecture. A <a href="../../../1/5/7/1574.html" title="1574">1574</a> document prepared for the Spanish ambassador attests to its wealth and fine architecture:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Limerick is stronger and more beautiful than all the other cities of Ireland, well walled with stout walls of hewn marble... There is no entrance except by stone bridges, one of the two of which has 14 arches, and the other 8 ... for the most part the houses are of square stone of black marble and built in the form of towers and fortresses.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Many examples remain in the city to the present day - though much has been lost also, through wars, decay and modern development. Present-day Limerick has perhaps not as extensive historical architecture as other Irish cities, though some very notable examples remain, such as the 800-year-old <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Mary%27s_Cathedral%2C_Limerick_629b.html" title="St. Mary's Cathedral, Limerick">St. Mary's Cathedral</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_John%27s_Castle_%28Limerick%29_ddb1.html" title="King John's Castle (Limerick)">King John's Castle</a>.</p>

The exterior of St. John's was completely refurbished in 2004, with new roofing and repointing of all stonework. The cathedral today cuts an imposing presence on an otherwise undeveloped side of the city centre. An important historical Protestant church sits near the cathedral also, and although in need of some repair, is now in use today by the <a href="../../../d/a/g/Daghda.html" title="Daghda">Daghda</a> dance company.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_Limerick_a479.html" title="Edit section: Georgian architecture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Georgian architecture</span></h2>
<p>Much <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_architecture.html" title="Georgian architecture">Georgian architecture</a> was evident in the city from about the <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800s.html" title="1800s">1800s</a> onwards. Although some has since been demolished, much of the city centre area is built in the Georgian fashion. St. John's Square, in front of St. John's Cathedral, towards the city centre, is an example of this. Stone-faced Georgian offices and townhouses were built in a planned fashion around this square. Although renovated in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, the area is now somewhat dilapidated.</p>
<p>One of Ireland's most celebrated museums, the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunt_Museum_bc0b.html" title="Hunt Museum">Hunt Museum</a> is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house an internationally important collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hunt_299f.html" title="John Hunt">John and Gertrude Hunt</a> during their lifetimes. On display are the 9th century Antrim Cross, a sketch by <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picasso.html" title="Picasso">Picasso</a> and a bronze sculpture of a horse, said to be from a design by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>.</p>

<p>As a city situated on a river (the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Shannon_1493.html" title="River Shannon">Shannon</a>), and at a crossing point, Limerick's bridges are of vital importance to the region. They connect the northern bank of the river, and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Clare_1390.html" title="County Clare">County Clare</a>, to the southern bank and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Limerick_f64c.html" title="County Limerick">County Limerick</a>. Apart from forming part of the Limerick to <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway.html" title="Galway">Galway</a> route, the crossings are important today in connecting <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shannon_Airport_d4f8.html" title="Shannon Airport">Shannon Airport</a> to the city and beyond.</p>
<p>The earliest bridge, Thomond Bridge, was built near a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_%28river%29.html" title="Ford (river)">fording point</a>. It was the scene of a failed defending of the city during the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Limerick_3d6b.html" title="Siege of Limerick">Siege of Limerick</a>. At one ends sits the Treaty Stone, upon which the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Limerick_f9dc.html" title="Treaty of Limerick">Treaty of Limerick</a> is said to have been signed. The current bridge was built in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>, replacing the earlier bridge which was also alongside King John's Castle. The bridge now forms part of the <a href="../../../r/4/4/R445_road.html" title="R445 road">R445</a> (formerly <a href="../../../n/7/_/N7_road.html" title="N7 road">N7</a>), carrying traffic on the <i>Northern Relief Road</i>.</p>
<p>Sarsfield Bridge is also a historic bridge, having been built around <a href="../../../1/8/2/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a>. Until the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, it was the main road bridge in the city. It is rather grander than the Thomond bridge, being wider and having balusters along the parapets, between which the river can be seen. Graceful lamp-posts adorn the walls. The style is borrowed from a bridge at Pont Neuilly on the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Seine_f512.html" title="River Seine">River Seine</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. The bridge is supported by a number of arches. At the southern end of the bridge, a simple flat deck with iron lattice railings crosses a canal and road. This section originally swung aside to allow river traffic to pass through from the Shannon to the Abbey River. This was converted to a fixed section in the early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. A boating clubhouse and a house stand on an island between the canal and the rest of the river. This is known as Sarsfield House. A statue to a local man lost in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimean_War_40b1.html" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a> was erected at this point. This statue was destroyed by the IRA in the 1930s and later replaced by a statue commemorating the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Rising_cc3a.html" title="Easter Rising">Easter Rising</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, the canal was reopened as part of the construction of a new marina beyond the bridge. New lock gates now allow boat traffic to pass below the bridge. A narrow road between the city's quays also passes below this portion of the Sarsfield Bridge.</p>
<p>The Shannon Bridge is by far the newest River Shannon crossing in Limerick city centre. It was built in the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, and connects to a relief road that passes through a bird sanctuary and runs around the north of the city. The bridge is still at times referred to as "The New Bridge", although the Abbey Bridge across the Abbey River is newer. For some time after its construction, the bridge was also termed "The Whistling Bridge" — the fencing on the bridge resonated with the winds coming up the Shannon Estuary, producing a shrill whistling sound. In extreme winds, the sound was quite deafening. Simple grills were added, and the effect was ceased.</p>
<p>Another bridge at the northern end of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Island%2C_Limerick_15ad.html" title="King's Island, Limerick">King's Island</a>, connects to Corbally on the north of the city. This is a simpler bridge, further up the Shannon. The only other road bridge across the Shannon near the city is the "University Bridge", at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Limerick_665c.html" title="University of Limerick">University of Limerick</a>. Opened in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> by An Taoiseach <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertie_Ahern_225c.html" title="Bertie Ahern">Bertie Ahern</a>, this fashionable modern bridge connects the recently commenced north bank campus (includes student villages/accommodation and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_Science_d4d9.html" title="Health Science">Health Science</a> building) to the main southern campus, but is does not serve as a public crossing point as there is no north bank entrance from the Clare side.</p>
<p>A "fourth" (referring to the city centre) river crossing is in the planning stages. A dual-tunnel under the Shannon is currently under construction as part of the southern ring road, along the lines of the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Lynch_Tunnel_2edf.html" title="Jack Lynch Tunnel">Jack Lynch Tunnel</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28city%29.html" title="Cork (city)">Cork</a>, but larger.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_Limerick_a479.html" title="Edit section: Architecture lost and found">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture lost and found</span></h2>
<p>Much of Limerick's architectural heritage has been compromised. The main streets in the city centre were originally fronted by mostly uniform Georgian <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townhouse.html" title="Townhouse">townhouses</a>. Nowadays significant gaps and oddities (out of place modern buildings) may be found, in addition to the dilapidated state of some buildings. The most recent example of a controversial demolition was the Cruises Hotel. This was the oldest hotel in Limerick; <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_O%27Connell_e9b1.html" title="Daniel O'Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a> himself stayed in it. It was demolished in or around <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> to allow Cruises Street pedestrian area. Sadly, the site of what was this illustrious building is now home to a <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a> and <a href="../../../h/m/v/HMV_faa8.html" title="HMV">HMV</a> music store on either corner of the street entrance.</p>
<p>Other areas of the city have similar tragic tales. Since the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Ireland has had somewhat tougher development requirements. This has resulted in an increasing number of Georgian and other historical buildings being refurbished rather than demolished. Shining examples include the conversion of a historic bank to an up-market <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub.html" title="Pub">pub</a>, also the conversion of old stone-built warehouses and Georgian townhouses to up-market apartments. These recent refurbishments of Georgian townhouses include cleaned brickwork, replica railings outside sash windows with brass catches, and new replica street railings. Until recently, the tougher development requirements have ironically resulted in tracts of wasteland on King's Island remaining undeveloped due complicated development work around historical remains of demolished structures. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">As of 2006</a> new apartment blocks continue to be built on the Island near the Abbey Bridge.</p>
