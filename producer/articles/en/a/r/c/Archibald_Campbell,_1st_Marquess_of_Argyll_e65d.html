<p>On the outbreak of the religious dispute between the king and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1637.html" title="1637">1637</a> his support was eagerly sought by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>. He had been made a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_Scotland_be71.html" title="Privy Council of Scotland">privy councillor</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1628.html" title="1628">1628</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a> the king summoned him, together with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traquair.html" title="Traquair">Traquair</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/x/Roxburgh.html" title="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a>, to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>; but he refused to be won over, warned Charles against his despotic ecclesiastical policy, and showed great hostility towards <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Laud_ce91.html" title="William Laud">William Laud</a>. In consequence a secret commission was given to the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Antrim_35db.html" title="Earl of Antrim">Earl of Antrim</a> to invade <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyll.html" title="Argyll">Argyll</a> and stir up the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Donald_d933.html" title="Clan Donald">MacDonalds</a> against him. Argyll, who inherited the title by the death of his father in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>, and had originally no preference for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a>, now definitely took the side of the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanters.html" title="Covenanters">Covenanters</a> in defence of national religion and liberties. He continued to attend the meetings of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland_97a8.html" title="General Assembly of the Church of Scotland">General Assembly of the Church of Scotland</a> after its dissolution by the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hamilton%2C_1st_Duke_of_Hamilton_a49f.html" title="James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton">Marquess of Hamilton</a>, when <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopacy.html" title="Episcopacy">Episcopacy</a> was abolished. In <a href="../../../1/6/3/1639.html" title="1639">1639</a> he sent a statement to Laud, and subsequently to the king, defending the General Assembly's action; and raising a body of troops he seized Hamilton's castle of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brodick.html" title="Brodick">Brodick</a> in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Arran_b9c8.html" title="Isle of Arran">Arran</a>. After the pacification of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berwick-upon-Tweed_7d36.html" title="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a> he carried a motion, in opposition to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Graham%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Montrose_052b.html" title="James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose">James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose</a>, by which the estates secured to themselves the election of the lords of the articles, who had formerly been nominated by the king, a fundamental change in the Scottish constitution, whereby the management of public affairs was entrusted to a representative body and withdrawn from the control of the crown. An attempt by the king to deprive him of his office as justiciary of Argyll failed, and on the prorogation of the parliament by Charles, in May <a href="../../../1/6/4/1640.html" title="1640">1640</a>, Argyll moved that it should continue its sittings and that the government and safety of the kingdom should be secured by a committee of the estates, of which, though a member, he was himself the guiding spirit. In June he was trusted with a Commission of fire and sword against the royalists in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atholl.html" title="Atholl">Atholl</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus.html" title="Angus">Angus</a>, which, after succeeding in entrapping the Earl of Atholl, he carried out with completeness and cruelty.</p>
<p>It was on this occasion that took place the burning the bonnie house of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airlie.html" title="Airlie">Airlie</a>. By this time the personal dislike and difference in opinion between Montrose and Argyll led to an open breach. The former arranged that on the occasion of Charles's approaching visit to Scotland, Argyll should be accused of high treason in the parliament. The plot, however, was disclosed, and Montrose with others was imprisoned. Accordingly when the king arrived he found himself deprived of every remnant of influence and authority. It only remained for Charles to make a series of concessions. He transferred the control over judicial and political appointments to the parliament, created Argyll a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess.html" title="Marquess">marquess</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/4/1641.html" title="1641">1641</a>), and returned home, having in <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hyde%2C_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon_4ab9.html" title="Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon">Clarendon's</a> words made a perfect deed of gift of that kingdom. Meanwhile there was a resort to force, an unsuccessful attempt, known as the incident, being made to kidnap Argyll, Hamilton and Lanark. Argyll was mainly instrumental in this crisis in keeping the national party faithful to what was him evidently the common cause, and in accomplishing the alliance with the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Parliament_c902.html" title="Long Parliament">Long Parliament</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1643.html" title="1643">1643</a>.</p>

<p>In January <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a> he accompanied the Scottish army into <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> as a member of the committee of both kingdoms and in command of a troop of horse, but was soon in March compelled to return to suppress royalists in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Civil_War_2a8f.html" title="Scottish Civil War">Scottish Civil War</a> and to defend his own territories. He compelled <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Gordon%2C_2nd_Marquess_of_Huntly_ab36.html" title="George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly">Huntly</a> to retreat in April, and in July advanced to abet the Irish troops now landed in Argyll, which were fighting in conjunction with Montrose, who had put himself at the head of the royalist forces in Scotland. A campaign followed in the north in which neither general succeeded in obtaining any advantage over the other, or even in engaging in battle. Argyll then returned to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, threw up his commission, and retired to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inveraray_Castle_dd26.html" title="Inveraray Castle">Inveraray Castle</a>. Thither Montrose unexpectedly followed him in December, compelled him to flee to <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roseneath.html" title="Roseneath">Roseneath</a>, and devastated his territories. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">2 February</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1645.html" title="1645">1645</a>, when following Montrose northwards, Argyll was surprised by him at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Inverlochy_%281645%29_f5b6.html" title="Battle of Inverlochy (1645)">Inverlochy</a> and witnessed from his barge on the lake, to which he had retired owing to a dislocated arm, a fearful slaughter of his troops, which included 1500 of the Campbells. He arrived at Edinburgh on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">12 February</a> and was again present at Montrose's further great victory on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">15 August</a> at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kilsyth_8c08.html" title="Battle of Kilsyth">Kilsyth</a>, whence he escaped to Newcastle. Argyll was at last delivered from his formidable antagonist by Montrose's final defeat at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Philiphaugh_5bcd.html" title="Battle of Philiphaugh">Philiphaugh</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">12 September</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a> he was sent to negotiate with the king at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_155c.html" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle</a> after his surrender to the Scottish army, when he endeavoured to moderate the demands of the parliament and at the same time to persuade the king to accept them. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">7 July</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a> he was appointed a member of the Assembly of Divines.</p>
<p>Up to this point the statesmanship of Argyll had been highly successful. The national liberties and religion of Scotland had been defended and guaranteed, and the power of the king in Scotland reduced to a mere shadow. In addition, these privileges had been still further secured by the alliance with the English opposition, and by the subsequent triumph of the parliament and Presbyterianism in the neighboring kingdom. The king himself, after vainly contending in arms, was a prisoner in their midst. But Argyll's influence could not survive the rupture of the alliance between the two nations on which his whole policy was constructed. He opposed in vain the secret treaty now concluded between the king and the Scots against the parliament, and while Hamilton marched into England and was defeated by <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Cromwell</a> at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Preston_%281648%29_93cb.html" title="Battle of Preston (1648)">Preston</a>, Argyll, after a narrow escape from a surprise at <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stirling.html" title="Stirling">Stirling</a>, joined the Whiggamores, a body of Covenanters at Edinburgh; and, supported by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Campbell%2C_1st_Earl_of_Loudoun_fbdc.html" title="John Campbell, 1st Earl of Loudoun">Loudoun</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Leslie%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leven_996e.html" title="Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven">Leven</a> and Leslie, he established a new government, which welcomed Cromwell on his arrival there on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">4 October</a>.</p>

<p>This alliance, however, was at once destroyed by the execution of Charles I on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">30 January</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1649.html" title="1649">1649</a>, which excited universal horror in Scotland. In the series of tangled incidents which followed, Argyll lost control of the national policy. He describes himself at this period as " a distracted man . . . in a distracted time " whose " remedies . . . had the quite contrary operation." He supported the invitation from the Covenanters to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> to land in Scotland, gazed upon the captured Montrose, bound on a cart on his way to execution at Edinburgh, and subsequently, when Charles II came to Scotland, having signed the Covenant and repudiated Montrose, Argyll remained at the head of the administration. After the defeat of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dunbar_%281650%29_b7e6.html" title="Battle of Dunbar (1650)">Dunbar</a>, Charles retained his support by the promise of a dukedom and the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Garter_59cd.html" title="Order of the Garter">Garter</a>, and an attempt was made by Argyll to marry the king to his daughter. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/6/5/1651.html" title="1651">1651</a> he placed the crown on Charles's head at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scone%2C_Perthshire_7209.html" title="Scone, Perthshire">Scone</a>, But his power had now passed to the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hamilton%2C_1st_Duke_of_Hamilton_a49f.html" title="James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton">Hamiltonian</a> party. He strongly opposed, but was unable to prevent, the expedition into England, and in the subsequent reduction of Scotland, after having held out in Inveraray Castle for nearly a year, was at last surprised in August <a href="../../../1/6/5/1652.html" title="1652">1652</a> and submitted to the Commonwealth. His ruin was then complete. His policy had failed, his power had vanished. In his estate he was hopelessly in debt, and on terms of such violent hostility with his eldest son as to be obliged to demand a garrison in his house for his protection.</p>

<p>During his visit to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Monck%2C_1st_Duke_of_Albemarle_9c28.html" title="George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle">Monck</a> at Dalkeith in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1654.html" title="1654">1654</a> to complain of this, he was subjected to much personal insult from his creditors, and on visiting London in September <a href="../../../1/6/5/1655.html" title="1655">1655</a> to obtain money due to him from the Scottish parliament, he was arrested for debt, though soon liberated. In <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cromwell_1316.html" title="Richard Cromwell">Richard Cromwell's</a> parliament of <a href="../../../1/6/5/1659.html" title="1659">1659</a> Argyll sat as member for Aberdeenshire. At the Restoration he presented himself at <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehall.html" title="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, but was at once arrested by order of Charles and placed in the Tower (<a href="../../../1/6/6/1660.html" title="1660">1660</a>), being sent to Edinburgh to stand his trial for high treason. He was acquitted of complicity in the death of Charles I, and his escape from the whole charge seemed imminent, but the arrival of a packet of letters written by Argyll to Monck showed conclusively his collaboration with Cromwell's government, particularly in the suppression of Glencairn's royalist rising in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1652.html" title="1652">1652</a>. He was immediately sentenced to death, his execution by beheading taking place on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="../../../1/6/6/1661.html" title="1661">1661</a>, before even the death warrant had been signed by the king. His head was placed on the same spike upon the west end of the Tolbooth on which that of Montrose had previously been exposed, and his body was buried at the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Loch_f511.html" title="Holy Loch">Holy Loch</a>, where the head was also deposited in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1664.html" title="1664">1664</a>. A monument was erected to his memory in <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Giles_High_Kirk_d0ab.html" title="St Giles High Kirk">St Giles's church</a> in Edinburgh in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>.</p>
