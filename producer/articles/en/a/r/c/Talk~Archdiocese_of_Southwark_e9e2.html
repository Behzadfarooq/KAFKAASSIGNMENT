<p>Instead of deleting these links why not put other ones in? Just because you may not like a particular parish does not mean it shouldn't be linked to from here.</p>

<p>The links to the Cathedral and the vocations website are both pertinent to the archdiocese so why remove them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>One either has an interest in making the encyclopedia entry as complete as possible, or one has an interest in promoting a particular viewpoint. The series of links posted by an anonymous and unregistered editor the other day made it clear that he.she was in the latter camp. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 23:40, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. Their presence did not by itself indicate a particular bias. Had they actually put in a statement or changed the article to promote a particular viewpoint you would be correct. The fact is they didn't and that even if they do support a specific view of the church the links were not objectively partisan. I for one favour an article that is as complete as possible. If we remove all links because we do not agree with them there won't be much left in wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoydosan_77f2.html" title="User:Roydosan">Roydosan</a></p>
<p>I admit I was in error to have deleted the links to the Cathedral and the vocations websites and am glad to see that they have been re-instated: I think that was clumsiness on my part, and apologise. The link that I had been keen to delete was that which was being placed on the page of most English diocese: a link to a Catholic organisation, but not an organisation that had any essential connection to those diocese. The same editor posted 2 links to parishes (one on this diocese, one in another): if his/her interest was in providing links from Wikipedia to parishes of the diocese, it would have been easy to link to the page on the respective diocesan websites that allows for that, but instead the links were to two of the small minority of parishes that cater for the liturgical preferences of that individual, as evidenced by his/her other postings. It is quite appropriate that the LMS should be linked from wikipedia pages that are specifically about Traditional Catholicism, but they are not relevant to pages about the individual diocese. Equally, I am sure that it is inappropriate to have a link there to St Bede's unless somebody intends expanding that section to include evry parish in the diocese with a website, although many would say that such a long list of links is equally inappropriate. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 19:01, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sure I have read this article elsewhere at some time: I cannot remember where, but I suspect that this is either a copyvio, or at the very least comes from a source that deserves to be cited.But even that is to assume that it is relevant, and I do not think it is. It is a pre-history of the diocese, not a history of the present entity, and I cannot see how the history of human settlement in the area where the cathedral is currently situated, nor the presence of Elizabethan theatres, can be held to be relevant to the history of a diocese that did not exist until 1850 and covers a far bigger area. The section is also heavily POV: even a page on a Catholic Diocese must be written so that it can be read equally comfortably by members of Opus Dei, the Free Presbyterian Church, or the Humanist Society: I do not believe that it meets that expectation. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 21:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nearly 3 weeks and no improvement: it would be my intention to delete this section in a week unless it is made much more relevant.<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 12:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
