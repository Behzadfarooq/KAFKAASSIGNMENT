<p>Archenbridge's two ancient universities are the <b>University of Dreybern</b>, established in 1248, and the <b>University of Derrynster</b>, established in 1561.</p>
<p>Archenbridge's ancient universities were self-governing academic communities founded by local scholars and learned ecclesiastics, and granted rights through provincial charters. The universities of Dreybern and Derrynster, along with Abingley in Lesteheim and Clydesmouth in Dommersclyde, were collectively termed the <i>Classical universities</i> due to their use of Latin and focus on the classics.</p>
<p>The Latin universities were dedicated to the pure pursuit of knowledge and study of the classics. They stood in contrast to the early <i>Imperial universities</i> (i.e. Tradon, Hantanford, etc.) which were public institutions under the control of the imperial government, and whose main objective was to train government officials and civil servants.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchenbridge_Universities_2cea.html" title="Edit section: 1600 to 1850">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1600 to 1850</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Imperial Carlington College</b> was founded in 1770. <b>Kettsmoor College</b> followed in 1802, and in 1815, Carlington and Kettsmoor together established the <b>University of Ansdorf</b>, then (and until 1994) a loose federation.</p>
<p><b>Hedgewin University College</b> began in 1817 as a small classical studies college modelled after Dreybern and Derrynster. It was granted university status in 1841.</p>
<p>During this era, the distinction between Latin and Imperial universities gradually blurred. In the late 1600s, Dreybern and Derrynster expanded their taught subjects to include more practical matters such as anatomy, medicine, law, and contemporary foreign languages (as opposed to Latin). Between 1700 and 1800, English - by then the common language of loosely governed Western Lorreschia - was adopted as the language of instruction for most practical subjects.</p>
<p>With the establishment of Carlington, an imperial institution, the distinction blurred even further as Dreybern, Derrynster, and Carlington exerted an influence on each other. For instance, Imperial Carlington introduced regimented written examinations to Dreybern, where assessment was previously conducted by oral interrogation or discussion of a dissertation. Meanwhile, the imperial institutions were granted greater freedom from governmental control and no longer existed solely to groom future officials. Kettsmoor, in particular, adopted the styles and collegiate customs of a classical university.</p>

<p>The university colleges of <b>Firthquay</b>, <b>Larkston</b>, and <b>Chestlion</b>, and the technical colleges of <b>Erryld</b>, <b>Manfred</b>, <b>Prettorwick</b>, and <b>Norringley</b> were all founded between 1850 and 1900. Erryld opted to join the still-federal University of Ansdorf; all the rest except Manfred were granted university status before 1900.</p>
<p>In 1916, Princes Manfred and Alistair directed funds to the establishment of university colleges in their names. <b>Manfred</b> and <b>Alistair Colleges</b>, originally sister establishments, soon took very different paths. While Alistair College joined the University of Ansdorf, Manfred became a polytechnic and would only later be granted university status.</p>

<p>In the 1910s, Manfred and other technical colleges were restyled polytechnics. New polytechnics were also built and some secondary schools converted to polytechnics in an effort to expand higher vocational education.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, <b>Manfred</b>, <b>Lettsborough</b>, and <b>Ketterley</b> were granted university status. They were to be followed by <b>Brossellon</b>, <b>Norringshire</b>, <b>Sylford</b>, <b>Shefferton</b> and <b>Derryshire</b> in the 1960s.</p>
<p>New universities founded since 1970 are <b>Kempa University</b> (1974), <b>Spenlow University</b> (1983), and the <b>Seawick University of Science and Technlogy</b> (1987).</p>
<p>The <b>University of Ansdorf</b> became a unitary university in 1994, after seven years of planning, integration, and cooperation between Carlington, Kettsmoor, and Prince Alistair colleges. <b>ECST (Erryld)</b> declined to join the unitary establishment and was granted its own university charter.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Medicine at Prince Alistair College is the country's largest medical school with an enrolment of around 4200 undergraduates and 1100 postgraduates. The annual undergraduate intake is among the highest in Europe: 410 MBChB candidates (310 first year, 100 advanced standing), 120 BDS candidates, and 350 nursing students. One out of every fourteen MBChB applicants in Skielanda (total 5600) is admitted to Ansdorf Med.</p>
<p>Ansdorf Med has consistently ranked within the top five nationwide, placing third at the last rating in 2005. High student numbers are matched by a teaching staff of 1650.</p>
<p><b>Faculty Buildings</b></p>
<p>Following the complete integration of Ansdorf University, all academic and research facilities of Ansdorf Med were unified in a single medical campus at Alistair College. The faculty's principal buildings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faculty of Medicine Kottimer Building - Houses three lecture theatres, classrooms, a clinical skills training centre, a dental skills laboratory, and most academic staff offices. This five-storey block (six storeys including basement) was completed in 1996.</li>
<li>Biomedical Laboratories Block - Houses laboratories, specialised medical units, and multidisciplinary research centres. Many staff offices are located here, as are sections of the Faculty of Life Sciences (Immunology and Infection; Medical Biochemistry). This eight-storey block was completed in 2002.</li>
<li>Medical Library Building - Houses the medical library, a lecture theatre, student study rooms, a cafeteria, and some administrative offices. This elegant red-brick building, built around 1890, was the Prince Alistair Medical School's original teaching centre.</li>
<li>Anatomy Building - Houses a lecture theatre, classrooms, several teaching laboratories, and storage space. Next to the Medical Library Building and built around the same time.</li>
<li>School of Nursing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The faculty also has offices and facilities in the Ansdorf Imperial Infirmary. A teaching centre for specialist fields is currently under construction adjacent to the infirmary.</p>
<p><b>Teaching Hospitals</b></p>
<p>Prince Alistair Hospital (adjacent to the campus) and Ansdorf Imperial Infirmary (Bernley) are Ansdorf Med's main clinical facilities. Both are general public hospitals with over 1000 patient beds. Ansdorf Med also operates at Palacians Hospital, Marberfield Hospital, Averborough Hospital, and a range of specialised clinics and medical centres.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchenbridge_Universities_2cea.html" title="Edit section: Accommodation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Accommodation</span></h3>
<p>The university realises that housing costs in Ansdorf are prohibitively high, and therefore strives to provide as many accommodation units as possible. All students who normally live outside a 60-km radius are eligible to apply for university accommodation. Accommodation is <i>guaranteed</i> to all such undergraduate students and all such first-year postgraduates.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Carlington - 2 houses, 615 units, none of which ensuite (near Carlington College).</li>
<li>In Kettsmoor - 2 estates, 6840 units, of which 1440 ensuite (near Kettsmoor College).</li>
<li>In Eppingate - 1 estate, 3888 units, of which 1728 ensuite (so. of Prince Alistair College).</li>
