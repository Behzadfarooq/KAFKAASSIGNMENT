<p>Archie Comics started out in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> as <b>MLJ Comics</b>, named after the first initials of its three founders: Maurice Coyne, Louis Silberkleit, and John L. Goldwater.</p>

<p>Early MLJ titles featured generic <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superheroes</a> remembered in the lore of comic collectors' trivia. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shield_%28Archie%29_0918.html" title="The Shield (Archie)">The Shield</a></i> was the first flag-themed superhero, a year before <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a></i>. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comet_%28Archie%29_ed72.html" title="The Comet (Archie)">The Comet</a></i> was the first superhero killed in the line of duty.</p>

<p>The <i>Hangman</i> (the <i>Comet's</i> younger brother) might be the most brutal superhero of the 1940s. <i>Roy the Superboy</i> preceded <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy.html" title="Superboy">Superboy</a></i> by half a decade, and <i>Steel Sterling</i> was dubbed "the Man of Steel" before <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a></i>. None remained popular. In 1941, a teenage humor strip called <i>Archie</i> began as a new back-up feature in <i>Pep</i>, replacing <i>Madam Satan</i>. Striking a popular nerve with emerging youth culture, Archie and his gang were such a hit that MLJ changed its name to Archie Comics in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, cartoonist <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_DeCarlo_d16c.html" title="Dan DeCarlo">Dan DeCarlo</a> ceased work on <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_Comics_%281950s%29_13f1.html" title="Atlas Comics (1950s)">Atlas Comics</a>' <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millie_the_Model_168c.html" title="Millie the Model">Millie the Model</a></i> and brought his influential style to the Archie Comics universe. DeCarlo is primarily responsible for the modern look of the Archie characters, and the creation of popular <i>Archie</i> spin-off comics <i><a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_32ff.html" title="Sabrina the Teenage Witch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../j/o/s/Josie_and_the_Pussycats_%28comic%29_b673.html" title="Josie and the Pussycats (comic)">Josie and the Pussycats</a></i>.</p>
<p>The enduring Archie legacy has spanned dozens of <i>Archie</i> titles, including <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin-off.html" title="Spin-off">spin-offs</a>, digest collections, and magazines focused on particular characters.</p>

The characters from Archie comic</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some of the odder series feature Archie and his friends cast as superhero versions of themselves or playing spies in a parody of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E._97a9.html" title="The Man from U.N.C.L.E.">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></i>. Some series, such as <i>Life With Archie</i> and <i>Archie at Riverdale High</i>, feature straight adventure and/or mystery stories.</p>
<p>In May 2007, Archie will debut what they call a more "dynamic", realistic art style, which will also feature longer serialized stories.</p>
<p>The <i>Archie</i> characters have been continually successful in other mediums since the comic's inception. The <i>Archie Andrews</i> radio program debuted May 31, 1943, and ran on various networks until September 5, 1953. The <i>Archie</i> newspaper comic strip was launched in 1946, and was drawn by Bob Montana until his death in 1975. In 1968, <i>Archie</i> was adapted into a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_morning_cartoon.html" title="Saturday morning cartoon">Saturday morning cartoon</a> series by <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmation.html" title="Filmation">Filmation</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Archie_Show_ecb6.html" title="The Archie Show">The Archie Show</a></i>. In 1969, the teen bubblegum pop band, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Archies_6146.html" title="The Archies">The Archies</a>, earned a gold record with their #1 hit "<a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar%2C_Sugar_3282.html" title="Sugar, Sugar">Sugar, Sugar</a>". In 1974, a network television pilot was made in attempt to bring a live-action Archie show but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the Archie characters were authorized for use in a series of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> comic books written and drawn by <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Hartley_d7ce.html" title="Al Hartley">Al Hartley</a> for <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spire_Christian_Comics_b04b.html" title="Spire Christian Comics">Spire Christian Comics</a>.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to revive MLJ's original superhero line, without success. Today, Archie Comics largely ignores its superheroes. Occasionally, some appear in their comics, if only for the sake of maintaining a trademark.</p>

<p><i>Archie</i> is set in the small town of Riverdale. The state, or even the general location of the town, is unclear. It is known, however, that John L. Goldwater went to school at <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horace_Mann_School_ac5e.html" title="Horace Mann School">Horace Mann School</a>, which is located in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in the <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdale%2C_Bronx_495d.html" title="Riverdale, Bronx">Riverdale</a> section of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bronx_bb96.html" title="The Bronx">the Bronx</a>. In the early years of Archie, Riverdale was located in Massachusetts, with Mr. Lodge being a senator for that state, but this is no longer considered <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>.</p>
<p>For the comics' 60th anniversary in 2002, several geographical and historical hints to the location of Riverdale were printed in every digest issue. At the end of the year, it was revealed that the hints point to Riverdale being located in the "<a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a> area," but that officially Riverdale has no location. It is essentially located wherever the reader wants it to be. Indeed, the geography of Riverdale is far too inconsistent for it to be any one specific location (see below).</p>

<p>Of all the parents, it is Veronica's father and Archie's parents who appear most frequently.</p>

<li>Archie's parents are Fred and Mary Andrews. Fred is pear-shaped, highly conservative, old-fashioned, and is losing his hair. He also plays the <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a> and was briefly part of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Archies_6146.html" title="The Archies">The Archies</a>.

<li>Betty's parents are Hal and Alice Cooper. They are typically the most relaxed and tolerant of the parents.</li>
<li>Jughead's parents are Forsythe Pendleton Jr. and Gladys Jones. His father is very slim. In older comics, Gladys is portrayed as a slim, older woman with a "needle" nose not unlike Jughead's, but more recently is usually portrayed as being younger, less thin, and with a nose normal in appearance.</li>
<li>Reggie's father is Ricky Mantle, editor of the local newspaper.</li>

<li>Penny is Jinx Molloys girlfriend. Her nickname is "Lucky Penny," and she seems to have a tendency to ward off Jinx's bad luck with her good luck. In one episode, everyone warns her about Jinx and his string of bad luck, but she still manages to find gold coins hidden under a tree. After finding her fortune, she takes a job as a model for an advertising company, which pays her a substantial amount of money.

<li>Ambrose, a small, clumsy boy whose hat always covered his eyes. He was the "tag-along" who never quite fit in with the gang, despite trying with all his might to help. He moved away from Riverdale. One comic has him visit the town; Archie, recalling how often he was rude and even mean to Ambrose, feared that Ambrose would want to get back at him-- but all Ambrose remembered was how Archie had included him in the gang.

<li>Fangs Fogarty, the town bully--"Fangs" over his prominent teeth. He, too, moved away. The comic that has him visit the town reveals he has had dental work that gave him perfect teeth, and that he now goes by the name "Smiley." He asks forgiveness for the terrible things he did as a kid.</li>

<p>Aside from very basic characteristics, many of the characters' traits, and even personalities, can change from strip to strip, usually depending on the writer. For example, usually Archie is very good at any given sport, but sometimes is the worst player on the team.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

Love triangle between Veronica, Archie, and Betty</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In certain strips, Betty does not mind being Archie's second choice as long as she gets a date with him on occasion, but in other strips is insulted when Archie considers her a second choice and responds with either anger or sadness. In addition, sometimes Veronica dominates Archie's love interest and Betty plays a distant second fiddle, while other times both girls seem to have Archie split 50/50 in a heated love triangle. Even though Archie's main love interests are Veronica and Betty, he often goes on dates with other girls; the vast majority of these girls only appearing once. Veronica and Betty also go on dates with other boys who only appear once.</p>
<p>There are some similar inconsistencies regarding the source of the Lodge's wealth: some stories depict Mr. Lodge as a self-made man who grew up in a poor part of Riverdale (thus wanting his daughter to study in a public high school to avoid making her a snob), while others depict the Lodge family as "old money" with a long history of wealth and a gallery of pictures of famous, wealthy relatives. One comic's punchline ends when Archie is trying to find out how Mr. Lodge gained his wealth with Veronica answering for him: "That's easy, when he married Mom she was worth $40,000,000 at the time."</p>
<p>There are also inconsistencies surrounding "Moose" Mason's character. In some issues he is portrayed as too dumb to solve the simplest math problem, but in other episodes he can complete in-class tests, win spots on knowledge-based game shows, and even place ahead of other characters in these shows. Other episodes describe him as having a learning disability, with the students being very kind and supportive. Midge, Moose's girlfriend, is usually respectful of Moose's limited intelligence, but has been known to make comments suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>Reggie Mantle is usually portrayed as being part of the gang (as a character that's sometimes mean and rude, but deep down is really a good person), but in other strips he is depicted as an outsider and is an antagonist to Archie and the gang. Similarly, Archie is sometimes depicted as a complete hopeless klutz of only average intelligence, while in other stories he is presented as being an extremely honest and good-hearted person, as well as being extremely moral (see the Christian comics produced in the 70's by Spire).</p>
<p>Each character has numerous relatives who have appeared once and never again. The inside of each character's house is almost always inconsistent. Other details will conflict between any two given stories. In <i>Archie's Double Digest #165</i>, Archie states that it takes a half-hour to drive from his house to Veronica's, which greatly contradicts the numerous previous implications in other strips that Veronica's mansion is only a few miles away from Archie's house.</p>
<p>As stated above, the geographical location of and size of Riverdale is always vague, and there have been a number of inconsistencies in this. Sometimes Riverdale is portrayed as being near enough to a beach for the gang to drive there; other times there seems to be no beach, as in a story where the gang are complaining they have nowhere to go on a hot day. Snow is very common in "winter" comics. Often the gang will be seen on seemingly impromptu and convenient ski holidays. This would suggest it might be somewhere in the northern states. One story has Betty, Archie and Jughead trying to escape a tornado, which would suggest Riverdale is in the Midwest -- Betty at one point says, "We shouldn't laugh about tornadoes in this part of the country." There is also one story in which Riverdale is shown on a small map as being in about the same place as <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moines_db34.html" title="Des Moines">Des Moines</a>, <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a>. Riverdale seems to be surrounded by farm land and woods, as well, but one story shows Archie and his father buying lobsters from an old fisherman who says to a critical Mr. Andrews that he should "either buy lobsters or do like I do on Sunday -- 'jes keep yer trap shut." Despite seeming to be an idyllic small town, occasional stories have taken part in a rough, seemingly crime-ridden part of town. But perhaps the most fitting choice of all for the location of Riverdale, if there can really be one, would be that it simply is a somewhat fantasized version of <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdale_NY_2730.html" title="Riverdale NY">Riverdale NY</a>, since that town is real and is only a few miles away from the actual headquarters of the publishers of Archie Comics, and also fits with all of the other clues given above except the presence of tornadoes and the small map. However, in the film adaptation it was plainly stated that Riverdale was located in California, contradicting all of the above evidence.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems that the writers of the comics have no qualms about changing facts to fit the story even at the expense of continuity. The complete absence of established <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a> is an often noted aspect of Archie Comics and may be a turn-off to fans of other comics who are accustomed to an established comic universe with strict canon.

<li>The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prom.html" title="Prom">prom</a> or some sort of dance is coming up and Archie cannot decide who his date will be.</li>
<li>Archie accidentally invited two girls to the same date at the same time, which he usually does not realize until the last minute. He tries to run between one date and the other without getting caught by either. Sometimes he is caught, sometimes he gets away with it.</li>
<li>In a variation of the above, one character may break a date to go with another person, but runs into that person while on the date and has to hide from them. Archie and Veronica are the usual offenders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A cash-strapped Archie attempts to borrow or raise money for an impending date with Veronica. Despite his best efforts, he either cannot pay for dinner or his jalopy breaks down. Veronica vows never to date him again.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Moose is jealous because Reggie is talking to his girlfriend, Midge. Moose beats up Reggie. Sometimes, Reggie has a plan that he thinks will help him get past Moose, or out of a beating (ie. Moose states Reggie will pay for kissing "his girl", Midge, and Reggie will give him money, or an <a href="../../../i/o/u/IOU_f73c.html" title="IOU">IOU</a>, but it backfires). Occasionally, it will be Archie who gets caught for some reason talking to Midge (almost always in a nonromantic way i.e. homework) , and chased or beaten by Moose.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Archie and his friends help Pop Tate get more business, or they prevent a greedy businessman from shutting him down.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Archie is late for school, accidentally breaks something, or disrupts class.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Weatherbee desperately tries to prevent Archie, Jughead, or both from clumsily disrupting or damaging the school when the superintendent visits. As if on cue, the boys accidentally blow up the chemistry lab. A variation on this theme has Mr. Weatherbee so obsessed with Archie not causing trouble, he brings it on himself, e.g. watching Archie's every move, he falls down the stairs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The boys challenge the girls or the Riverdale High faculty to game in various types of sports. The boys think it will be an easy win, but they end up getting defeated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A rivalry develops between the gang at Riverdale High and students at another high school (who are always depicted as being villainous) over a competition or athletic event. The rival students will cheat in an attempt to win and/or sabotage Riverdale High's efforts, but this would always backfire, allowing Archie's gang to emerge victorious.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jughead shows everyone an item that he claims endows him with great luck, and Reggie and/or Veronica are skeptics. But when all sorts of events occur that support Jughead's claim, they do everything in their power to steal it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Archie is at Veronica's house and ends up breaking countless priceless heirlooms. Mr. Lodge angrily kicks him out of the house.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An assortment of characters go to the beach. While there, Archie and Reggie love to look at the scantily clad women. Occasionally they organize "girl watching" contests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In true <i><a href="../../../t/h/r/Three%27s_Company_7568.html" title="Three's Company">Three's Company</a></i> fashion, one character eavesdrops on another and misinterprets what they're saying.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Archie learns that Betty or Veronica is spending large amounts of time with, say, "Billy," which causes Archie to become enraged with jealousy. However, by the end of the strip, we learn that Billy is actually a visiting cousin, neighbor's pet, or some other non-romantic and innocuous subject.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Archie (often dragging Jughead along) tries to "make points" with Mr. Lodge by doing chores for him, but fails miserably, causing Mr. Lodge to become very angry and damaging their relationship even further.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A character develops short-lived <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">paranormal abilities</a>, such as predicting the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Weatherbee, stressed out from Archie's antics, decides to go on vacation or visit a quiet, remote area of Riverdale to relax, but ironically ends up running into Archie.</li>
<li>Veronica abuses her wealth and connections in order to upstage Betty (for example, she flies to Paris and hires a renowned fashion designer to provide her with a dazzling dress for the prom, while Betty is left at home sewing by hand). Often, Veronica ends up dissatisfied with the results (for example, Betty independently creates an identical dress by hand).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pop, Mr. Weatherbee, Mrs. Grundy, or Ms. Beazley decide to retire, and Archie and the gang persuade them to stay. For members of the faculty, one variation has the person in question in fact retire, but their replacement proves to be so horrible that the gang has no choice but to convince them to come back.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Betty (in love with Archie) and Reggie (in love with Veronica) unite to try and sabotage Archie and Veronica's relationship</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The boys become lifeguards and have many adventures while saving drowning people and flirting with the women on the beach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jughead eats an incredible amount of food, often in a food-eating contest. People watching him are amazed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Veronica sees Betty and Archie together and develops a plan to separate them. The plan usually backfires on herself. Conversely, Betty attempts, usually without success, to separate Veronica and Archie. Can also happen with Archie and Reggie. One extremely common strip involves Reggie sabotaging Archie's sporting equipment so that he can win first place uncontested or play in the important game and therefore get all the girls. However, the plan backfires on him when the girls opt to take care of the injured Archie rather than Reggie the sporting hero.</li>
<li>Archie must cram for a test the next day but gets into a series of hijinks.</li>
<li>Veronica's father tries to introduce Veronica to men other than Archie. (Who, sometimes, might be clumsier or more annoying than Archie.)</li>
<li>Archie is assigned to do an errand, but he messes up along the way.</li>
<li>Middle-class Betty and wealthy Veronica wonder what it would be like to be in the other's shoes.</li>
<li>Archie and friends go on a vacation together.</li>
<li>Archie loses an important document that Mr. Lodge has asked him to deliver to a business associate. However, the document inexplicably still reaches its destination (i.e. via the wind), which causes a confusing moment for Archie when Mr. Lodge thanks him for a job well done at the end of the strip. Some minor variations occur.</li>
<li>Jughead runs away from women, especially Big Ethel.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that Betty sews her dress by hand and Veronica spends quite a bit of money on her own, they end up with the same thing and have a fight.</li>
<li>Reggie mocks Jughead's apparent stupidity or incompetence, then falls victim to Jughead's hidden cunning.</li>
<li>Betty investigates a strange occurrence in the area. Sometimes, she gets help from her friends, like Moose and Dilton, to solve the case.</li>
<li>Archie saves Mr. Lodge from being swindled by a crooked business associate.</li>
<li>Mr. Lodge is convinced that Veronica needs to learn to value money and forces her to get a job. After a series of occurrences, she is forced to quit either by her father or by being fired, and sometimes ends up spending more money than she would have made.</li>
<li>Archie and/or Jughead attend one of Veronica's posh social events and stick out like a sore thumb.</li>
<li>Archie decides to finally choose between Betty and Veronica once and for all (but never does).</li>
<li>Jughead shows Archie how badly he is treating Betty. Archie takes Betty out to dinner or to a movie instead of Veronica, who is incensed.</li>
<li>Cheryl Blossom decides to "slum it" in Riverdale and all the boys (especially Archie &amp; Reggie) flock to her, leaving Betty &amp; Veronica very jealous. The two always find some way to either A) run her off or B) keep Archie away from her.</li>
<li>Betty and Veronica compete for Archie's affections. Ex: Cooking for him, in which Betty always wins.</li>
<li>Jughead eats his friends (Archie, Betty, and Veronica) out of house and home.</li>
<li>Archie and Jughead's parents comment on how lazy they are and attempt to get them to either clean their room or do some sort of chore around the house.</li>
<li>Archie and Betty go to the beach where Archie is paying attention to all the other girls there (ie. looking, chatting up), rather than Betty. Betty thus tries to get Archie's attention away from the girls. The story usually ends with Betty getting her way.</li>
<li>Archie (sometimes Jughead) usually disrupts some con-men from stealing other people's money.</li>
<li>Archie begs for an allowance increase to no avail, and usually ends up getting the money anyways because his money making schemes cause more headaches and money for his parents.</li>
<li>Jughead does something to prove that he will do absolutely anything for food.</li>
