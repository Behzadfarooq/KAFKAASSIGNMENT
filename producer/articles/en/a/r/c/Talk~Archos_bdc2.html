<dd>Maybe some of the older machines are historically significant and one can make the case that it's not an advertisement if the item isn't currently being marketed.

<p>While I know Wikipedia is one of the best online fact sites here, I decided to add extras to this, by adding pictures and more descriptive terms for the products.</p>
<p>This was not advertising, it was merely keeping the article friendly yet informative. Yes I may well agree that "Your eyes are not deceiving you" sentence was a little over the top, This was purely to give the reader a more friendlier, positive approach.</p>
<p>I know that there should be no emotion but this was purely to give easier digestibility to the reader.</p>
<p>With regard to the (R) signs, as the company names are registered trademarked, this is a legal requirement to show this. This is in no way a form of advertising, it is merely a legal need.</p>
<p>As you are not happy with the article, I have reverted it back to it's original state from the 3rd of January 2006.</p>
<p>Thank you for your input anyway,</p>

I wonder who is make the Archos wiki page an advertisement? I dunno, may be Archos. I am partly of the Opinion that we should trim the article, or just add all the negatives about archos. Like their poor customer server. I guess that really would not be in the wiki spirit, but I hate it when people abuse Wikipedia.</p>

I think the article is still quite biased and contains little information that could not simply be found on Archos's website. As someone who has owned the AV380, AV480 and currently, the AV5100, there seem to be very few criticisms of these device, such as the difficulty in using these devices with an Apple Mac (they don't disconnect cleanly), the inability of the widescreen models (AV500, AV700 etc.) to record anamorphic widescreen broadcasts and then play them back in the correct aspect and the whole dubious nature of copyright infringement when recording television broadcasts or obtaining DivX/XviD movies from the Internet, Newsgroups etc..

<dd>Product list is pretty okay, since it can contain useful information about the products. But awards are just boasting.

<dd>Copying text verbatim from their website is copyright infringement. It's actually more useful to create your own text, with references to original research. Every product could therefore have at least a few lines that summarise what most reviews said about them, with references as footnotes and if there are criticisms, then some important ones must also be brought forward. Otherwise some of the product text would indeed read like an advertisement.</dd>

<dd>Photos of products should be treated by the same token.

<dd>I found a Dutch WP article on Archos actually has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nl:Afbeelding:Archos.jpg" class="extiw" title="w:nl:Afbeelding:Archos.jpg">properly-licensed image</a> of its product, so that could be used here instead of all those that are currently in here.

<dd>Are you sure those tags are absolutely necessary? They push the images below the bottom threshold and ruin the overall look of the article.

<dd>What does <i>below the bottom threshold</i> mean to you? Please explain.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of <u>free content</u> and not a wealthy corporation that could endlessly defend itself in court from copyright liability just because its users might think that it may use some images under a Fair Use license — as these images were copied from the Archos website and are therefore not free content. The problem is that most countries don't have the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_Use_83e7.html" title="Fair Use">Fair Use</a> provision in their copyright laws and many countries' copyright laws are even stricter than those of the U.S.</dd>

<dd>I apologize for not explaining. I just assumed it would be obvious by looking where the bottom of the body was in relation to the images, but maybe it appears differently when under other resolutions or rendered through different engines. Basically, the images continue far below the text. I know why the tags were created, but that is not what I was asking. Wikipedia recognizes <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> and a great deal of images it hosts are tagged with respect to the doctrine. I know the rationale under which the images are hosted, and if they were not allowed they would/should be deleted. Tags concerning the legality/licensing of images should be addressed on their respective pages. I have browsed the site for about two years now and this is the first time I've come across so many images with such captions; I wouldn't be so concerned if it didn't degrade the look of the article. Perhaps a single, all-encompassing caption would be sufficient, or a message only visible to editors.

<p>Recently the FCC leaked that they have appproved an archos 704. Here is the link <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/07/archos-705-mobile-dvr-with-wifi-unveiled-thanks-fcc/" class="external free" title="http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/07/archos-705-mobile-dvr-with-wifi-unveiled-thanks-fcc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/07/archos-705-mobile-dvr-with-wifi-unveiled-thanks-fcc/</a></p>
<p>since it is part of the 04 series it should definetly be mentioned somewhere Tenio 01:32, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also recently, due to a violation of the gnu/linux license (the GPL), the source code for some of the firmware in their 04-series players has been released. This is certainly important enough to warrant a note on the page (Archos' website link: <a href="http://www.archos.com/support/download/software/gpl_notice.html" class="external text" title="http://www.archos.com/support/download/software/gpl_notice.html" rel="nofollow">GPL software download page</a> 65.112.197.16 01:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
