The <i>CC-by-sa</i> license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, but it allows <b>other projects</b>, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiTravel_62d2.html" title="WikiTravel">WikiTravel</a>, to use our articles. Since you are among the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_8bec.html" title="Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits">top 2000</a> Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at <i>minimum</i> those on the geographic articles. Over 90% of people asked have agreed. For More Information:</p>

<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>. The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Option 1</b></dd>
<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:</dd>

<p>I can't do anything about this. There is a system at the moment where the following happens: 1) I block the name 2) an autoblock appears on the IP next time someone tries to use it to log in (the idea was to prevent socks)</p>
<p>Now I can undo the auto block but I have to wait until someone logs in from that IP and in this case no one did so before I went to bed.

<p>On some old maps I have it shows Ingleby Barwick as being a housing estate in the town of Thornaby. Although it as now grown in size, the council have not made it a town in its own right, so therefore it is still part of the town of Thornaby (although it is often disconnected with regards to signs etc...)</p>

<p>I don't understand your reasoning for changing "4th century AD" to "4th century". When used with a year, the era is placed before; when used with centuries, the era comes after. And while the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Manual of Style</a> says nothing about using AD, it does not explicitly forbid its use -- which I had added to remove ambiguity over the time Palladas lived. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 03:36, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, you're being no more pedantic than I am about the usage, &amp; your point is a good one, &amp; is why AD precedes the year. However, AD follows the century because of established practice -- it's what my copy of the <i>MLA Handbook</i> proscribes, &amp; every other Manual of Style (that I remember) that addresses this usage proscribes. Do you have a counterexample? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:01, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Arcturus. There is some debate over at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_UK_geography_cb92.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject UK geography">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject UK geography</a> (also spilling over into <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_95c3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (places)</a>) about what strikes me as the rather odd way Wikipedia currently arranges its county articles. While there will always be disagreements over the status of the traditional counties I think there is a case to be made on both sides of that old argument that our attempt at a compromise has been botched and is leading to all kinds of problems, and that we should think about taking a fresh look at our arrangements. I wonder if you'd take a look and perhaps add your comments if you have a view on the matter.

<p>Hello; I just wanted to commend you for providing some much-need common sense on the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_95c3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (places)</a> page.

I think that, with the recent revival of this discussion, and the greatly increased support for using a common-sense option (traditional counties) rather than the currently-prescribed administrative-cum-ceremonial mess since the last poll, reversing the current policy and imposing a better one is a realistic goal.

<p>I didn't really see them as controversial here (and, in fact, they aroused no controversy in what was an otherwise extremely controversial article). The MoS on this issue has been in a state of almost continuous flux since before I started editing here, and I've not kept up with its latest wording I'm afraid. My impression was that the style adopted in the article was a matter for editors in consensus.</p>
<p>It's true that my personal opinion is that the BCE/CE usage should be adopted by Wikipedia as the norm; it is in widespread use â almost 100% in academic texts, and in a high proportion of semi-academic and serious non-fiction, especially those concerned with matters of culture and, even more especially, of religions â and is preferable on theoretical (including NPoV) grounds. In this case, however, I was thinking only of the individual article â on a non-Christian place with non-Christian history, edited by mainly non-Christian editors who all seemed happy with the change. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">ÎÎµÎ» ÎÏÎ·ÏÎ·Ï</font>)</a> 07:44, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Arcturus, just wanted to let you know that I've just seen that my revert of your edit to 1970s was a mistake: for some reason I read your initial edit as removing the reference to the West as well as to the US.

<p>Hi, Arcturus. I don't know how to get involved in the discussion in the "undeletion" section, so I clicked on your name and am making comments on your page. I don't use your site much, but a few months ago, Lester Rodney directed me to a definition of the Daily Worker that included a hyperlink to his name, but no information. Since my master's thesis was on the Daily Worker's campaign to end segregated baseball, which then spurred some other research on Lester Rodney and the Daily Worker, he suggested that he and I put together an entry on your site to serve as his dictionary entry/biography. I don't know why it seems strange to you all that someone would want an authorized biography on your site, it is a practice in putting one together for both myself -- a history doctoral student -- and Lester. I have also written biographies that appear in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, volume 241 (Joe Bostic and Dan Burley -- and I am quoted as a source for the Lester Rodney piece in the same volume -- I did not have time to do 3, so I did the two I had not done before and let Mr. Klein do Lester, and I cited his biography in my Wikipedia piece). Lester likes getting the word out about his work on trying to desegregate baseball and against racism in general, and even though he is in his 90s he likes to take advantage of technology, so that is why it was important to him to have his bio done online. I want to stress that his name was hypertexted in the Daily Worker article, and if you all did not intend for there to be an entry on him, then why the hypertext??? It is important to me because, as a doctoral student, the more places my work appears, the better. I stated in an email to Andrew Gray that I obtained the proper rights to reprint or republish anything I have written on Lester from M.E. Sharpe, my original publisher, as well as from sportsjones.com, my original online publisher, but did not "lift" any of the information word-for-word from any of my other work. I mean, if what you all are accusing me of is plagarizing myself, the U.S. Supreme Court has already handled that issue, you can't plagarize yourself. I don't understand what all the brou-ha-ha is about this issue -- and no one will explain it to me personally. I write about Lester Rodney. I have written about him in the past. I have a vast storehouse of personal knowledge about him, and I know him personally. I wrote about him for your site because you had a hypertext of his name and no definition. I ended my article with citations towards other works written about Lester Rodney, by myself, my co-author (Chris Lamb), and others, including Irwin Silber and Robert Klein, who both cite me in their works on him. What is so hard to understand about that?? I think that this is making mountains out of molehills. All Lester wanted was to see a short bio on himself online -- and he and I worked on that. Why are you all so upset about it??? Sincerely, Kelly E. Rusinack 67.142.130.21 19:46, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Arcturus! I mean no offense, but it seems you are not really familiar with the guideline you've just put under my nose at <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novaya_Zemlya_b65a.html" title="Novaya Zemlya">Novaya Zemlya</a>. In general, and as a friendly tip, please always provide a link to the guideline you are quoting, even if you are sure your opponent knows where it is at perfectly well.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe the guideline you were referring to is <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>. However, if you would refer to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Disputes_over_style_issues" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">this particular section</a>, you would see that the geographic location of any article's subject has nothing to do with what spelling is used in that article, as long as the subject is not strictly British/American/Australian/Canadian-specific. The only <i>other</i> good reason to correct spellings is when an article uses different spellings interchangeably for no apparently good reason (usually when several editors with different spelling preferences edited the article without paying much attention to spelling consistency). Even then, the change should be not to the spelling <i>you</i> prefer, but to the spelling used by the first major contributor (as per MoS). Reviewing the article's history, one can see that the first major contributor, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a>, used American spelling when he started the article in 2002 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Novaya_Zemlya&amp;oldid=231123" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Novaya_Zemlya&amp;oldid=231123" rel="nofollow">see paragraph 2 of his initial contribution</a>: <i>1070 met<u><b>er</b></u>s</i>). Hence, as per MoS, the article is to retain American spelling from then on indefinitely, unless the United Kingdom annexes Novaya Zemlya, at which time the spellings will have to be changed&#160;:)</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I sounded snarkyâI tried my best not to. I hope I was able to explain what the guideline is really about. I would appreciate if you could revert your change back to the policy-compliant version.

The reason why I feel a table is superior is because a) it saves space because you can float the table to the side, b) it isn't content <i>per se</i> so I don't feel bad seperating it out, and c) it is tabular data, so the most logical place to code it is in a table. I moved the earliest and latest dates to the actual article about the feast. That information is trivia, and the article in question was Sacred Heart, not Feast of the Sacred Heart, so I felt this trivial content would be more at home at the proper article. Actually I just thought of something as well... I think the table and dates should be moved to the proper "Feast..." article. We don't have the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a> dates table on the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifix.html" title="Crucifix">Crucifix</a> or <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_egg.html" title="Easter egg">Easter egg</a> page, and we don't have the dates for the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feast_of_the_Cross_e074.html" title="Feast of the Cross">Feast of the Cross</a> listed on the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross.html" title="Cross">Cross</a> page. As long as we have a wikilink to the Feast of the Cross and a brief summary on the Sacred Heart page, there is no reason why we can't expand the feast page instead of making content redundent. hmm... maybe we should take this to the article talk?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi -- The <a href="../../../l/a/a/Laas_Gaa%27l_3ea7.html" title="Laas Gaa'l">Laas Gaa'l</a> article contains material that is in both of its two sources, which is why I put in two copyvio tags. It looks to me like the world66 wiki is a copyvio of the BBC site in one place, and in another place the WP article is plagiarizing material directly from the BBC site that doesn't appear on the world66 site (see the article's talk page). I've reinserted the copyvio tag referring to the BBC site.--<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.52.254.62.html" title="User:24.52.254.62">24.52.254.62</a> 20:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Situation is that the term <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> is confusing. It says so on the BI page, so it's not only me on this issue. The term "British Isles" is not universally accepted, and is seldom used by people in Ireland, and even the British Government and the BBC try not the use the term. So if it's good enough for all those 3 to avoid the term, then it's good enough for WP to avoid the term too. I am not questioning the existance of the term, just the usage.MelForbes 22:47, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup, sure are a lot of policies. You might find <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_Editor%27s_Index_to_Wikipedia_23cc.html" title="User:John Broughton/Editor's Index to Wikipedia">this</a> useful, although it's only an index.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your question of how I'd describe someone else's user page edit (or any edit, pretty much), my answer is that I'd avoid emotion-tinged words if at all possible. ("Vandalism" is a fact; that one I have no problems using.) I realize that this approach may sound like unilateral disarmament, but Wikipedia talk pages aren't like social scenes where failure to defend oneself verbally is seen as a weakness. If the purpose of Wikipedia is to build an encyclopedia, then introducing emotions and personal attacks is, itself, an indication of lack of comprehension, and a simple "Please observe <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>" (or <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> or whatever) demonstrates (to some of us, anyway) an ability to focus on the task at hand, despite distractions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the last edit that you mention, if you're talking about the reversion on Laurence's user page of the edit you did to it, I think the reversion was totally appropriate. <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> pretty much says that other editors aren't to touch the user page of another editor except in very specific circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, thank you for revising your last post on Laurence's talk page, though in the best of worlds I think you'd delete it entirely. -- <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:18px;"><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></font> | <sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">(â«â«)</a></sup> 19:28, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is currently a debate about replacing the existing UK place infoboxes with a unified one. I generally support this proposal but there is an attempt to remove the historic county information that a lot of people worked on and where a consensus was reached. I would appreciate your input into this.
