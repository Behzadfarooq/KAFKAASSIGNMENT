<p>I think you should delete that part of your edit. Articles need to be based on fact, not your own speculation; where is the source to back this up?

<dd>If this is my own speculation then I have done one hell of a job covering my bases. Arctic Monkeys rule, and if they're not number one on Sunday then it is a crime against music.<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi">Deano</a> 08:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well that's ok then, but why didn't you mention this in the first place? I get the impression that perhaps you are annoyed at me but last night you hadn't covered your bases and hence why I contested your edit.

<p>Does anyone know whether or not <i>Beneath the Boardwalk</i> is the same EP as <i>Five Minutes with the Arctic Monkeys</i>? If not, what is it? <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi">Deano</a> 22:43, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Beneath the Boardwalk was what "the sheriff" tagged the mp3 files as when he released them on his website <a href="http://www.ilovethesheriff.com/arcticmonkeys.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ilovethesheriff.com/arcticmonkeys.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (link was taken down) He was handed an EP by the band simply named <i>Demos</i> and decided to rename it to something more original. There was a thread about it somewhere on the old forum. I'm not sure whether it deserves a mention here. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafuffle_d15b.html" title="User:Kafuffle">Kafuffle</a> 09:27, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for that - I've put in a mention in the bit about "Rise to Fame" and p2p file-sharing. I think it probably deserves a mention gicen that most people will probably presume it is an actual album or EP. <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi">Deano</a> 15:15, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The title Beneath the Boardwalk came from where the recordings were.

<dd>As far as I know, although retagged "Beneath The Boardwalk" by a fan, the famous Arctic Monkeys demos were recorded across town at the (now fully booked) 2Fly studios by Alan Smythe, a friend and former band-mate of the Arctic's manager.

<dd>Spoke to Alan Smythe last night, and it was indeed he who recorded the famous demos.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fastest selling rock debut</span></h2>
<p>Despite what The Sun and other tabloids may say the first week figures for Definetly Maybe were surpassed by Elastica's debut the following year. I can cite no references on the internet for exact figures but a google search for elastica + "Fastest selling debut album" will show over 200 results. Before Oasis the record was held by Suede and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitchellStirling_c103.html" title="User:MitchellStirling">MitchellStirling</a> 01:56, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The whole paragraph is confusing. I thought Hear'say's debut had the biggest first week sales. Is it not Oasis who had the previous record for first day sales?

<dd>I've just looked at the BBC link from the article and it says that if it sells more than Hear'say then it's the fastest selling album in the UK ever. Surely that's the only point that needs to be made instead of confusing things with specific genres? --<a href="../../../f/o/z/User%7EFozi999_dc4e.html" title="User:Fozi999">Fozi999</a> 03:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the Oasis reference was mentioned a lot as the record was not expected to surpass they Hear'say figures and so the press at the start of the week were saying it was set to be the biggest selling UK rock debut beating Oasis' record.

<dd>I'm fairly sure I removed all the American commas when I did it originally - I can't see any more. The paragraph structure it this format is (IMHO) better that the standard because it better illustrates that the band's history is intertwined and that each overlaps with the others - they are not separate entities.

<dd>The addition of an "influences" section just ends up becoming a huge list of bands.

<p>To be fair though it mentions their contemporaries and not their influences. I can understand the need not to waste space in the article but actually I am not asking who they sound like.

<p>Note: I added the contemporaries page a while ago. It's a lot easier to compile contemporaries than influences, but I think it's fair to say that both Oasis and the Strokes are influences. Oasis was reportedly their favorite band at a young age (10 or so), and I'm pretty sure they started as a Strokes cover band.</p>

<p>Part of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy is that all arguments should be balanced and take into account all points of view. In this case, the accusation is that Arctic Monkeys release new music regularly purely to make more money and cash in on the success of their original record. The rebuttle is that, in fact, they release new music so that they don't have to play the same songs over and over again. The fact that money is not mentioned is irrelevant - it is still the counter-argument. Cook is implicitly arguing against any "money-making" suggestion, as explained. <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi"><b>DJR</b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjr_xi_f6e8.html" title="User talk:Djr xi">Talk</a>)</small> 11:15, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">split article</span></h2>
<p>Hi - as you may have noticed I've been doing a lot of work on this article over the last few days, and it's grown a fair bit in size. In order to keep the article within Wikipedia's recommended size limits but without losing content, I propose outsourcing certain parts into new, separate articles. I've given it some thought, and I propose creating two new articles:- <b><a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_members_cff7.html" title="Arctic Monkeys members">Arctic Monkeys members</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_tour_history_6c4d.html" title="Arctic Monkeys tour history">Arctic Monkeys tour history</a></b>. The reasons for my choice are twofold - firstly they are areas that involve very little overlap in their current form and will thus avoid repetition. Secondly, these are the two areas of this article that are least necessary within an article about that band, indeed there is always the opportunity to move content about the members onto their own individual pages.</p>
<p>If unopposed this weekend, I will <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and do it myself.

<p>It was widely reported that AM's sucess came from promoting their songs on MySpace. However, I have recently read an article that one of the members clearly states they had never heard of MySpace until they read about themselves in papers etc, and that their MySpace page was either set up by the PR guys in the record label, or fans of the band. I have been looking for the article but I can't find it, so I have not contributed to this Wiki.

<dd>The MySpace reports largely came from America where MySpace is the fourth most visited site on the internet. The verifiable information we have is that the band themselves are complete technophobes and did not do <i>anything</i> themselves. However, the demo CDs that they gave away were ripped onto PCs and shared peer-to-peer online. <i>At the same time</i>, Mark Bull made "Beneath the Boardwalk" available for free download on his site. MySpace does not come into it, and if you check out their MySpace site, you will notice that they have been members since August 2006 - a time when they had <i>already signed to Domino Records</i>. <a href="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArmsofengland.png_5227.html" class="image" title="COME ON ENGLAND!"><img src="../../../upload/thumb/d/d8/Armsofengland.png/20px-Armsofengland.png" alt="COME ON ENGLAND!" width="20" height="24" longdesc="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArmsofengland.png_5227.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi"><b>DJR</b></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_England.svg_855d.html" class="image" title="COME ON ENGLAND!"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/20px-Flag_of_England.svg.png" alt="COME ON ENGLAND!" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_England.svg_855d.html" /></a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjr_xi_f6e8.html" title="User talk:Djr xi">Talk</a>)</small> 10:05, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
