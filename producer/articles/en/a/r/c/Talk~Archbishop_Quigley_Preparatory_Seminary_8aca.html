<p>I believe that the list of "distinguished alumni" from Quigley's Web site consists of people who were official recognized by QPS as being "distinguished". There are others who attended QPS who may or may not have graduated who became distinguished, if not famous, in other fields. For example, my understanding is that Gene Krupa, the famous jazz drummer, and Marty Sheen, the actor, attended Quigley (at different times, of course). I don't have the references, but I wonder whether Quigely will archive all those records from the past 101 years, and make them available to scholars. That would be the sure fire way to verify this. RSzoc 18:22, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "Noted Alumni" on the Q. Wiki site are comprised of both those officially recognized by Q. as "distinguished alumni" (the addition of this official list to the Q. Wiki site is still not complete, but we're working on it), and those not officially recognized by Q. who have been added with documentation by participating editors. Anyone can add a "noted alumni" to the Q. Wiki site with documentation. The Quigley Preparatory Seminary 2006 Alumni Directory (see footnotes to this document in main text) lists most names of those who graduated, but not all who attended. Agreed that it would be great if Q. would release a list of all who attended as well, especially for the period up to 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Gene Krupa did attend a high school seminary, but it was St. Joseph's in Indiana--<a href="http://www.gkrp.net/genebio.html" class="external free" title="http://www.gkrp.net/genebio.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gkrp.net/genebio.html</a></p>

<p>Is there an error in the article? I thought Q North = Quigley, and that Q South was the only campus closed c. 1989. (Today's Trib article may have said 1990, by the way.) <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 03:16, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The above facts were clarified, with footnotes linked to sources. The student from the class of 2008 was removed, since he was placed obviously above Cardinal Egan in jest.</p>

<p>Colleagues, the recent changes to the alumni listing seem to be by some kind of hierarchical/alphabetical order, but whoever rearranged this section of the page using that method didn't finish the job. Previously, the alumni section was arranged in hierarchical/alphabetical order for living bishops, then by class of graduation for everyone else. Any suggestions?

<p>Karl Hench added back in. His connection to TV show Beauty and Geek seems to be verified per the Wiki site for the show. Can we verify that Andrew Sawa is the same Devon Sawa from the show? Ajschorschiii 04:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One advantage of placing the living alumni hierarchy on top, and the rest of the alumni arranged chronologically and by alphabet within graduation class, is that a reader can then get a sense of the tradition of the school. By arranging the entire alumni list by the order of cardinal/archbishop/bishop/monsignor/priest/deacon?/laity as a recent contributor did, we miss a certain sense of tradition being passed on. . . I suggest we make a compromise between hierarchy and chronology. Comments?Ajschorschiii 15:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have begun entering names and links from the official Quigley distinguished alumni web page, <a href="http://www.quigley.org/alumniq/DistAlumni/award.html" class="external free" title="http://www.quigley.org/alumniq/DistAlumni/award.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quigley.org/alumniq/DistAlumni/award.html</a>, into Quigley noted alumni section. Only 2005 names from this list had links. We need more facts about the entries in the official Q distinguished alumni page.</p>
<p>If there are no comments on the ordering of alumni by 12/15/06, I'll thereafter begin reordering the alumni in hierarchical/alphabetic order for living bishops only, and then return all other alumni to chronological/alphabetical order.</p>

<p>I propose that all changes to this Quigley Wiki page be made by those who sign in as opposed to anonymous IP address only entries, and that we try to document every single entry if possible. For that reason I'm temporarily taking the Timothy Nicholl (QN '75) entry off until someone signs in with a user name and puts him back in. Ajschorschiii 17:19, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An anonymous poster added Andrew Sawa, (AQ '03) back in, along with Mark Heneghan, (AQ'06). A. Sawa's connection to the Beauty and the Geek show now checks out per several websites. M.

<p>Should there be references to academics, sports, spiritul, student life, and other highlights within Quigley's history? e.g. Roger Pinon finished 9th in the state cross country finals, highest ever in Quigley history. Also, should we highlight faculty of Quigley, esp. those who have been there for over 10 years and alums returning to Quigley to teach? `P '02</p>
<p>I've added another section to the article below the alumni lists, entitled "Other Quigley Facts and Figures," where some of the sports records and other facts about Quigley can go that don't quite fit into the history narrative. These will be more difficult to document, however, if they are sports records, without some link to an outside verifying source. For example, an athlete being named "All State" or placing in a major race can be found in outside newspaper articles and these can be referenced. But internal school records are maintained by the school, and it would be hard to prevent someone from posting phoney records to the Wiki site, especially after Quigley closes, unless Quigley published some official list.</p>
<p>As far as adding faculty, we could add a historic faculty roster, but this could get very long, and go beyond the purposes of a Wikipedia encyclopedia listing. At some point, a historic faculty roster might be posted by the Quigley Alumni Association to its own website if there is interest. Anyone is free to add alumni to the "Noted Alumni" list on the Quigley Wikipedia site, but with some kind of documentation so that the entry is verifiable in keeping with Wikipedia standards.Ajschorschiii 23:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reference to mass once a week is incorrect. The content on the Quigley website has not been properly updated. Currently, there is mass 3 days a week built into the school's schedule, Monday morning prayer to begin the week and Friday afternoon prayer (as noted in the article change). Religion class, required, was changed to Theology approx. 5 years ago. Formations &amp; retreats are required of all students.</p>
<p>The above 1/12/07 edit was unsigned.</p>
<p>The paragraph mentioning the daily Mass requirement was edited to conform to the historic past tense, and moved to the bottom of the article so as not to interrupt the flow of the historic narrative above. Linking phrases were added to connect the Mass theme with Cardinal Mundelein's 1916 letter and John Paul II's 1979 exhortation at Quigley South. The editor making the 2001 entry should probably add some reference to document per Wikipedia standard the 2001 establishment of Mass three days a week at Q. Understood that this might have been internal archdiocesan communication, but eventually it may be available in archive if a dated letter.</p>

<p>Need to verify whether James O'Gara, (Q '36), was the same James O'Gara (1918-2003) who was the noted editor of Commonweal magazine for several decades. The birth date of the editor in 1918 from the obits and the Chicago origin and participation in Chicago's Catholic Worker jibe with the Q 1936 graduation date--<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_3_40/ai_110737048" class="external free" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_3_40/ai_110737048" rel="nofollow">http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_3_40/ai_110737048</a> If someone has documentation, please leave a comment, since this would be a very important addition.</p>
<p>Admittedly, noted graduates from the Catholic Action era (1930s-1950s) are easier to document, since their names appear in histories and in the public record. In order not to skew the historic alumni list in this Catholic Action direction, we need others to enter names from other eras and traditions.Ajschorschiii 02:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Need to verify that Msgr. Harry Koenig (ca. 1910-2002) was a Q graduate. Newspaper obits have him attending but he is not listed in the 2006 Q Alumni directory. Msgrs. Koenig and J. J.

<p>Added item under Facts and Figures on the question of whether Quigley alumni priests outnumber alumni attorneys per comments made in the press.

<p>An editor added the word "was" to the first paragraph. Since Quigley will not be closed until June, 2006, this word is not factual as of 4/1/07, and will be changed back to "is" until the actual date of closing. Also, items about the move of Archdiocesan offices to Quigley were already noted at the bottom of the article, so some of this language can be moved below so as not to make the article seem like an article about archdiocesan offices.
