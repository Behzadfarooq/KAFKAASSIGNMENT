<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Manning_4f03.html" title="Edit section: Ole Miss">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ole Miss</span></h2>
<p>In the first national prime-time broadcast of a college football game (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_in_sports.html" title="1969 in sports">1969</a>), Manning threw for 436 yards and three <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touchdown.html" title="Touchdown">touchdowns</a>, also rushing for 104 yards, in a heartbreaking 33-32 loss to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_7e4c.html" title="University of Alabama">Alabama</a>. But despite his considerable talent, the rest of the team was not at his level, and the Rebels only had a record of 15-7 in his last two years. In his college career, he threw for 4,753 yards and 56 touchdowns and ran for 823 yards. He scored 14 touchdowns in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. In both <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, he was named to the All-<a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Conference_3deb.html" title="Southeastern Conference">SEC</a> team and his #18 jersey was retired by Ole Miss. Manning was elected to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame_85e4.html" title="College Football Hall of Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1989. Manning's legacy is honored to this day on the campus of Ole Miss. During his time at Ole Miss Manning was a brother of <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Nu_cd05.html" title="Sigma Nu">Sigma Nu</a> Fraternity.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Manning_4f03.html" title="Edit section: NFL career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NFL career</span></h2>
<p>After college, he was selected in the 1971 NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints with the second overall selection. The Saints were at that time – and throughout Manning's stay there – one of the worst teams in the league, and Manning's supporters have often said that this was the reason that his career was less successful than it otherwise might have been. It seems very likely that if quarterback sacks had been an official statistic throughout his NFL career, there would probably have been more recorded against him than against any other player.</p>
<p>Manning played for the Saints for ten full seasons, none of them winning. In 1972 he led the league in pass attempts and completions, and led the NFC in passing yards, though the team's record was only 2-11-1. In 1978, he was named the NFC Player Of The Year by UPI after leading the Saints to their first non-losing season. They finished 8-8. That same year, Archie was also named All-NFC by both the UPI and <i>The Sporting News</i>.</p>
<p>Manning was selected to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. He went on to conclude his career with the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Oilers_dada.html" title="Houston Oilers">Houston Oilers</a> (1982-83), and the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> (1983-84), where the teams posted a collective record of 6-35. He ended his 13-year career having completed 2,011 of 3,642 passes for 23,911 yards and 125 touchdowns, with 173 interceptions. He also rushed for 2,197 yards and 18 touchdowns. His 2,011 completions ranked 17th in NFL history upon his retirement.</p>

<p>Manning continues to make his home in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a>, though he also owns a condo in <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford%2C_Mississippi_81a8.html" title="Oxford, Mississippi">Oxford, Mississippi</a> which he relocated to following <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, and he is involved as an analyst with the Saints' <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> and preseason <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> broadcasts. He can also be seen as a commentator for <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> Sports' college football broadcasts. He is the father of three sons, Cooper, Peyton and Eli. Archie has also been utilized as a <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">commercial</a> spokesman for products in Southeast Louisiana, where he remains popular with many fans.</p>

<p>Cooper Manning, Archie's oldest son, was born in 1974. The only Manning brother not playing professional football, he was a standout <a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide_receiver.html" title="Wide receiver">wide receiver</a> at the <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isidore_Newman_School_3ffa.html" title="Isidore Newman School">Isidore Newman School</a>. During his senior year he was selected to the all-state team, the same season his brother Peyton started at quarterback as a sophomore.</p>
<p>Cooper was heavily recruited by <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_I_94db.html" title="Division I">Division I</a> schools Texas, Virginia and <a href="../../../o/l/e/Ole_Miss_01ea.html" title="Ole Miss">Ole Miss</a>, but was diagnosed with <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_stenosis.html" title="Spinal stenosis">spinal stenosis</a> in 1992.</p>
<p>After a successful surgery in 1993, he eventually graduated from Ole Miss and entered the business world as an oil and gas stock trader. Cooper married Ellen Heidingsfelder in 1999 and together they have three children, a daughter named May born in 2002, and two sons, Arch and Heid, born in 2004 and 2006, respectively. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
