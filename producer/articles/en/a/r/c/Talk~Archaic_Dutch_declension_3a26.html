	    <p>þThis page pertains mainly to an invented (by linguists) Archaic Dutch Declension system which was never in popular use. To this extent the article is about 100 years out of date at least. This declension system was prescribed in writing (it was never used in the spoken language) by linguists who felt Dutch should be more like Latin grammatically.</p>
<p>Besides, like the article Archaic Dutch Declension, this is not at all an accurate description of the Declension System which was prescribed the Dutch in the 1800's. This article is full of errors. Regarding its errors please see <a href="../../../d/u/t/Talk%7EDutch_declension_ArchiveADD1_8212.html" title="Talk:Dutch declension/ArchiveADD1">Talk:Archaic_Dutch_Declension</a></p>
<p>These errors notwithstanding, Modern Dutch these days in both writing and speech in fact has a much simpler system of declension and inflection which is nothing like this.</p>
<p>The article on Archaic Dutch Declension appears to have been merged with this one and this whole thing is very misleading.</p>
<p>It desperately needs an overhaul! It either needs to be corrected and re-titled "Archaic Dutch Declension" or re-written totally to reflect the Modern Dutch situation. But I'm not going to do this if someone's just going to come along and revert everything the next day.</p>
<p><br />
Modern Dutch has only one active case: common case; two genders: common and neuter; two numbers: singular &amp; plural and two adjective inflections: -e and -Ø (ie no/zero ending); one indefinite article; two definite articles etc. etc.</p>
<p>EG:</p>
<ul>
<li>de man, de vrouw, het kind - de mensen</li>
<li>de goede man, de goede vrouw, het goede kind - de goede mensen</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>een man, een vrouw, een kind - (Ø) mensen</li>
<li>een goede man, een goede vrouw, een goed (Ø) kind - goede mensen</li>
</ul>
<p>All other declensions and inflections for oblique cases are archaic [such as "den goeden kinde" (to the good child), "eener goede vrouw" (of a good woman) etc.] and used and recognized to about the same extent that English speakers would use/recognize archaic English declensions such as "þæm godum childe" (to the good child) or "anes godes wifmannes" (of a good woman). (In other words, not at all.)</p>
<p>Finally this article should be titled "(Archaic Dutch) Morphology" not "Declension". "Declension" only refers to how nouns and adjectives show gender and case by taking endings, "inflection" refers to how nouns and adjectives show number by taking endings. These two taken together, are called "morphology".</p>

<p>A lot to read, and a lot to learn!</p>

Yes I do know a lot about Dutch as I am 1) a native Dutch speaker [you seem to imply I do not 'know' (sic) Dutch] and 2) have a university degree in Linguistics, majoring in the History of Germanic Languages, specalizing in the History of Dutch Grammar. Just because articles appear in Wikipedia do not make them correct. Which is why I refer to the Van Dale Groot Woordenboek as my source and make these comments here for discussion (I haven't made any edits as yet by the way - but unless you can provide PROOF otherwise, the factual accuracy of this article is still disputed). That's the whole point of Wikipedia. In any case, the articles in the Dutch Wikipedia are by and large correct (to the extent anyway that it pertains to the invented system of the 1800s which was officially abandoned by the Taalunie in the 1950s). The article HERE is NOT the same. It has additions which are incorrect, such as the section on the indefinite article. You have a Dutch name so I assume you are Dutch, like me. Don't assume just because I write here in English that I'm not a Dutch native speaker. Saying "A lot to read and lot to learn" is rather arrogant I think.</p>
<p>And I would happily bet $1000 that if Govert Morevield is a native Dutch speaker, that unless he wanted people to laugh at him or look at himstrangely, he wouldn't dream of speaking Dutch using sentences such as, for example, "Ik heb vandaag mijnen besten vriende wat geld geleent." or "Ik heb vandaag in eenen Nederlandsen krant gelezen dat de president der Verenigde Staten der koninginne der Nederlanden over de vriendschap der twee landen gesproken heeft." Hence, I rest my case.</p>
<p>As I stated in the Talk page for Archaic Dutch Declension (which article has now merged with this one) for an accurate description of the real Dutch declension system as it functioned when it was in fact productively used [as opposed to the one described here which is an invented system made up by prescriptive linguists in the 1800s to make the language more 'Latin', as Latin was seen to be more noble, and was never productively used by Dutch people) please refer to: <a href="http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/publicaties/taalgeschiedenis/en/mnlcasus.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/publicaties/taalgeschiedenis/en/mnlcasus.htm" rel="nofollow">The Middle Dutch case system</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This is an article written by a faculty of Dutch Linguistics appearing on a University Website. And if that's not a reliable enough source on Dutch Declension then I really have nothing furter to add.</li>

<p>I am surely a native Dutch speaker, and you are right that I wouldn't say sentences like "Ik heb vandaag mijnen besten vriende wat geld geleent." or "Ik heb vandaag in eenen Nederlandsen krant gelezen dat de president der Verenigde Staten der koninginne der Nederlanden over de vriendschap der twee landen gesproken heeft." (by the way, it should be "geleend"). That's why the article states which forms are archaic and which forms aren't. If you want to write an article about the Middle Dutch Case system, please do, since I'm very interested (I am not being ironic).</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovert_Miereveld_9907.html" title="User:Govert Miereveld">Govert Miereveld</a> 15:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article does not really clearly distinguish which forms are current and which forms are archaic. It gives the impression of there being a fully-fledged declension system in Dutch, which although archaic, is still latently accessible to Dutch speakers, in the same way that Middle English forms such as "thou wert, he worketh" are latently accessible to English speakers. This is not true. The average Dutch speaker would have no idea how to "use" this Declension system if presented with it. As far as modern Dutch declension goes this whole article is kinda redundant - there is in any case already a fine article in Wikipedia about <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_grammar.html" title="Dutch grammar">Dutch grammar</a>. To that end this article is confusing. It should just be left as "Archaic Dutch Declension System". Calling it "Dutch Declension System" gives the distinct impression that this is a declension system which is currently in use, whether latently or not, by Dutch speakers, whereas it's not and never even has been (except in formal writing). This was my first point originally. My second one is that the article, as it stands, contains factual errors which I've discussed at Talk:Archaic Dutch Declension, which have not been addressed. Yet my tag keeps being removed. However, I've already lost interest in this discussion, so, good luck&#160;:)</p>
<p>If you still don't believe me, can I cite a passage from J.M Hoogvliet (1909), Elements of Dutch, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner and Co. which, although almost a century old, is an excellent one to keep in mind when it comes to this article:</p>
<p><i>The "official" grammars of our language contain many things, which are not at all in accordance with the real state of things. These grammars indeed give many chapters and paragraphs on the four cases of declension and on the three grammatical genders. The truth is, that there is of declension in our language no greater amount than there is in English...[but] whereas the English nation has hailed the aboliton of cases and genders as a natural and in many respects a useful and a practical reform, the Dutch nation, or at least the authors and learned people of Holland, often wholly absorbed in classical studies, admiring the Greek and Latin languages for their riches of grammatical forms, and having besides this on the eastern frontier of their country a neighbour people which in its language had still in the course of centuries preserved the greater part of that exuberance of forms, which the Dutch language had had to part with, were very sorry for the "losses" they had sustained and tried by any kind of violent means to have their riches back. In this way the system of "genders" and "cases", condemned and thrown away by language itself, <b>continued to be reared and cultivated artificially by the authors and the learned people</b>. They held on like grim death, they strove and struggled with might and main - they plodded on, toiled on, trudged on...and succeeded in keeping the thing going to the present day. The result is this, that even now a well-educated Dutchman, when going to write no matter which contribution to a magazine or paper, or even an ordinary letter, nay nothing more than a simple postcard of a few lines, will most inevitably have to turn a good many of dictionary-leaves just to ascertain whether in his own language this or that word belongs to the masculine or to the feminine gender. -Of course, in our present idiom we have a large quantity of words, which in the middle-ages, during the period of "genders" and "cases", did not exist at all.... What in the world may be the gender of all those words, ex. gr. of a word like fiets...(a bicycle) or trem...(a tramway)? Of course nobody knows. But never mind.... Our learned men will set to work at a moment's notice and for each new word which you choose to bring them they will forge at their private workshop a brannew [sic] "gender" while you wait.</i> (pp. 6, 24-25)</p>
<p>I must say that I find it ironic that almost a century later this passage still appears to have relevance.</p>

<li>I doubt quoting from Dutch version of wiki. They are not referenced, nor are they from institurtes nor universities. In addition, there are so many English materials one can quote from on the internet, or even books. Afterall the article is in English, is it really that hard to reference in English? Or one just can't explain Dutch grammar in English? <b>matt</b>-<i>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_ke_3624.html" title="User:Matt ke">my page</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt_ke_fffc.html" title="User talk:Matt ke">leave me a message</a>)</i> 12:43, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>This is absolutely chaotic and unacceptable. Just a few obervations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The move to the misspelled "ArchaicDutch" (presumably intentionally, in order to avoid the already existing <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaic_Dutch_Declension_aff9.html" title="Archaic Dutch Declension">Archaic Dutch Declension</a>) was unacceptable. If you want to move a page and the target is already taken, you do a Requested Move, you don't move it to a bad spelling instead.</li>
<li>Both <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaic_Dutch_Declension_aff9.html" title="Archaic Dutch Declension">Archaic Dutch Declension</a> and ArchaicDutch Declension were misspelled anyway, because the capitalisation was wrong.</li>
<li>The existence of two or even three separate articles on basically the same topic is inexplicable. Okay, I understand there is a tension within Dutch grammar writing, between a more conservative system preserving more inflections, and a more progressive system where most of them have become obsolete. And apparently there are some POV issues here among contributors about how to weigh these different strands of the grammar. But I can't understand why it shouldn't be possible to treat these together in one article. The state of affairs here smacks of POV-forking, which is very strongly frowned upon. Come on, guys, it can't be that difficult, can it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the moment, I'm moving the page from ArchaicDutch Declension to <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaic_Dutch_declension_6e96.html" title="Archaic Dutch declension">Archaic Dutch declension</a>, just to get the spelling right. (Incidentally, that spelling isn't taken yet.) However, I <b>expect</b> you guys to find a way how to then merge that page back into the main article <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_declension.html" title="Dutch declension">Dutch declension</a>. These simply <b>must</b> be de-forked, in my view. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:36, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

He originately deleted this article from <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_declension.html" title="Dutch declension">Dutch declension</a>. I think we should have two pages: one concise and one extensive. Everything that's in the concise one <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_declension.html" title="Dutch declension">Dutch declension</a> is already incorporated into this one <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Declension_System_f0da.html" title="Dutch Declension System">Dutch Declension System</a>.

<li>Your position seems incoherent. Matt ke and Duprie37 seem to want two separate articles because they believe there are two different systems to describe, a modern and an archaic one. That's okay. But you seem to be saying there's only a single system worth treating, the fully inflecting one. In that case there can't be a reason to have two pages - we don't do alternative concise and extensive treatments of the same issue, over and above the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary-and-main</a> article structure with <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_grammar.html" title="Dutch grammar">Dutch grammar</a>. And please stop quoting the Dutch Wikipedia as if it had any authority as a source. It doesn't. What they write there is utterly irrelevant. Cite sources from the reputable literature. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 07:13, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The systems described now are the same: the system "<i>described</i>" by <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">user: Rex Germanus</a>, is just a resume of the one described here (if you would just try to read it (I know this is hard because it's a lot of rubbish). Furthermore I won't stop quoting the Dutch wikipedia, because lot's of Dutch speaking people visit these pages and they seem correct to them. I can't deny that I have the impression that some people (ii sunt <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">user: Rex Germanus</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_ke_3624.html" title="User:Matt ke">user: Matt ke</a> seem to be frustrated and want to oversimplify Dutch grammar. At the moment both pages seem to be a lot of bullshit to me (no offense to user Duprie37 who did a lot of interesting and correct changes). I suggest that both pages be deleted as they are, and that a new article (id est not the bullshit-one that exists at the moment) on <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_declension.html" title="Dutch declension">Dutch declension</a>. I still think this should reflect the articles on the Dutch wikipedia.

<li>Govert, you failed to address either of the two points I made: (1) If you think both articles are on the same topic, why would you want to keep them separate and not merge them? (2) You show a total lack of understanding of our <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution policy</a>. What you personally consider correct Dutch is of no importance. What readers and editors on the Dutch wikipedia consider correct is of no importance. Get a book and quote from it. You want us to follow the views of the Dutch wikipedia? The anser is no, and if you repeat it a thousand times, it will still be no. It's the policy. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:56, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey hold on. It's the people who use Dutch daily simplify things, not just me and Rex. You cannot even provide a single source in English (Yes it's about Dutch but bear in mind this is English wiki), nor you can provide any reliable source in Dutch either. On the other hand when I keep reverting back you tag the article as unreferenced and I referenced it straight away, and I do remember one come from a uni in Netherlands. How on earth would referring to Dutch wiki which by the way, not referenced as well, and without a background, not reliable at all. And also, I did not delete anything. I found it terribly different from what I learnt in uni thus noticing Rex was contributing to the Dutch language articles, I ask to to rewrite. And then the reverts. Some unnamed user keeps reverting back (let's say is vandalism) and never made any comments. OK now suddenly comes Govert with all the "no oh do you actually know Dutch, please read Dutch wiki and that will be the definitive version of the current Dutch language". And Taalunie is the official regulator of the Dutch language and in their site it provides some excellent links to sites which pretty much follows the way what Rex wrote and none of all the complex unknown inflections like Govert or Bombshell wrote/insists. If you're telling everyone the Official regulator of the language - Taalunie is wrong, please tell me who is the most superior of all. <b>matt</b>-<i>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_ke_3624.html" title="User:Matt ke">my page</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt_ke_fffc.html" title="User talk:Matt ke">leave me a message</a>)</i> 17:19, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not saying Taalunie is wrong, they just don't say eveything. They thry to keep it plain and simple. E;g. if you search for "datief" 5=dative case) on Taalunie, you'll find a short description on the dative in Dutch, mainly stating that it isn't used very often, but it exists. If you would like to know how declensions are formed in Dutch, you better check: dbnl: <i>Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse letteren</i>, if you search for <i>Spraakkunst</i> (=Grammar), you'll find several modern and historic grammars: <a href="http://dbnl.nl/cgi/zoek?q=spraakkunst&amp;form=extended&amp;m=any&amp;wm=wrd&amp;ps=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://dbnl.nl/cgi/zoek?q=spraakkunst&amp;form=extended&amp;m=any&amp;wm=wrd&amp;ps=10" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, note that different spellings may be used(e.g. eenen versus enen), this is because Dutch spelling changed like over five times during the last century. Furthermore, about the Taalunie: people are not obliged to follow them, so even stuff the Taalunie disapproves should be in a Dutch declension article, as long as people use/have used it in speach or in writing. <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovert_Miereveld_9907.html" title="User:Govert Miereveld">Govert Miereveld</a> 19:08, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not just a simple POV, it's like "thy", etc in English which are not used in common conversation/document type situation nowadays unless in certain places where it is required. Yes I agree the old complex one should be kept, that's why I proposed long ago that it is "archaic" as it's not used in normal situation anymore just to stop confusing readers. But the thing is some contributor erases all the info on the normal page which describes how Dutch is inflected nowadays and puts the old complex one back, which is totally unacceptable. It's either normal current one, or both with some sort of warning tags that the old complex one has been fallen out of use for ages. That way it can only gives the correct information to readers. <b>matt</b>-<i>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_ke_3624.html" title="User:Matt ke">my page</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt_ke_fffc.html" title="User talk:Matt ke">leave me a message</a>)</i> 02:43, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
