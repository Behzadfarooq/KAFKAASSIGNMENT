<dd>The English-language Wikipedia mathematics community tends to be a blissfully quiet backwater compared to the turbulence of the mainstream. Our articles are numerous, but vary widely in age, thoroughness, accuracy, and so on. Some of our editors are multilingual, but the typical <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee.html" title="Yankee">Yank</a> is not. Many of our editors have some level of university training, usually enough to help settle technical disputes. Good help is always appreciated, as is good company.

<p>Fabulous edit to <a href="../../../f/u/n/Function_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Function (mathematics)">function (mathematics)</a>! The article finally has a proper <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELead_b989.html" title="WP:Lead">lead</a>! You may face resistence from existing editors there, but I will back you up 100% and I hope others will too. Your edit shows great mathematical insight and the breadth of interpretation and knowledge that I believe such a general article should articulate. (See also my comments on the talk page of the article.) I wish I had had the courage to make such an edit myself - the article desperately needed a breath of fresh air. Thanks for bringing it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 22:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your kind words! As a matter of fact, as I explained on the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Talk%7EFunction_%28mathematics%29_2bd9.html" title="Talk:Function (mathematics)">talk page</a>, I was very much inspired by your very well thought-out comments. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcfrk_47a5.html" title="User:Arcfrk">Arcfrk</a> 22:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Been there, commented briefly, and made a few minor edits to your contribution (I hope correctly). I was very happy to hear that my comments inspired your efforts. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 23:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It sounds to me like you might also care (and know in some detail) about the category <a href="../../../d/i/f/Category%7EDifferential_calculus_ed61.html" title="Category:Differential calculus">differential calculus</a>. This category desperately needs help. At the moment the main article is <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative.html" title="Derivative">Derivative</a>: this is a nice introduction, but only covers derivatives in one variable. The <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">calculus</a> article is not as good, and there is essentially no introductory article on calculus in many variables. Your comments and edits would be very welcome. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 23:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you have any comments on my edits to <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative.html" title="Derivative">Derivative</a> let me know.

<p>I just noticed your very sensible restructuring of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative_%28generalizations%29.html" title="Derivative (generalizations)">derivative (generalizations)</a>. The next stage in my plan for <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative.html" title="Derivative">derivative</a> is to add an elementary section on vector-valued derivatives and derivatives in higher dimensions. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 02:50, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are too kind to my edits. The "generalizations of derivatives" article still needs a lot of work, probably, summarizing some content and moving it out to separate articles, it's a big hodge-podge with lots of bold font at the moment. I indeed looked at the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative.html" title="Derivative">Derivative</a>, it's in much better shape than before thanks to your efforts. We are on the same wavelength concerning this whole topic, I especially liked your comment about "derivatives of functions of one variable and Banach space derivatives - some reality check needed". <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmiley.svg_d547.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/8/85/Smiley.svg/15px-Smiley.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmiley.svg_d547.html" /></a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcfrk_47a5.html" title="User:Arcfrk">Arcfrk</a> 03:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I realised your edits were just a start, but we've got to start somewhere, and preferably in the right direction! I'm very glad that I am not the only one who has noticed the strange dichotomy between the elementary and inaccessibly advanced in the differentiation articles: if you want to know the pain I feel as a geometer, take a look at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_rule.html" title="Chain rule">chain rule</a>&#160;;-) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 19:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have both been spending too much time recently on rewriting or reverting each other's contributions. Perhaps it would be more productive if we both agree just to add to the other's work, and not remove or revert it (except as necessary for corrections). <a href="../../../r/2E/e/User%7ER.e.b._6838.html" title="User:R.e.b.">R.e.b.</a> 13:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I completely agree. As you might have guessed from my earlier comments, I am a bit picky about the accuracy issues, which, on the other hand, can <a href="../../../h/e/c/Talk%7EHecke_algebra_7d19.html" title="Talk:Hecke algebra">lead to unnecessary haisplitting</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcfrk_47a5.html" title="User:Arcfrk">Arcfrk</a> 17:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I felt I should pay a visit and offer some guidance, based on comments you left on my talk page and elsewhere. To say what I have to say, I must speak plainly; I hope you will not be offended.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous welcoming message, many of us who contribute to mathematics articles here bring professional training and experience. However, we prefer to base our discussions on sound arguments and facts, not background and status. In fact, this is the professional way to behave, and tends to expedite our path to quality results.</p>
<p>Although I don't enjoy it, I can handle an occasional insult or slight. And I do understand that the Wikipedia process can be frustrating, even infuriating, and that we are all human beings with egos and emotions and other forces in our lives. But I think you will find it counterproductive to bristle if you are questioned, and very counterproductive to "throw your weight around".</p>
<p>I like to encourage an environment that is forgiving of mistakes, so long as someone does not make it a lifestyle. That includes emotional outbursts as well as errors in fact or blunders in copyediting. For example, I have quietly corrected mistakes that could have been caught by careful proofreading in edits you have made. Others have done the same for me.</p>
<p>If you have expert knowledge and experience to contribute, it won't take long for you to establish credibility and a good reputation in this community. I notice you do not state credentials on your user page; neither do I. I am satisfied — in fact, prefer — to have my contributions speak for themselves. And it rather forces me to convince with compelling arguments, not bluster.</p>
<p>I get the impression that you think a lot of your own opinion. Maybe that's justified. Maybe in time we'll come to think so, too. But if we do, it will be because of what we see for ourselves. So far, most of what I see is good; the rest, I hope, can be adjusted. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 16:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
