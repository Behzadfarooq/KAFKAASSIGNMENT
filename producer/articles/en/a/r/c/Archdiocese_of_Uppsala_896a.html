<p><a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppsala.html" title="Uppsala">Uppsala</a> is the seat of the Lutheran Archbishop of Uppsala. The diocese, which has its centre in the city of <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppsala.html" title="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, covers <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppsala_County_6450.html" title="Uppsala County">Uppsala County</a>, <a href="../../../g/%C3%A4/v/G%C3%A4vleborg_County_2b5c.html" title="Gävleborg County">Gävleborg County</a> and parts of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm_County_4a8f.html" title="Stockholm County">Stockholm County</a> and <a href="../../../v/%C3%A4/s/V%C3%A4stmanland_County_23d3.html" title="Västmanland County">Västmanland County</a>. The archdiocese originally also included those parts of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norrland.html" title="Norrland">Norrland</a>, which were included in the new <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_H%C3%A4rn%C3%B6sand_2e3d.html" title="Diocese of Härnösand">Diocese of Härnösand</a> when it was founded in 1647 and the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">City of Stockholm</a>, which was made <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Stockholm_c2d2.html" title="Diocese of Stockholm">a diocese of its own</a> in 1942.</p>
<p>As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the archdiocese consists of 201 parishes (<i>församlingar</i> or [historically] <i>socknar</i>) distributed over 86 larger parishes (called <i>pastorat</i>) and a smaller number of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deanery.html" title="Deanery">deaneries</a>.</p>
<p>As the archbishop besides being head of Uppsala diocese also has a central role in the Church of Sweden on a national level (from 2006 the position is held by Anders Wejryd),an additional position as assistant bishop in Uppsala diocese was created in 1990. In 2000 the diocese was divided into two pastoral regions, the smaller part of wich is led by the archbishop and the rest by the bishop in Uppsala diocese [the possition as assistant bishop, later called the bishop in Uppsala diocese has been held by Tord Harlin (1990 to 2000) Ragnar Persenius(from 2000]].</p>

<p>When <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Ansgar_564d.html" title="St. Ansgar">St. Ansgar</a>, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829, the Swedes were still heathen and the country contained many sacrificial groves and temples for the worship of Germanic pagan idols. One of the most celebrated of the latter was the temple at Upsala in what is now called Old Upsala, the centre of idolatrous worship not only for Sweden but for all Scandinavia. Even after Christianity had spread through Sweden, heathen sacrifices were still maintained at Upsala. The "Bishops' Chronicle", written by <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_of_Bremen_a932.html" title="Adam of Bremen">Adam of Bremen</a> in the years 1072-76, says, "The Swedes have a well-known heathen temple called Upsala", and "Every ninth year, moreover, a great feast is celebrated at Upsala, which is observed in common by all the provinces of Sweden. None is permitted to avoid participation in the feast ... More horrible than any punishment is that even those who have become Christians must purchase exemption from participation in the feast ... The sacrifices are made thus: Nine heads are offered for every living creature of the male sex. By the blood of these the gods are appeased. The bodies are hung up in a grove not far from the temple. Dogs and horses may be seen hanging close by human beings; a Christian told me he had seen seventy-two bodies hanging together."</p>
<p>An episcopal see was established at Old Upsala. One of the bishops was St. Henry, who took part in the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusade</a> to Finland led by king <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Eric_IX_of_Sweden_57a4.html" title="Saint Eric IX of Sweden">Saint Eric IX of Sweden</a> and suffered martyrdom there in 1157. The bishops of Sweden were first <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan.html" title="Suffragan">suffragans</a> of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen, of which see St. Ansgar was archbishop when he died. Afterwards the Swedish bishops were <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan.html" title="Suffragan">suffragans</a> of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Lund_d180.html" title="Archbishop of Lund">Archbishop of Lund</a> in Denmark, then <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_of_Scandinavia_33ba.html" title="Primate of Scandinavia">Primate of Scandinavia</a>.</p>
<p>In 1152 <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_Nicholas_of_Albano_f43b.html" title="Cardinal Nicholas of Albano">Cardinal Nicholas of Albano</a>, later Pope Adrian IV, visited Sweden and held a provincial synod at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link%C3%B6ping.html" title="Linköping">Linköping</a>. He had been commissioned to establish an independent <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_province.html" title="Church province">Church province</a> in Sweden, but the matter was deferred, as the Swedes could not agree upon the see of the archbishop. In 1164 <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Alexander_III_e24c.html" title="Pope Alexander III">Pope Alexander III</a> established a separate ecclesiastical province of Sweden with the see at Upsala. The suffragans were the Bishops of <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skara.html" title="Skara">Skara</a>, Linköping, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strengn%C3%A4s.html" title="Strengnäs">Strengnäs</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wester%C3%A5s.html" title="Westerås">Westerås</a>; at a later date the dioceses of <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexi%C3%B6.html" title="Wexiö">Wexiö</a> and <a href="../../../%C3%A5/b/o/%C3%85bo.html" title="Åbo">Åbo</a> in neighbouring <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> (which came to be ruled by the Swedish crown) were added.</p>
<p>The first Archbishop of Upsala was Stephen, a <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cistercian_monk.html" title="Cistercian monk">Cistercian monk</a> from the celebrated monastery of <a href="../../../a/l/w/Alwastra.html" title="Alwastra">Alwastra</a>. Cardinal <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Sabina_bc81.html" title="William of Sabina">William of Sabina</a> came as <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_legate.html" title="Papal legate">papal legate</a> to Sweden during the archiepiscopate of Jarler, a <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Order_2f62.html" title="Dominican Order">Dominican</a> monk (1235-55). The legate had been commissioned, among other things, to establish <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral_chapter.html" title="Cathedral chapter">cathedral chapters</a> wherever such were lacking, and to grant them the exclusive right of electing the bishops. Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_celibacy.html" title="Clerical celibacy">clerical celibacy</a>. At a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provincial_synod.html" title="Provincial synod">provincial synod</a> held at <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skenninge.html" title="Skenninge">Skenninge</a> in 1248 under the presidency of the cardinal, the rules as to celibacy were made more severe. The pious and energetic Archbishop Jarler and his successor Laurentius (1257-67), a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>, constantly strove to elevate the clergy and to enforce the law of celibacy. A century later <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Bridget_of_Sweden_6efe.html" title="Saint Bridget of Sweden">Saint Bridget</a> (d. 1373), laboured zealously for the enforcement of the same law.</p>
<p>A new era arose in the history of the archdiocese when Archbishop Folke (1274-77) transferred the see from Old Upsala to <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aros.html" title="Aros">Aros</a>, a town near by on the Fyris which was given the name of Upsala. This change was approved by the pope, the king and the bishops. The relics of the national saint, St. Eric, were also transferred to the new see. The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral.html" title="Cathedral">cathedral</a> of Upsala, the most important church of Sweden and the largest in Scandinavia, was built by the French architect Etienne de Bonnuille in 1287. It was a masterpiece of the Gothic style, and is a monument of what Catholic art and Catholic self-sacrifice were able to create under the leadership of zealous archbishops and prelates.</p>
<p>The labours of the archbishops extended in all directions. Some were zealous pastors of their flocks, such as Jarler and others; some were distinguished <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonist.html" title="Canonist">canonists</a>, such as Birger Gregerson (1367-83) and Olof Larsson (1435-8); others were statesmen, such as <a href="../../../j/%C3%B6/n/J%C3%B6ns_Bengtsson_Oxenstjerna_f5e7.html" title="Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstjerna">Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstjerna</a> (d. 1467), or capable administrators, such as Jacob Ulfsson Örnfot, who was distinguished as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_the_Church_0859.html" title="Prince of the Church">prince of the Church</a>, royal councillor, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patron_of_art.html" title="Patron of art">patron of art</a> and learning, founder of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Upsala_7a0a.html" title="University of Upsala">University of Upsala</a> and an efficient helper in the introduction of printing into Sweden. He died in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthusian.html" title="Carthusian">Carthusian</a> monastery of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariefred.html" title="Mariefred">Mariefred</a> (Mary's Peace) in 1522. There were also scholars, such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Magnus_5bb3.html" title="Johannes Magnus">Johannes Magnus</a> (died 1544), who wrote the "Historia de omnibus Gothorum sueonumque regibus" and the "Historia metropolitanæ ecclesiæ Upsaliensis", and his brother <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olaus_Magnus_c08d.html" title="Olaus Magnus">Olaus Magnus</a> (d. 1588), who wrote the "Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus" and who was the last Archbishop of Upsala.</p>
<p>The archbishops and secular clergy found active co-workers among the regular clergy. Among the orders represented in Sweden were the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictines.html" title="Benedictines">Benedictines</a>, Cistercians, Dominicans, Franciscans, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigittines.html" title="Brigittines">Brigittines</a> (with the mother-house at Wadstena) and Carthusians. The monks laboured in things spiritual and were also the teachers of the people in agriculture and gardening. Still greater credit is due the members of the orders, both men and women, for their services in the intellectual training of the people of Sweden. A Swedish Protestant investigator, Carl Silfverstolpe, wrote: "The monks were almost the sole bond of union in the Middle Ages between the civilization of the north and that of southern Europe, and it can be claimed that the active relations between our monasteries and those in southern lands were the arteries through which the higher civilization reached our country."</p>
<p>The beneficial labours of the Catholic Church were forgotten in the stormy days of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, but meanwhile have been once more recognized by more dispassionate investigators. Dr. Claes Annerstedt, the historian of the University of Upsala, says: "One of the finest results of modern research is that the highly important labours of the Roman Church have received proper recognition by the exhibition of its services in the preservation and spread of civilization."</p>
<p>After the Swedish crown had exchanged Catholicism for Lutheranism as official religion, the Roman hierarchy as such disappeared. When a new Catholic missionary jurisdiction was established, it was not at any of the ancient episcopal sees but an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_prefecture.html" title="Apostolic prefecture">apostolic prefecture</a> in 1781, from 1783 promoted to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicariate_apostolic.html" title="Vicariate apostolic">vicariate apostolic</a>, in the Swedish capital <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, which became an <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exempt.html" title="Exempt">exempt</a> bishopric (for all Sweden) in 1953, when the same status was given in Norway to <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a>, which had only in 1869 been split from the Swedish apostolic vicariate.</p>
