	    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know you are interested in christianity, and I recently started a new wiki over at wikicities which is on the subject of christianity. <a href="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" class="external text" title="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">Christian Knowledge Base</a> is the site.</p>
<p>The goal is to have a knowledgebase on christianity from a distinctly "C(hristian)POV" rather than the NPOV. It is not meant to be a mere Christian Encyclopedia, but to foster a real sense of community. I'd like to include things like current events, news, stories, and anything that would add to both an understanding of Christianity, but also its enjoyment. I'm looking for help to build a resource that could really enrich the lives of Christians.</p>
<p>I know you are busy but I am actively seeking new sysops/admins to help me build this site up, and I would be positively thrilled if you could contribute in any capacity whatsoever. <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmpty2005_a433.html" title="User:Empty2005">Empty2005</a> 00:22, 26 March 2006 (UTC) Cheers&#160;:)</p>

<p>I think it could be good idea, but what do you want to include what's not on wikipedia? Stories of healing? Prophecies or warnings about coming events? Good and solid descriptions of all the books and/or prophets in the Bible? Worship songs? Other persons in the Bible? Or concentrated on certain subjects like 'alcohol addiction and the Bible', 'sexuality and the Bible'? What about church history?<br />

<p>Yeah, right now a lot of the articles are forked from Wikipedia. I have personally imported stuff about theology and church history. On CKB, the existence of God and Jesus are taken as givens, as they are in Christianity. Right now we're trying to figure out who is and who is not a Christian&#160;;( It is fairly ecumenical, though. Check it out if you want to know more.

Whoever owns the site, seeing as they <i>intend</i> it to be POV, should not worry about where to draw the POV-line, imo. A LDS site would use a different definition of "Christian" than a JW site would -- no reason to try to include all the different (often conflicting) definitions into one -- just go with the one the owner of the site uses.

<dd>Yeah, after reading Homestarmy's comments there, I say "no thanks". There is more than plenty basis to say that Jesus was not God, all from the Bible. People who strive to follow all of Jesus' commands (often even moreso than most Trinitarians), believe Jesus is the Christ who was sent by God to provide salvation, stay away from pagan influences in Christianity, read the Bible daily and do their best to be the best Christians they can be, and yet do not agree with the teaching of the Trinity (for very good and justifiable reasons) do not deserve the kind of bashing that will inevitably (already) occur over there.

<p>Brothers, the most dangerous trap we as Christians together can fall in is that we are bashing each other. It is hard to stay humble and do not let your pride come up. Plase ask God for grace (also for building this site). A problem is that we don't see each other and it is easy to be more careless about your words on the Internet and that we have a physical distance from each other because we are all scattered around the globe. It is so easy to be more concerned about the truth(s) than about Jesus. We, I myself included, has to be aware of this. We have to be focused on His righteousness, His holiness, His judgments, His love otherwise we might desperately fall.<br />

<dd>"The whole argument over who's a "better" Christian led to the 1054 CE schism between Eastern and Western Rite churches that has lasted nigh on 1,000 years, and to the Reformation, and to the Inquisition. Additionally the argument over who is a better theist led to the Muslim conquests, the Crusades, the ongoing violence between Muslims and Hindus, the ongoing violence between Sikhs and Hindus, the genocide in Darfur, [the Israelis and the Palestinians] etc. The bottom line is this: no matter what religion one belongs to, one does not have the right to condemn others because of their beliefs. If you believe that your religion is the "True Way", hey, fine, I'm happy that you have found peace. But to rip each other apart because of ridiculous superficial differences is just asinine, counterproductive and hardly in the best interests of mankind.

<dd>This discussion is pretty far off-topic, and controversial. Some of us reject the condemnation implicit in the stricture against condemning others, finding it to be self-referentially incoherent ("I condemn you for condemning people").
