<p>This article is kind of Anglocentric. Several Chinese astronomers have published in the last few years, usually in "Astronomy and Astrophysics - a European Journal"</p>
<p>I'll try to hunt up a few references. Also there is recent work on transits of Venus that should be mentioned. See:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.venus-transit.de/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.venus-transit.de/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>I've written a "What is archaeoastronomy?" page for my own site. I'm happy to put it in Wikipedia, but this would mean a major re-write of the existing article, the creation of an extra page and culling of many external links. You can see the text at <a href="http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/archaeoastronomy/" class="external free" title="http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/archaeoastronomy/" rel="nofollow">http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/archaeoastronomy/</a></p>
<p>I'd also pull the Some Old / New World sites where archaeoastronomy is being explored sections into a new page called Sites of Archaeoastronomical Significance and link to it via a See Also section. As for the external links most of them would go. I'm not convinced we need four separate links to James Q Jacobs's site. Many of the other links are very specific rather than being relevant to Archaeoastronomy in general. They might be good pages, but DMoz would be a better place to list them. The references would be replaced with the references used for the entry.</p>
<p>What is missing from the entry would be reference to things like the Orion's Belt theory. While I don't agree with them, people looking up von Daniken may refer to Wikipedia. A sub-section on pseudo-archaeology with links to the pseudo-archaeology entry and author pages like Bauval etc could be appended without problems.</p>
<p>I realise people will correct it as soon as I put it up, or that I could just put it up and leave it for someone to revert. I just thought with it being a big change and me being new here it would be a good idea to put up a notice first. I'm not trying to arrogantly run roughshod over the previous entry without consultation. If there's no major concerns then I'll add it in a couple of days. --<a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 16:38, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know enough about the subject to comment on your content, but the philosophy of wikipedia is to be bold. The existing article is not much better than a stub. There is a biggish leader and then lists of links - a structured article will be an improvement. Of course the revision shouldn't include original research - but the proposed article appears to contain sufficient references that I assume this is not the case. If you are considering removing material, one way is to move it to this talk page, so that someone who strongly feels it is important doesn't need to revert your edit and can simply re-edit the old stuff into a suitable place in the new article. You could do the same with the existing external references. If you think the references are useful but very specific, one way to handle this is to use sub-headings under heading of external links - see <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underwater_archaeology.html" title="Underwater archaeology">Underwater archaeology</a> for example. The some old/new world sites article might be best as a List of... article? You may get objectors to the idea of an article on pseudo-archaeology (either because people believe it and object to pseudo, or they believe it is pseudo and object to its inclusion at all). Personally I agree with you, but it needs to be carefully worded. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EViv_Hamilton_1137.html" title="User:Viv Hamilton">Viv Hamilton</a> 15:54, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Below is cut'n'pasted the previous version of the Archaeoastronomy entry so that anyone can put stuff back in if they feel it's should be in the new entry. My plan is to use the category page for Archaeoastronomy to help link in material so I'll be flitting round other relevant entries to make sure they have an archaeoastronomy category link later. The only major cuts will be in external links which will be heavily pruned. I'll be cutting links that aren't to archaeoastronomical sites and to sites concerned specifically with one culture. For instance some of the James Q Jacobs links might be better on the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_calendar.html" title="Maya calendar">Maya calendar</a> page.

<p><b>Archaeoastronomy</b> (also spelled <b>Archeoastronomy</b>) is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Archaeoastronomy examines archaeological sites for evidence of astronomy in remote cultures, and anthropological and ethnohistorical evidence for evidence of astronomical practices in living cultures. The study of the astronomies of living traditional cultures is sometimes called Ethnoastronomy. Archaeoastronomy also focuses on modern astronomy, employing historical records of early astronomical observations to study past astronomical events, and employing astronomical data to clarify the historical record.</p>
<p>In the study of solar, lunar, and stellar alignments of monuments, numerous claims have been made that the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalith.html" title="Megalith">megalithic monuments</a>, such as <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabta_Playa_fc90.html" title="Nabta Playa">Nabta Playa</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonehenge.html" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrange.html" title="Newgrange">Newgrange</a>, represent "ancient observatories," but the extent and nature of their use in that regard needs careful definition. Certainly, they are aligned with particular significance to the solstitial points.</p>
<p>The early development of this aspect of archaeoastronomy was influenced by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Thom_8ca5.html" title="Alexander Thom">Alexander Thom's</a> studies of megalithic monuments of Britain, published in <i>Megalithic sites in Britain</i> (Oxford, 1967). Thom employed detailed surveys and statistical methods to investigate the calendric and astronomical functions of numerous Neolithic monuments. He claimed that these monuments incorporate alignments to points on the horizon where the sun and moon rise and set at seasonal extremes like midsummer, midwinter and the equinoxes. In addition to his work on Neolithic astronomy, he also proposed the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalithic_yard.html" title="Megalithic yard">megalithic yard</a> as a standardized unit of measure. Although his work greatly influenced the development of archaeoastronomy, many of his conclusions (especially those implying highly precise observations) have been widely questioned.</p>
<p>Anthropological and ethnohistorical methods have been used to study astronomies in a wide range of cultures. Typical studies have examined the astronomical and calendric practices of the <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopi.html" title="Hopi">Hopi</a> and <a href="../../../z/u/n/Zuni.html" title="Zuni">Zuni</a> of the Southwestern United States; the astronomy and cosmology of the Andean villagers of Misminay; the calendrical and divinatory practices of modern <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya.html" title="Maya">Maya</a> priests, and the ambiguous <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_calendar.html" title="Lunar calendar">lunar calendar</a> of the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Mursi.html" title="Mursi">Mursi</a> of southwestern Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Archaeoastronomy has also considered the extensive records of ancient China for references to "guest stars". "Guest stars," or star-like objects which appeared in the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_sky.html" title="Night sky">night sky</a>, were of great interest to the observers of ancient China and were often dutifully recorded. These events have been associated with many transitory phenomena, such as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet.html" title="Comet">comets</a> and, particularly, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernova.html" title="Supernova">supernovae</a>. Besides the insights such records provide into the significance of celestial phenomena in ancient cultures, they have also been found useful by modern astronomers.</p>

<p>Well, the recent change by Melchoir has raised the issue to the fore. Is Ethnoastronomy a separate entity from archaeoastronomy, deserving its own article, or is it part of it? Since it is already covered (to some extent) in this article, perhaps we should make the connection clearer. For the moment, I'm going to remove the disturbing red link to the non-existent article on Ethnoastronomy. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveMcCluskey_1bdc.html" title="User:SteveMcCluskey">SteveMcCluskey</a> 13:49, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, I have no idea, personally. But whatever the decision is, the intro must reflect it. Currently, we have an article on A that states "A is related to B, C, and D", while C and D are links to other articles and B is not. The omission frankly screams! <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 14:13, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Congratulations to <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> and indeed all contributors to this beautifully-written article: it makes for a compelling, well-structured and very informative read, and is sumptuously illustrated. I've listed it as a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">Good Article</a> since it meets all the criteria. However, despite its ample good points, it only <i>just</i> satisfies the broadness <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">criterion</a> in my opinion. In particular, the following points need addressing when further developing the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most pressingly, how <i>scientific</i> is archaeoastronomy? To what extent are conclusions based upon individual opinions?</li>
<li>Which academic centres are the most prominent for archaeoastronomical research? This is vital for context.</li>
<li>There are no direct quotations either regarding the discipline itself or from eminent archaeoastronomers.</li>
<li>A section is needed which elaborates on how archaeoastronomy compares and contrasts with each of its closely-related disciplines, as suggested in the introduction. In particular, what sources tackle the ethnoastronomy/archaeoastronomy debate and among whom is there "no consensus"?</li>
<li>What are the major achievements within the discipline?</li>
<li>In ===Displays of Power===, the sentence "The use of astronomy at Stonehenge continues to be a matter of vigorous discussion" is opaque and needs context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some stylistic points of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is Wikipedia consensus that footnote numbers should be placed <i>after</i> punctuation marks in the prose (except for brackets).</li>
<li>A redirect for <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnoastronomy.html" title="Ethnoastronomy">ethnoastronomy</a> is appropriate at the moment.</li>
<li>There should be a small introductory paragraph to the section ==Major topics of archaeoastronomical research==.</li>
<li>The image of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machu_Picchu_a695.html" title="Machu Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> is beautiful, but it doesn't bear any obvious relevance to the prose it illustrates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I had a thoroughly good time reading this article, so cheers, and well done again. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVinoir_4d5a.html" title="User:Vinoir">Vinoir</a> 16:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the review. The footnotes and redirect are in place. Perhaps a <i>methodology</i> section would tackle both the scientific/historical nature of archaeoastronomy and be a place to discuss ethnoastronomy? Clive's quote on archaeoastronomy spanning unbridled lunacy to something else (I'll have to look it up) would be a good intro to the methodology and arguments over how scientific one can be. --<a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 17:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good stuff. A ==Methodology== section sounds ideal. If you ever need me for follow-up to the above comments, I'll be happy to oblige. Probably the article will also be large enough for <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">peer review</a> at that point, and I think that <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Featured Article</a> status is a realistic prospect for the article. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVinoir_4d5a.html" title="User:Vinoir">Vinoir</a> 20:59, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I forgot to make a note of what I added, and to spellcheck. I'll try and do the latter tomorrow morning. Added are <b>Methodology</b> and <b>Recreating the Sky</b> sections. I wanted to try and show there's more to method than just measuring alignments, and try and get away from the astronomical shopping list idea. As a result I'm not happy with either section as they stand, but they're up for anyone else to knock about. I'm off campus at the moment too, but when I'm back possibly next week, I'll try filling out the references.</dd>

<dd>Other sections I thought to add are <b>Major archaeoastronomical sites</b> which could briefly discuss Stonehenge, Chichen Itza and Giza with links through to the main articles and also an <b>Archaeoastronomy and Archaeology</b> section for the end to say that while you can't use purely astronomical data to turn the archaeological world upside down, some things do make more sense when astronomy is considered e.g. Maya Venus Star Wars, Iron Age roundhouses and Polynesian navigation.</dd>

<p>I've been following recent changes to the article over at <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_Astronomy_05a6.html#Archaeoastronomical_claims" title="Hindu Astronomy">Hindu astronomy</a>, where there has been an effective rebuttal of the attempts to use archaeoastronomical methods to push the date of Indian astronomy back by over two millennia. Lying behind these attempts is a nationalist agenda to grant Indian astronomy priority and make it the source of Greek and Babylonian astronomy.</p>
<p>I don't like to see archaeoastronomy tarred by this kind of foolishness, yet the late David Pingree, an expert on Indian astronomy — who also did solid research on Greek, Babylonian, and even medieval European astronomy — spent a page of an excellent article on early science condemning "the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers." (Pingree, "Hellenophilia versus the History of Science," <i>Isis</i>, 83(1982):554-563, esp. p. 556; reprinted in Michael H. Shank, ed., The <i>Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages</i>, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 2000), pp.30-39.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the thing to do is add a section dealing with fallacies in Archaeoastronomy and discussing those standards that can help a reader critically evaluate such weak research. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveMcCluskey_1bdc.html" title="User:SteveMcCluskey">SteveMcCluskey</a> 21:35, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I thought a section on pseudo-archaeoastronomy might be useful, but I'm not sure I'm the person to write it.

<p>It seems that most of these sites were built for these cultures to express their 'cosmic admiration' or 'cosmic awe' for their God(s), so possibly these sites have much more <b>astrological significance</b> than people (i.e. modern, highly skeptical scientists) give them credit for. Perhaps we should include more about the astrological significance of these amazing structures in the main article. For instance, we know that many archaeoastronomical sites are <i>astronomically</i> amazing and significant in that they uncannily line up with the cycles of the sun, moon, and planets, but WHY would these cultures go through the laborious process of building these sites if they didn't attach any <i>astrological</i> and/or spiritual significance to them? Thank you for your time and suggestions. --172.150.63.12 06:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's sorry you don't have a user name so I could contact you directly. Perhaps there could be a section on the use of early astronomies for prognostication. There are two problems. First, for most archaeoastronomical sites we don't have enough cultural context to say anything specific about the purposes to which they were put. The second, and related, problem is to find secondary accounts regarding this topic in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that could be <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">cited</a> in the article. I know the use of the Maya material for prognostication has been talked about by Tony Aveni and others but I'm pretty much at a loss for any good material on the other sites under discussion here. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveMcCluskey_1bdc.html" title="User:SteveMcCluskey">SteveMcCluskey</a> 17:12, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would be delighted to read more on the astrological significance of the sites, if it can be verified from a reliable source. As Steve says, there's not the cultural context there. For instance it would be weird if there wasn't some rich symbolism in the night sky of the builders of Stonehenge, but the complete lack of historical records means that we will never know what it was. Additionally ancient people are very good at being weird and proving everyone wrong.</dd>

<dd>There is also a danger that in specifying <i>astrology</i> rather than <i>ritual</i> you risk putting a modern preconception back onto the past. Astrology is not a universal belief system, in the case of Graeco-Roman astrology it relies on some fairly basic assumptions about the use fo mathematics which don't transfer to other cultures. I'll give it some thought. I did wonder if something could be added in the <b>Displays of power</b> section. Unfortunately the only suitable thing I can think of is some work on the Tellus relief at the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Ara_Pacis_5f1a.html" title="Ara Pacis">Ara Pacis</a>, but that's not verifiable as it hasn't been published yet. --<a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 13:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
