	    <p>I share your doubts. It’s very confusing. Maybe everything is okay but I find those articles very strange. There is no facts only assertion, data are unverifiable. It is not possible to double check them. As in many countries, I am sure there are some public information regarding the date of birth, decease and marriage of Gueroust’s family in the Mexican Civil Register in Campeche because Mexican authorities should have been recording this kind of data. Now, as a descendant of “de Gueroust’s family”, information I have on Mexican Gueroust’s family do not match with Wikipedia ones. My 3 great-grandfather was the nephew of Adelaïde’s father and my 2 greatuncle (his son) was in Mexico during the French war against Mexican people as a French army officer. None of them mentionned anything regarding the marriage between Archduke Louis of Austria with Adelaide Gueroust. What I got from miscellaneous sources: - Adelaïde Gueroust got married with Hugo de Lapierre in 1818 at the Capellania Auxiliar de Santa Anna, Campeche. They got 7 children of which Anna Lapierre Gueroust. - Adelaïde’s father died in 1834 in Campêche - Adelaïde's father spoke about his son in law (de lapierre) in a business letter in 1828. He sent it to one of his French cousins living in France. He never spoke about this alliance - Personal reports written by my 2 greatuncle during his stay in Mexico did not mentionned anything about his great uncle The last but not the least, the information you could find at the below address is not correct too: - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Louis_of_Austria" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Louis_of_Austria" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Louis_of_Austria</a> Archduke Louis met his wife, Adelaide Gueroust, at her residence in the Loire valley, the Castle of Boisclaireau Why? The last de Gueroust heir male, count of Boisclaireau, died in 1835 and left one girl who got married with a French army officer. The de Gueroust’s family who was living in the Castle of Boisclaireau is another branch of the de Gueroust’s family.</p>
<p>Up to now I do not see any proven links between Adelaïde de Gueroust and Archduke Louis of Austria.</p>

Its very interesting to find information on the life of a member of the most important family in Europe.</p>

<p>I'm quite confused as to why so many people disagree about a daughter named Anna-Victoria Von Habsburg-Gueroust. She would be the daughter of Adelaide Gueroust...I have seen some articles make mention of her and it is said that through her a rival pretender to the throne of Mexico came...</p>
<p>"Since the deposition of Emperor Maximilian I in 1867, there has been no Monarchy in Mexico. Since then, there have been two rival pretender lines of accession to the Throne; one through Maximilian's adopted sons, originally grandsons of <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agustin_de_Iturbide_1ecb.html" title="Agustin de Iturbide">Agustin de Iturbide</a> , the other claim through the Emperor's niece Princely-Countess Anna-Victoria von Habsburg-Gueroust - daughter of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archduke_Louis_of_Austria_a033.html" title="Archduke Louis of Austria">Archduke Louis of Austria</a>."</p>
<p>Then, I hear of her changing her family name to "De la Pierre" during the end of the Second Mexican Empire and of a castle in Campeche, Mexico which is called Gueroust Palace...If anybody knows any facts about this case, please inform. Thank You! --<a href="../../../c/2E/k/User%7EC.Kent87_b7db.html" title="User:C.Kent87">C.Kent87</a> 01:35, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a hoax. Whatever remains of her on Wikipedia ought to be removed, as there is no claim to be held by her. There are no princely counts or countesses of Habsburg-Gueroust, let alone ones who changed their names. All information to be found was inserted by a con here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 16:04, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, there is no Gueroust Palace. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 16:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your input...I wonder who would have made up such a thing? I will try and do some searching about this subject. It seems to me that the name change would only be in Mexico...and her descendants in Mexico would be "De La Pierre". If, in the future, it turns out to be true I should think it would belong here....IF. Again, I thank you for this information, I have no obligation to either side, so it goes without saying that I only want the truth&#160;; ] --<a href="../../../c/2E/k/User%7EC.Kent87_b7db.html" title="User:C.Kent87">C.Kent87</a> 03:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was a rather off-balance individual who was pushing the claim of one "Dona Concepcion", a de la Pierre/Habsburg/Gueroust. All of it was false. In such cases where evidence is needed to substantiate something and such evidence does not exist, it is unverifiable in the least. This one, however, was also a hoax. *If* it were true then yes it should be here. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 15:38, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
