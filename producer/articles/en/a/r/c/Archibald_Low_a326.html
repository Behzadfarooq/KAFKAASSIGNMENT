<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">Professor</a> <b>Archibald Montgomery Low</b> (born <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a> <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purley%2C_London_8b59.html" title="Purley, London">Purley, London</a>, died <a href="../../../s/e/p/September.html" title="September">September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>) was an <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronautics.html" title="Astronautics">engineer</a>, research <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physicist.html" title="Physicist">physicist</a> and inventor, he was also the author of more than 40 books.</p>
<p>Low has been called the <i><b>"father of radio guidance systems"</b></i> due to his pioneering work on guided rockets, planes and torpedoes. He was a pioneer in many fields though, often leading the way to others, but his lack of discipline meant he hardly ever saw a project through, being too easily distracted by new ideas. If it weren't for this inability to see things to a conclusion, Low could well have been remembered as one of the great men of science. Many of his scientific contemporaries disliked him, due in part to him using the title Professor, which technically he wasn't entitled to do as he didn't occupy an academic chair. His love of the limelight and publicity probably also added to the dislike, in that time such things weren't seen as seemly in the scientific world.</p>

<p>Low was born in <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purley%2C_London_8b59.html" title="Purley, London">Purley, London</a> the second son of John and Gertrude Low, his father was an engineer and Low's interest in all things mechanical and scientific was fired by visits to his father's place of work. The family moved to <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erith.html" title="Erith">Erith</a> in the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Bexley_e3d6.html" title="London Borough of Bexley">London Borough of Bexley</a> when Low was still a baby. He was sent to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preparatory_school_%28UK%29_c111.html" title="Preparatory school (UK)">Preparatory school</a> at Colet Court when his family had to visit <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, a few years later he also got to visit <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> Australia with his family and recalls being amazed to find that telephones were fitted in every house. As a young boy Low was forever experimenting at home, building homemade steam turbines or conducting chemical experiments that brought havoc to his local neighbourhood and caused his parents to receive many complaints about the bangs, smells and gases created by young Archie.<br />
At the age of 11 he was enrolled into <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Paul%27s_School_2428.html" title="St. Paul's School">St. Paul's School</a> an institution where he didn't fit in, being as he put it "<i>too much of an individual</i>". One of his classmates for several years was one <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Law_Montgomery_c9a5.html" title="Bernard Law Montgomery">Bernard Law Montgomery</a>, who Low recalled as being "<i>rather dull</i>".</p>
<p>Aged 16 Low entered the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Technical_College_1f57.html" title="Central Technical College">Central Technical College</a> an institution far more to his liking, here his abilities really started to show. Under the guidance of his mentor professor Ashcroft, Low's mercurial mind was given free reign over many of the scientific disciplines, this lack of structured guidance though probably didn't help him in later life. During his time at the CTC Low designed a drawing device which he called "The Low flexible and adjustable curve", this device along with a dooted line pen and a self filling draughtsman's pen were marketed by Thornton's a renowned <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measuring_instrument.html" title="Measuring instrument">instrument</a> makers based in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>. He also spent a year devising and making a selector mechanism which allowed a lever when moved to fall into a pre-selected slot. It wasn't until 32 years later that pre-selected gears came in long after Low had originally thought of them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Low_a326.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Low joined his uncle, Edward Low's engineering firm, "The Low Accessories and Ignition Company", at that time this was the second oldest engineering firm in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_London_c553.html" title="City of London">City of London</a>. Unfortunately the company was in a constant struggle for solvency. Edward Low did what he could financially to help get his nephews ideas off the ground, but what was really needed though was a rich investor. During this pre-war period Low was constantly coming up with big new ideas, such as his <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_induction.html" title="Forced induction">Forced induction</a> Engine or gadgets like the whistling egg-boiler which he christened "<i>The Chanticleer</i>", it went on to sell very well, earning him some much needed money. He also experimented with <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_turbines.html" title="Gas turbines">gas turbines</a>, but the alloys available at that time wouldn't stand up to the required heat.</p>
<p>In May 1914 Low gave the first demonstration of what was to become television, he called it TeleVista. This demonstration was given to the Institute of Automobile Engineers it was entitled "<i>Seeing By Wireless</i>", Low's invention was crude and under-developed but the idea was there. The main defficiency were the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selenium.html" title="Selenium">Selenium</a> cells he used for converting <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_waves.html" title="Light waves">light waves</a> into electric impulses, they responded too slowly thus spoiling the effect.<br />
The demonstration certainly garnered a lot of media interest with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> reporting on May 30;<br /></p>

<p>Come the outbreak of war, Low joined up and received officer training after a few months he was promoted to Captain and seconded to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> the precursor of the <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_4f12.html" title="RAF">RAF</a>. His brief was to use his civilian research to find a way to remotely control an aircraft, so it could be used as a guided missile. With two other officers under him a Captain poole and Lieutenant Bowen, they set to work to see if it was possible. This project was called "Aerial Target" or AT a misnomer to fool the Germans into thinking it was about building drone plane to test anti-aircraft capabilities. After coming up with a prototype it was decided by General Sir <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Henderson_%28military_officer%29_770f.html" title="David Henderson (military officer)">David Henderson</a> (Director-General of Military Aeronatics) that the Royal Flying Corps Experimental Works should be created to build the first proper "Aerial Target" complete with explosive warhead. As head of the Experimental Works, Low was given about 30 picked men, including jewellers, carpenters and aircraftsmen in order to get the pilotless plane built as quickly as possible. The planes trial took place on March 21 1917 at <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upavon.html" title="Upavon">Upavon</a> <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Flying_School_5397.html" title="Central Flying School">Central Flying School</a> near <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salisbury_Plain_6eec.html" title="Salisbury Plain">Salisbury Plain</a>, in attendance were 30-40 allied Generals. The AT was launched from the back of a lorry using compressed air (another first), Low and his team successfully demonstrated their ability to control the craft before engine failure led to it crash landing. At a later date an electrically driven gyro (yet another first) was added to the plane, but ultimately the "Aerial Target" project wasn't followed up after the war, due to the shortsightedness of military planners. In 1917 Low and his team also invented the first electrically steered rocket (the world's first wireless, or wire-guided rocket), almost an exact counterpart of the one used by the Germans in 1942 against merchant shipping. Low's inventions during the war, were to a large extent before their time and hence were under-appreciated by the Government of the day, the Germans though were well aware of how dangerous his inventions might be. In 1915 two attempts were made to assassinate him, the first involved shots being fired through his laboratory window in Paul street. While the second attempt was from a visitor with a German accent, who came to Low's office and offered him a cigarette, which upon analysis contained enough <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strychnine.html" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a> chloride to kill.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> the Germans also made good use of Low's 1918 rocket guidance system and used it as one of the foundations for their <a href="../../../v/-/1/V-1_flying_bomb.html" title="V-1 flying bomb">V projects</a>. So yet again Low was leading the way, only this time the wrong people followed.</p>
<p>Low should have made a considerable amount of money from these inventions, but his patents couldn't stay in force for the statutory period, as he was in the employment of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Department_%28UK%29_140a.html" title="War Department (UK)">War Department</a> everything he invented was as a part of his duties so he couldn't benefit financially from them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Low_a326.html" title="Edit section: Inter-war years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inter-war years</span></h2>
<p>Not long after the war Low started the <i>Low Engineering Company Ltd</i> in association with the Hon. C. N. Bruce (later <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_Napier_Bruce%2C_3rd_Baron_Aberdare_22b9.html" title="Clarence Napier Bruce, 3rd Baron Aberdare">Lord Aberdare</a>). The company offices were on Kensington High Street, and Low spent much of his time trying to bring his inventions to fruition. As usual though he was easily distracted by gadgets that he devised, taking his attention away from the more important work. One of the better gadgets was a motor scooter that Low invented and manufactured in conjunction with Sir <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Norman_4d87.html" title="Henry Norman">Henry Norman</a>.<br />
Despite his best efforts business wasn't his strong point, an example of this is the magazine he started up with his friend <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cuthbert_Moore-Brabazon%2C_1st_Baron_Brabazon_of_Tara_59d5.html" title="John Cuthbert Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara">Lord Brabazon</a> and others . It was entitles <i>Armchair Science</i>, Low helped edit it, and at one point the sales figures were 80,000 a month, yet it never seemed to make a profit and was sold on. Another of Low's delights was speed, especially racing cars or motorbikes. He was a regular attendee at <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklands.html" title="Brooklands">Brooklands</a> and at one point invented a rocket propelled bike and numerous other gadgets and improvements for the internal combustion engine. An example of Low's prescience is that he was worried about the number of road traffic accidents that were occurring and believed speed in cities should be restricted to 25 mph using modern radio methods to enforce it. One of the bugbears of Low was excess noise, to this end he invented an audiometer to measure and record noise in a visual form. He conducted experiments on the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> and achieved some success in pinpointing trouble spots and reducing their impact by use of shields over the wheels and padding of the interior panels.<br />
In 1938 Low had lunch with a gentleman called <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Joyce_f6d9.html" title="William Joyce">William Joyce</a>, Joyce wanted Low to contribute an article to a paper he helped run. Low declined the offer being too busy, it was only a couple of years later that Joyce gained infamy as Lord Haw-Haw.</p>
<p>A few of Low's inventions from this period are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Using infra-red photography to check head space in engines.</li>
<li>A machine for reproducing photographs by radio.</li>
<li>An Audiometer that was a fore-runner of sound photography at high speed. (Used in engineering and architectural work)</li>
<li>A device for converting ordinary print to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braille.html" title="Braille">Braille</a> using <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_cell.html" title="Solar cell">photo electric cells</a></li>

<p>At the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> Low initially joined the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Ministry_f2ea.html" title="Air Ministry">Air Ministry</a> in a civil capacity. His job was to examine captured German aircraft and prepare reports for British pilots to enable them to identify the weakpoints of the enemy aircraft. Later on he joined the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Logistic_Corps_3b8f.html" title="Royal Logistic Corps">Royal Pioneer Corps</a> and was promoted to Major, in-between experiments in his back garden laboratory, he gave frequent talks to service personnel on scientific matters. Low was frequently in bad health from the late 30's onwards, he had never fully recovered from a bout of <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> he'd suffered a few years earlier. Although nothing that he experimented with during the war ultimately came to fruition, he did have some interesting ideas;</p>
<ul>
<li>A water bomb intended for use in rivers, it floated just beneath the surface, came up when needed and spread a kind of umbrella out of itself which would detonate when touched.</li>
<li>A bomb, that when dropped on airfields would be buried to the hilt but leave trailing wires on the service, any aircraft touching these wires would detonate the bomb.</li>
