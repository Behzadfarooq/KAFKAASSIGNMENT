<dd>You did well. But, we need to go through and make sure EVERYTHING has a fair use rationale, and it would be good to have that copyright tag for each as well. I'm assuming that not only did WB pay for the film, but they paid for distribution domestically and overseas, correct? Because that could change the copyright tags. I only saw WB in the production info. Anyway, even the poster needs a fair use rationale, I got the image of the cliff rationaled, just need the other Leonidas image, the poster, and I think the Xerxes image needs one (haven't check the poster or Xerxes yet). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 21:24, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, it's looking pretty good. I've been keeping my eye on it, and I'm especially glad to see all of those nasty lists seamlessly transformed into prose, though I don't know if you're responsible for that or not; either way, it's awesome. I agree with <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a>'s thoughts on the talk page, however, regarding the images being moved around; I'm not particularly fond of the arrows-blotting-out-the-sun one, myself. I don't know about including pics of the toys (yes, there are toys), though, and I almost positive that they haven't released a movie-tie in version of the graphic novel; the edition I keep seeing in all of the bookstores is the one and only hardback book that I've had at home for years. What is your take on the images?</p>
<p>By the way, I don't know if you've read it, but <a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> posted on the talk page about nominating the article for GA status once it calms down a bit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:300_%28film%29#GA_possibility" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:300_%28film%29#GA_possibility" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <span style="font-family: verdana"><a href="../../../y/l/l/User%7EYllosubmarine_e632.html" title="User:Yllosubmarine">María</a>: <small>(<a href="../../../y/l/l/User_talk%7EYllosubmarine_57e8.html" title="User talk:Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">habla</span></a> ~ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yllosubmarine_42d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">cosas</span></a>)</small></span> 18:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the article is not worthy of a nomination yet, as well, but it's something to aim for; perhaps in a week or so when things stop being all crazy-like.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I would <i>love</i> to see something from the GN on the article, just to make some of those "it's not accurate, it's not accurate!" folks shush up. I hate uploading any picture that isn't either a movie poster or a bookcover, for fear of violating copyright, but doing a quick Google image search, I came across this: <a href="http://www.solaceincinema.com/2006/10/04/300-comic-to-screen-comparison/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.solaceincinema.com/2006/10/04/300-comic-to-screen-comparison/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and then I drooled. I have no idea if any of it is fair use, though. I really, really want it to be.</dd>

<dd>My opinion, the 4th to last (start at the bottom and count up to the 4th) and the first large scale image (the cliff scene) are probably the best. Actually, if someone could crop them we could use a better image in the plot for those, just crop the comic out. Anyway, as for fair use, so long as you have a comparison section it's fine, you just have to write a fair-use rationale. What I generally do is find a FA and just copy their fair use rationale, supplimenting the appropriate information or adding stuff if it didn't list it. Also, you'll need a summary of what the image is depicting (don't mean in the article, mean on the picture page) which would basically say something like "image is being used for comparison of how the GN translated to the cinema" or something like that. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 19:12, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looked good, I was copy editing it a second ago. I was also trying to find a comic panel tag, but I couldn't. If it's just "comic panel" cool, if not and you know what it is then I think you should add it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 20:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, if you haven't already then go ahead and tack on that tag as well.

<dd>I mean, since none of the images are "free", and we are using them under "fair use" then we have to apply a fair use rationale (like you did for the comic comparison) to every image on the page, including the poster. I've taken care of it all minus the image of the behind the scenes compared to the finished version. Everthing also has a copyright tag. I'm going to search articles to see if I can find one that explains how to give a rationale for a similar comparison of "behind the scenes" and "finished product". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 21:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the anti-300 site is already mentioned in the article, and others who are reverting it and its friends don't want the article to be overrun; the site that I recently reverted, however, (and I think Bignole did before me) is a fansite, actually; submitted fanart with an Ancient Persian theme, probably inspired by the movie, but come on, people. Speaking of the calm before the storm, I wish fansites were the only reverts we had to look forward to, heh. <span style="font-family:verdana"><a href="../../../y/l/l/User%7EYllosubmarine_e632.html" title="User:Yllosubmarine">María</a>:</span> <small>(<a href="../../../y/l/l/User_talk%7EYllosubmarine_57e8.html" title="User talk:Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">habla</span></a> con<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yllosubmarine_42d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">migo</span></a>)</small> 22:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you referring to the 300movie.info website? It's basically an online petition, the same as petitiononline.com. As such it's a violation of NPOV because it's an entire site devoted to fighting the film. A source that discusses the website is fine, but an external link for the website itself wouldn't be appropriate. It wouldn't pass the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html#Campaigning" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Conflict of interest for campaigning</a> as they are basically campaigning against the film, just in an unusual way. It's being included as an external link, and not as a source for anything. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 22:32, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am editing only in this section since I am more knowledgeable in this area. Not all me contributions are Iranian-friendly (e.g I have added Warner Bros response at the end of the article and I have removed un-sourced material and vandalism a few times), In fact I don’t totally agree with Iranian outrage and I criticize it myself. Not all Iranians are pushing in one side (see my arguments with The Behnam). Anyways thanks for your advice and I am happy that you are unblocked. (Shahingohar 05:10, 18 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>FYI: 3RR applies in all contexts except for the removal of blatant vandalism—"good faith" edits, if they revert material more than 4 times in any sort of conflict, violate the 3RR.

<dd>Regardless of how justified reverts may be, the 3RR is there to encourage people to discuss and try to see things eye-to-eye, rather than simply constantly reverting eachother (often both sides in a revert war feel that they are completely justified).

<p>Hi, thanks for the compliment. After a little spat with Agha Nader on the AN/3RR page, I am in the clear on the 3RR thing, so there is nothing to worry about there. Mehrshad123, who I reported, also ended up in the clear, amazingly enough.</p>
<p>As far as the Zionist thing, that is the state media, which of course is can't exactly be called the thermometer of the Iranian people. But if you read the transcript itself, it is just another Iranian conspiracy theory speculation. (In case you didn't notice, conspiracy theories are fairly common with Iranians). I believe it was 'commentary' by the IRINN, and hence speculation, probably the opinion of one or a few commentators. Anyway, I addressed this earlier. I felt that Mercenary's initial inclusion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=115665226&amp;oldid=115659185" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=115665226&amp;oldid=115659185" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> had a bit of an anti-Iranian tone to it (it was the strawman), so I adjusted the sentence to be more specific, accurate, and less vehement/POV-toned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=115671437&amp;oldid=115667526" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=115671437&amp;oldid=115667526" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. I hope that improves it. It is fairly easy to 'milk' a <a href="../../../m/e/m/MEMRI_1fae.html" title="MEMRI">MEMRI</a> transcript to portray something very negatively but I believe I have corrected this, and that my rewrite is more accurate. The threat always exists with MEMRI reports; for some reason they manage to translate things from the negative side of the Islamic world almost all of the time. But if you can make it even more accurate and neutral, please do.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think I've tied up all of the loose ends needed to start a wikibreak. I'm rather busy in the next few days, but I'll be back by 22nd if not earlier.

<p>Sure, this is a question of taste. The OED gives "host" in this sense ("An armed company or multitude of men; an army.") as "Now arch. and poet."; and it sounds a bit funny to me, as I think immediately of OED 3a. "the multitude of angels that attend upon God." But I suppose we can be poetic if we like. "Quaking with fear" strikes me as wordy, and the sentence is already a bit convoluted. To make the phrase fully grammatical one would have to write "Quaking with fear at <i>the prospect of</i> facing...." or something to that effect. But if it seems more effective to you, no problem. --<a href="../../../j/a/v/User%7EJavits2000_0fa8.html" title="User:Javits2000">Javits2000</a> 17:19, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm letting you know that I removed that "Zionist" bit. What some random and unknown commentator has claimed on an Iranian TV channel about the movie, in a political commentary, is neither relevant nor significant.

<dd>Oh, okay. Well, looking at the MOS, I didn't see any specific rules for the number of images in one article. I also didn't see anything at WP:films. Film FA seem to vary, however; <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boondock_Saints_3641.html" title="Boondock Saints">Boondock Saints</a> only has two aside from the infobox image, but <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_%281978_film%29_29c9.html" title="The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)">The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)</a> has nine. 300 has six so far, so I'd say we're safe in adding one or two more considering how important the look of the film is.

<dd>I would suggest that the removals performed addressed the numbers of Iranian MPs who called for the film's banning. In all but the last revert, pov-pushing edits claimed that 4 out of 290 persons contrituted "several". Not even the dictionary does that. When I opted to be more specific and stating that "four MPs (out of 290)", so as to allow the reader to make up their own mind about what word best qualified, someone changed that to 'some', which is still considered by dicitonaried and most folk as more than 4/290ths. What I reverted were attempts to make the support for banning to appear grater than what it was.</dd>
<dd>If however, you are considering the reverts of the statements concerning zionism, I had been reinstating edits that blanked them repeatedly, despite the statements having reached concensus days before. the reason the POV-editors wanted the statements removed was rather succinctly put by one of the ones blanking the statements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:300_%28film%29&amp;curid=3855133&amp;diff=115897611&amp;oldid=115897178" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:300_%28film%29&amp;curid=3855133&amp;diff=115897611&amp;oldid=115897178" rel="nofollow">here</a>; they felt that arguing the reliability of the statements and dismissing the reliability of all Iranian TV and Fox to boot (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:300_%28film%29&amp;diff=115894671&amp;oldid=115894425" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:300_%28film%29&amp;diff=115894671&amp;oldid=115894425" rel="nofollow">here</a>) was the only way to maintain any valid defense of the Depiction of Persians section of the article. I personally don't think the statement's inclusion would have truly hurt that, but it would have balanced the Iranian-as-victim stance that had been adopted by the POV edits. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 23:56, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, Core, but are you aware that the last "diff" you provided wasn't a revert but a rewording, based on the contents of the actual source itself? How can you classify wording a sentence to reflect the contents of its source as a revert, just because someone wrote it in a manner that was inaccurate? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 23:58, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right. The fourth diff wasn't a revert. Unblocked with apologies. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#006449">desat</font></a></b> 00:31, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, after re-reviewing <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, it doesn't have to be the same thing - all reverts in a 24-hour period are counted.

<dd>Yeah, it happens. Good to see you weren't blocked...er...well reblocked. Just keep an eye on things. Don't repeat yourself, do it once and then immediately go to the talk page for discussion if someone reverts behind you. It's ok if it's in there while your discussing, the article isn't going anywhere. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 01:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
