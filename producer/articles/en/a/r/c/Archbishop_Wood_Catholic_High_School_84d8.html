</div>
</div>
<p>Archbishop Wood was founded and built in 1964 in Warminster Township, Pennsylvania as two separate but essentially identical buildings. The school was originally divided into Archbishop Wood High School For Boys and Archbishop Wood High School For Girls.</p>
<p>Though the original blueprints for the school included an <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditorium.html" title="Auditorium">auditorium</a> to be built in the space between the separate buildings, budgetary constraints forced plans for the auditorium to be scrapped. By <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, funding for the auditorium had been secured thanks to donations by the Archbishop Wood Alumni Association. The Sofia Friedman Auditorium was completed by <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, coinciding with the joining of the two schools into Archbishop Wood Catholic High School, wherein the school became co-educational and the two buildings were united by means of the auditorium.</p>

<p>Archbishop Wood Catholic High School is well known throughout the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for its excellence in academics. The school currently offers eleven Advanced Placement classes, and over 98% of students take the SATs each year. 75% of the graduating class attend a four-year college, while 19% attend a two-year college. Graduates frequently gain acceptance into some of the most prestigious schools nationwide, including Ivy League and Patriot League schools as well as service academies, and are awarded over $10 million in scholarships yearly.</p>

<p>The Viking Voice is Archbishop Wood's student newspaper. When the school was founded in 1965, the student newspaper was split into two divisions, one for the boys' school and another for the girls'. The newspaper was called "Crossroads" and "Woodwinds", respectively. When the two buildings were united and Archbishop Wood made co-educational in 1989, the newspaper was rechristened "The Viking Voice".</p>
<p>Individuals within the school have maintained an extensive physical archive of the newspapers dating back to 1967. Though efforts have been made to enhance the standing of the newspaper, there has historically been little financial or institutional support for an expanded, comprehensive student-run newspaper infrastructure.</p>
