<p>Company, not sufficiently known to be in Wikipedia. 4 google hits. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndris_6e9c.html" title="User:Andris">Andris</a> 06:09, Jun 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Not sufficiently known" is an awkward reason to not have something in Wikipedia. Most of us are probably only familiar with a tiny fraction of the topics covered. 4 google hits probably doesn't mean very much... firstly the website is very new (updated 15th May) and secondly b2b businesses specializing in physical products tend not to have much of a web presence. Keep, unless verified to be an insignificant company by some other means. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 09:18, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Um, did I not just explain in the very comment you are supposedly replying to why <i><b>4 Google hits</b></i> is <i>irrelevant</i>??? <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 18:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Not having a significant presense in Google doesn't mean anything. I'm sure there are a huge number of significant businesses that have no Internent presense, and even then might not come up in Google. Google is not the Internet, the Internet is not the world. I would recommend <b>keeping</b> this article unless it in someway conflicts with Wikipedia operations. --<a href="../../../j/h/o/User%7EJholman_d00c.html" title="User:Jholman">Jeff</a> 23:07, Jun 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Agreed. This is not an ad repository and no one is going to come to an encyclopedia looking for information on a company such as this. - Lucky 6.9 18:33, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Who are you to judge what people will come to an encyclopedia for? What is particularly ad-dy about this entry, compared with the hundreds (probably thousands) of articles we have about companies? I think you are rejecting something because it is outside your sphere of interest and experience. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 18:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I daresay that there are a lot of articles on this site well outside my spheres of interest and experience. There are thousands of articles about companies and their products, but they are companies and products of note, notoriety, infamy, etc. If I was looking for information on a Hong Kong handbag manufacturer, I'd go to Google and find a website. The burden of proof of notoriety in this case should be on the author.
<ul>
<li>It is a leading manufacturer of handbags in Hong Kong (and if you've been shopping in HK, you know they sell a lot of handbags). That is sufficient proof of notoriety. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 23:23, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I should also mention that many similar articles have been deleted in the past. Let's be honest: Who <i>really</i> would come to a site like this and enter this name? - Lucky 6.9 21:18, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the circumstances are the same as this case, then those deletions were mistaken. People may not come to Wikipedia specifically for this company, but they may come to Google, like most of our traffic. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 23:23, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although significantly leaning towards delete, might it have more Google hits in a non-English name? The name sounds like a weird translation, something that only non-English speakers would come up with. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep. Probably reasonably notable in Hong Kong; naturally Google is biased towards companies in English speaking countries. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 20:14, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete. Unless someone can provide results from google.com.hk that this is notable, then it just looks like unnecessary self-promotion to me. - <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 22:11, Jun 1, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fail to see how this would be considered self-promotion. The article will only be found if someone is ooking for information about this company, or if another article links to it. Another article will only link to it if the conpany has any significance; if not there is nothing to worry about it. --<a href="../../../j/h/o/User%7EJholman_d00c.html" title="User:Jholman">Jeff</a> 23:07, Jun 1, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>For the third time, since when is Google the final arbitrator of anything? A significant proportion of the information I add to Wikipedia comes from books, and can not be found through Google (well it couldn't, until I added it to Wikipedia and hence to Google&#160;:-). It is not immediately obvious that this is self-promotion (the IP in question has lots of HK-related edits). <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 23:23, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep,</b> strong keep. The article is reasonably NPOV and doesn't sound at all like an advertisement, just a sober statement of its business. I feel Google means little, because many significant companies (for example, established manufacturers in "old-economy" industries) tend not to get mentioned much online. Also, I agree with Pcb21--who are we to judge what people will come to an encyclopedia for? And finally, in any case, Wikipedia is <s><i>not</i> an encyclopedia</s> (sorry, I meant <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">"not a <i>paper</i> encyclopedia"</a>). I can imagine people coming here to learn about the companies they work for, much as they might come to learn about the history of the streets they live on or schools they attended. Who are we to thwart that sort of curiosity? <i>-- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikisux_cf56.html" title="User:Wikisux">Wikisux</a> 23:13, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</i>

<li>I can't help but start to see this article as a bit of a litmus test of how deletionist has become in the last X months.

<li><b>Delete</b> This company has no political, cultural, historical significance. This isn't a accessories catalogue. Who would use this information? It does't have the history required by a commercial company to deserve an encyclopaedia entry. Where is the potential for it to grow beyond a stub? Employee of the month lists? Product ranges? We have to remember that Wikipedia isn't an infinite space where we have space for this stuff. Ask the creator to justify the page at least (if he/she hasn't).--[[User:HamYoyo|<a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamYoyo_060c.html" title="User:HamYoyo">HamYoyo</a> <a href="../../../h/a/m/User_talk%7EHamYoyo_53a7.html" title="User talk:HamYoyo">(Talk)</a>]] 23:37, Jun 1, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The creator of the page was an anon. They easily might not find this debate. I have thus assumed responsibility for creation by proxy for the purposes of defending it. I justify the page by saying that it has verifiable encyclopedic information, and that it doesn't meet any criteria for deletion under our deletion policy. No threshold for how politically, culturally or historically important a particular company has to be is given. The threshold is that the information has to be verifiable and factual, and that someone has to be bothered to write it. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 07:10, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>What's to edit? This is nothing but advertising, and as such, does not belong on Wikipedia. Are we going to allow articles on every small company in the world, with one paragraph saying what they do and a link to page to buy their products? If so, we might as well start selling ad space. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:25, Jun 2, 2004 (UTC)</b>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I don't see the problem with allowing people to write articles about small companies, as long as they are factually accurate and NPOV (as this article is.) Secondly, RickK, based on the evidence, I would submit that this article is <b>NOT AN AD; it appears to have been written in good faith</b>. The anonymous user has a long history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=130.88.185.84" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=130.88.185.84" rel="nofollow">edits</a> related to Hong Kong and China. <i>— <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikisux_cf56.html" title="User:Wikisux">Wikisux</a> 00:46, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)</i></li>
<li>We have literally thousands of articles on things with links to commerce. For instance we have thousands of articles on fictional characters, all of whom created for the purpose of making money. The fact that there seems to be a willingness to keep them, but perhaps not this is indicative of a systematic bias. People want this article deleted because it is about a plain old non-western manufacturing company, rather than cosy western computery domain of understanding. But for a lot of readers, this company's existence is more significant than those daft computer instruction articles, or Star Trek, Starcraft, Pokemon... <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 09:13, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, User:130.88.185.84 isn't Mikula, he's made many edits to Hong Kong related articles. What I suggest though is that someone who speaks Chinese goes over to the Chinese Wikipedia and asks them there whether they have or want an article on the subject, possibly on their vfd page. Then, if it's good enough for them, keep if not bin it.

<li>Weak keep. This appears to be the corporate equivalent of a vanity page. Verifiable and even written in a sufficiently neutral tone, but not necessarily encyclopedic.

I don't know this company from Adam, I have no idea if their products are good, I utterly can not recommend them. What I have been doing of course is trying to enforce the Wikipedia:Deletion Policy for an article that caught my eye. In months past this article would've easily been kept. But over time there's been a drift towards deletionism, because the participants in vfd who are on the inclusionist side get fed up with the abuse. There are several articles that I could make this sort of stand for, but just don't have the time. The fact that making these sorts of stands is sufficient grounds to get called a confidence trickster's assistant just shows how far vfd has come (in the wrong direction). Anyone who's been around Wikipedia a while would know it is completely ridiculous to call me what you did. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 19:41, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<li>Strong <b>neutral</b>. This article falls in much the same category as non-notable secondary schools. There's no very good reason for it to be in Wikipedia, and there's no very good reason for it not to be in Wikipedia. IMHO it is silly to be expressing any <i>strong</i> opinion about it either way, and silly to be getting overly worked up about it. It's too long to be criticized as a substub, it's factual and probably verifiable, it doesn't use any promotional language—the company name says the bags are "nice" but the article itself doesn't make that claim. I wouldn't object to anything in it if the company were notable. Putting a non-notable company in Wikipedia is intrinsically promotional. We're using more disk space for this discussion than the article is taking up. But... there's no earthly reason to have it in Wikipedia other than that it might please the person who created the article. So... <b>I don't care.</b> I <b>vehemently</b> don't care. All be the same in a hundred years, that's what I say. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 19:32, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<li>Hmmm... This is a tough one. I think I will say keep and delete the link to the company website to make the article less ad-like. Delete the sentence that reads <i>Its range of products include ladies handbags, unisex casual bags, travel bags, backpacks, shoulder bags, cosmetic bags, evening purses, natural &amp; paper straw bags, and sports bags.</i>, since it sounds addish and seems to be lifted straight from the website. Maybe replace the final phrase with "...a wide variety of bags". Maybe someone might want to put a note on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:130.88.185.84" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:130.88.185.84" rel="nofollow">the author's talk page</a> asking him what else he knows about the company and why he decided to write about it. Maybe a famous celebrity bought a bag from that company or something? Anyway, I don't see tremendous harm in keeping the article around, other than the 1 KB of space it's using on the server. Maybe in the future the article will develop into something bigger. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencer195_dc2c.html" title="User:Spencer195">☞spencer195</a> 01:35, 6 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Honestly, I have not been "very very busy" doing this, it has taken only a fraction of my Wikipedia time. (Unlike you, only a very small fraction of my recent edits have been to vfd). I don't really understand why I am not allowed to question the votes of others... how else I am supposed to point out that deletion of this article is not in the spirit or letter of Wikipedia policy that vfd contributors have grown increasing ignorant of? Your original reason for voting "delete" was the very mature reason that I have been arguing to "keep". Your instinct was to "delete", seeing that view was obviously not going to get consensus, you decided to smear me by using a loaded term like "shill" and hoped to get away with it by presenting your own definition of that word. But hey let's continue this somewhere else. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 20:58, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I tend toward a). Yeah, Wikipedia is not paper, but Wikipedia isn't <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> either.

<dd>Perhaps the question when considering deletion, though, is not whether <i>everything factual needs to be in the encyclopedia</i>, but whether <i>anything factual needs <b>not</b> to be in the encyclopedia</i>. Unless the Wiki really starts to struggle under the size of the database, what purpose is actually served by a significance test? Who suffers if there are articles of interest to relatively few people, so long as they are well-written, accurate, NPOV etc? Removing the significance test gets around the problem of defining <i>significant</i>, which I would argue is impossible to do in an objective, culturally neutral fashion. With the number of people in the world and on the net, an article could be of interest to only one person in a million, and still find 1,000 avid readers. Such an article might be on an arcane scientific topic, a variety of tulip, an obscure opera or the manufacturer of one's favourite handbag. Who among us is really qualified to rank other people's interests in order of importance?

<dd>Seriously this debate will end soon (because of the deadline), but I hope it will be carried off to somewhere else. It is pretty interesting (not on the co. <i>per se</i>) and is of value.

<dd>You've rumbled me there - I guess I am an inclusionist &lt;grin&gt;. I think merely being factual and NPOV is quite sufficient to differentiate us from the world wide web as a whole! Agree about carrying on the debate in more general terms. As a pretty new wikipedian I don't know how/where these things happen, but could somebody who knows what they are doing create a suitable discussion page or point me to it if it already exists?
