<p>To the obviously disgruntled student (The LEAKER, The TRUTH) who left the sections: "What riordan doesn't want you to know" and "Riordan in the media"</p>
<p>First of all, the section about what Riordan "doesn't want you to know" contains errors in the title itself, as well as the body of the article. You begin by refering to Riordan as a cognitive person, which it is not. It is a student body and an administration. if you want to write about the administration, that is okay, but "Riordan" can refer to anyone who is even slightly involved with the school. Secondly, who is "you" referring to? You as in a student, prospective students, parents, prospective parents, the general public, the Cubans? Who?</p>
<p>In regards to the body of the article, you missed the point of Wikipedia altogether. From a technical standpoint, you did not cite your sources, and the article you were referring to misquoted the teacher in question. The term "gook" was hearsay, and even the sudent in question denies that it was uttered by either party. Please keep in mind, accuracy is important here. Also, what evidence do you have that "Riordan" doesn't want this information out in the public domain? there weren't any cover ups, the teacher in question privately and publicly apologized, and now he works for Notre Dame High School. What more could someone want? An advertising campaign highlighting frizzy-haired quick-witted and misunderstood teachers?</p>
<p>The section "Riordan in the media" was flawed as well. "Riordan" in the media implies that the school was in the media, not former students who killed somebody. Yes, we all know that the Giants fan who killed a Dodgers fan was from Riordan. So? Killers aren't allowed to go to high school? Are you implying that everyone who goes to Riordan will be a killer? Are you killing someone right now? If you want to have a section called: "Riordan graduates in the media," perhaps in an alumni section, you could probably make it an unbiased examination of "Riordan in the Media" as you call it. You could talk about Danny Moreno, who won a Jefferson award and was featured on CBS news. There's a clip of him on the website. Going with the media theme, you could get that KTVU anchor a link. He's "in the media."</p>
<p>In the future, please do not use Wikipedia as a forum for venting a personal vendetta against a school.</p>

TruthReveal:</p>
<p>Well there are several misunderstanding on your part. One, do not assume I am/was a student in the school! Word spreads, son. I get news from students there and that's not against the rules.</p>
<p>Two, the title was&#160;:what the school does not want you to know. Not RIORDAN. And the "you" part? Yes... this can be mean anybody...even the Cubans!</p>
<p>Actually the story wasn't made public by the school I think. The school did not even speak about it when it came out to the public. By not informing students and their parents is a way to cover up. That is what happened. I have a friend that went to this school and graduated 2 years ago. I know what goes on.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Mr. TruthReveal,</p>
<p>I certainly do appreciate your heartfelt, if not gramatically and logically incorrect statements. However, even you can recognize that your statements in their current form do not belong in this article.</p>
<p>Mr. Truth, I believe you are the one that is assuming something. I am not a tool of the administration that doesn't care about facts. I am not here to erase any trace of discord from the article. Criticism is healthy for the school, especially in a public forum like Wikipedia. By referring to me as "son" and sarcastically disregarding my constructive criticism, you have proven that you honestly don't care about creating a factual, unbiased page.</p>
<p>In the best interests of the objective just mentioned, I will again delete your section, and again explain why am doing so. I deleted it for the following reasons: 1. The section is mistitled 2. The section cites an article that was retracted due to misinformation 3. The section is highly biased</p>
<p>You said, and I quote, "By not informing students and their parents is a way to cover up." While I particularly enjoyed this hemorrhage of the English language, I will have to politely disagree with its intent. Are you expecting the school to tell everyone in a newsletter that a teacher (who is not a racist, and later apoligized, and offered in his resignation) made an offhand comment to a student, and that parents should be on the look-out for hurt feelings? The school was ultimately responsible for the teacher's actions, and they took responsibility by not rehiring him. Are you implying that any school that has anything less than noteworthy happen on campus should be required to publish it in newspapers across the county, as well as drop leaflets from the sky? The school took necessary action, and the administration is willing to discuss the event with any concerned student, parent, or anyone else for that matter.</p>
<p>If you wanted to put the event with some others, perhaps calling it "Recent Controversy Regarding Departed Faculty" then the event would be suitable for publishing. I would not cite that Examiner article, because in the next issue, the article was retracted by the editors because they misquoted both parties. Remember, research is always important in editing Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also, even when you say "the school" you are too vague. "The school" could refer to students, to janitors, or to coaches. If you want to start a conspiracy, then you must first be able to say who exactly is doing the cover-up. Frankly, there is no way you could factually say that any specific member of the administration initiated a cover-up, or continues to cover the event up.</p>
<p>I appreciate your ongoing efforts to improve the school and Wikipedia through awareness, but as of late your contributions have been more destructive than productive.</p>
<p>P.S. Sal Castanada went to Riordan. Perhaps you could write something regarding his accuracy in traffic reports or something. <a href="http://www.ktvu.com/station/1849372/detail.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ktvu.com/station/1849372/detail.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ktvu.com/station/1849372/detail.html</a></p>
<hr />
<p>TruthReveal:</p>
<p>Mr. Conti, I appreciate your critism and understand how much you appreciate this school. Unfortunately, both you and I do not agree with each other. But I will try my best to make it as unbias as much as I can. I will also cite the evidence to support my facts. I apologize for my previous "biased" remarks and I hope we will eventually agree on the fact that this article will be filled with unbiased information.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<li>I think Riordan is a great school. It offers a great academics to young men and encouraging them to use the gifts given to them.<br />
-Anonymous</li>
<li>Riordan is an amazing school, in that those students who wish to succeed will, while ones who don't will still have the opportunity to do so. The staff is tireless, and although there is some criticism regarding the administration, there are individuals who truly care and love for the Riordan family. - Anonymous</li>
