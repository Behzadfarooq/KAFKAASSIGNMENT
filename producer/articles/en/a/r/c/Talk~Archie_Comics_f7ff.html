<p>Funny, there's an entire stub about how Archie meets The Punisher (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punisher_Meets_Archie" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punisher_Meets_Archie" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punisher_Meets_Archie</a>), but no mention in this section of the article. Or is the punisher not considered a superhero? I dunno.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was about to mention that - The Punisher isn't a superhero, but an anti-hero, since he goes about killing criminals instead of putting them in jail.

<p>"The Hangman (the Comet's younger brother) <b>might</b> be the <b>most brutal</b> superhero of the 1940s." This is a pretty subjective sentence and there is no qualification for it. It needs to be rewritten.</p>
<p>In addition, why is there no mention of the movie "Archie, to Riverdale and Back Again"? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099054/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099054/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>The Hangman passage is subjective as it stands, but it's an interesting "fact" if it has any historical truth, and it would be great if someone could cite a reference or authority instead of having to remove it. ...

<dd>The Hangman (like the Punisher &amp; very earlier Batman) was all about <i>retribution</i> in an age before there was a Comics Code Authority &amp; no one thought twice about violence in comics ... during one of the Archie superhero revival attempts he was brought back as a fairly rabid villain (without much change from his original appearances apparently). There were a LOT or brutal heroes in the 40's though, and even the early versions of modern mainstream heroes not infrequently killed their villains directly or through (deliberate) inaction.--Invisifan 15:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The other parents appear less frequently" -- not exactly ... while Hiram Lodge appears frequently, Archie's own parents are not that far behind; by contrast (despite having her own wikipedia article) Hermione Lodge appears no more frequently than Betty's parents (Hal &amp; Alice) or Jughead's (Forsythe Pendleton Jr and Gladys) — although they all appear far more than Reggie's father (Ricky) and his never-seen-and-unnamed mother. It could be noted also that Hermione's appearance varies greatly (sometimes within the same story!!) between slim, glamorous socialite and stodgy (and slightly overweight) matron.</p>
<p>As for Betty's siblings, she has (although the Archie universe being what it is there are stories implying otherwise) an older brother (Chic) and and older sister (Polly), both introduced in "Little Archie". Chic is almost never seen or mentioned in the mainstream stories (although once apparently as a <i>spy!!</i>), however Polly is not infrequently referred to by Betty in a sibling rivalry context and does occasionally appear in stories (she's a red-head — like Archie, not Cheryl).</p>
<p>Harry &amp; Saranda would be better placed under "Townsfolk" as neither are students or even teens. As for Freddy Fogarty &amp; Ambrose Pipps, I'm not sure they warrant a separate and redundant reference here -- possibly <i><a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Archie_Comics_fb76.html" title="Minor characters in Archie Comics">Minor characters in Archie Comics</a></i> should be referenced as a "see also" instead? --Invisifan</p>
<p><br />
Yeah, I'm aware that Archie's parents appear much more frequently than any of the other normal-income parents and more than Veronica's mother. I didn't move her mother because I thought the two parents should be together. And although I have a sizeable collection, I haven't been buying much lately. I had no idea on Harry and Saranda--have never heard of them, but as they were noted to be dating the main characters I thought they belonged there. Guess not--go ahead and shift them where they <i>should</i> be.</p>
<p>I'm reasonably sure that I heard Betty's sister mentioned in the regular comic...I think I recall her actually appearing on one occasion, but it was a long time ago, my reading that. Anyway, that's why I put her up. Are there any other family members that should go up? I know canon is an issue, but I would expect that a sibling mentioned once is good enough to note. Doesn't Archie have an older brother Chad? or am I completely thinking of something else? On extended family, might be a judgment call (such as if an "uncle" is used merely for comedic effect).</p>
<p>As to Little Archie vs. Archie--I would expect that Little Archie would be background facts for the regular series (in as much as you can call anything a "fact" in Archie). I don't consider it the same as the other "alternate universes." Unlike the futuristic series, it's established fact, not speculation; unlike the spies or time traveling, it's told in a generally factual manner (aside from the supernatural bits such as aliens, which crop up in regular Archie too anyway (especially at Christmas)). Still, regarding Ambrose and Fangs, if you guys think that frequent appearances in Little Archie and only one appearance in Archie means a minor character, go ahead and remove 'em, I guess.<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilyle_c306.html" title="User:Kilyle">Kilyle</a> 08:01, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as ranking the frequency of parental appearances, informally I'd say:
<ol>
<li>Hiram Lodge (easily)</li>
<li>the Andrews</li>
<li>the Coopers</li>
<li>the Jones</li>
<li>Hermione Lodge</li>
<li>Rick Mantle</li>
<li>anyone else (essentially never)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>if the "The other parents appear less frequently" is removed altogether it would make more sense, otherwise it needs rearranging.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Polly Cooper isn't frequent, but she did appear in the digest on the srands last month (as an example) and gets mentions now &amp; then (unlike big brother Chic, who like Ambrose &amp; Fangs is primarily only in Little Archie -- btw, "Chic" is Archie's own nickname from his very first appearance) ... As for other family members it's pretty well established that of the core 5 only Betty &amp; Jughead have siblings; Veronica does have a cousin Leroy (about 10) who appears whenever a younger relative would make life difficult for Archie; Jughead does have a few notable relatives (Saranda Jones is a cousin of some sort on his father's side) — his mother has a sister (<a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilma_Wilkin_1a53.html" title="Wilma Wilkin">Wilma Wilkin</a>) and brother (Herman) who live in Midville and are part of a different Archie Comics series...</dd>

<p>FACULTY FUNNIES #1 was released in June of 1989, in which the faculty of Riverdale High are indeed imbued with superpowers. Professor Flutesnoot invites the other faculty members to an advance viewing of the science fair projects - Archie's entry explodes, giving the faculty superpowers. Ms. Grundy gains the ability to stretch her right arm as if it were rubber. Coach Clayton gains "super lung" abilities. Mr. Weatherbee is given "trouble-sense" alerting him to nearby danger. Professor Flutesnoot is given the ability to withstand electrical shock. The series was named "Faculty Funnies presents THE AWESOME FOURSOME." These powers lasted through issue #5, the last issue in the Faculty Funnies comicbook series. I can't quite remember whether this is true or not, but I think it's possible that some of the cartoons in the regular Archie digests that revolved mainly around the faculty of Riverdale High were also called Faculty Funnies. 71.56.86.252 12:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is currently no speculation as to what grade Archie and his friends are in. Numerous proms naturally suggest 11th or 12th grade, but can anyone uncover specific stories that might point to earlier grades, or contradict being in 11th or 12th? Funny they never talk about graduation day, so is it possible they are all in 11th? This should be documented under the "Inconsistent themes" section, assuming there are any.--<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetron4_6924.html" title="User:Metron4">Metron4</a> 23:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Grade 10 or 11 - they are officially (perennially) 16-17 which puts them in that general area, and they never appear as either freshmen or seniors ...--Invisifan 01:47, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anyone know of an attempt to calculate the number of times Archie or his friends have appeared in classroom stories and tried to compare that to the number of possible school days in the average four-year high school? Very roughly put, nine school months, times thirty days, minus three vacation weeks (two for Xmas, one for Easter), minus four or five holidays, all multiplied by four school years equals, wow, about one thousand possible school days.</p>
<p>One thousand school days with six classes per day = 6,000 possible classes</p>
<p>Now here's where it gets tricky. Lets say Archie Comics has published at least five Archie comic books every month and has since December 1941. Lets say January 1942.</p>
<p>2006-1942 = 64 years of Archie.</p>
<p>64 years X 5 books X 12 issues a year = 3,840 issues for five titles.</p>
<p>Each comic has two to three stories average. If just one of those three is set in a classroom, that's 3,840 classes. According to my horrible, horrible calculations, Archie still has a ways to go before he graduates. This assumes that the stories we read are from all four years of high school. Anyone else want a go at this, just for fun?--<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetron4_6924.html" title="User:Metron4">Metron4</a> 23:46, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You made one critical mistake calculating the number of school days - weekends... Let's try this - 52 weeks a year, minus about 11 for summer, 2 for Christmas, 1 for March break/Easter and another for miscellaneous individual holidays == 37, times 5 days per week is: 185 days in school x 4 == 740 times 6 classes = 2940 (so say 3000) ... only about HALF your estimate... and since we never see them specifically as freshmen or seniors we lose at least some of that at the beginning &amp; end so I'd say it's closer to 2500 classes available for stories.--Invisifan 01:49, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Have removed the following from the article as it does not make sense. If someone knows what it was trying to say, perhaps you can insert it back into the <b>Inconsistent themes and character portrayals</b> section:</p>
<ul>
<li>(edit: he is part of the gang, only he is the "dity Uncle Harry," the one who does the mean things but is still part of the group, anyway).</li>
</ul>
<p>I have read the entire article and it doesn't need copy-editing: grammar, spelling etc is fine. However the content is kind of waffly and not organised particularly well so if it is still an issue, you might want to consider inserting the {{cleanup}} tag. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenLouise_6ad3.html" title="User:JenLouise">JenLouise</a> 02:31, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone have anything about the bad blood that was left when Don DeCarlo left Archie shortly before his death. There was some controversy about the creators rights on Josie and the Pussy Cats when that movie was made. I know it was quite bad. I think there was something in the CBG and in the forward for a book of his pin-up girls. Not sure about either of those, I can't quite remember where I read this.
