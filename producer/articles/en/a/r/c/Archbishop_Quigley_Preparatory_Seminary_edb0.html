<p>Archbishop James E. Quigley began plans for a minor seminary in Chicago in July of 1903, shortly after his installation. Only 417 diocesan and 149 order priests then served Chicago's 252 parishes, with a city population nearing 1.7 million, and with the archdiocese's then boundaries extending across northern Illinois. Quigley recruited Rev. Francis Andrew Purcell to head the new minor seminary, and dispatched him to the College Propaganda Fide in Rome to earn a doctorate in divinity. The site of the new seminary at Wabash (then Cass) Avenue and Superior Street, was opened on October 2, 1905 upon Purcell's return, and named Cathedral College of the Sacred Heart. Following the European seminary practice of being sited in the midst of the city center of ministry, it also followed the practice of school on Saturday, with Thursday off. No tuition was charged for the first 52 freshmen recruited and admitted upon the nomination of their pastor. Nine other priests, all with either Irish or German surnames, served as the faculty.<sup id="_ref-carihi22_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihi22" title="">[8]</a></sup> It became the established tradition of Chicago's minor seminaries that financial want should not prevent a seminarian from attending.</p>
<p>Quigley purchased land on the far West Side of Chicago, in today's Austin neighborhood, for a future major seminary, and a site at Addison St. and Sheridan Rd. for a larger minor seminary, since Cathedral College had quickly grown to encompass three buildings. Chicago's rapid expansion made the Austin site unsuitable for a major seminary, and Quigley sold the property to the city for its present use as a portion of the beautiful Columbus Park,<sup id="_ref-kantmun2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kantmun2" title="">[9]</a></sup> later designed by the noted landscape architect, <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jens_Jensen_%28landscape_architect%29_5802.html" title="Jens Jensen (landscape architect)">Jens Jensen (landscape architect)</a>. Quigley's health failed before he could put his plan of seminary development in motion, but at an ecclesiastical event in the Eastern United States prior to his death, Quigley providentially spent an afternoon with George Mundelein, then auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn, describing his plans in detail. Quigley died on July 10, 1915, but his successor Mundelein expanded upon Quigley's vision and put it into action.<sup id="_ref-carihi23_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihi23" title="">[10]</a></sup> Upon his being named Archbishop, Mundelein boarded a train on February 7, 1916 with a delegation from his new archdiocese, and headed to Chicago, where he was installed as archbishop two days later.<sup id="_ref-kantmun5_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kantmun5" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Within a few weeks, on "the feast of the Holy Apostles Phillip and James, 1916," Mundelein wrote to the priests of Chicago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is for this reason that in several of the dioceses of the country, the bishops have established the more modern form of the preparatory seminary, where the young boy selected from among his companions by the pastor or confessor, who discerns in him the probable signs of a vocation, the piety, application and intelligence which is required for the candidate for the holy priesthood, even while remaining in the sacred circle of the home and under the watchful eye of a pious mother, is placed apart and educated with those who only look forward to that same great work in life, the priestly field of labor, keeping daily before his mind the sublime vocation of the priesthood, preserving him pure and pious by constant exhortation, by daily assistance at the Holy Sacrifice and by frequent reception of the sacraments."<sup id="_ref-mundlet_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mundlet" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"The buildings are to be in the early French Gothic style of architecture and by reason of the distinct individuality and prominent location, will form a place of interest, not only to visitors, but to all lovers of the City Beautiful. The group will be composed of a main college building, and two ornate wings will be one the chapel, the other the library and gymnasium."<sup id="_ref-carihis4_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihis4" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mundelein had purchased earlier in 1916 a half block of land on Rush St. from Pearson to Chestnut Streets,<sup id="_ref-kantmun3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kantmun3" title="">[14]</a></sup> and later sold the Addison and Sheridan property for $600,000, with a profit of $160,000, in April, 1917, with the profit going to build the new Quigley Seminary, and the principal being reserved for the planned new major seminary.<sup id="_ref-kantmun4_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kantmun4" title="">[15]</a></sup> With the ground broken in November, 1916 and a cornerstone laid at the corner of Pearson and Rush on September 16, 1917,<sup id="_ref-carihist_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihist" title="">[16]</a></sup> classes were first held at school's current location in September 1918.</p>
<p>Carrying on a precedent established in 1905 in Cathedral College under rector Rev. Francis Andrew "Doc" Purcell (Msgr. in 1922), also Quigley Seminary's first rector, the new "Quigley Memorial Preparatory Seminary" was established with a five-year program of study (which continued until 1961), but like Cathedral College as a day school, so that Quigley students "would never lose contact with their heritage, their families, their Church."<sup id="_ref-carihis3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihis3" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1922, Quigley Seminary was already overcrowded, with over 600 students in a building designed to hold 500. A west wing of the building, this time in the Flemish-Gothic style, was begun in March, 1925 and completed amazingly by December, 1925, increasing the capacity of the school another 500."<sup id="_ref-carihis5_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihis5" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Msgr. Purcell established the school newspaper, <i>The Candle</i>, its yearbook, <i>Le Petit Seminaire</i>, the Cathedral Choristers (a boys' choir which sang at Sunday Masses at Holy Name Cathedral), catechists (who served at parishes), the Beadsmen (who gathered after school and at breaks to pray the Rosary), and the primacy of basketball among Quigley Seminary's intramural and interscholastic sports. By the end of his tenure as rector in 1931, Quigley faculty had grown from ten at Cathedral College in 1905 to forty-two, and the student body had grown from 1905's fifty-two to 1,030. Quigley priest faculty were expected to live in the parishes of the Archdiocese so as to keep a parish and priestly connection.<sup id="_ref-carihis6_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihis6" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Msgr. Purcell was succeeded as rector in 1931 by Msgr. Philip Francis Mahoney, who according to the Archdiocesan history changed little established by Purcell, and whose poor health led to his resignation during the 1934-35 academic year. Mundelein then met with the Quigley faculty and asked for their prayerful individual and confidential recommendations for the rector's position. During the next faculty meeting, Cardinal Mundelein named as Quigley's third rector the faculty choice, Rev. Malachy P. Foley. Msgr. Foley urged Quigley faculty to earn graduate degrees, regularly met personally with students both to praise and correct, expected classroom professionalism, and, according to Archdiocesan historian Msgr. Harry Koenig's account, "maintained Quigley as a seminary that saw itself as second to no other high school."<sup id="_ref-carihis7_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihis7" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_Quigley_Preparatory_Seminary_edb0.html" title="Edit section: Mundelein's &quot;Paperhanger&quot; Speech and His Impact on Quigley">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mundelein's "Paperhanger" Speech and His Impact on Quigley</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most memorable event in Quigley Seminary's history came on Tuesday, May 18, 1937, when Cardinal Mundelein, speaking to 500 priests at Quigley during a quarterly diocesan conference, lashed out at Nazi leaders <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Goering_986d.html" title="Hermann Goering">Hermann Goering</a> for using the pretext of "immorality" and sexual scandals to attack Catholic religious orders, organizations, and German Catholic schools, which at the time educated two million children, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fight is to take the children away from us. If we show no interest in this matter now, if we shrug our shoulders and mutter, 'Maybe there is some truth in it, or maybe it is not our fight;' if we don't back up our Holy Father (<a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XI_7042.html" title="Pope Pius XI">Pope Pius XI</a>) when we have a chance, well when our turn comes we, too, will be fighting alone. . . . Perhaps you will ask how it is that a nation of sixty million people, intelligent people, will submit in fear to an alien, an Austrian paperhanger, and a poor one at that I am told, and a few associates like Goebbels and Goering who dictate every move of the people's lives...<sup id="_ref-paperhanger_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paperhanger" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nazi minister Goebbels, labeled a "crooked minister of propaganda" in the same speech by Mundelein, responded furiously within days at a mass rally with 18,000 attendants, demanding that the Vatican discipline Mundelein, which it refused to do. Nazi attacks on German Catholic institutions intensified, and 200 Catholic newspapers were shut down.<sup id="_ref-nazireaction_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nazireaction" title="">[22]</a></sup> In Philadelphia, the International Brotherhood of Painters, Paperhangers, and Decorators for their part took exception to the Cardinal's classification of Hitler as a "<a href="../../../p/a/p/Paperhanger.html" title="Paperhanger">paperhanger</a>" in any case, despite Mundelein's remarks "he was not a very good one."<sup id="_ref-unionoffended_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unionoffended" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mundelein similarly championed Quigley,<sup id="_ref-kantmund_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kantmund" title="">[24]</a></sup> and personally recruited Catholic families to send their sons into the priesthood, including Frederick and Reynold Hillenbrand, sons of the dentist of Mundelein's niece, and later of Mundelein himself.<sup id="_ref-munddent_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-munddent" title="">[25]</a></sup> In a January 2, 1938 speech to 2,000 members of the Holy Name Society at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Name_Cathedral%2C_Chicago_dac6.html" title="Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago">Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago</a>, Mundelein said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our place is beside the poor, behind the working man. They are our people; they build our churches, they occupy our pews, their children crowd our schools, our priests come from their sons. They look to us for leadership, but they look to us, too, for support.<sup id="_ref-mundathnc_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mundathnc" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chicago's poor and working people were comprised of many immigrant groups, and Mundelein used his seminaries to break down ethnic barriers among the clergy. Ethnic groups fought back, and demanded concessions from Mundelein to preserve their identity. One such concession was that Quigley students of Polish descent had to learn Polish, a practice that continued from Mundelein's day until 1960.<sup id="_ref-kantpoli_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kantpoli" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Quigley-educated rector and faculty member Msgr. John W. Schmid followed Msgr. Foley as the fourth rector in 1944, and expanded the language curriculum, sending professors (Quigley faculty were called "professors" or "profs" for short) to study in Mexico, Canada, and Europe, and added sciences and physical education as requirements. Schmid, seeing the student body of Quigley growing to 1,300 near the end of his thirty-one years of service to Quigley as professor and rector in 1955, began a formal study for expansion of the school, and stepped aside so a younger man could lead it. The vigorous and athletic Msgr. Martin M. Howard, another Quigley graduate and professor, fluent in classical languages and Spanish, was named rector on May 18, 1955 by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Cardinal_Stritch_f651.html" title="Samuel Cardinal Stritch">Samuel Cardinal Stritch</a>.<sup id="_ref-carihis8_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihis8" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Msgr. Howard faced, according to Msgr. Koenig's account, the task of fitting four years of high school and two years of college into Quigley's five-year curriculum with a "<a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulpician.html" title="Sulpician">Sulpician</a> language-school model" of seminary inherited from Msgr. Purcell a half-century previous. With frequent faculty consultation, Howard participated in plans with Cardinal Stritch to convert Quigley to a four-year program, build a second Quigley near Chicago's south suburbs, establish a four-year free-standing college seminary, and shorten the program at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Mundelein, IL to four years of graduate study. In the mean time, the Archdiocese rented the Ogden School at 39 West Chestnut from the Chicago Board of Education as Quigley's "Annex" to better accommodate the overflow of Quigley's 1,300 students. <sup id="_ref-carihis9_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihis9" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Before Cardinal Stritch could complete the plan for the second Quigley, he died in Rome on May 27, 1958. At the direction of his successor <a href="http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmeyer.html" class="external text" title="http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmeyer.html" rel="nofollow">Cardinal</a> <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Gregory_Meyer_c16a.html" title="Albert Gregory Meyer">Albert Gregory Meyer</a>, a former seminary rector and Milwaukee archbishop named archbishop of Chicago on September 19, 1958, the seminary built a new high school, Quigley Preparatory Seminary South, at 77th Street and Western Avenue, which opened in 1961, with Msgr. Howard named its first rector. The original Quigley classes of 1960 and 1961 graduated in Spring, 1960, with the new Chicago college seminary, later to be called Niles College, opening that Fall.<sup id="_ref-carihi10_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihi10" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cardinal Meyer dedicated the Quigley South Chapel of the Sacred Heart (so named to hearken to the original Chicago minor seminary, Cathedral College of the Sacred Heart), its 40 acre campus, and new facilities for its 869 students on September 13, 1962.<sup id="_ref-carihi13_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihi13" title="">[31]</a></sup> For a short period in the early 1960s, both Quigley campuses held joint events, including graduations, in order to instill among the students the spirit of sharing one school.<sup id="_ref-oneschoo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oneschoo" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Msgr. John P. O'Donnell (Q' 41) was named rector of the newly named Quigley Preparatory Seminary North at the original Chestnut Street location in 1961. Msgr. O'Donnell encouraged his faculty to seek degrees from many universities, and himself earned a PhD from Loyola University and a master's degree from Notre Dame in addition to earlier master's and licentiate degrees from St. Mary of the Lake Seminary. Cardinal Meyer continued the practice of appointing priests to Quigley on the theory that "young seminarians needed a good number of priest-models to make an intelligent decision about their vocations."<sup id="_ref-carihi18_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihi18" title="">[33]</a></sup> In 1965 Msgr. O'Donnell also led Quigley North in earning accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and took steps to make Advanced Placement classes available for students, an action mirrored at Quigley South, the year that Archbishop <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Patrick_Cody_d334.html" title="John Patrick Cody">John Patrick Cody</a> was named to succeed Cardinal Meyer, who had succumbed to cancer on April 9. Quigley North faced for the first time a problem of declining enrollment, seeing its freshman class decline from 256 in 1962 to 130 in 1967. Declining enrollments brought both Quigley seminaries to consider further changes.<sup id="_ref-carihi19_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihi19" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1966 Cardinal Cody instituted a Chicago seminary system-wide change abolishing the Thursday day off and Saturday school day, which had for decades separated Chicago seminarians and seminary faculty from participating in Saturday social activities, while Quigley faculty voted to alter their own dress code requiring a cassock, in place of other clerical attire. Seminary policies prohibiting seminarian participation in co-educational activities and organizations were also revised in that same year. In 1968, dress codes for both Quigley seminaries requiring a suit coat and tie for students were revised to fit the seasons of the year, and the Quigley seminaries made the necessary arrangements so that Quigley students could join the National Honor Society. After a year-long self-study of the entire Chicago archdiocesan seminary system in 1969 assisted by Arthur B. Little and Company of Boston, Cardinal Cody in 1970 announced a new admissions policy for the Quigley seminaries, which expanded beyond Cardinal Mundelein's original requirement in 1916 that Quigley students be "educated with those who only look forward to that same great work in life, the priestly field of labor." Boys from two categories would as of 1971 be admitted to Quigley, "(a.) ... who have indicated a desire for the priesthood and who meet the requirements of admissions, and (b.) ... who, in the judgment of parish priests, have the kind of character, ability, and temperament which might lead to the personal discovery of a vocation in the priesthood." The new policy also indicated that Quigley North and South should "emphasize the fact that they are contemporary seminaries primarily concerned with the development and encouragement of vocations to the priesthood," and that "a vigorous campaign should be begun, especially on the part of priests, to enroll qualified students."<sup id="_ref-carihi20_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carihi20" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

<p>On October 5, 1979, Pope <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_18b2.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a> visited Quigley South, giving three speeches--one to the bishops of the United States,<sup id="_ref-jpiiquo2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpiiquo2" title="">[36]</a></sup> one to the sick,<sup id="_ref-jpiiquo3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpiiquo3" title="">[37]</a></sup> and one to the minor seminarians of both Quigley schools, to whom he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear seminarians,<br />
<br />
I extend a special greeting to all of you who are present here today. I want you to know that you have a special place in my thoughts and prayers.<br />
<br />
Dear sons in Christ: Be strong in your faith--faith in Christ and His Church, faith in all that the Father has revealed and accomplished through His Son and the Holy Spirit.<br />
<br />
During your years in the minor seminary, you have the privilege of studying and deepening your understanding of the faith. Since Baptism you have lived the faith, aided by your parents, your brothers and sisters, and the whole Christian community. And yet today I call upon you to live by faith even more profoundly. For it is faith in God which makes the essential difference in your lives and in the life of every priest.<br />
<br />
Be faithful in your daily prayers; they will keep your faith alive and vibrant.<br />
<br />
Study the faith diligently so that your knowledge of Christ will continually increase.<br />
<br />
And nourish your faith each day at Mass, for in the Eucharist you have the source and greatest expression of our faith.<br />
<br />
God bless you.<sup id="_ref-jpiiquo1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpiiquo1" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jpiiquote_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpiiquote" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jpiiitqu_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpiiitqu" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jpiiqpic_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpiiqpic" title="">[41]</a></sup><br />

<p>While in 1983 Quigley North Rector Rev. Thomas Franzman could report that "45% of our seniors headed on to Niles College [Seminary],"<sup id="_ref-franqnan_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-franqnan" title="">[43]</a></sup> by December 1989, facing declining enrollment and a reduction in the number of Quigley graduates completing studies for the priesthood, the Archdiocese announced the closure of both Quigley North and Quigley South as of June 1990, combining both schools into Archbishop Quigley Seminary at the original downtown site for the 1990 Fall term. For several weeks in early 1990, Quigley students<sup id="_ref-nytQstds_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nytQstds" title="">[44]</a></sup> and alumni from both institutions picketed the mansion<sup id="_ref-tribpicket_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tribpicket" title="">[45]</a></sup>of Cardinal <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Bernardin_897f.html" title="Joseph Bernardin">Joseph Bernardin</a> and published a full-page ad in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Sun-Times_5b28.html" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>,<sup id="_ref-stopenlet_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stopenlet" title="">[46]</a></sup> but many of the protesters later joined in supporting the combined Archbishop Quigley Seminary. The Quigley South campus was purchased for the new location of St. Rita High School (originally located at 63rd Street and Claremont Avenue). The reorganized Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary would go on to earn national recognition from <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_News_and_World_Report_8b36.html" title="US News and World Report">US News and World Report</a> in 1999 as one of 96 outstanding high schools in America.<sup id="_ref-quigusnw_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-quigusnw" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>As of the Fall of 2006, with an enrollment of approximately 200 students, Quigley was the largest of the seven remaining preparatory seminaries in the country.<sup id="_ref-lasthsem_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lasthsem" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Daily attendance at Mass was required of Quigley students for the greater part of the 20th century, following Cardinal Mundelein's letter of 1916 and John Paul II's 1979 direction quoted above, but the practice declined during the early 90s, when a weekly Mass was instituted.<sup id="_ref-quigmass_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-quigmass" title="">[49]</a></sup> However, when Rev. Peter Sneig was appointed rector in 2001, per Cardinal George's<sup id="_ref-fgnetrib_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fgnetrib" title="">[50]</a></sup> decision, prayer was the centerpiece of Quigley once again. Since academic school year of 2000-01, Mass has been an integral part of spiritual growth, being required three days a week with Monday morning prayer and Friday afternoon prayer to begin and end each week.</p>
<p>The Archdiocese announced on September 19, 2006 that Quigley's doors will be shut at the end of this school year in June 2007.<sup id="_ref-qcloseletter_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qcloseletter" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-q06demo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-q06demo" title="">[52]</a></sup> After one year of renovation the site will become home to the new archdiocesan Pastoral Center, containing the offices of the archbishop's curia and relative church bodies, with a "Quigley Scholars" program being established to support priestly vocations among high school boys.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cathedral Choristers -- the boys' choir of Chicago's Holy Name Cathedral populated by Quigley and later Quigley North students during the Days of the Giants. Each entering Bennie was screened at orientation for singing ability, and if he could sing and his voice had not yet changed, his membership in the Cathedral Choristers was mandatory. If his voice had fully changed, he was assigned to the Schola or Glee Club. Founded originally as the St. George Choral Society in 1918, they became the Cardinal's Cathedral Choristers in 1931. Directed by Msgr. Charles Meter (Q '30) from 1941-1963, the Choristers recorded "Carols of the Nations," which was a Christmas program performed at the Cathedral and at Quigley until the Choristers were disbanded in 1980.<sup id="_ref-kantjour_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kantjour" title="">[156]</a></sup></li>

Two key events are the Money Jars and the Lob. For the money jars, each class including faculty would have their own jar to collect/add money. At the end of Lent, the class with the most money wins; however, only quarters at to your amount while any other currency deducts from your total. The Lob is when students &amp; faculty have to "lob" balls from different parts of the gymnasium balcony to a bucket on the floor of the gym. Depending on the location and the type of ball used, each class (plus faculty) gains points. At the end of Lent, the points and the money jar are added together to determine the winner.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Majors -- the intramural, intra-year basketball league. Prior to inter-school play, to "make the majors" was reserved only for the best athletes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Memorial Hall -- the east attic where students and faculty snuck up and signed their names and class year.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mission Walk -- organized by Ray Schuman (Q '55), Prof. of Mathematics at QN &amp; AQ, the mission walk was to raise money for the Catholic missions, where students walk from Quigley to <a href="../../../m/u/n/Mundelein_Seminary_a22f.html" title="Mundelein Seminary">Mundelein Seminary</a>, a total of approx 55 miles. Students are to fund raise money for each mile they walk. From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, the mission walk was a two day even where students departed from Quigley on Friday morning and walk north to Mundelien. It is often tradition for the students who participate to stop by the Cardinal's residence before continuing on. The walk ended in the afternoon on Saturday. It is often tradition that the last mile the participants ran. After 2003, the mission walk was limited to Wrigley Field because of health reasons of the moderator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>One hundred -- during the Days of the Giants, a semester course grade of one hundred (100) was given to those students who during the semester answered every question correctly on all daily quizzes, exams, and major assignments. This practice was usually limited to language courses, where the feat was more possible, and became subject to Quigley folklore. In a given four or five-year cohort of students during the Days of the Giants, two or three students within the school may have scored 100 in a course.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pastor's signature -- during the Days of the Giants, a pastor's letter of recommendation was required for a student to enter Quigley, and pastors as well as parents during the Days of the Giants were required to sign the student's report card at final marking periods.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefect.html" title="Prefect">Prefect</a> -- during the Days of the Giants, the student in a Latin class designated to monitor the classroom in the absence of the professor, a responsibility given to the student with the highest grades in a marking period.</li>

During an annual personal conference with the rector, the student's letter was discussed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Room 219 -- during the days of Quigley North &amp; the early days of Archbishop Quigley, alcohol was stored here for the faculty. Currently, pop/cola is stored at Archbishop Quigley.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rosie -- during 1999, when the City of Chicago had "Cows on Parade", Archbishop Quigley was donated a blank cow by the city to be decorated. The cow's design was based on the Rose Window of the St. James Chapel; hence, the name Rosie. Rosie was auctioned and then re-donated back to the school.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Schola, or Schola Cantorum -- a small group of Quigley students with mature voices trained in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_Chant_fd90.html" title="Gregorian Chant">Gregorian Chant</a>, who would sing at Quigley or at Holy Name Cathedral during the Days of the Giants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Schuman Brownies -- refers to Ray Schuman's (Q '55, QN &amp; AQ math professor) brownies that he sells during the lunch periods for the mission drive. Schuman brownies are infamous for being burnt, extra crispy, and/or extremely under cooked.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Toilet Paper -- underground newspaper of Archbishop Quigley that published ten separate issues during the 1991-92 school year, produced by students who were unhappy with the results of merging Quigley North and Quigley South. It had some serious articles on reforms like women priests, but mostly contained jokes at the expense of teachers and administrators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Urinal -- later underground newspaper of Archbishop Quigley. It first appeared in 1994 penned by disgruntled seniors in the guise of an assignment from one of the teachers. It reappeared in 1999 and once again in 2002. During 2002, the Urinal writers took on aliases such as "Son of Liberty," and "Uncle Sam." The reappearance of the Urinal in 2002 was to express disapproval of censorship placed on the school newspaper, The Talon, by the administration due to the infamous "Breast, Legs, &amp; Thighs - A Restaurant Review of Hooters" written by the class of 2001, which were later confiscated and destroyed by the school administration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Yearbook Office -- over the many decades of Quigley, the yearbook office had been relocated numerous times.

David Jones was appointed President of Archbishop Quigley in March 2000, the yearbook office was once again moved to make room for the president's office.

<li>Despite press reports to the contrary,<sup id="_ref-qclotri5_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qclotri5" title="">[160]</a></sup> the Quigley seminaries have over the course of their century history educated more priests, almost 2,500,<sup id="_ref-counver2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-counver2" title="">[161]</a></sup> than lawyers, not formally counted or verified. Lawyer alumni have outnumbered priest alumni in the the school's final fifteen years, since according to the Chicago Tribune article cited, only one Quigley graduate, Rev. Pawel Komperda, has been ordained since 1990, and a few have become attorneys. This count does not consider Quigley graduates currently studying for the priesthood.</li>
