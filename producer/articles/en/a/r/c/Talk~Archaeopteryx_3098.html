<p>The Archaeopteryx is the most common response whenever a creationist says "There are no transitorial fossils". Is this something worth noting in the article; or should this article have the word "transitorial" in it somewhere? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 06:54, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but we need to strive for a NPOV&#160;:). I expanded the intro a little, and mentioned transitional fossils in the first paragraph. <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.81.231.127.html" title="User:68.81.231.127">68.81.231.127</a> 08:51, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm pretty certain if you're following the Latin model it should be Ar-kay-op-ter-iks. There's probably a lot of people out there who pronounce it (or would if they knew it) <i>archie</i> or <i>arkee</i>, and you'd have a hell of a time telling them they're wrong, because none of them is speaking Latin anyways. &#160;<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin&#160;</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">TALK&#160;&#160;</font></a>&#160; 05:28, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>IPA is gibberish to me, but here's what my Webster's has: ar ke op' ter iks. I can't put in the special markings over the letters, so here's the equivalent: ar as in "arm", e as in the first e of "event", o as in "odd", e as in "maker", i as in "ill". There is a soft stress on the first syllable and a strong stress on OP. "ae" in Latin is typically transliterated as "ee", not "ay", but that's just just Webster. For example, we pronounce Caesar as "seezer" rather than "sayzer". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:19, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just read an online article referencing a new speciment -- the Thermopolis specimen -- notable for particularly well-preserved feet. Indications are that Archaeopteryx did not have a true perching toe. Someone more knowledgeable may want to update this article.--130.76.32.16 22:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>seen as an intermediate fossil&#160;? How do we know it wasn't just another clawed, toothed bird that has gone extinct? How can feathers on reptiles, or teeth on birds give us any indication that transitional/intermediate fossils are what they are?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Technically every fossil is intermediate, since evolution doesn't go in spurts. Archie just serves as a classic example by virtue of being the *first* clawed, tooth bird ever found, and the one most similar to deinonychosaurs in skeletal features other than the obvious claws and teeth.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 15:09, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would disagree with the "doesn't go in spurts", but not with the "every fossil is is intermediate". But what you prolly mean with "no spurts" is "no saltationism", i.e. features do not materialize out of thin air, and I'm 100% with you on that one. Radiation events, e.g. following major extinctions, which occurred under drastically decreased/altered selective pressure (due to most life being extinct and the selective forces - ability to survive in arctic darkness under sulfuric-acid-rain or whatever - being not representative of selective forces as occur most of the time), give "freak" forms a chance to survive, multiply, diversify. Thus, you actually end up with a sort of "spurt" in evolution, because stuff that otherwise would have been outcompeted can survive as not letting your relatives eat all the food and get all the kids doesn't matter when there are hardly any relatives left... in the fossil record, this looks like a real "jump", but even then, it <i>is</i> gradual: the generation-to-generation steps are not larger by <i>quantity</i>, but can be larger by <i>quality</i> <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 17:50, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You need to understand exactly what a transitional fossil is and why it's important. Archie may well have gone extinct and not be a direct descendant of birds. There are some features that it has that suggest that this is the case. However, that's irrelevant to its status as a transitional fossil. What's important is that it bears the unmistakable mark of both an old lineage and a modern day lineage: it has the distinctive collections of traits that BOTH lineages otherwise have uniquely. That's what makes it transitional. Whether it's a direct ancestor is not important: it shows us something about the general structure of the branches farther back, regardless of whether or not Archie's branch reaches out into the modern day or not.Plunge 06:11, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Simply put: Archie was not a bird in the modern sense. It was no real dinosaur either. And there were more such beasts around some 20 million years later. One of these was the ancestor of all modern birds. Hasn't been identified yet and indeed it might never be; it is after all luck to find a fossil (we habe 10.000 beids species now, and some 30 mya there were much more. And although there were considerably less than that in the Cretaceous, we know what, some dozen maybe. The rest is still out there somewhere, or perhaps no remains have survived at all).</dd>
<dd>But what we do know is that 120-80 million years ago, roughly, avian flight was tried out by a huge number of half-birds and three-quarter-birds and full birds which were nonetheless not related to today's, and dinosaurs which did the bird thing but never became more birdish than growing some feathers, and so on. And that is the major point of transitional fossils: they do not exist for a long time, usually, because they are always half-adapted for several things, at least one of them new. But this is often just as well or maybe even better as being fully adapted for one same-old-same-old thing. So if you find one crucial transitional fossil, that's an indication for scientists to look closer, because in some thin strata there will be many more around. As of now, they're getting pretty close to unravel the evolution of limbs from fins, for example. Await more astounding half-fishes, three-quarter-fishes and so on to be discovered in the next years, now they have a good idea where to look for them. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 08:39, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As a side note, "transitional fossil" is itself a kind of 'fossil' term prone to misinterpretation. Creationists raise some brouhaha occasionally on how Archie is not "transitional" but "mosaic", combining avian and dinosaurian feature. But this is precisely how we now know that it <i>is</i> a transitional form. In Darwin's time up into the early 20th century, the unspoken assumption - a leftover from Creationist days - was that prehistoric forms changed from one kind of critter into another wholesale. But this is not true; there is indeed no reason why it should be true at all (except for microorganisms). Rather, evolution works by changing bits and pieces at a time. Although there is a tendency for basal ("primitive") forms of a lineage to have been ecological <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generalist.html" title="Generalist">generalists</a> more often than derived ("advanced") forms, this is not certain and it must always be remembered that nutural selection will see to that every species, no matter how transitional it may be, is expertly adapted to its particular mode of life. Compare with dinosaur teeth: they were lost several times independently in the lineages (note plural!) of Mesozoic birds. Indeed, the ancestors of <i><a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesperornis.html" title="Hesperornis">Hesperornis</a></i> seem to have lost them and later re-evolved veritable bird teeth which are unique in several respects among all teeth known to have borne by other animals.</dd>
<dd>It is somewhat unfortunate that we have a pretty clear idea when and from what Archie evolved, but that any indication of <i>what it evolved into</i> are missing. It cannot be allied with other known Mesozoic birds at present. Indeed, there is no reason to suppose (given that the Late Jurassic fossil record of Eurasia has been less than thoroughly worked in comparison with e.g. the Cretaceous Liaoning deposits or the Messel pit) that it did have a lineage of successors that survived for dozens of millions of years. It might, and such fossils may one day be discovered. But the Archie lineage may just as well have died out before the Cretaceous. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 17:42, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Archaeopteryx" is the name of this article, but when a reader starts reading the article, the article immediately refers to A. lithographica.

<p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> (ahr-kee-OP-ter-ix) meaning "ancient wing" (Greek archaio = ancient + pteryx = wing), from the Late Jurassic of Germany, is the earliest and most primitive known bird. The discovery of the first intact specimen, Archaeopteryx lithographica, in 1861, two years after Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species, set off a firestorm of debate about evolution and the role of transitional fossils that endures to this day.</p>

<dd><i>Ancient pinion</i> -- does Meyer use this etymology in the description?

<dd>Bühler &amp; Bock argue that if any variant is wrong, it is "wing". They suggest that "feather" is what von Meyer must have had in mind, because when he penned the decription he had just barely heard of the skeleton and certainly not seen ist. "Pinion" (German "Schwinge") expresses that ambiguity.</dd>
<dd>FWIW, von Meyer's descriptions probably read something like "pteron[in Greek letters] = Schwinge" (it can also mean "fin" BTW. "Flapping appendage" in general, more or less) as was usual at that time (for a long time during the early 20th century, etymologies were usually not provided in descriptions at all). <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 19:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>CT scan won't show brain regions associated with vision, motion or hearing. FMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is the only imaging which show brain functions. And FMRI can only be done for live humans. CT scan of fossils might show brain gyrus but I doubt that too. And gyrus doesn't mean same as functional area. That part of article is ridiculous though Witmer's article has been published in Nature (I don't know if quote is done wrongly). Tkkoski</p>
<p>Dinoguy2: Tell me what is better way to guide people to read my comment above? I really thought about it but I couldn't find a better way. For awhile I considered that I should delete the whole cite on Witmer's article. It won't met Wikipedia's requirements on science. But I didn't want to do it, cause it's always better to have first a good debate. Tkkoski</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tkkoski, there are three possibilities: (1) the person who wrote Wikipedia's paragraph on the CT scan may have misread or misunderstood Witmer's article (2) Witmer may be wrong (3) you may be wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If (1) has happened, you need to read Witmer's article yourself and correct Wikipedia's paragraph to show what he <i>really</i> said.</li>
<li>If (2), Wikipedia is not the place to argue with him (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to understand why). The editors of <i>Nature</i> clearly found his article convincing. So you need to write a letter to the editors of <i>Nature</i>, not try to eliminate him from Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Number (3) is always a possibility, so re-read his article carefully.</li>

A quote from Witmer's article's abstract: "We investigated this problem by computed tomography scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction of the braincase of the London specimen of Archaeopteryx. Here we show the reconstruction of the braincase from which we derived endocasts of the brain and inner ear. These suggest that Archaeopteryx closely resembled modern birds in the dominance of the sense of vision and in the possession of expanded auditory and spatial sensory perception in the ear. We conclude that Archaeopteryx had acquired the derived neurological and structural adaptations necessary for flight. An enlarged forebrain suggests that it had also developed enhanced somatosensory integration with these special senses demanded by a lifestyle involving flying ability."</p>
<p>So the solution isn't (1). Question is: Is your second or third proposal right. As a doctor I see CT scans almost daily and I understand CT scans possibilities. Reconstruction of a skull really don't show brain function... So Witmer makes his conclusions with unproven hypothesis. Witmer's hypothesis may be right or wrong but we really don't know it. And I understand that this is not the right place to arque that. I'm just wondering why everything has to be written in Wikipedia. Tkkoski 19:03, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If a sorce is published, it trumps an un-published source. Witmer is a published source on this topic, you (as far as I know) are not. I don't doubt you credentials, but I also ask that you find a source which specifically identifies the methods Witmer used as flawed, and modify the paragraph accordingly, citing this source. As a doctor I'm sure you have acess to some article, any article, which identifies the flaws in this method. It is sometimes frustrating when you can find a flaw in someone's work, but as Wikipedia prohibits original research, there's nothing you can do about it save publishing on it yourself or finding an existing published source to back up your idea.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 20:23, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CT Scans have been conducted for dinosaurs since at least 2004. Using the scans, researchers are able to construct 3D models of the braincases of the dinosaurs. If researchers see "bulges" or "lumps" in the braincase of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, similar to those found in modern birds, such as bumps in modern bird brains that are already known to affect olfactory or visual sense, there are many reasons to believe <i>Archaeopteryx</i> shared similar traits. These CT Scan findings have been generally accepted by the paleontological community, as far as I know.</dd>
<dd>I actually don't know your background, but I assume you must be an MD by your post, since you claim CT Scans can only be conducted on living humans (what about animals?). If you are a doctor of <i>human</i> medicine, Tkkoski, it is understandable that considering human brains, it might be hard to see why "bulges" are considered evidence for greater sensitivity. The bird brain, and those of reptiles, however, is much more divided, with each section of brain more seperated than in the human version, and senses divided into lobes. If the lobe is large, it indicates the animal needed greater sensitivity in that region of the brain. Witmer's claim, then, that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had specific adaptations similar to modern birds (seeing, hearing, and adapted senses for flight) do not seem at all wrong-headed, and I haven't read any claims to the contrary until your edits today.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 01:08, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I try to keep this short. I didn't claim that CT scans may be done only on humans. I said it above about FMRI. CT scan can be done on everything. And I'm not claiming that Witmer is totally wrong, I said that Witmer makes hypothesis which can't be proved. CT scans show brain gyrus and sulcus, but we don't know how those indicate different senses on dinosaur. You can presume brain functions from a CT scan, but you don't know it for sure. And in my opinion discussion on CT scans possibilities don't belong in this article of Archaeopteryx, so I let it be this way. All that I wanted was a word to indicate uncentainty, but I understand that after that word I't hasn't been a direct quote from Witmer. 128.214.191.201 04:23, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That post antedates the paper which casts quite some doubt upon it by 5 years&#160;:(. If it were in <i>reaction</i> to it and started with "I looked up Bühler &amp; Bock's comments..." I'd be glad. But alas, the one thing that we KNOW O.607 does is to establish that <i>A. lithographica</i> is a nomen conservandum (the pre-1861 "crassipes" names of Archie fossils were suppressed by O.1070). The point of Bühler/Bock is apparently that their research shows that the feather is the original holotype, and that <i>everybody, including the ICZN</i> in 1961 thought that the <i>London specimen</i> was the holotype. And therefore, they conclude, O.607 is valid in establishing that Archie is indeed correctly called <i>A. lithographica</i> (as opposed to "Griphosaurus" or whatnot), BUT that that name is still attached to that indeterminable feather. Swinton in the proposal which launched O.607 writes, apparently arguing as to why he thought the London specimen to be the holotype, "von Meyer announced the receipt of a nearly complete skeleton". The original description has "Skelett eines mit Federn bedeckten Thiers [...] gefunden worden sey" ("the skeleton of an animal covered in feathers [...] is said to have been found"). This makes it quite obvious that von Meyer in 1861 had heard of, but not seen or even received, and consequently refrained to link the feather to what would later become the London specimen and <i>what according to B&amp;B everyone has since long believed to be the holotype</i>. So I shall see to that I get me O.607 (and Swinton's) myself. The point to check out - and it seems that before 2002 nobody hat taken note of this really - is whether it contains a designation of neotype for the London specimen; if not, it merely suppresses the synonyms. This is indeed possible beacuse it was obvious to every modern observer that attaching the name to the feather made it a <i>nomen dubium</i>... and by 1960, nobody would believe that this could remain undetected for so long, and thus, by inference, the London specimen was assumed to be the holotype. Luckily, the content of O.607 does not change: for an opinion on suppression of some name, it is not important whether the conserved name is attached to some holotype specimen or another, only that it <i>is</i> attached to one at all.</dd>
<dd>That all this is not inconceivable shows the trouble I had to go through to establish that <i><a href="../../../a/i/o/Aiolornis.html" title="Aiolornis">Aiolornis</a></i> is the correct form (not "Aiornis", even though this makes <i>no</i> sense etymologically while the correct name does make perfect sense). Google will give, oh, just 4 times as many hits for the wrong version... or the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Croix_Macaw_a6e5.html" title="St. Croix Macaw">St. Croix Macaw</a>, where nobody seems to be sure whether it is -cthones or -chtones or -chthones. These things happen, and it is only human if any researcher for decades would have thought that the type is the London specimen, because the notion of the name being stuck to that feather and staying stuck there without <i>anybody</i> raising a ruckus is too hilarious. But quite possibly, that's exactly what happened. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 22:24, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, the issue seems to be the fault of De Beer (1954), who claimed as forcefully as wrongly that von Meyer's lumping of the feather with the London specimen made the latter the holotype as the former was not diagnostic. but it <i>is</i> diagnostic at least insofar as that it cannot be identified to have come from the same animal. Until Bühler/Bock's review, and especially in 1960/1961, De Beer's view seems to have been accepted. But this is not correct as the feather was the only specimen available to the describer at the time of the description. Indeed, the conclusion is that <i>if</i> there has not been a formal neotype designation, we're actually left with <i>Archaeopteryx</i> being, by all gods, not only a <i>nomen dubium</i> but also an <a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichnotaxon.html" title="Ichnotaxon">ichnotaxon</a> (the alternative would be noncompliance with ICZN rules)! I cannot imagine how it could get any worse.</dd>
<dd>De Beer's reasoning in a nutshell: as von Meyer stated in 1862 (Palaeontographica <b>10</b>(2): 56),</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>"Die von mir dargelegte fossile Feder von Solenhofen wird von einem ähnlichen Thiere herrühren, für dass ich die Benennung <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> (Jahrb. für Mineral., 1861. S.679) gewählt habe."</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>supposedly implies that he considered the London specimen his "type", but this is both incorrect according to ICZN §73.1.2 (types can only specimens under review, not specimens known from hearsay - if not so, we'd have 2 paratypes as per ICZN §73.2 and could be cool with that), and not a valid neotype designation either (ICZN §12.3 unequivocally precludes any designation by a throwaway line "a similar animal, for which I choose the name..." to be valid). Sigh. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 16:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Obviously this is a situation that needs to be addressed with a clear designation of a neotype b the ICZN. The fact is that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> the taxon (not ichnotaxon) prevails ovewhelmingly in the literature, and while you are right about all this, it's original research until published. In other words, nothing needs to be changed in the article itself here&#160;;)<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 02:48, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dysmorodrepanis wrote in an edit summary: "the one thing -pteryx certainly does not mean in this case is "wing"... the descr. refers without any doubt remaining to the single feather." I don't have access to the original paper, but you can't really assume such a thing. The athor may have presumed the presence of a feather implied the presence of a wing. Does the paper actually state what the intended etymology is? If not, the issue is unresolved.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 02:32, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for correcting, I was to rash in my statement. Not having read the original descriptions but knowing how these things looked like then ("Museum Heineanum" is a good and roughly contemporary comparison), I'd assume that von Meyer gave the overall etymology (probably in a footnote, and in Greek letters) but did not specify any one meaning. What is certain is that he goes on about the feather and nothing but in the description (which is unmercifully brief, just a picture and some measurements and the attachment of the name to the specimen - not much more to say in 2 pages at most of what apparently was at that time a small-format gazette) and merely mentions the London specimen as something that may have bearing on the case; he neither states that there MUST be a connection, nor had he seen it when he penned the original description, BUT it must also have been clear to him (as is is immediately clear to anyone who has ever taken a good close look at a bird) that what he had there was a remix. Compare to descriptions of all those <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moa.html" title="Moa">moa</a> "species" which have had taxonomists going nuts over them all those years because they were so horribly undiagnostic. Somebody should really go and public domain the original description; there seem not many copies left in Germany (a lot were firebombed away in the 40s) but SAPE probably can - and IHMO eventually will - put it online when one of their folks finds time. Maybe dropping Gerald Mayr a note could speed things up... Senckenberg's library should either hold or get access to the von Meyer paper.</dd>
<dd>(As a side note, isn't that cool that all this stuff now gets collected up and put together on W'pedia, finally to be accessed and available for the general public?) <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 15:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So what is there at present? Only a partial English translation, viz.:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional to my writing of the fifteenth of last month, I can notify you that I have inspected the feather from Solenhofen closely from all directions, and that I have come to the conclusion that this is a veritable fossilisation in the lithographic stone that fully corresponds with a birds' feather. Simultaneously, I heard from Mr. Obergerichtsrath Witte, that the almost complete skeleton of a feather-clad animals had been found in the lithographic stone. It is reported to show many differences with living birds. I will publish a report of the feather I inspected, along with a detailed illustration. As a denomination for the animal I consider <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> to be a fitting name...</p>
</blockquote>
and a even less complete German original, viz:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>"Zugleich erhalte ich von Herrn Obergerichtsrath Witte die Nachricht, dass das fast vollständige Skelet eines mit Federn bedeckten Thiers im lithographischen Schiefer gefunden worden sey. Von unseren lebenden Vögeln zeige es manche Abweichung. Die von mir untersuchte Feder werde ich mit genauer Abbildung veröffentlichen. Zur Bezeichnung des Thieres halte ich die Benennung <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> geeignet...<i>"</i></p>
</blockquote>
- but it stops where it starts to get interesting. Note that the "I will publish..." is really the introduction to the description; the stuff about the London specimen would be labelled "abstract" today. Note also that the ICZN not being in force, we have here the basis for all that taxonomic jumble, namely von Meyer simply lumping the feather (which is the original holotype - by monotypy as per ICZN §73.1.2, and not by designation!) with the London specimen and assuming that they were of the same species. If this were true, his non-designation of a holotype would not matter. But as it stands or stood, the taxon was at least initially attached to the feather which seems not to be from Archie. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 16:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One person who has looked it over says that it checks out with Wellnhofer's article in "Feathered Dragons". There's been a change in status in some of the specimens, though, after Mayr et al.'s 2007 paper, that reintroduces <i>A. siemensii</i>. I don't have the article, unfortunately. A summary can be found <a href="http://dml.cmnh.org/2007Jan/msg00256.html" class="external text" title="http://dml.cmnh.org/2007Jan/msg00256.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and below:</dd>
<dd>"An interesting outcome of this study is the distinction of two species: *A. lithographica*, including the London (1), Maxberg (3), Haarlem (4), and Solnhofen (5) specimens, and *A. siemensii*, including the Berlin (2), Munich (7), and Thermopolis (10) specimens. *Wellnhoferia grandis* is sunk because, while distinct from *A. siemensii*, it cannot be told apart from *A. lithographica*, and *A. bavarica* is sunk because the supposed sternum is part of the coracoid, removing the main difference between it and *A. siemensii* -- various proportions differ between the Munich specimen and the Berlin specimen, but in these the Thermopolis specimen is intermediate. The very small Eichstätt specimen (6), the very incomplete 8th specimen, and the inaccessible 9th specimen are not assigned to a species. -- *A. lithographica* is larger, has much larger flexor tubercles on the toe claws, different limb proportions, a stouter metatarsus, and a constriction in the middle of the premaxillary tooth crowns; the other features previously considered diagnostic for *Wellnhoferia* could also be diagnostic for *A. lithographica*, but are not preserved in the other three specimens; the end of the tail is not preserved in the Solnhofen specimen, so its tail length, previously considered diagnostic, can only be estimated."</dd>

Wagner appears to have used <i>Griphosaurus</i> in 1861 without a species name (note that in the pdf listing, 1862 is in parentheses, and the reference says 1861); Woodward indeed used <i>Griphosaurus problematicus</i> in 1862, not Wagner; <i>Griphornis longicaudatus</i> was published in 1862 by Woodward from a manuscript by Owen, for unknown reasons.

The quick version of their findings is: London, Haarlem, Maxberg, and Solnhofen=<i>A. lithographica</i>; Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis=<i>A. siemensii</i>; and Eichstaat, Burgermeister-Muller, and Chicken Wing were not assigned to a species, so you can leave them alone. <a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Spencer_cced.html" title="User:J.

<p>Hi guys, what I can see needs doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>needs a <b>Description</b> section after the lead, some material can be gleaned from <b>Paleobiology</b>.</li>
<li>list of specimens needs delistifying somehow, unless others feel a list is the way to go:</li>
</ul>

<dd>I've asked someone to have a look at the timeline graphic, so hopefully we'll get some suggestions on that in near future.</dd>
<dd>I like having separate paragraphs for each specimen. They're each a bit short for full subsections, so maybe just remove the bullets and see how they look as short paragraphs? <a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Spencer_cced.html" title="User:J.

<dd>They need more than just tweaking, I think (I just did a bit, and they need a lot more attention). I agree they work as paragraphs, though. Obviously, the paragraph on the fragments needs expanding. Aside from references, we'll also need to create a <i>lot</i> of articles for all the red links. In all of this, let's not forget the actual collaboration of the month is supposed to be <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Compsognathus.html" title="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a></i>; Arthur put a lot of work into it, and I'd hate to see that "go to waste", so to speak. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 00:15, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Yep, I can probably start a description section soon. The history of discovery section is horrific. Yikes, it needs a bunch of work done &amp; I'll definitely need some help with that. The opening para's are taking shape, but seem to be rather repetitive &amp; not descriptive enough for an opening section. I'm thinking however, does the Pop culture section need to be there? It's got 1 song from a dead beat group &amp; that's the only thing. I say we scrap it &amp; concentrate on other things. In an FAC, the pop culture section would be ripped to shreds &amp; be deleted eventually anyway. Other than that, for the Paleobiology section, are there any other burning topics that need to be included - We only have plumage &amp; flight ability so far. Does anyone have anything on feeding &amp; behaviour etc? I'm going to do some shuffling round later today, so it may look a bit disjointed for a while. Hopefully we can get it half good... I bags noming it once it is...&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 02:18, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Removed the pop culture section - "<i>Popular culture - Track 11 on the Lemon Demon CD Dinosaurchestra is entitled "Archaeopteryx". The song is about a person with an intense dislike of birdkind based on a jealousy of their flight ability. The person then travels back in time and kills the original Archaeopteryx, thus killing off all future birds.

<dd>I feel the <b>Archaeopteryx &amp; the origin of birds</b> section belongs as a subheading with an expanded section on <b>Taxonomy</b> and <b>Classification</b>, both could go somwhere under Discovery and Species or in their own section. There must be a pile of stuff on taxonomy to go into the article.

<dd>Archie is definitely an icon of evolution, and I think any pop culture section needs to emphasize that fact.

<dd>Oh hi Dinoguy, I've been meaning to ask you for your help on Archie but forgot. I can't remember where I saw it, but there was a similar scale picture where numerous theropod dinosaurs were lined up in different colours showing their different sizes along side each other.

All my dino books are on the other side of the planet (DoA is too heavy for carry-on&#160;;) ). Anybody have that info? For now, here's one based on the Berlin specimen, which I believe is 0.6 m, I assume not counting retrices.

<dd>No, I was talking about a picture I've recently seen on here that Dinoguy could have based this picture off. The only thing is, the picture I saw, I can't find it again! This has been happening a lot around here &amp; not just to me (Dinoguy above, me, Cas...) The picture was of I think, Big Al, T rex, Allosaurus, Albertosaurus &amp; they were different colours &amp; placed in front &amp; behind each other on a scale graph like the above picture. This picture showed the different sizes of each as the bigger ones overlapped the smaller ones. Hard to explain, but it's drving me nuts as I saw it not long ago!!!! GRRRRRR! Maybe I never saw it...

<p>Ok, I made two versions of the size comparison--one with all eight specimens Headden illustrated, arranged diagonally to fit (I also tried it stacked as with the allosaurs, but it was harder to see what's going on at that small size), and one with the largest two and the smallest two, which gives an example of most specimens that have been assigned to their own genera or new species.</p>

Headden's <i>Jurapteryx</i> image <a href="http://www.paleograveyard.com/archaeopteryx.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.paleograveyard.com/archaeopteryx.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> is around 20 cm long, not including possible tail feathers. The <i>Jurapteryx</i> on your image is no more than 15 cm long, including tail feathers. While 5 cm may not seem like a big deal, it is when it's about 1/4th the length of the entire animal. Even accounting for the different neck positions (stretched out vs. further back), it seems a little small. This is the one I noticed, but the others may be on the small side, too. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 08:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, something strange is going on here. I was going by the scale in his panoply ("The Many <i>Archaeopteryx</i>), in which the Eichtatt specimen is only slightly longer than the scale bar, which is labelled 10cm. All of the individual skeletals at the Grave Yard site are significantly larger than their counterparts in the panoply. I'm betting the bar was mis-labelled in the latter?

<dd><font color="blue">Given that it is now well established that several lineages of theropods evolved feathers and flight independently, the question of how precisely the ancestors of Archaeopteryx became able to fly has lost dramatically in importance for the time being. Since it is quite likely that this species belongs to a lineage of birds unrelated to the Neornithes (the Jurassic ancestor of which remains unknown), how exactly flying ability was gained in Archaeopteryx may be a moot point, having little bearing on how this happened in the ancestors of modern birds.</font></dd>

<p>Looking over the page it is taking shape rather nicely. The main things I can think of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The long list of synonyms for mine is a bit of an eyesore; would it be worthwhile just highlighting (in a paragraph) the several that are important and why - e.g. recent proposed new species and griphosaurus etc.)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have borrowed Luis Chiappe's book on Glorified Dinosaurs - it describes archies environment and what Solnhofen/bavaria was like at the time. It may make a good subsection "Environment of Archie"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do folk feel about the paragraphed list of specimens? OK or still to listy?</li>
</ul>

<dd>I think the list of synonyms are actually okay to be honest - Numerous other articles have a similar set up. Of course, if this was a problem in FAC, then we could easily cram it into a para or two. In regard to the specimens, I think it's about right. It's not too listy, but it doesn't exactly look the tidiest, but that's just my OC coming out.&#160;;) I'm thinking that if that's all we have to worry about, I see no reason why I shouldn't nom soon. Even if I nom'd today, Cas would still have enough time to create a short para on the archie environment. The article is well cited, informative &amp; has everything that an FA would need. Who's with me? If anyone is, I'll nom soon. Right? (Please say yes, I'm so itchy to nom...)

<dd>The list can be shorten quite a bit if you removed all the lapsi (they really rather refer to the genus name not the binomial name, ex: Archeopterix instead of Archeopteryx). That would lead to only 7-8 synonyms for which a small sentence can be added. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthurWeasley_0992.html" title="User:ArthurWeasley">ArthurWeasley</a> 05:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The excellent preservation of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at Solnhofen indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens found are likely therefore to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than been corpses that drifted in from further away. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of <a href="../../../p/t/e/Pterosaur.html" title="Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a> such as <i><a href="../../../r/h/a/Rhamphorhynchus.html" title="Rhamphorhynchus">Rhamphorhynchus</a></i>, the group which dominated the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Niche_%28ecology%29.html" title="Niche (ecology)">niche</a> currently occupied by <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seabird.html" title="Seabird">seabirds</a>, yet are common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagrancy_%28biology%29.html" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrants</a> from the larger islands 50 km (31 miles) to the north.<sup id="_ref-Paul_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-arid.html" title="Semi-arid">semi-arid</a> and sub-<a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical.html" title="Tropical">tropical</a> with a long <a href="../../../d/r/y/Dry_season.html" title="Dry season">dry season</a> and little rain.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flora.html" title="Flora">flora</a> of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low (3 m [10 ft]) shrubs.<sup id="_ref-Paul_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul" title="">[2]</a></sup> Contrary to reconstructions of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> climbing large trees, these seem to have been absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilised tree <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollen.html" title="Pollen">pollen</a> is also absent.</p>
<p>The lifestyle of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it. It has been suggested by some researchers that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude <i>Archaeopteryx</i> from an arboreal lifestyle; several species of extant bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> point to either an arboreal or ground existence, the length of its legs, the elongation in its feet; and some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs, open ground and even alongside the shores of the lagoon.<sup id="_ref-Paul_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Paul" title="">[2]</a></sup> It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it were small enough or with its claws if it were larger.</p>

<dd>Above looks great. I just woke up and am a bit bleary eyed but I can't see where it says there are few conifers. It is similar to what I looked at -Chiappe says "Although a handful of plnat remains and the existence of insects with wood-boring larvae supports the presence of trees, particularly conifers, this meagre record suggests the forests were scarce at best." thus I mentioned conifers as there was <i>something</i> of them.&#160;:) Feel free to replace mine with SSs.

<p>There is no mention of the (originally German) term <i>Urvogel</i> in this article, which is supposed to be comprehensive. Currently, <a href="../../../u/r/v/Urvogel.html" title="Urvogel">Urvogel</a> redirects here. I believe this term should be mentioned in the article, but where? <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 22:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, maybe you could list it in the description part &amp; just say that in Germany where it was discovered, the term for Archie was Urvogel... Or something of the like. Too trivial to put in opening &amp; nowhere else would suit it... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:59, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone on the last FAC indicated DOIs should be included with each new FAC submission, and helpfully provided a DOI linking tool. I can't find it now; does anyone know where that link is? I'd like to add the DOIs. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 20:15, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
