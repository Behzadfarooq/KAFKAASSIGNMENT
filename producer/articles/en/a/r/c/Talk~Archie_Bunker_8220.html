<p>Something that is missing, the fact that Archie Bunker got 1 vote for Vice President at the 1972 Democratic convention.</p>
<p>Edith once said that Archie was jelous of Mike because Mike was young and going to college and Archie has been forced to drop out of school to support his family and Archies life wasn't going anywhere now.</p>

<p>There are numerous sources with information about the neighborhood in Queens where Archie lived. On the other hand, where is it alleged that this was never mentioned in the course of the show? ~Sylvain 12/5/05</p>
<dl>
<dd>If there are numerous sources that conclusively say in which neighborhood the Bunkers lived, please cite one. The only "source" that matters is the show itself, and the particular neighborhood they lived in was never mentioned. This is a fact. If their specific neighborhood <i>had</i> been mentioned, there wouldn't be any confusion about the neighborhood, and we wouldn't have to say "maybe it was Corona, maybe it was Astoria." People who make such conjecture are basing it on <i>clues</i> in the series, but they are clues (a mention of Northern Boulevard - which travels through many Queens neighborhoods - here, a mention that they are "close to the airport" (But which one, LaGuardia? Kennedy? And in which direction?) there. The fact still remains that no one on the show ever mentioned the neighborhood by name, and therefore any mention of it is here is conjecture. I'm asking you for a link with proof (I happen to know you won't find any with any citation from the show itself); barring that, if you revert again, I'll take this to Requests for Comment. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 03:31, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd be happy to.

<dd>OK, I'm back after a few weeks' break. Again, all of those references do not specifically refer to an episode of the show in which a character said "Hey, we live in Corona!" or the like, but rather are based on their own writers' conjecture and interpretation of supposed clues. That being said, I'm willing to compromise. Astoria is an absurd guess, so you're right, we'll leave that out. See what you think of how I've written it now. It's accurate and includes your (and others') Corona supposition, which it's obviously important to you to include in this article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 18:12, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For God's sake, "not insignificant" is not a double negative. Do you even know what a double negative is? If someone calls "not insignificant" a double negative, they're bastardizing the original meaning of the term, which is used to describe someting gramatically incorrect in English ("not insignificant" is hardly gramatically incorrect). "Not insignificant" is not the same as "significant." If I had wanted to use the word "significant" to describe the 1972 parody campaign, I would have used it. (I am aware of the word). "Not insiginifcant" is my attempt to strike the right tone to describe the campaign. If you can come up with a better qualifier, go for it. "Significant" is not it, since the Bunker election campaign of 1972 was really not particularly singificant: it was clearly a parody and didn't make a lasting imprint on history. However, it was also not insignificant because it was widely referenced at the time and generated bumper stickers and the like. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 02:05, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I may be mistaken myself, but I think there is a mistake regarding the name of the lodge Archie belonged to: "the lodge he had attended since the early days of All in the Family, the Kings Of Queens."</p>
<p>I think that is actually the name of the organization from the Ku Klux Klan episode, and that Archie had resigned from it just about as quickly as he had joined it. Anyone know for sure? -- mariox19 2006-07-30 at 19:02 GMT.</p>
<p>No, The Kings of Queens was the name of the lodge that he had been a member of for a very long time. In one episode, the club did come under scrutiny for having no minority members. They decide to invite a black Jew in, thusly "killing two birds with one stone" However, the new member invites several other black men, and jokes that the name should be change to the Kings of Queens of Spades. Well. That got off track. But ya. It is in fact the name of the lodge that he was a member of. 70.130.157.224 08:49, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
