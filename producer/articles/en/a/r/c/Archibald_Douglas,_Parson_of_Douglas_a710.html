	    <p><b>Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas</b>, (b. before <a href="../../../1/5/4/1540.html" title="1540">1540</a> - d, after <a href="../../../1/5/8/1587.html" title="1587">1587</a>) was also Parson of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, a Senator of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Justice_25cf.html" title="College of Justice">College of Justice</a>, Ambassador to Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, and a notorious intriguer.</p>
<p>Archibald Douglas was Parson of <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas%2C_Lanarkshire_6bab.html" title="Douglas, Lanarkshire">Douglas, Lanarkshire</a>, prior to January 15, 1561/2 on which day he was awarded the Third of the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefice.html" title="Benefice">Benefices</a> for that parsonage. He was appointed to the College of Justice on November 13, 1565 as an Extraordinary Lord in place of Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney.</p>
<p>Accused with his brother, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Douglas_of_Whittinghame_5422.html" title="William Douglas of Whittinghame">William Douglas of Whittinghame</a>, of involvement in the conspiracy to murder <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Riccio_613c.html" title="David Riccio">David Riccio</a>, he was obliged to retire to France for some time. But the husband of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots_8791.html" title="Mary, Queen of Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Stuart%2C_Lord_Darnley_c428.html" title="Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley">Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley</a>, secured his return to Scotland, where Douglas then successfully negotiated the pardons of the other conspirators, gazetted on 25th December 1566.</p>
<p>He then entered into the intrigues of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hepburn%2C_4th_Earl_of_Bothwell_5867.html" title="James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell">James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell</a> and his confederates for the assassination of Darnley, and acted as the agent between them and the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Morton_bd2b.html" title="Earl of Morton">Earl of Morton</a>, and, according to the on-the-scaffold confession of his servant Binney or Binning, was actually present at the Kirk of the Field on the night of the murder (9/10 February 1567). In the confusion of the hour Douglas lost his shoes, which he had removed, which were found in the morning and known to be his. No pursuit was however, at that time, instituted against him.</p>
<p>On June 2, 1568, he was raised to a Lord Ordinary in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Justice_25cf.html" title="College of Justice">College of Justice</a> in place of John Leslie, Bishop of Ross.</p>
<p>He was then sent by Regent, the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Lennox_4a1c.html" title="Earl of Lennox">Earl of Lennox</a> to the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Sussex_7c6f.html" title="Earl of Sussex">Earl of Sussex</a> in September 1570 to congratulate him on his victory over the Border friends of the Queen, and to negotiate support for the Regent's authority. It was thought to be shortly afterwards that he obtained the Parsonage of Glasgow, with some difficulty as the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk.html" title="Kirk">Kirk</a> at first felt him unqualified to enjoy that benefice. In January 1572, however, the requisite sanction was obtained, and he is found to be in receipt of the Thirds of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefice.html" title="Benefice">Benefices</a> for <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newlands%2C_Glasgow_f2a9.html" title="Newlands, Glasgow">Newlands, Glasgow</a> thereafter.</p>
<p>In April 1572 he was found to be assisting the party of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots_8791.html" title="Mary, Queen of Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> who then held <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_Castle_ec97.html" title="Edinburgh Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a>, by conveying to The Grange four out of five thousand Crowns which had been sent to her by the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Alva_3c00.html" title="Duke of Alva">Duke of Alva</a>. He was at the same time accused of conspiring for the death of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Morton_bd2b.html" title="Earl of Morton">Earl of Morton</a>, and was warded (held under house arrest) at <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stirling_Castle_531b.html" title="Stirling Castle">Stirling Castle</a> (another source says <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Leven_Castle_2da3.html" title="Loch Leven Castle">Loch Leven Castle</a>).</p>
<p>He appears to have lived, if not in prison, at least in privacy, during the Regency of Morton, but was, on the November 11, 1578, restored to his former place on the bench, following a request letter from King <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VI_ae13.html" title="James VI">James VI</a> to that effect. On December 31, however, he was denounced to the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_Scotland_be71.html" title="Privy Council of Scotland">Privy Council of Scotland</a> as guilty of Darnley's murder, and orders were given for his arrest. But having been forewarned by his kinsman George Douglas of <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longniddry.html" title="Longniddry">Longniddry</a>, he fled from his wife's tower-house at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morham.html" title="Morham">Morham</a> to England. Queen Elizabeth 1st agreed to have him returned upon the guarantee of "unsuspect judges and other persons on the assise", but this guarantee could not be given so he remained for the time being in England.</p>
<p>On November 28, 1581, he was forfeited by Act of Parliament for the murder of Lord Darnley, which, they argued, was proved by his flight to England, and the evidence of his servant Binney or Binning, who had, in June 1581, already been executed for the same crime.</p>
<p>Owing to the influence of his friend, the Master of Gray, he returned on a safe-conduct to Scotland, arriving in Edinburgh on 15 April 1586. His (nominal) trial took place on May 26, (reported at length in Pitcairn's <i>Criminal Trials</i>). He was acquitted. There was great uproar. To make matters worse, he was then appointed by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VI_ae13.html" title="James VI">James VI</a> his personal Ambassador to Elizabeth 1st, a post he took up in September. While in that post it is said that he assisted the Master of Gray, William Keith, and Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairny to move Elizabeth towards clemency for Mary Queen of Scots, although Dalrymple disputes this. He was at length dismissed from this post, being succeeded by Sir Robert Melville.</p>
<p>After this nothing much appears to be known of him. It is possible he may have died. However, a Mr.Archibald Douglas, Archdeacon of Glasgow (in that post prior to November 1596), is mentioned in the Privy Council Registers on October 28, 1598, and again on December 4, 1599, but it is not known if this is the same person.</p>
<p>Archibald Douglas married, about 1578, (as her third husband) Jane (d. before August 1599), daughter of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Hepburn%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Bothwell_3498.html" title="Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell">Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell</a>.</p>
