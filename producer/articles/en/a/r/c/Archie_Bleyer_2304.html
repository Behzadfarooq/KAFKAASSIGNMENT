	    <p><b>Archie Bleyer</b> (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> - <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>) was an American <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arranger.html" title="Arranger">song arranger</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandleader.html" title="Bandleader">bandleader</a>.</p>
<p>He was born in the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corona%2C_Queens_1be3.html" title="Corona, Queens">Corona</a> section of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York City</a> borough of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a>. He began playing the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> when he was only seven years old. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> he went to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_College_of_Columbia_University_6f7e.html" title="Columbia College of Columbia University">Columbia College</a>, intending to become an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_engineer.html" title="Electrical engineer">electrical engineer</a>, but as a sophomore switched to a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> major. Without graduating, he left to become an arranger.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> he started leading a band of his own at <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Carroll_Theatre_4bbd.html" title="Earl Carroll Theatre">Earl Carroll</a>'s club in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood, California</a>. Bleyer's orchestra recorded for <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunswick_Records_e249.html" title="Brunswick Records">Brunswick Records</a>, and one of the vocalists who worked with this orchestra was <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Mercer_cd0f.html" title="Johnny Mercer">Johnny Mercer</a>, who became better known as a <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songwriter.html" title="Songwriter">songwriter</a> and co-founder of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_Records_df10.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>.</p>
<p>He became musical director for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Godfrey_701f.html" title="Arthur Godfrey">Arthur Godfrey</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, serving in this role until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>. Many close to Godfrey considered Bleyer's creativity and understanding of music to be pivotal to the success of Godfrey's radio and TV programs. And while Godfrey was known to be short-fused and controlling, he often deferred to Bleyer's judgment in the areas of presentation and production.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> he founded <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadence_Records_0e64.html" title="Cadence Records">Cadence Records</a>, whose first artist was Godfrey alumnus <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_La_Rosa_9592.html" title="Julius La Rosa">Julius La Rosa</a>. Along with several instrumental hit singles of his own, Bleyer went on to sign many other artists who had performed on Godfrey's programs (including <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chordettes_0aaf.html" title="The Chordettes">The Chordettes</a>, one of whose members, Janet Ertel, became his wife).</p>
<p>In the fall of 1953, Godfrey dismissed La Rosa on the air and later claimed the young singer "lacked humility," doing his own popularity considerable damage. Just days later, Godfrey fired Bleyer, claiming he was offended when Bleyer recorded Chicago radio personality <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_McNeill_%28performer%29_e37e.html" title="Don McNeill (performer)">Don McNeill</a>, host of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Breakfast_Club_%28radio%29_477c.html" title="The Breakfast Club (radio)">Don McNeill's Breakfast Club</a></i>. This Godfrey-like show was based in Chicago and broadcast nationally, but its popularity was mainly in the Midwest. Always insecure, Godfrey felt McNeill, whose show had once been a competitor, was still in competition though Godfrey was the dominant personality of his generation. Offended that Bleyer recorded McNeill, shortly after the LaRosa firing, Godfrey claimed that when he confronted Bleyer and threatened to fire him, the conductor simply shrugged and told him to do what he had to do. When Bleyer left the show, he never made a public statement about his days with Godfrey. The public furor that surrounded LaRosa's firing and, to a lesser extent, Bleyer's, began the unraveling of Godfrey's seemingly unstoppable dominance of radio and TV as Bleyer's career was just beginning to blossom.</p>
<p>While LaRosa was unable to sustain his early successes, later Cadence artists included <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Williams_2da7.html" title="Andy Williams">Andy Williams</a> and the label's biggest act of all, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Everly_Brothers_99cf.html" title="The Everly Brothers">The Everly Brothers</a> whose hits such as "<a href="../../../b/y/e/Bye_Bye_Love_3fcd.html" title="Bye Bye Love">Bye Bye Love</a>" and "<a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Up_Little_Susie_4f54.html" title="Wake Up Little Susie">Wake Up Little Susie</a>" were produced by Bleyer in Nashville with country studio musicians led by <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chet_Atkins_db4e.html" title="Chet Atkins">Chet Atkins</a>. Bleyer at one point was also the father-in-law of Phil Everly. He had his own instrumental recording hits on the Cadence label as well. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Shirley_76b4.html" title="Don Shirley">Don Shirley</a>, who appeared on the label in 1955 with "Tonal Expressions". It became a Top 15 album in the spring of that year, reportedly selling more than 20,000 copies, a respectable debut for a jazz artist. Ironically, it was the only chart album Shirley was to enjoy, but his sales remained steady enough that he was with the label until it closed in 1964, cutting around a dozen long-play releases <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Shirley_Discography_c040.html" title="Don Shirley Discography">Don Shirley Discography</a>.</p>
<p>Bleyer also had his limits to his tolerance for rock and roll. While he clearly, and correctly, viewed the Everlys as a commercially appealing, clean-cut act whose country-influenced harmonies could reach a vast following, he was not so tolerant of pioneer garage-rock guitarist <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_Wray_5b29.html" title="Link Wray">Link Wray</a>. In 1957, Bleyer reluctantly agreed to release his no-frills, roaring instrumental "<a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumble_%28song%29.html" title="Rumble (song)">Rumble</a>" on Cadence in part due to his daughter's fascination with the song. Wray had a contract with Cadence, but in 1958 after he submitted a newly recorded album of similarly raw material recorded in Nashville, Bleyer was genuinely (if spuriously) convinced the instrumental music was morally and musically inappropriate and shelved the album and canceled Wray's contract. The material wouldn't see the light of day for decades until it was acquired by the British Rollercoaster label.</p>
<p>Cadence had another major hit in 1962 with comic <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughn_Meader_3907.html" title="Vaughn Meader">Vaughn Meader</a>'s album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_First_Family_%28album%29_bd63.html" title="The First Family (album)">The First Family</a></i>, which featured Meader's comedic sketches and his peerless impersonations of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_John_F._Kennedy_94bb.html" title="President John F. Kennedy">President John F. Kennedy</a>. The album was an enormous seller, as was a followup, until Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.</p>
<p>In 1964, Bleyer, who was unable to accept the changing pop music market at the dawn of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">Beatles</a> era, sold the Cadence label and all its recordings (except for certain material--like the Link Wray album--he kept to himself) to Andy Williams. Today the Cadence material is owned by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_BMG_a405.html" title="Sony BMG">Sony BMG Music</a>.</p>
<p>He died of the effects of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_disease.html" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a> in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheboygan%2C_Wisconsin_44e5.html" title="Sheboygan, Wisconsin">Sheboygan, Wisconsin</a>.</p>
