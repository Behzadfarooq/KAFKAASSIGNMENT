<dd>No offense was intended. It seems I'll have to read up on this three revert rule, but I do feel I'm correct in making my edits and trying to removed a bias from the article rather than add one. Is there some kind of ranking that decides that my edits can be reverted three times but this doesn't apply to the other person, something seems unfair here, I really wish people would just leave my edits be I stated my argument in the talk page. - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch_NME_45a5.html" title="User:Arch NME">Arch NME</a> 05:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Know that you are entering into a conentious area that has partisans on both sides of the issue. If you are serious about trying to improve Wikipedia then I would suggest you consider looking at contributing for the long haul. Most of the time on contentious subjects here it is only over a long period of time that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> can be established in articles covering them. Follow the above links in Hummus sapiens' welcome message and familiarize yourself with Wikipedia policies in general. The more knowledgeable about them and the better you follow them the better the chances are that your edits will "stick" as you contribute. Also <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> applies to everyone equally. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:06, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have edited in response to your own edit. I've not reverted to your version because doing that generally spirals into an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a> which is severely frowned upon here on the Wiki. Outside of following Wikipedia policies, content is established through <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> reached through discussions surrounding given edits. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:10, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> thing seemed to indicate that an edit war or something like it was the process by which a concensus was reached. With the rule being only that no one person gets to fire more than three shots. from <a href="../../../3/r/r/Wp%7E3rr.html" title="Wp:3rr">wp:3rr</a> -&gt; <i>"Any reversions beyond this limit should be performed by other users. This collaboration between agreeing users is intended to demonstrate that the community at large is in agreement over which of two (or more) competing versions is most accurate."</i> I'm done editing it myself either way I supposed, I'll do some more reading though on the various rules and procedures. - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch_NME_45a5.html" title="User:Arch NME">Arch NME</a> 06:34, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The 3RR is not an entitlement to 3 reverts in a 24 hour period but a rule of thumb. If you constantly revert over a period of time you likely be subject to <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocking</a>. I know the other editors who were reverting you enough to know that any simple reverting that I might have done would have just been subsequently re-reverted... so rather than even enter into it I edited the text leading to the quote to reflect that it was <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> the views of the the quoted man (and the other name I know from research) read <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">new antisemitism</a> if you get a chance. Editing on Wikipedia in view of the need for consensus can be challenging particularly when there are groups of editors who tend to edit in a semi-coordinated fashion in support of those groups' points of view. Generally speaking if you're to make much of an impact here on contentious topics you're going to have to be patient and know your stuff. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 07:00, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added some junk to the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_8ba4.html" title="Fair Labor Standards Act">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> article yesterday and already some tard has vandalised it. The problem is I'm trying to revert it and he made two changes and saved them so when I go to the history and to compare and press the undo link it wants to change it back to the other one he made is there a way to tell it which revision to go back to? or is there an article somewhere that explains all this. - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch_NME_45a5.html" title="User:Arch NME">Arch NME</a> 20:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This should be relatively easy:</dd>
<dd>Go to the "History" tab; you will see something like this:

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Somewhere down the list you should find the revision that you're looking for. Click the left radial button on that line and then click "compare selected versions". The old revision will appear on the left, the current on the right. It should say "XXX intermediate revisions not shown. To revert to the exact revision you clicked on, now click on "Revision of XXX date", "Edit this page" (which will give a warning), add your edit summary, and then save page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don't click the "undo" which only undoes the last edit. This way also give you the option of changing things before you save the page in question.</dd>

<p>I was just leaving a response to your first message when I got your second one. Based on that, I don't see any reason to keep the comments in the AfD, or even put them on my talk page. There's no reason for two good editors to get into a pissing match that would just reflect poorly on everyone. Your comments actually made me step away from that AfD, which was a good thing.

<p>Hiya. I think you misunderstood what I was saying in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Feezy_350_86af.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Feezy 350">the AfD for Feezy 350</a>. My personal tastes hardly factored into the equation. If they had been featured as a "critic's choice" compilation, I would consider that notable. To cut to the center of my argument - Madden soundtracks are not a reliable indicator of quality, and hence not a reliable indicator of musical relevance, and hence not to be considered "notable" per <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. --Action Jackson IV 23:34, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope, I didn't misunderstand. Nor did I disagree with your argument. Just some retarded comment. You said "in other words, man there are some truly dreadful songs" I said personal opinion of song quality shouldn't be a factor. That's an opinion even if not a direct one about that particular song. Anyway... blah blah blah, this is all so silly I don't even have the words.
