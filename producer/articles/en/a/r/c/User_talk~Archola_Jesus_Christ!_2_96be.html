<p>OK, great idea. Given that, can I suggest then that you rename the article Jesus Christ? I'll contact Sophia to start work on a Jesus of Nazareth page. (This is what I wanted anyway...and explains all the hints about two articles.) If you agree to this suggestion, how about if I make the suggestion on the Jesus page (after I contact Sophia), then you guys could do what you want unfettered, but we can each feel free to borrow good info from each other.

<p>but it's be better if you or Robert (the minister) made the proposal re dividing Jesus among religions. I get your point on them wanting to divide Jesus nine ways to Sunday. This text is important, no that text is, but his real name was, no his real name was this...it can be rather maddening, even for an agnostic.

<dd>Thanks, Archie! That clarifies. As you can tell by my ramblings, that's in keeping with my thought. I a perfect wiki world, would build the subarticles and then work on the summary. That will not work. So, let's dispose of the tempests on the page, archive the stuff and try to talk people out of debating. Maybe we can calm some of it by going to more subpages. Let's try a lot of "that's nice. but what about the article. No debating the subject. Quote scholars! This is supposed to be a summary. Let's take it up below and in the subarticle." --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 12:02, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Archola--I deliberately nowikied the header in the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html" title="Talk:Jesus">Talk:Jesus</a> article so that I didn't make a new section on the talk page--that's my proposed header for a new section on the page to put the "Hebrew/Aramaic" argument to rest. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 22:54, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re: "I saw the message you left on Justin Eiler's talk page, and I must admit I'm confused. 1) Why was a message addressed to "Arch" left on Justin's page? 2) What was deleted, who deleted it, and what does this "it" have to do with Greek or Hebrew? 3) Essentially correct about what? 4) Does MPerel's "point" matter now that Mperel and Haldrik have reached an agreement? (I'm not sure about Jayjg, though.) 5) Why did you sign this mesage twice? 6) Is this any of my business, or did you address this message to another Arch?"</p>
<p>See Justin's page for a better explanation, one that includes arrows and blinky lights. Justin deleted my comment (which turns out to be the likely source of Haldrik's proposal that Perel agreed to) -- that's a no-no in Wikiworld. Now it could have been an accident, and if so that just means that Justin needs to be more careful. If it was intentional, Justin had better have a damn good explanation.</p>
<p>In any case, see the updated version, note what I said about reversing the Greek to Hebrew. (Oh, just in case there's a misundersanding -- I don't care about this for credit purposes, but I do not appreciate having my comments deleted). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 12:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Jim and Arch--what happened is I was trying to revert Arch's removal of the "Nowiki" tags--he thought I included them accidently, but they were part of my proposal for a new subsection (you can see the Nowikied heading further down in the diff). I evidently took too long and you got your edit in while I was trying to get mine finished.

<p>I wish they would stop already! It makes no difference whatsoever. We either place the names in the intro, with at least a footnote indicating it is the near unimous opinion of scholars on the issue, or, as I prefer, put a link in to the names page.

<p>A week later, and still going on about the Greek and Hebrew. Amazing.</p>
<p>"Nonsense. Greek represents documented fact, Hebrew represents speculation. They shouldn't be mixed in an intro. Jayjg (talk) 04:09, 15 March 2006 (UTC) I agree.

<dd>Jayjg is missing a key point: all one needs to say is, Ιηςους, likely from Hebrew Yeshu(a). After all an overwhelming majority of linguists have theorized that to be the case (I've pointed that out three times already and I'm not interested in going for four).</dd>
<dd>As for the other argument made by a few people that since Jesus spoke Aramaic peredominantly (which is true) his name would have been in Aramaic, they miss the sociological point that his given name would be in Hebrew in order to retain the Jewish lineage and heritage. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 10:48, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see. Well, I've begun implementing your outline to the NT section of the Jesus article on my talk page. I think most of the rest should be left alone, but possibly we'll need to revamp the Historicity section based on updates being made to that article and the Historical Jesus article. By all means feel free to jump in and start adding content on the duplication I made; and if you would rather work on a new version somewhere else just lemme know. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 20:07, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. Judging by those two sections, which seem to cover a good amount of biographical data without being too long or unreadable, I honestly would have to disagree that the biography section would be too long. I think by merging some of the related sections (such as Geneology and Family, Nativity and Childhood, Resurrection and Ascension) we could cover all the bases without making the section too long. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 02:14, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sorry, but I still think your point is both illogical and inaccurate. You state "Saying "Bible scholars, historians and philosphers" is exactly like saying, "Texan Americans, Iowans and Californians."" This is not a reasonable analogy, because people say "Bible scholars" all the time, and never just say "Bible." But people do not say "historian scholars" or "philosopher scholars." Moreover, people say "Biblical scholars" all the time, but do <i>not</i> say "Texas Americans" at all. So this is inaccurate in that you either are unfamiliar with English, or with the was English speakers identify different kinds of scholars. And, this is a poor analogy, because you are comparing a common phrase (Bible scholars) to a non-existant phrase, "Texan Americans." If you are going to make an analogy, do it right. Here is a good analogy: saying that "Bible scholars, historians, and philosophers" is like saying "New Yorkers, Iowans, and Californians." Yes, "Bible scholar" is a nominal phrase consisting of two words, whereas "historian" is a nominal phrase using only one word. Similarly, "New Yorker" is a nominal phrase using two words, and "Iowan" is a nominal phrase with only one word. Does that mean that people are wrong to say "<i>New</i> Yorker," that they should say only "Yorker?" Does that mean that people are wrong to say "Iowan," that they ought to say "New Iowan?" No - this would be absurd. It is perfectly fine that some states are called by two words and other states by one word. And this practice is in no way disparaging - no one in the US thinks New York is more "new" than Iowa! "New York" is how one refers to one state, "Iowa" is how one refers to another state. "Bible scholar" is how one refers to one kind of academic, and "historian" is how one refers to another kind of academic. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:10, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was a bad analogy based on an illogical implication. My point was that we might find a better way to phrase it.

<p>I understand that Archie - it's the wording of the sentence that could curently be read to mean that there are slight disagreements that the gospels were written in the decades after Jesus died - ie it implies some think they were written before. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">Sophia</a><sup><small><a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESOPHIA_c099.html" title="User talk:SOPHIA"><font color="purple">Talk</font></a></small></sup><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_The_Centrist_Faction_48eb.html" title="User:Archola/The Centrist Faction"><font color="#404040">TCF</font></a> 13:42, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now that we're referring to a specific date (first 60 AD/CE, then 65 AD/CE, although JimWae mentioned 68 AD/CE) this is less of an issue. Actually, the subsection <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html#Historical_reconstructions_of_Jesus.27s_life" title="Jesus">Jesus#Historical reconstructions of Jesus's life</a> says "Most scholars agree the Gospels were written after the destruction of the Jewish Temple by the Romans."

<p>If you can get the article the way you envision it (which is essentially what I was talking about -- present the different cases in an NPOV manner, including religious, hystorical, mythological, etc.) then I would suggest you Anglicise it as that tends to be seen as a "higher" form of English (very snobby indeed!). But, if it stays as it is, or drifts further into a Sunday School-style presentation, then American English would be best as that really is the way the article reads (to me at least). Hey, if we could find a Buddhist monk to rewrite the article, we might actually have something good -- a spritual person who is logical and non-theistic.

<p>I haven't spent much time on the German version -- too many fires to put out between people swearing that the 20 versions of Genesis chapter 2 written in the 12 languages I can read are all mistranslated from the Hebrew; two other people hell bent on arguing that humans aren't primates; another person hell bent on disrupting the Pseudoscience article; Benapgar's delusions; writing four other articles and taking care of 4 kids, working a lovely job as an IT manager, and assisting people with linguistics questions. Oh, sleeping and eating go in there too. &#160;:)</p>
<p>More seriously</p>
<ul>
<li>"the time when Jesus was purported to live" -- this seems to be bending over backward for the Jesus-mythers. You already mentioned that they exist, but are a small group.</li>
<li>"Although <b>some</b> critical scholars, including archeologists, continue to use them as points of reference in the study of ancient Near Eastern history[9] <b>some</b> have come to view the texts as cultural and literary document" (emphasis added). -- and some don't give a damn? "Some" is too weasely. Are there any percetages available? Do more argree with statement one, or with statement two?</li>
<li>Since you link to hagiography, do you really need this explanation? "Hagiography has a principal aim of the glorification of the religion itself and of the example set by the perfect holy person represented as its central focus."</li>
<li>This indicates that there is proof that Paul had visions: "Paul saw Jesus only in visions, but he claimed that they were divine revelations and hence authoritative (Galatians 1:11-12)."</li>
<li>Develop this a bit more? Admit that they may not exist because they may have been intentionally destroyed? "Questions of existence of earlier texts" (I would change the title to "Earlier texts" or "Possible earlier texts" as "questions" carries a certain implication that the documents never existed).</li>
<li>The footnote doesn't exactly support this, in addition, there is no indication of potential bias on the part of the scholars. "However, most scholars accept many details of the Gospel narratives"</li>
<li>Is the many and some true in this section, "External influences on gospel development"? Also, are these historical scholars (i.e., non-reliously inspired) or Biblical scholars?</li>

However, I have still been checking in on the progress at the article and think the introduction is looking good. I do think though that a lot of time is being spent on representing and refining very small views, especially fringe views in Christianity--far more time than is being spent on expanding the biographical sections of the article.

<p>Yep - we're actually back to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> who raised just that point. His way of looking at things was "why add God - all it does is push the question back one step". The best reply I've ever had to that, and one I don't argue with, is that adding God to the begining of the universe is a step of <i>faith</i>. When I was doing cosmology at Uni there were discussions on "perturbations in the entropy" and other such stuff. I think it's something we can know about but never really know for sure as the laws of physics start to break down when you get to any <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singularity.html" title="Singularity">singularity</a>. I have never understood why evolution and science are a problem with religion as to me someone who can set up the rules and conditions for this universe to happen by it's self is infinitely cleverer than someone who has to manhandle it every step of the way. Then of course the "word of God" be comes science as that is the real way to "know the mind of God".

Diversity of viewpoint and ruthless pruning of POV is what may make Wiki our generation's "great wonder". PS: Any idea why most of the Historical Jesus talk page vanished a couple days ago? The edit history makes it look like a mistake, but I was wondering if it got archived somewhere due to the rather, um, heated exchanges from a while back. I thought the discussion was interesting and very on-point. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin/Last1in</a> 01:39, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry for getting you mixed up with Avery! (WHY do I do that?)</p>
<p>I have reverted twice, reaching my limit, the anonymous user's additions. He is signed in from an AOL IP, so it is essential we urge him or her to establish a user ID. Also, the addition he has tried to add simply is too much detail for the main page and is repetitive.

<p>You ask for a citation. Sadly, I read a lot, and don't take notes. I'm sure all of the ideas I mention are from books I mention, but which idea comes from where is more than my powers of memory will supply. I think these ideas are in common currency. I have supplied Biblical references for the ideas. If you can't find a secondary source, how about changing it to read, "According to the Bible..."? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 12:25, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've spent the last two days trolling around the WP Jesus stuff, particularly the historical/myth related activity. The shock caused me to open an account. Since you seem interested in working with people to get it right, I thought I'd come to you for some advice.</p>
<p>I don't want to jump into something if its just going to be carte blanche worked over by extremists from either side. But, in my opinion. there are major problems that really need to be addressed (Gnosticism, for instance, has extensive factual errors that keep getting replaced). Any collaberation on where to begin would be appreciated. I don't have a lot of time as I've exams coming up quickly, but after that I can devote some effort.</p>
<p>In general, there is a lot of emphasis on the gnostic/mythicist position here. This is fine, as people are reading the Da Vinci Code and seeing the NGS Gospel of Judas stuff and want to know what it is about. To me, anything that gets people to pay attention to my field is great. When it leads to conspiracy theories which ignore mainstream scholarship, or to accusing people of an "overt Christian bias", there is a problem, however. In fact, it shows that people have absorbed the mythicist playbook, and causes real questions about POV. The search for non Christian sources on the historicity of Jesus is useless, for instance, since the academy considers it a closed question. The only people who are going to take the bait are by nature conservative Christians.</p>
<p>Since this is clearly a condentious area, before I start axe-wielding, I'd like to know where I can be more useful and get involved with the dialogue. Sorry to ramble, but this deserves to be done well. Best.--<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdarcey_5066.html" title="User:Mrdarcey">Mrdarcey</a> 14:33, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, and it appears various other anons are doing the same thing. It is not the fact that they want to provide specific examples that bothers me--it is that they are cherry-picking things which may seem fundamentalist and leaving out others. I prefer the original summary of "abide by the spirit of the law rather than just the letter." That covers all bases without getting into this nitpicky debate. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 05:20, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I kind of got involved in other stuff. I'd have to look at the page to see what the heck happened that caused it to lose it's star -- no doubt the same thing that's been happening to the English page. I know you and CTS and others have kept it from getting totally out of hand, but it's even more of a Sunday School lesson dressed up like a church full of ikons than it was a month ago.</p>

<dd>Man, I'm sorry to see all that stuff. Maybe you <i>should</i> take a Wiki-break, even if only for a day. It's just ridiculous. BTW, and I mean this seriously, whence the half-brother? I did a search on the KJV and there's nothing that indicates half-brother, other than "James, son of Mary".</dd>
<dd>I voted for CTS even though he hasn't a chance.</dd>
<dd>Are you saying the following isn't true to some people? entombment = "buried in a tomb." What does it mean then? Out picking grapes?</dd>
<dd>I hate to say this, but religion brings out the worst in many people (or, perhaps I should say that their monolithic views of their religion do).

<p>I saw the argument. I commented. The whole thing sickens me. <i>Agape</i> my ass. Everyday, I understand more and more why I jettisoned religion twenty-some years ago. The genetic question was a rational question. (Of course, every "good Christia person" better hope there never is any genetic evidence -- the whole religion goes down in flames if the body is ever found.) One other point: not all Chrtistians accept the virgin birth -- many see it for what it was: a mistranslation of the Hebrew word for young girl that led to the creation of a myth that became canonised in the NT (well, not in all of it). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 23:34, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
