<p>I can see that, Poe being an editor. Coming back time and time again, violating Wiki rules and editing his own page. Probably adding things to the articles on adaptations of his stories&#160;:"my book was better". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 00:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC) Finally saw <i>300</i>, just got back matter of fact. It was pretty good; kind of like watching a documentary on the history channel, minus the authenticity part. I did see where Persians had their issues, but I saw things in the beginning that Greeks could hold offense to, but no one seems to be saying too much about them (though for NPOV it would be good to have something in those sections). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 04:13, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The infanticide is probably one the clearest. What culture wants to be reminded, or accussed of tossing babies off a cliff in search of that "perfect" one? Plus, Leonidas kills the messenger because he doesn't care of his choice of words, but was just finished preaching to his son about respect. That's rather barbaric, don't like the news so kill the messenger. I probably would have done the same, but still, not the image of civility and posh that Iranians are claiming wasn't giving to their people in the film. Also, all that outcry about blacks and bad, but did you notice that the "guards" that accompanied the first messenger were white? The hunchback traitor, Ephialtes, was technically white also. Both Ephialtes, and Theron, were bought out, what does that say about the "whites"? Maybe that they were easily swayed by money, they have no integrity? Who knows, but no one seems to be bringing these points up to keep a NPOV. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 13:01, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I'll have to read through the "outcry" sections, but I can be almost certain, based on the discussions beforehand, that there is nothing in there from the Greek community. Even if there is only 1 source of angst against the film, from the Greeks, to be NPOV it should be there. Also, I'm sure there is probably some Greek interpretations of the depictions of Persians which would be nice. But again, I haven't read it yet. Since I've finally seen the film, I can go through the whole page and bring any concerns to light on the talk page. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 14:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't have one. It's one thing to embellish, but it's another to try and convince people of faux credentials in some lame excuse to win arguments. From what I've read, he tried to flash his "cred" during arguments to get people to stop. I don't care if he's right or wrong in those instances, it's just uncouth. I've been around people that, when confronted with opposition, can only throw the "well I'm a ......" to try and win the argument. Other than that, I wouldn't care if he got to keep his job, or if he was still an editor. Even hearing some of the bad things, I also heard he was a good editor and administrator. I think I may have come in contact with him once, but it may have been more in passing. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 22:31, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear sir, I didn't know why my addition didn,t updated in 300 movie External links. So I tried many times and I didn't mean Vandalism as you said. It was just trial. I think adding a link wasn't damaging the hard work of others, is it? so anyway I'll stop this way of editing. But I just wanna know, how will be my edition accepted? I though I did as its written in tutorial, maybe I was wrong!

<dd>First of all, don't be frustrated by this, I learned how to do that only 2 or 3 months ago, so the learning curve is easy. Here's a way to do it:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>First, open another browser page (keeping this one open in the bacground) and go to your Wikipedia talk page. Click the tab at the top where it says "Edit this page".</li>
<li>Now, go back to the page where these instructions are, and highlight the address bar (where it says http..., etc). Copy that <i>link</i>.</li>
<li>Afterwards. click on your Talk Page (below the rest of the text already there, like you were going to type something new), and type: "This is where I learned how to link externally".</li>
<li>Hit the return key, taking you to a new line and PASTE the copied link from my page. You should now have a full, prety long web-address there.</li>
<li>Highlight the whole link (make sure you get it all, from first letter to last), and then move your cursor over the tool button icons at the top of the editing window. These are your most commonly used tools in Wikipedia (after your brain, of course). if you move your cursor over them slowly, their names will pop up.</li>
<li>With the written link still highlighted, click the tool button that has the earth in it (external link). This will put two brackets '[' on either side of the highlighted link.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You have just made an external link, or hyperlink! When you click it, you will note that it automatically takes you to this page.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you might want to make a word the external link to a page, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">here</a>. All I have done there, if you look at the link through the "edit this page" window, all I've done is enter the link, put a space and then the word (or number or multiple words) I wish to associate with the link.</li>
<li>Note that <i>internal links</i> are different in that they point to pages within Wikipedia, like <a href="../../../i/m/a/WP%7EIMAGE_b3eb.html" title="WP:IMAGE">WP:IMAGE</a>, or <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOT_933b.html" title="WP:BOOT">WP:BOOT</a>. By going to the latter of those two links you can learn more about getting all fancy with your links.</li>

<p>Absolutely -- that particular string of footnotes isn't mine.

<dd>Okay, I've fixed the code for the userboxes and the signpost; HTML and Wiki don't mix well, which was the problem with getting things aligned. I just used the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Help%7ETable_8f3b.html" title="Help:Table">Help:Table</a> page for a quick help. Also left a note for you in the code in case you want to add more userboxes. I've being doing HTML off and on for ten years now, but it is fun once you get the hang of it. Kind of like learning a different language; use it or you lose it. <span style="font-family:verdana"><a href="../../../y/l/l/User%7EYllosubmarine_e632.html" title="User:Yllosubmarine">María</a>:</span> <small>(<a href="../../../y/l/l/User_talk%7EYllosubmarine_57e8.html" title="User talk:Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">habla</span></a> con<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yllosubmarine_42d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">migo</span></a>)</small> 14:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hullo -- now that we're getting down to the fine points, a quick query: you've added in "plot" the phrase "(whose bloodline would continue absent them)" to describe selection of the 300. I think I understand, but it's a bit confusing -- would "who already have children" be better?

<p>Dimitris is just informal or a nickname for Dimitrios (or Demetrios). The other edit I made was a matter of NPOV. It is almost implied that the makers of the film and the comic had intentionally wanted to be racist against the Persians, which is not at all the case. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:39, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. It can probably stay as it is in "Production," but we could use it again under "Historical Accuracy" after the current quote -- for example the part about "a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth" is illuminating. --<a href="../../../j/a/v/User%7EJavits2000_0fa8.html" title="User:Javits2000">Javits2000</a> 20:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just saw your edit summary of your reasoning for having placed the "Trolling" template on Viriditas's talk page - you really shouldn't have done that.

<dd>Well, Books, it was a while ago, and the lad just rubs me the wrong way. It hink its notable that in almost 6 months, I've only met one editor with whom I cannot find anything nice to say about. I did repoirt his 3RR, but the Noticeboard was apparently busy, and didn't get to it until it after it was archived. He knows he did it, and that I caught him doing it. I've since moved on, and I think the article is less than it could be. It's supposed to be fun to work in WP, and that cat just sucks all the enjoyment right out of it. After all, I don't go calling people meat-puppets unless I can prove it. Speaking of which, has Sarah written to you since you decided not to report Viriditas? I would lay odds she hasn't.</dd>
