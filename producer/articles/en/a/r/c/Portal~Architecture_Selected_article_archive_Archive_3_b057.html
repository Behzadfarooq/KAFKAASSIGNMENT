<p><b><a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_Calatrava_Valls_bc6d.html" title="Santiago Calatrava Valls">Santiago Calatrava Valls</a></b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>) is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a> whose work has become increasingly popular worldwide.</p>
<p>Calatrava was born in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valencia_%28city_in_Spain%29_4808.html" title="Valencia (city in Spain)">Valencia</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, where he pursued undergraduate studies at the Architecture School and Arts and Crafts School. Following graduation in 1975, he enrolled in the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_Federal_Institute_of_Technology_bf42.html" title="Swiss Federal Institute of Technology">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology</a> (ETH) in <a href="../../../z/%C3%BC/r/Z%C3%BCrich.html" title="Zürich">Zürich, Switzerland</a> for graduate work in <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_engineering.html" title="Civil engineering">civil engineering</a>. Calatrava was influenced by the French/Swiss architect <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Corbusier_5fc7.html" title="Le Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>, whose <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_du_Haut_93ed.html" title="Notre Dame du Haut">Notre Dame du Haut</a> chapel caused Calatrava to examine how complex form could be understood and generated in architecture. In 1981 after completing his doctoral <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thesis.html" title="Thesis">thesis</a>, "On the Foldability of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_frame.html" title="Space frame">Space Frames</a>", he started his architecture and engineering practice.</p>
<p>Calatrava's unique, creative, and highly influential style combines a striking visual architectural style that interacts harmoniously with the rigid principles of engineering. His work often draws on form and structure found in the natural world, and can be described as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphic.html" title="Anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a>. His works have elevated the design of some civil engineering projects such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge.html" title="Bridge">bridges</a> to new heights. He has designed numerous <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train_station.html" title="Train station">train stations</a>, heralded for their bright, open, and easily-traveled spaces.</p>
<p>While he is primarily known as an architect, Calatrava is also a prolific <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculptor</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painter.html" title="Painter">painter</a>, claiming that the practice of architecture combines all the arts into one. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_Calatrava_1355.html" title="Santiago Calatrava">(more…)</a><br clear="all" /></p>

<p>The <b>IG Farben Building</b> or the <b>Poelzig Building</b> was built from 1928 to 1930 as the corporate headquarters of the <a href="../../../i/g/_/IG_Farben_2057.html" title="IG Farben">IG Farben</a> conglomerate in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt.html" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt am Main</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. It is also known as the Poelzig Ensemble or Poelzig Complex, and previously as the IG Farben Complex, and the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. A competition to design the building was won by the architect <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Poelzig_a25f.html" title="Hans Poelzig">Hans Poelzig</a>. On its completion, the complex was the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_largest_buildings_in_the_world.html" title="List of largest buildings in the world">largest office building</a> in Europe and remained so until the 1950s.</p>
<p>The building was the headquarters for research projects relating to the development of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">wartime</a> <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthetic_oil.html" title="Synthetic oil">synthetic oil</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthetic_rubber.html" title="Synthetic rubber">rubber</a>, and the production administration of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnesium.html" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>, lubricating oil, explosives, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methanol.html" title="Methanol">methanol</a>, and <a href="../../../z/y/k/Zyklon_B_44ff.html" title="Zyklon B">Zyklon B</a>, the lethal gas used in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the <b>Labyrinth</b> was an elaborate structure constructed for King <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minos.html" title="Minos">Minos</a> of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a> and designed by the legendary artificer <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daedalus.html" title="Daedalus">Daedalus</a> to hold the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minotaur.html" title="Minotaur">Minotaur</a>, a creature that was half man and half <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull_%28mythology%29.html" title="Bull (mythology)">bull</a> and which was eventually killed by the Athenian <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero.html" title="Hero">hero</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theseus.html" title="Theseus">Theseus</a>. Theseus was aided by <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariadne.html" title="Ariadne">Ariadne</a>, who provided him with a fateful thread to wind his way back again, a clue to the single path of the labyrinth.</p>
<p>The term <i>labyrinth</i> is often used interchangeably with <i><a href="../../../m/a/z/Maze.html" title="Maze">maze</a></i>, but modern scholars of the subject use a stricter definition. For them, a maze is a tour <a href="../../../p/u/z/Puzzle.html" title="Puzzle">puzzle</a> in the form of a complex branching passage, with choices of path and direction, while a single-path (<i>"unicursal"</i>) labyrinth has only a single, <a href="../../../e/u/l/Eulerian_path.html" title="Eulerian path">Eulerian path</a> to the centre. A labyrinth has an unambiguous through-route to the centre and back and is not designed to be difficult to navigate. <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labyrinth.html" title="Labyrinth">(more…)</a></p>

<p>A <b>maze</b> is a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_puzzle.html" title="Tour puzzle">tour puzzle</a> in the form of a complex branching passage through which the solver must find a route. This is different from a <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labyrinth.html" title="Labyrinth">labyrinth</a>, which (strictly speaking) has an unambiguous through-route and is not designed to be difficult to navigate (despite the common uses of the word to indicate various complex, confusing structures). The pathways and walls in a maze or labyrinth are fixed (pre-determined). Maze-type puzzles where the given walls and paths may change during the game are covered under the main puzzle category of <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_puzzle.html" title="Tour puzzle">tour puzzles</a>.</p>
<p>Mazes have been built with walls and rooms, with <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedge_%28gardening%29.html" title="Hedge (gardening)">hedges</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turf_maze.html" title="Turf maze">turf</a>, or with paving stones of contrasting colors or designs, or in fields of crops such as <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cereal.html" title="Cereal">corn</a> or, indeed, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maize.html" title="Maize">maize</a>. Maize mazes can be very large; they are usually only kept for one growing season, so they can be different every year, and are promoted as seasonal <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourist_attractions.html" title="Tourist attractions">tourist attractions</a>. One type of maze consists of a set of rooms linked by doors (so a passageway is just another room in this definition). Players enter at one spot, and exit at another, or the idea may be to reach a certain spot in the maze. Mazes can also be printed or drawn on <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paper.html" title="Paper">paper</a> to be followed by a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil.html" title="Pencil">pencil</a> or fingertip.

<p>The oldest part of the Palace still in existence, Westminster Hall, dates from 1097. The <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace.html" title="Palace">palace</a> originally served as a royal residence but no monarch has lived in it since the 16th century. Most of the present structure dates from the 19th century, when the Palace was rebuilt after it was almost entirely destroyed by a fire in 1834. The architect responsible for rebuilding the Palace was <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Barry_eb91.html" title="Charles Barry">Sir Charles Barry</a> with <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Pugin_4d2f.html" title="Augustus Pugin">Augustus Welby Pugin</a>. The building is an example of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_revival.html" title="Gothic revival">Gothic revival</a>. One of the Palace's most famous features is the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_Tower%2C_Palace_of_Westminster_deb4.html" title="Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster">clock tower</a>, a tourist attraction that houses the famous bell Big Ben. The latter name is often used, erroneously, for the clock itself, which is actually part of St Stephen's Tower.</p>
<p>The Palace contains over 1,000 rooms, the most important of which are the Chambers of the House of Lords and of the House of Commons. The Palace also includes committee rooms, libraries, lobbies, dining-rooms, bars and gymnasiums. It is the site of important state ceremonies, most notably the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Opening_of_Parliament_6b71.html" title="State Opening of Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>. The Palace is very closely associated with the two Houses, as shown by the use of the word "Westminster" to refer to "Parliament". Parliamentary offices overspill into nearby buildings such as <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portcullis_House_32f0.html" title="Portcullis House">Portcullis House</a>, and Norman Shaw Buildings. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Westminster_357b.html" title="Palace of Westminster">(more…)</a></p>

However, the new house was fitted with the latest <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innovation.html" title="Innovation">innovations</a> such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and more importantly completely separate areas for the staff.

<p>The <b>shotgun house</b> is a narrow rectangular domestic residence, usually no more than 12&#160;<a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_%28unit_of_length%29.html" title="Foot (unit of length)">feet</a> (3.5&#160;<a href="../../../m/e/t/Meter.html" title="Meter">m</a>) wide, with doors at each end. It was the most popular style of <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">house</a> in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">Southern United States</a> from the end of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> (1861–65), through to the 1920s. Alternate names include <b>shotgun shack</b>, <b>shotgun hut</b>, <b>shotgun cottage</b>, and <b><a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad_apartment.html" title="Railroad apartment">railroad apartments</a></b>. The style was developed in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a>, but the houses can be found as far away as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> or <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_West_6a8a.html" title="Key West">Key West</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. Shotgun houses are still the most prevalent housing style in many southern cities and towns. Though initially as popular with the middle class as with the poor, the shotgun house became a symbol of poverty in the mid-20th century. Opinion is now mixed: some houses are bulldozed due to <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_renewal.html" title="Urban renewal">urban renewal</a>, while others are beneficiaries of <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historic_preservation.html" title="Historic preservation">historic preservation</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentrification.html" title="Gentrification">gentrification</a>.</p>
<p>Shotgun houses consist of three to five rooms in a row with no hallways. The term "shotgun house," which was in use by 1903 but became more common after about 1940, is often said to come from the saying that one could fire a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotgun.html" title="Shotgun">shotgun</a> through the front door and the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_shot.html" title="Lead shot">pellets</a> would fly cleanly through the house and out the back door. However, the name's origin may actually reflect an <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">African</a> architectural heritage, perhaps being a corruption of a term such as <i>to-gun</i>, which means, "place of assembly" in the Southern Dohomey Fon area.</p>
<p>Several variations of shotgun houses allow for additional features and space, and many have been updated to the needs of future generations of owners. The oldest shotgun houses were built without <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_water_system.html" title="Domestic water system">indoor plumbing</a>, and this was often added later (sometimes crudely). "Double-barrel" shotgun houses consist of two houses sharing a central wall, allowing more houses to be fitted into an area. "Camelback" shotgun houses include a second floor at the rear of the house. In some cases, the entire floor plan is changed during remodeling to create hallways. <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotgun_house.html" title="Shotgun house">(more…)</a><br clear="all" /></p>

<p>A <b>templon</b> (from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> τέμπλον meaning "temple", plural <i>templa</i>) is a feature of <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_architecture.html" title="Byzantine architecture">Byzantine architecture</a> that first appeared in Christian churches around the fifth century AD and is still found in some <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Christianity_17e5.html" title="Eastern Christianity">Eastern Christian</a> churches. It eventually evolved into the modern <a href="../../../i/c/o/Iconostasis.html" title="Iconostasis">iconostasis</a>, still found in Orthodox churches today. It separates the laity in the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Nave.html" title="Nave">nave</a> from the priests preparing the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacraments.html" title="Sacraments">sacraments</a> at the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altar</a>. It is usually composed of carved wood or marble colonnettes supporting an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architrave.html" title="Architrave">architrave</a> (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctuary.html" title="Sanctuary">sanctuary</a>. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icons.html" title="Icons">icons</a> were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the colonnettes, and the templon became more and more opaque. It is often covered with icons and can be very elaborate.</p>
<p>The templon most likely has an independent origin from that of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> chancel barriers. Classical stage architecture is one possible source. At certain times during Byzantine history, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">theater</a> heavily influenced painting and sculpture. Architects then, influenced by stage backdrops dating back to <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophocles.html" title="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>, consciously imitated the classical <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proscenium.html" title="Proscenium">proscenium</a> (the backdrop of a classical Greek stage), copying the multiple columns punctuated by a large door in the middle and two smaller doors to each side. The statues on top of the backdrop would thus be analogous to the icons of the saints looking down.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_myref-12"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/c/Portal%7EArchitecture_Selected_article_archive_Archive_3_b057.html#endnote_myref-12" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/c/Portal%7EArchitecture_Selected_article_archive_Archive_3_b057.html#endnote_myref-12" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span> The similarities, however, are probably only visual. Although classical drama was performed in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, during the 5th and 6th century when the first templa appear, when Christian <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgy</a> was first being developed, the plays and their architecture had lost their importance and could not have influenced Christian ritual. <a href="../../../t/e/m/Templon.html" title="Templon">(more…)</a></p>

<p><b>Constructivist architecture</b> was a form of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_architecture.html" title="Modern architecture">modern architecture</a> that flourished in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in the 1920s and early 1930s.

<p>Constructivist architecture emerged from the wider <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructivism_%28art%29.html" title="Constructivism (art)">constructivist art</a> movement of 1914-1920 which had been initially inspired from 1914-1920 by the sculptures of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Archipenko_2557.html" title="Alexander Archipenko">Alexander Archipenko</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picasso.html" title="Picasso">Picasso</a>'s reliefs. Constructivist art had attempted to apply a three-dimensional <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubist.html" title="Cubist">cubist</a> vision to wholly <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_art.html" title="Abstract art">abstract</a> non-objective 'constructions' with a <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_art.html" title="Kinetic art">kinetic</a> element. After the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_revolution.html" title="Russian revolution">Russian revolution</a> of 1919 it turned it's attentions to the new social demands and industrial tasks required of the new regime. Two distinct threads emerged, the first was encapsulated in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Pevsner_f594.html" title="Antoine Pevsner">Antoine Pevsner</a>'s and <a href="../../../n/a/u/Naum_Gabo_169c.html" title="Naum Gabo">Naum Gabo</a>'s <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Realist_manifesto.html" title="Realist manifesto">Realist manifesto</a></i> which was concerned with space and rhythym, the second represented a struggle within the Education Commissariat between those who argued for <i>pure art</i> and the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Productivism_%28art%29.html" title="Productivism (art)">productivists</a>, a more socially-oriented group who wanted this art to be absorbed in industrial production.</p>
<p>A split occured in 1922 when Pevsner and Gabo emigrated. The movement then developed along socially <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utilitarian.html" title="Utilitarian">utilitarian</a> lines.
