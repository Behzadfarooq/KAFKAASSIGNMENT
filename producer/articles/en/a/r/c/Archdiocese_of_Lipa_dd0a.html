<p>It is bounded on the north by the provinces of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavite.html" title="Cavite">Cavite</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/g/Laguna_%28province%29.html" title="Laguna (province)">Laguna</a>, on the east by <a href="../../../t/a/y/Tayabas_Bay_7105.html" title="Tayabas Bay">Tayabas Bay</a>, and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quezon_Province_a0f3.html" title="Quezon Province">Quezon Province</a>, on the west by the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_China_Sea_9e9c.html" title="South China Sea">China Sea</a>, and on the south by the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balayan.html" title="Balayan">Balayan</a> and Batangas Rays. Its land area is 3,165 square kilometers (1,222 square miles) and the population as of the 1994 census is 1,668,480 of which 99.5 per cent are <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Catholics</a>.</p>
<p>The province surrounds <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Taal_ab91.html" title="Lake Taal">Lake Taal</a> from which <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal_Volcano_edc5.html" title="Taal Volcano">Taal Volcano</a> rises in the center. The rich soil of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Batangas">Batangas</a> was formed from volcanic tuff coming from the active volcanoes of Taal. The terrain is characterized by rolling hills, plateaus and low mountains, the highest of which is <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Makiling_191b.html" title="Mount Makiling">Mount Makiling</a> which is only 1,109 meters (3,600 feet) in elevation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Lipa_dd0a.html" title="Edit section: The Province">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Province</span></h2>
<p>The province is rich in natural resources. Almost 80 per cent of Batangue√±os have a piece of land to cultivate, and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Batangas">Batangas</a> farmer is a model farmer known for his intensive cultivation of land. This was brought about in large part by big landowners selling portions of their land, thus eliminating social unrest.</p>
<p>Fishing and mineral reserves abound in the province which also has a number of manufacturing industries including petroleum refineries, sugar centrals, food and beverage companies, and countless cottage industries. The coastline is dotted with beach resorts often frequented by local and foreign tourists. it is popular with foreign <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diving.html" title="Diving">diving</a> aficionados.</p>
<p>As they have a stable source of income, most families in Batangas can afford to send their children to schools and colleges in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Batangas">Batangas</a> or in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>. This explains why 90 per cent of the population is educated.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Batangas">Batangas</a> was originally called <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balayan.html" title="Balayan">Balayan</a>, with <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal.html" title="Taal">Taal</a> as its first capital. In 1754 the capital was moved to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas_City_4bac.html" title="Batangas City">Batangas City</a>, its capital today. Historically, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Batangas">Batangas</a> is known as the birth place of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apolinario_Mabini_ffcf.html" title="Apolinario Mabini">Apolinario Mabini</a>, a Filipino hero known as the "Sublime Paralytic" who became Secretary of State of the First Philippine Republic. The last Filipino general to surrender to Americans in the Philippine American War, <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Malvar_587b.html" title="Miguel Malvar">Miguel Malvar</a>, was also from this province.</p>

<p>The Diocese of Lipa was created on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">April 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>, separating it from that of Manila. The diocese then covered the provinces of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Batangas">Batangas</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/g/Laguna_%28province%29.html" title="Laguna (province)">Laguna</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quezon.html" title="Quezon">Quezon</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marinduque.html" title="Marinduque">Marinduque</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mindoro.html" title="Mindoro">Mindoro</a>, with Most Reverend Joseph Petrelli, <a href="../../../d/2E/d/D.D._acad.html" title="D.D.">D.D.</a>, as the first <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a>. He was faced with a monumental task because the diocese was large and there was but a handful of priests.</p>
<p>Bishop Petrelli invited different religious <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_religious_order_a997.html" title="Roman Catholic religious order">congregations</a> to come to his diocese and help minister to the spiritual needs of the faithful. He also conceived the building of a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminary.html" title="Seminary">seminary</a> in the diocese. In June l914 a diocesan seminary was built in <a href="../../../b/a/u/Bauan.html" title="Bauan">Bauan</a>, which was later transferred to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Pablo_b37e.html" title="San Pablo">San Pablo</a> in Laguna. This initiative of the first bishop was continued by the next bishop, Alfredo Verzosa, D.D., who served a long term from 1916 to 1950. He invited priests from the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_St._Vincent_de_Paul_6faf.html" title="Society of St. Vincent de Paul">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> to help in the administration of the new seminary.</p>
<p>In 1950 the Most Reverend <a href="../../../r/u/f/Rufino_Cardinal_Santos_2f68.html" title="Rufino Cardinal Santos">Rufino Cardinal Santos</a> took over the diocese. Described as a financial administrator of great acumen, Bishop Santos applied for bank loans to help construct some buildings. This way he continued the construction work of the Cathedral of Lipa and built a major seminary beside it.</p>

<p>With the departure of Monsignor Rufino Santos for the Archdiocese of Manila came a young bishop, Most Reverend Alejandro Olalia, D.D., who stayed with the diocese from 1953 to 1973. It was during his term that the Diocese of Lipa, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, became the tenth Archdiocese and Ecclesiastical Province by order of the Holy Father, Pope <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_VI_0ee4.html" title="Paul VI">Paul VI</a>. This same order elevated Bishop Olalia to the rank of archbishop on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>.</p>
<p>Bishop Olalia died in 1973 and was replaced by Bishop <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_J._Vidal_c86f.html" title="Ricardo J. Vidal">Ricardo J. Vidal</a> who stayed with the diocese until 1981. During his incumbency. Bishop Vidal organized the Pastoral Council, and initiated the construction of the Lipa Archdiocesan Formation Center.</p>
<p>Bishop Vidal was replaced in 1981 by Bishop Mariano Gaviola, D.D. who stayed with the diocese from 1981 to 1993. He was at the helm of the archdiocese as it celebrated its 75th anniversary on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, the reins of the archdiocese were again transferred, this time to Bishop <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudencio_Rosales_b3e1.html" title="Gaudencio Rosales">Gaudencio Rosales</a>, a native of Batangas City. He was ordained priest in Lipa in 1958, became Auxiliary Bishop of Manila in 1974, served as bishop in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaybalay.html" title="Malaybalay">Malaybalay</a> in 1982, and on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> he was elected Archbishop of Lipa.</p>
<p>With the death of <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jaime_Cardinal_Sin_bd40.html" title="Jaime Cardinal Sin">Jaime Cardinal Sin</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, there was a vacancy at the Holy See of Manila. <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudencio_Cardinal_Rosales_61ba.html" title="Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales">Archbishop Gaudencio Rosales</a> was chosen by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> to be the new <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>.

<p>As the <strong class="selflink">Archdiocese of Lipa</strong> changed hands over the years, changes too were happening to its territorial jurisdiction over certain areas. These were proud moments for the archdiocese, when a number of provinces had acquired the capability to stand on their own. Thus in 1936 <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental_Mindoro_e7d7.html" title="Oriental Mindoro">Mindoro</a> was separated and became the Apostolic Prelature of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calapan.html" title="Calapan">Calapan</a>. In 1950 <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucena.html" title="Lucena">Lucena</a> became a diocese of its own, and also in 1950 the Prelature of Infanta was created, comprising the northern part of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quezon_Province_a0f3.html" title="Quezon Province">Quezon Province</a>, Polilio and <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurora.html" title="Aurora">Aurora</a>, Laguna's turn came next and became a separate diocese in 1967, that of San Pablo. The Diocese of Boac in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marinduque.html" title="Marinduque">Marinduque</a> was created in 1977 and that of <a href="../../../g/u/m/Gumaca.html" title="Gumaca">Gumaca</a> in 1984. Both dioceses were part of the Diocese of Lucena before their establishment. In 1983 the new Apostolic Vicariate of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joseph_8013.html" title="Saint Joseph">San Jose</a> in <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occidental_Mindoro_4b12.html" title="Occidental Mindoro">Occidental Mindoro</a> was created.</p>
<p>Today the <strong class="selflink">Archdiocese of Lipa</strong> is for the province of Batangas alone. But the population has multiplied many times over. The archdiocese is divided into 6 vicariates, each headed by a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar_forane.html" title="Vicar forane">vicar forane</a> . Except for the parishes in Vicariate IV which are run by the <a href="../../../o/b/l/Oblates_of_St._Joseph_27cc.html" title="Oblates of St. Joseph">Oblates of St. Joseph</a>, all other parishes are run by the diocesan clergy. There are 49 parishes in all, served by 143 priests. 122 of them diocesan. There are 13 religious brothers, and 197 religious sisters. Catholic schools number 23, high school seminaries 2 and college seminaries 3. Two pastoral centers are being maintained.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, after much review, and meetings presided over by Archbishop Gaudencio Rosales himself, the archdiocese's vision was conceived:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A people of God called by the Father in Jesus Christ to be communities of totally developed human persons in the world, witnessing to the Kingdom of God by living the Paschal Mystery in the power of the Holy Spirit."</p>

<p>One of the main projects of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudencio_Cardinal_Rosales_61ba.html" title="Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales">Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales</a> during his stay as the Archbishop of Lipa. It eliminates the notion that only the rich can give to the needy. The concept of this program is saving at least 25 cents everyday as part of your contributions to the Pondong Batangan. The money that were collected from all the parishes in Archdiocese of Lipa are then being loaned to less fortunate families in Batangas for them to use as a starting capital for their own business. During the early years of the campaign,<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangko_Sentral_ng_Pilipinas_14b3.html" title="Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</a> sent a letter to the Archdiocese asking for them to immediately deposit the 25 centavo coins to the banks as they are having a shortage of 25 centavo coins.</p>
