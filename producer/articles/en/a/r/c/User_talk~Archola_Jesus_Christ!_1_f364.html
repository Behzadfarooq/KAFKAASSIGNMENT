<dd>Archie, I'm trying to work from the top down in this article and walked into a firestorm. (as you know) I've put a new section into the talk page to see if I can bring resolution to this paragraph, so that I can get into a fight with other Christians over "accept Jesus" 8-)</dd>

<dd>Don't worry about my doing preemptive strikes. I don't find it useful. I will first try to find the discussion over the paragraph, see what's going on and then make suggestions. I don't mind the Nicene Creed mention (all thought it doesn't get to how individuals receive salvation), since I believe it is the border line between Christian and non-Christian faiths. What I will suggest is changing "accept" to "believe" Lutherans and others really do not believe that humans have any role at all in salvation. We believe that even faith which receives salvation is a gift from God. The trick is to find language that covers our view and those of our Evangelical brethren. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 11:23, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand the need to appease people like Robsteadman in order to avoid yet another edit war, but too much prominence is being given to fringe views that in any other article would either be mentioned only in passing or not at all. While a number of people may doubt the divinity of Jesus, very few people (and no notable historians to my knowledge) claim Jesus never existed. I honestly think we shouldn't give Rob with his anti-Religion and anti-Christian agenda the time of day. His motives are clear. We've already tried the appeasement route, adding such a caveat to the scholarly-view paragraph that continues to grow. It's gone from simple lack of documents to now mentioning "similarities with various mythological figures." Based on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, we, by policy, are not even obligated to mention these small minority views, at least not in such a prominent place as the introduction in a biographical article. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 18:47, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, we're on record, with evidence on the Jesus talk page. NO need to respond to anything he says that's a repeat. When the paragraph goes into effect, we will just revert any changes and refer to this page.

<dd>When he confirms that he wants to delete "historians" I'll point out it stays in because there are historians on that list -- Paul L. Maier for one, and others such as Michael Grant to come.

<p>I also wanted to commend you personally on your boldness in standing up to Rob.

I think you have handled yourself very well, and I would go so far as to say that you have done more to forward this process than any other member. If you ever need a helping hand on any WikiProject or other collaboration, please look me up. I'd love to work with you further. (P.S. What do you think the odds are of Rob actually sitting down and shutting up now that he's essentially been told to by at least 15 Wikipedians? =P ) --<a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverykrouse_1761.html" title="User:Averykrouse">Avery W.

<p>I tell my college students the the good news about the internet is that anyone can publish on it and the bad news is that anyone can publish on it! 8-) This is especially true of the wikipedia.</p>
<p>I do not believe we are censoring when we revert people who shoot first and ask questions later. As long as we politely point people to the talk page, ask them to read the discussion and then add their two cents to the talk page, we're fine. They can say anything they want. It is the open internet and indexed by google. No one is telling them they can't say anything they want.</p>
<p>As long as we are distinct people, we have a perfect right on the wiki to revert things for good reason. This paragraph has been debated over every conceivable angle I can think of. It is likely that any edits will be done for reasons we debated. We've achieved an overwhelming majority in favor of the current text. We do not need to rehash the same arguments (in fact, if we'd resist, everyone, answering the same objections, there wouldn't be much fuel for Rob's fire. Even at two reverts a day, we have ten to Rob's two. We can ignore the same arguments.</p>
<p>Now, if someone, even Rob, brings something new, we can hear it out and debate it and come to a new consensus and adopt it.</p>
<p>The only freedom we curtail is for someone to edit without doing their homework. No self-respecting internet forum would allow this. An encyclopia should even less.</p>
<p>Remember, this recent round happened because I did just that. Until I added references to the text of the paragraph, I did not alter a single word of the paragraph until there was consensus about it. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 03:32, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Exactly why a very gentle edit summary upon revert, plus a nice, encouraging comment on the user talk page of the poor person that wanders into our hornet's nest goes a long way. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 03:46, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sorry if I jumped into this with both feet. You guys were just getting this thing nailed down. I have to confess that I am just as worked up about this as he is. He is probably a likeable chap with a big chip on his shoulder. I do object to formulating the article with the lead line being: "<b>Jesus</b> . . . held to exist by the opinion of most historians" or something like that.

<p>I am responding to your kind messages on my talk page here. I think that I have upset Mr. Steadman too much. I will let him cool down a bit. As a scholar he is being put through the mill. I find that he is much like Don Quixote tilting at windmills. BTW, I think that I have a book written in the 1930s entitled <i>Jesus: A Myth</i>. So the Revisionist Jesus-Mythers have been around for a long time. "There is nothing new under the sun" (Eccl. 1:9).

<p>Arch, I have made a new motion for a vote on the helpful addition to the second sentence of the second paragraph. I feel that this is an important matter as we are all devoted to NPOV. KHM03's addition makes this second paragraph NPOV. Please, don't clobber me: I know my friend CTSWyneken has counseled us to have no more votes.<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 23:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I post the below because Talk:Jesus seems to be locked. Comment on the voting:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've made my votes in the past. I feel that further voting may be polarizing, hence I choose to abstain. Beyond that, many should learn to respect others' points of view. After all, we do not experience another's subjectivity, so we cannot directly judge another's subjectivity. The real issue is that there are various points of view that should be explained accurately, fairly and while respecting NPOV.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>At this point, I honestly don't believe it matters. Try as I have, no one follows directions, and no one will be satisfied unless their side wins. For all I care, this whole darn vote can be chucked in the can. I'm sick and tired of it.

<p>I have appealed to User:MONGO to consider the discrimination that this affords. This is simply not fair in light of the fact that all of us are careful to be NPOV. However, despite all of our efforts we cannot free ourselves from POV no matter how we try. It must be understood that POV is not an evil thing, just all POVs need to be represented to make something NPOV, and NPOV means "neutral point of view" not "no point of view." That, at least, is my understanding of it. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 21:18, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I learned what a kah-BAHL is by listening to "Conspiracy Theory" tapes from the John Birch Society when I was a sophomore in High School. I am now a happy Missouri Democrat (moderate politically but conservative religiously). The honorable Mr. Rob Steadman, the maestro, accuses us of conspiring together to edge him out of editing this article. He kind of got the idea for this by the messages that all of us have on our talk pages. "Vote". I'm thinking that I came on too hard with them by those paragraphs about them being in denial and advocates of crack-pot scholarship. Maybe I stirred up the pot, and there is no way of turning over a new leaf. He is ignoring me with my concilatory messages that you can see for yourself on his talk page.

<p>You are correct about the LCMS rejecting the Joint Declaration between the ELCA and the Catholic Church (so did one Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger!) We have always stood with Luther on salvation by grace alone. So, as I said above, theologically we are the original Protestants. But, unlike the reformed tradition, we retained the ancient liturgy of the church, its art, music, calendar, etc. So we're (in the view of many non-Lutherans) protestants that LOOK like Catholics.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 19:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since we both seem to be talking with Jim over this, what do you know about Catholicism in relation to John 3:16?

<p>Ah, much better -- the problemn was in the diacritical marks. Wiki does not disple the rough or soft breathing marks (see the extra mark on the omega in ωςτε) -- BTW: those marks equal the presense of (rough) or lack of (soft) an english H. The biggest problem is that monogene (μονογενη) is debated as to its meaning -- mono doesn't really mean "only" in Greek.</p>
<p>I'm working on the German, but as I noted, it's a very high level of German, and if you note my user page, I noted DE-2, in other words, I can read it reasonably well, but hardly with the facility with which I can read Latin, Spanish, Portuguese and French. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 17:19, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it's going better than expected (I think I was just tired yesterday, and fighhting bronchitis doesn't help -- robbed my brain of oxygen&#160;;). Besides, I didn't come unarmed -- I have one of the best German-English dictionaries on the planet, the 1400 page Cassel's German Dictionary. As soon as I get done the second section, I'm going to start posting it on a separate page of my user space (unless you think I should wait just to heighten the anticipation. &#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Oh, BTW, can you send me the site you got the Greek version from? My version has no diacriticals, and they are very important to the meaning of the word. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 18:22, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, I'll go check and see if there's a cite for the site. As far as I know I have the newest version of IE explorer -- in fact I just upgraded it two weeks ago to allow for tabbing (it allows you to open multiple pages within one IE launch, rather than launching another copy of IE to get a second or third page). Maybe it's something in my settings. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 18:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm too busy translaing to hit the talk page, but the Wiki Jogn 3:16 page includes this, which would have benefited part of last nights conversation with Jim Wie: "The various translations differ on whether this is a direct quote of Jesus or a comment of the narrator of the Gospel."</dd>
<dd>Sadly, the difference in meaning is not gone into. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 19:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. Because Jim contests something doesn't make it not a majority view. 2. Good point. 3. The article is meant to provide easy-to-understand information to a lay person. This verse does that better than most any other verse. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 22:23, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree we have to avoid the slipperly slope into a Christianity article, but I think the fact that John 3:16 focuses solely on Jesus as Saviour makes it completely relevant. "For God so love the world he gave his <i>only begotten Son</i>..." I honestly fail to see why someone would object to mentioning this verse, attributed as a direct quote from Jesus. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 03:04, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But why are we even having this discussion? Why is the verse being objected to? Really it seems to be to be a nonissue. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a></p>
<p>I see your point, but the verse is in no way linked as if it provides a complete account of Christianity. It is located as a (see this) link immediately following the sentence on Jesus as Savior, and demonstrates very generally how he saves one, that a person will <i>not perish by have everlasting life</i>. I know of no majority Christian group that would disagree with this verse and find deleting it quite superfluous. It seems as if people have no real objections other than that they have a personal preference for another verse. If someone will show me what Christian groups in the majority deny the correctness of John 3:16, then by all means remove it. But frankly I believe there are none and people are making an issue where there clearly is not one. Really it seems to me that the ulterior motive here is to remove a verse on the grounds some feel is proselytizing or supporting trinitarianism where it clearly is not. Secondly, see my above response about the salvation sentence. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 17:00, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jesus#One_will_or_3.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jesus#One_will_or_3.3F" rel="nofollow">this</a> pretty much just confirmed the above for me. Jim is clearly a nontrinitarian and is going to do everything he can to prevent us from representing the trinitarian view fully. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 17:05, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But predestination is really irrelevent to this debate. If one is predestined to attain salvation, he would be predestined to <i>accept</i> it. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 18:52, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, <i>predestination</i> comes before acceptance. Acceptance comes before salvation. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 22:14, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK good point, but I think that reflects more on the limitations of the English language than the theology. The sentence itself says <i>acceptance of Jesus as Saviour is necessary to attain salvation</i>. Now, I personally vehemently disagree with the doctrine of predestination, but nonetheless was taught in a Lutheran school as a child and have many Calvinist friends, so I'm exposed to a wide variety of views concerning the subject. That said, God may have predestined someone to be saved, and yes the gift is offered then accepted, but one cannot <b>attain</b> salvation, the gift, without first accepting it, correct? The sentence does not say one must accept salvation to be offered it! —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 03:30, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please see an alternative salvation sentence I adapted from the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html#Aiden.2FArchola_Compromise_Revision_4" title="Talk:Jesus">here</a>. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 21:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you mind archiving some of the stagnant discussions on the Jesus page? I've been doing a lot of research on the Catholic views of salvation, particularly in relation to whether or not the current 2nd paragraph's sentence, "acceptance of Jesus as Saviour is necessary to attain salvation" is in compliance with Catholic teachings on salvation. I'd like to post this but I'm OCD'ing about the disarrary of the talk page. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><b>Aiden</b></a> 01:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
