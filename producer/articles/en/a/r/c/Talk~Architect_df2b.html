Not all architects can be classified in those categories...</p>
<p>The stub definition still needs some more info to flesh this out into a proper stub so that the list can be moved to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_architects.html" title="List of notable architects">List of notable architects</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>
<p>I think the convention is (correct me if I missed something) that the name of the profession (<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dramatist.html" title="Dramatist">dramatist</a>, etc) is a brief intro and then a list of people in that category, rather than needing a list titled <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_architects.html" title="List of notable architects">List of notable architects</a> which seems cumbersome. --David Levinson</p>
<p>That's not the convention, that's just the way things start. One could write a great deal on any profession and the quasi-convention <i>is</i> to have lists named lists. Lists are not encyclopedic and the only place these lists would be linked is from the article on the profession anyway. For example, if someone were reading an article about <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_96e4.html" title="Frank Lloyd Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> that said he was an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a>, the natural thing for that person to expect upon clicking on the link to the article "architect" would be an article explaining what an architect <i>is</i>, not a list. A list does not an article make. Furthermore, lists should not be named as if they were articles -- that is, unless the only thing on that page is a list. Lists are also <i>inherently</i> plural so having them on a properly named (read: singularized) page title is counter-intuitive and confuses newcommers about our naming conventions. Unfortunetely, most of the profession articles are little more than just lists so moving the list (the only real content of the page) at this time doesn't make sense until a proper stub for the profession article can first be made (breaking things up is also another quasi-convention around here). Sorry, I'm always looking ahead about 20 steps in the process, cross-checking those changes with established conventions and working-through exceptions. In this process I often fail to explain my reasoning for doing the first few steps. Cheers! --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a>, Wednesday, May 29, 2002</p>

Unlike publications for professionals such as doctors, lawyers and engineers, the official publication of the American Institute of Architects can be easily understood by a bright lay person, as most of the content is simply fashionable imagery.</i></p>
<p>I have to vehemently disagree with this statement. Are you only reviewing cutesy, pretty periodicals that come off of the newsstand? Or are you a professional with some sort of justification?</p>
<p>I have to think that you are the former, because all of the architects I have worked for have been architectural engineers, bound by their clients to produce a safe structure. Structures' benefits to the well-being of the public is a highly subjective point to try to summarily evaluate, and everyone will have a different feeling about it.</p>
<p>Our society's letigious nature seems to preclude too many grave errors going so unnoticed so as to justify a statement such as yours. If you have a serious problem with the well-being of those affected by structures in your area, then be present at the pulic meetings in which these builders must answer questions like this and others before granting permission for them to erect said structures.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltbluetony_df3f.html" title="User:Cobaltbluetony">CobaltBlueTony</a> for your comments. Unfortunately, you assumed incorrectly.</p>
<p>First, it is my understanding that wikipedia is a collaborative effort. If you are some sort of self-appointed judge, jury and editor-in-chief, please notify those in charge of the wikipedia project so that others don't waste their time and so that the public won't be misled into believing the effort to represent some sort of concensus opinion or broad group effort.</p>
<p>Second, many professions have legitimate controversies within them, and I find your procilivity to edit other people's work because you think you are "right" to be highly offensive and grossly disrespectful. It is typical of the sort of snotty, upper crust, stuffed shirt, blowhard mentality of which this profession needs to divest itself, no?</p>
<p>Third, I am a professional architect, licensed in the litigious USA and have been working in and around the profession for many years, but agree that there may, in fact, be some regional variations in practices, viewpoints and conventions around the world. Since this encyclopedia is intended for public consumption, however, I think it is worth including some perspective that is slightly broader than the way a narrow segment of the profession in one part of the world chooses to narrowly portray, (mis)understand and (mis)represent itself.</p>
<p>Fourth, the "cutesy, pretty periodicals" that I am referring to are available only to industry professionals and are delivered to my mailbox. Architectural Record is the "Official Publication" of the American Institute of Architects, and I, frankly, am embarrassed and disgusted by the gross idiocy and blatant promotional aspect of its content. Nevertheless, I think it accurately reflects the mindset of its professional readers.</p>
<p>Fifth, if you would like to engage in some discussion about appropriate content for this entry, or the way certain thoughts have been organized or presented, I would welcome your input so that we can arrive at content that is mutually agreeable. On the other hand, I could easily challenge some of the basic premises here and find grounds for deletion of your sincere efforts. At this point, I will show some respect, excercise restraint and refrain from so doing.</p>
<p>For example: Architecture isn't really "science", is it? Science uses an investigative methodology to establish facts (or generally accepted principles of nature), usually by research. Name one Pritzker-Prize winning architect that has had a single research paper published in a scientific journal. Have you or any of your employers ever published a research paper in a scientific journal? Name a Law of Architecture, such as "Corbusier's Law" that is actually true and that serves as a foundation for further research, investigation or discussion. Books of architecture ARE cutesy and pretty and are usually sold in the same stores as are books of art, not books of science or engineering.</p>
<p>Sixth, as you point out, all of the "architects" you have worked for are actually engineers, and engineering is a decidedly different profession and has a different emphasis. Personally, I have never worked for an architect that did not shield their practice from litigation by hiring qualified engineers to perform often difficult and complex structural analyses required for seismic safety. Suing an architect in the USA is actually a complicated issue--no matter how bad their work product is--because it can give rise to much more (economically) damaging suits from the construction contractor as a result. As in, "See? The design and the drawings were so bad the client even sued his own consultant--that's why the roof leaked!" So clients tend not to go there, and architects tend to hire "specialists" for absolutely everything that lets them get away with gross breaches of professional ethics. But I digress.</p>
<p>Mr. Tony, I would be most appreciative if you would kindly restore the material that you edited and engage in some constructive dialog as to how the concepts I expressed can be reasonably included in the brief space available, because I believe they factually supportable. If you don't believe they are factually supportable, please provide some parameters or threshold so that other participants may be able to evaluate whether or not my arguments persuasively address your objections and concerns. I would be interested in comments from others as well.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<dd>&#160;&#160;The purpose of an encyclopedia is not to present every single point of view. A main article, such as this is, is not intended to present points of view. In fact, upon reviewing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy</a>, many editors will conclude that your acrimonious, divisive statements do not belong in this article at all. I agree that the <a href="../../../a/i/a/AIA_1948.html" title="AIA">AIA</a> definitely has its own agenda, and that there are many architects out there that do not view as their own responsibility many results of their own process. However, there are architects and architectural engineers (licensed as architects as well) who are involved in continuing education, and employ engineers, not as consultants, but as members and even partners of their firms. Your statements are pejorative without sufficient evidence to support them; such information is not meant to be part of a main article. I would suggest collecting your evidence, facts, resources, etcetera, and write an article about this particular topic with the most neutral point of view that you can muster. Or, find an editor who can do this for you if you find it difficult to separate your conclusions about the facts, which obviously come from your personal attachment to the issue. Objectivity is crucial in Wikipedia, and I gather from your words that this might prove to be difficult to you. - <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltbluetony_df3f.html" title="User:Cobaltbluetony">CobaltBlueTony</a> 02:37, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Tony, I retracted a long-winded rant</b>. Instead, I made some minor revisions to the entry for two purposes: One is to acknowledge the long-established role of the architect in aesthetic decisions; the other to include the fact that architects actually make decisions. I believe this strengthens the aspect of "involvement", acknowledges realities within the profession about aesthetics, and does so in a constructive manner. If you would still like supporting references, I would refer you to the very long discussion in the entry on <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">Architecture</a>, and would welcome any comments about the edit I made, including substance, grammar, and syntax.

<p>Perhaps it'd be good to develop some sort of dialogue for what constitutes "notable" to prevent budding architecture students everywhere from just listing their own schools. May be someone with way more motivation than I have right now can rewrite the section in terms of the development of architecture as a profession and an academic fields, noting the "hotspots" along the way. (That is, as a text instead of a list.) For example, a discussion on the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in the 1800s (formation of the professional arch. school), MIT in the late 1800s/early 1900s (role, as the first professional school in the U.S., in legitimizing architectural practice as a profession), Harvard &amp; IIT in the 1930s-50s (introduction of Gropius &amp; Mies and Modernism in the academic context to the U.S.), Berkeley &amp; the AA in the 1960s (creation of the 4+2 BA/M.Arch system and Archigram, respectively), Princeton &amp; Cooper Union in the late 1970s-1980s (pedagogical innovation, <i>Education of an Architect</i>), Columbia and Sci-Arc in the 1990s (rise of formalism, implementation and influence of new computer tools, conceptual refocusing), etc., would be much more valuable than a list of every vaguely recognizable arch school in the world. - <a href="../../../g/k/u/User%7EGku_e4bb.html" title="User:Gku">Gku</a> 20:14, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I haven't reverted this because it could for all I know be right, but it certainly sounds unlikely - can someone with certain knowledge comment and change if necessary? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnabypage_0845.html" title="User:Barnabypage">Barnabypage</a> 15:13, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What archiotects say? Do we all klisten to accountants? Why are Architects the wiosdom and all philospohy of the world. Surely the Real Esatate developers whose money and resources these arhcitects use to foist their views are more important that the architetcs themselves? <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChivista_f827.html" title="User:Chivista">Chivista</a> 14:46, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great... a heading quoting <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne%27s_World_a596.html" title="Wayne's World">Wayne's World</a> and a very, very clever statement (that's sarcasm, by the way- hence the two "very"s) . Why if this fellow is not already an architect (or more likely, architecture student) he should consider Law school.</dd>

<p>Since Vitruvius covers instruments of war in his Ten Books on Architecture, naval architecture arguably bears intrinsic value in the art of designing and the science of building.</p>
<p>De facto, to suggest that architectural awards are given based on cultural qualities is to at once give credence to the idea that safety and the public's well-being are intrinsically rooted in their being given. The reigning professional body in the profession, the AIA, states it is the architect's prime responsibility to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. In affixation of construction documents with the architect's seal, he or she is swearing oath that the building will inherently serve these functions. As such, any award given to an architect in recognition of a building for which he or she "stamped drawings" is at once an award given on the merit of the building's safety and concern for the public's well being. Thereby, an award honoring a "safe" building would in effect undermine that which is inherently expected of the architect from the outset.</p>
<p>While I believe the nature of mainstream contemporary architectural periodicals (or any mainstream periodical for that matter) lends itself almost entirely to senseless promotion through advertisement and bias (perhaps even moreso than other professional periodicals) there is some recompense in the fact that these periodicals do for the architectural profession what medical and legal periodicals presumably do for their respective professions: discuss those issues related to the field that will strengthen circulation, that is to say, prevailing mainstream issues of the day. If one's issue is with the material between the covers of such magazines as Architectural Record (which is open to any and all willing to pay the subscription price, not solely those in the profession) perhaps it isn't the magazine that should be indicted but the architect's acceptance of what has been deemed "good" architecture, in other words, the reason contemporary mainstream architecture has achieved such noble status. Furthermore, what sets other professional periodicals apart from those concerning themselves with design is the mere fact that they discuss topics (current events, health or leagal issues, politics, social themes, etc.) that are more imminent. That is to say, health, law, news, and politics shape the ethereal world in which we live in a deeper, more intrinsic, and arguably more important way than the buildings in which we live. In architecture there is no human necessity which extends beyond a roof and four walls. The situation isn't as simple when discussing these other issues.</p>
<p>As a second-year professional and a graduate from a classical architecture school, it seems pretty clear to me how one ought to diagnose and treat the embattled profession.</p>

<p>This might just be me, but I feel that the article is better served by defining what an architect is, rather than what an architect is not. I removed the paragraph as it seems to belong on an article describing the profession of engineering. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeek_man_90b2.html" title="User:Beek man">beekman</a> 03:13, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
