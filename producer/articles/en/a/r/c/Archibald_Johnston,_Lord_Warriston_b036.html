<p>He first came into public notice in 1637, during the attempt of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> to force an Anglican-style <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgy</a> upon Scotland, when as the chief adviser of the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanter.html" title="Covenanter">covenanting</a> leaders he drew up their remonstrances. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_22.html" title="February 22">22 February</a> <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>, in reply to a royal <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proclamation.html" title="Proclamation">proclamation</a>, he read a strong protestation to an enormous multitude assembled at the town cross in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. Together with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Henderson_51a5.html" title="Alexander Henderson">Alexander Henderson</a> he was the author of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Covenant_fd8a.html" title="National Covenant">National Covenant</a> of 1638, drawing up himself the second part, which consisted in a recapitulation of all the Acts of Parliament which condemned "<a href="../../../p/o/p/Popery.html" title="Popery">popery</a>" and asserting the liberties of the Scottish church.</p>
<p>He was appointed clerk to the tables, and also clerk and afterwards <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procurator.html" title="Procurator">procurator</a> or counsel to the General Assembly held at Glasgow the same year, when he discovered and prsented several missing volumes of records. In June 1639 he took part in the negotiations leading to the Pacification of Berwick, ending the first <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops_War_a84b.html" title="Bishops War">Bishops War</a>, when his firm attitude was extremely displeasing to the king. After Charles promised a new Assembly and Parliament to settle the church question, Johnston responed by accusing him of playing for time, to which the king replied in anger "that the devil himself could not make a more uncharitable construction or give a more bitter expression"; and on Johnston's continuing his speech ordered him to be silent and declared he would speak to more reasonable men.</p>
<p>In August he read a paper before the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Scotland_b6d1.html" title="Parliament of Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a>, strongly condemning its <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prorogation.html" title="Prorogation">prorogation</a>. In the following year he was appointed to attend the general of the army and the committee, and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">23 June</a>, when the Scottish forces were preparing to invade England, he wrote to Lord Savile asking for definite support from the leading opposition peers in England and their acceptance of the National Covenant, which drew from the other side at first nothing but vague assurances. In October he was a commissioner for negotiating the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Ripon_d25c.html" title="Treaty of Ripon">Treaty of Ripon</a> and went to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. He continued after the peace to urge the punishment of the incendiaries, and especially of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stewart%2C_1st_Earl_of_Traquair_02f1.html" title="John Stewart, 1st Earl of Traquair">Traquair</a>, and in a private interview with the king strongly opposed the proposed act of general oblivion. On the king's arrival in Scotland in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1641.html" title="1641">1641</a> he led the opposition on the important constitutional point of the control of state appointments, supporting the claims of the parliament by an appeal to the state records, which he had succeeded in recovering.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Johnston%2C_Lord_Warriston_b036.html" title="Edit section: Lord of Parliament">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lord of Parliament</span></h3>
<p>In September Johnston received public thanks for his services from the Scottish parliament, and, in accordance with the policy of conciliation then pursued for a short time by the king, was appointed on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_13.html" title="November 13">13 November</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1641.html" title="1641">1641</a> a lord of session, with the title of Lord Warriston (a name derived from an estate purchased by him near Edinburgh in 1636), was <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knighted.html" title="Knighted">knighted</a>, and was given a pension of Â£200 a year. The same month he was appointed a commissioner at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster.html" title="Westminster">Westminster</a> by the parliament for settling the affairs of Scotland.</p>
<p>He was a chief agent in concluding the treaty with the English parliament in the autumn of <a href="../../../1/6/4/1643.html" title="1643">1643</a>, and was appointed a member of the Committee of Both Kingdoms in London which directed the military operations, and in this capacity went on several missions to the parliamentary generals. He took his seat early in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a> in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Assembly_5e60.html" title="Westminster Assembly">Westminster Assembly</a>, to which he had been nominated, and vehemently opposed measures tolerating independency.</p>
<p>Besides his public duties in England he sat in the Scottish parliament for the county of Edinburgh from 1643 until 1647, was speaker of the barons, and served on various committees. After the final defeat of Charles, when he had surrendered himself to the Scots, Johnston was made in October 1646 <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Advocate_c5a8.html" title="Lord Advocate">king's advocate</a>, and the same year was voted Â£3000 by the estates for his services. He continued to oppose concessions to Charles, and strongly disapproved of the Engagement concluded in 1648 by the government of the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hamilton%2C_1st_Duke_of_Hamilton_a49f.html" title="James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton">Duke of Hamilton</a> with Charles at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carisbrooke_Castle_8575.html" title="Carisbrooke Castle">Carisbrooke</a>, which, while securing little for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a>, committed the Scots to hostilities with the English Parliament and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Model_Army_f4c0.html" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a>.</p>

<p>He now became one of the leaders of the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Party_07b6.html" title="Kirk Party">Kirk Party</a> opposed to the engagement, and during the ascendancy of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engagers.html" title="Engagers">engagers</a> retired to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kintyre.html" title="Kintyre">Kintyre</a> as the guest of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyll.html" title="Argyll">Argyll</a>. He returned again after the Whiggamore Raid, met Cromwell at Edinburgh in October after the defeat of the engagers at Preston, and in conjunction with Argyll promoted the <i>Act of Classes</i>, passed on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_23.html" title="January 23">23 January</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1649.html" title="1649">1649</a>, disqualifying the royalists from holding public office. The good relations now formed with Cromwell, however, were soon broken by the king's execution, and Johnston was present officially at the proclamation of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> as king at Edinburgh, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">5 February</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1649.html" title="1649">1649</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">10 March</a> he was appointed <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Clerk_Register_6e43.html" title="Lord Clerk Register">Lord Clerk Register</a>. In May he pronounced sentence of death on <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Graham%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Montrose_052b.html" title="James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose">Montrose</a>, and he is said to have witnessed with Argyll the victim being drawn to the place of execution. He was present at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dunbar_9fbd.html" title="Battle of Dunbar">battle of Dunbar</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">3 September</a> <a href="../../../1/6/5/1650.html" title="1650">1650</a>) as a member of the committee of estates. After the defeat he urged the removal of Leslie, afterwards Lord Newark, from the command, and on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">21 September</a> delivered a violent speech in Charles' presence, attributing all the late misfortunes to the Stuarts and to their opposition to the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>.</p>
<p>After Dunbar the Committee of Estates persuaded the General Assembly that it was necessary to abandon the Act od Classes, to allow a new national army to be raised, to include supporters of the Engagement and other royalists. A resolution to this effect was immediately drawn up. Johnston, along with some of the more implacable Presbyterian, drew up a Remonstrance or Protest against this move. The Act of Classes was duly abandoned, but the division between the majority Resolutioners and the minority Protestors was to haunt the Church of Scotland for decades after.</p>
<p>In the autumn of <a href="../../../1/6/5/1656.html" title="1656">1656</a> Johnston went to London as representative of the remonstrants; and soon afterwards, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">9 July</a> <a href="../../../1/6/5/1657.html" title="1657">1657</a>, he was restored by Cromwell to his office of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Clerk_Register_6e43.html" title="Lord Clerk Register">Lord Clerk Register</a>, and on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">3 November</a> was appointed a commissioner for the administration of justice in Scotland, henceforth remaining a member of the government until the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a>. In January <a href="../../../1/6/5/1658.html" title="1658">1658</a> he was included by Cromwell in his new <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, and sat also in the upper chamber in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cromwell_1316.html" title="Richard Cromwell">Richard Cromwell</a>'s parliament.</p>

<p>Upon the latter's abdication and the restoration of the Rump, he was chosen a member of the council of state, and continued in the administration as a member of the committee of public safety. At the Restoration he was singled out for punishment. He avoided capture, escaping to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> and thence to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and was condemned to death in his absence on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">13 May</a> <a href="../../../1/6/6/1661.html" title="1661">1661</a>. In 1663, having ventured into <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, he was discovered at <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen.html" title="Rouen">Rouen</a>, and with the consent of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIV_of_France_d0a6.html" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV</a> was brought over and imprisoned in the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_London_bcf4.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>. In June he was taken to Edinburgh and confined in the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolbooth.html" title="Tolbooth">Tolbooth</a>. He was hanged on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">22 July</a> at the Market Cross, Edinburgh, the scene of many of his triumphs, and a few yards from his own house in <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Mile_6a44.html" title="Royal Mile">High Street</a>, which stood on the east side of what is now known as Warristons Close. His head was exposed on the Netherbow and afterwards buried with his body in Greyfriars churchyard.</p>

<p>Johnston was a man of great energy, industry and ability, and played a large part in the defence of the Presbyterian settlement of 1638. He was learned in Scottish law, eloquent and deeply religious. His passionate devotion to the cause of the Scottish church amounted almost to <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanaticism.html" title="Fanaticism">fanaticism</a>. According to the History by his nephew Bishop Burnet, he looked on the Covenant as the setting Christ on his throne. He had by nature no republican leanings; all the Royalists in Scotland, writes <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baillie_606d.html" title="Robert Baillie">Robert Baillie</a> as late as 1646, could not have pleaded so much for the crown and the king's just power as the chancellor and Warriston did for many days together. When, however, Presbyterianism was attacked and menaced by the sovereign, he desired, like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pym_6abd.html" title="John Pym">John Pym</a>, to restrict the royal prerogative by a parliamentary constitution, and endeavoured to found his arguments on law and ancient precedents. His acceptance of office under Cromwell hardly deserves the severe censure it has received. He stood nearer both in politics and religion to Cromwell than to the royalists, and was able to offer useful service in office. Johnston was wanting in tact and in consideration for his opponents, confessing himself that his natural temper (or rather distemper) hath been hasty and passionate. He was disliked by Charles I, and hated by Charles II, whom he rebuked for lack of commitment to the Covenants; but he was associated in private friendship and public life with Argyll.</p>

<p>He had a large family, the most famous of his sons being James Johnston (1655-1737), called secretary Johnston. Having taken refuge in Holland after his father's execution, Johnston crossed over to England in the interests of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_III_of_England_5927.html" title="William III of England">William of Orange</a> just before the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_Revolution_fc02.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of <a href="../../../1/6/8/1688.html" title="1688">1688</a>. In 1692 he was appointed one of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State%2C_Scotland_3977.html" title="Secretary of State, Scotland">secretaries for Scotland</a>, but he was dismissed from office in 1696. Under <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_England_002c.html" title="Anne of England">Anne</a>, however, he began again to take part in public affairs, and was made <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Clerk_Register_6e43.html" title="Lord Clerk Register">Lord Clerk Register</a>. Johnston's later years were passed mainly at his residence, Orleans House, <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twickenham.html" title="Twickenham">Twickenham</a>, and he died at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a> in May 1737.</p>
