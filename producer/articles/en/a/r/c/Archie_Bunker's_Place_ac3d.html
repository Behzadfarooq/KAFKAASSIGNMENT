<p><i><b>Archie Bunker's Place</b></i> is a sitcom originally broadcast on the <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> network, conceived in 1979 as a retooled version of <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_In_The_Family_6782.html" title="All In The Family">All In The Family</a></i>. While not as popular, the show maintained a large enough audience to last four seasons, ending its run in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Some sources consider it to be a separate series (i.e., a <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin-off.html" title="Spin-off">spin-off</a> of <i>All in the Family</i>), while others consider it to be a continuation of the earlier program.</p>
<p>The major difference this series had from its predecessor is that – although some of the scenes were set in the Bunker home long familiar to viewers – most of the stories were set at Archie Bunker's Place, the neighborhood tavern <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Bunker_d610.html" title="Archie Bunker">Archie Bunker</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carroll_O%27Connor_17a7.html" title="Carroll O'Connor">Carroll O'Connor</a>) purchased in 1977 (in the eighth-<a href="../../../s/e/a/Season_premiere.html" title="Season premiere">season premiere</a> of <i>All in the Family</i>). He had purchased what was then known as Kelsey's Bar from former proprietor Tommy Kelsey when Kelsey's health declined. During the premiere of <i>Archie Bunker's Place</i>, he takes on a Jewish partner, Murray Klein (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Balsam_efb8.html" title="Martin Balsam">Martin Balsam</a>) when co-owner Harry Snowden decides to sell his share of the business. Early in the first season, to increase his clientèle, Archie and Murray build a restaurant onto the bar; the additions include a separate seating area for the restaurant and a well-equipped kitchen with service window. The regular patrons are Barney Hefner, Hank Pivnak, and Mr. Van Ranseleer.</p>
<p><i>Archie Bunker's Place</i> was the sounding board for Archie's views, support from his friends, and Murray's counterpoints. Later in the series, after Murray re-marries and leaves for San Francisco, Archie hires a business partner, Gary Rabinowitz (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Gordon_a631.html" title="Barry Gordon">Barry Gordon</a>), whose views were liberal in contrast to Archie's political <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservativism.html" title="Conservativism">conservativism</a>.</p>
<p>This series was reminiscent of a <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> radio and TV sitcom called <i><a href="../../../d/u/f/Duffy%27s_Tavern_44c7.html" title="Duffy's Tavern">Duffy's Tavern</a></i> which also featured a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_collar.html" title="Blue collar">blue collar</a> tavern owner named Archie who commented on life and society with a group of colorful characters.</p>
<p><i>Archie Bunker's Place</i>, like <i>All in the Family</i> before it, was set in the borough of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. The opening credits featured a view of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensboro_Bridge_cdc8.html" title="Queensboro Bridge">Queensboro Bridge</a>, which connects <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> to Queens.</p>
<p>The theme of <i>Archie Bunker's Place</i> was "<a href="../../../t/h/o/Those_Were_The_Days_c94a.html" title="Those Were The Days">Those Were The Days</a>". It was a re-scored version of the long-familiar opening theme to <i>All in the Family,</i> sans vocals from Archie and Edith. The closing theme, "Remembering You," was a re-scored version of <i>All in the Family's</i> closing theme.</p>

<ul>
<li>Carroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker, a bigoted blue-collar worker whose ignorant stubbornness tends to cause his arguments to self-destruct. By the time of <i>Archie Bunker's Place</i>, however, the character has mellowed somewhat and is no longer as explicitly bigoted as he had been during <i>All in the Family</i>, even agreeing to go into business with a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> man.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Stapleton_98c0.html" title="Jean Stapleton">Jean Stapleton</a> continued to play Archie's wife <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Bunker_93cb.html" title="Edith Bunker">Edith Bunker</a> when <i>Archie Bunker's Place</i> premiered. The show featured Edith occasionally during the first season, but Stapleton decided to leave the series late in 1979; her character was referred to but unseen during the rest of the 1979-1980 season. The writers and producers addressed Stapleton's departure in the Season 2 premiere, explaining that Edith had died of a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a>. Archie reflected on his wife's passing, and eventually, began dating other women.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Balsam_efb8.html" title="Martin Balsam">Martin Balsam</a> as Murray Klein. Murray was Archie's Jewish partner, who held similar <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> views to Archie's son-in-law <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Stivic_446d.html" title="Michael Stivic">Michael Stivic</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Brisebois_857a.html" title="Danielle Brisebois">Danielle Brisebois</a> as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Mills_%28All_in_the_Family%29_6197.html" title="Stephanie Mills (All in the Family)">Stephanie Mills</a>. Stephanie, a 10-year-old girl who is Jewish, is taken in by Archie and Edith after her father (Edith's cousin), a chronic drunk and unemployed Floyd Mills (played by Ben Slack), had abandoned her during the final season of <i>All in the Family</i>. Stephanie loved to sing and dance, and her talents were showcased in several episodes.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/e/l/Celeste_Holm_2c2e.html" title="Celeste Holm">Celeste Holm</a> (as Estelle Harris, Stephanie's wealthy grandmother, who would often be at odds with Archie over his rearing of Stephanie)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Melvin_8e26.html" title="Allan Melvin">Allan Melvin</a> as Barney Hefner, one of Archie's best friends and a regular at the bar. Their friendship was first established in 1972 during an episode of "All in the Family." He was then married to a woman named Mabel but Mabel died (somewhere around the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> season) and Barney married Blanche (played by <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estelle_Parsons_ede5.html" title="Estelle Parsons">Estelle Parsons</a>), a friend of Edith's. Blanche left Barney numerous times, always for repairmen. Barney divorced her in 1979, but Blanche was the only one to gain anything out of the divorce, with Barney being ordered to pay alimony.</li>
<li>Danny Dayton as Hank Pivnik, another regular and good buddy of Archie's. First appeared in 1977 on "All in the Family." Hank disappeared with no explanation given afer the 1979-1980 season.</li>
<li>Bill Quinn as Mr. Edgar Van Ranseleer, a blind patron and regular at the bar. He was almost never referred to by his first name. First appearance dates to 1978 on "All in the Family."</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Wingreen_e62b.html" title="Jason Wingreen">Jason Wingreen</a> as Harry Snowden, Archie's former business partner who continued to work at the tavern as a bartender. Another holdover character from "All in the Family," which Wingreen joined in 1977.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Alvarez_47c1.html" title="Abraham Alvarez">Abraham Alvarez</a> and Joe Rosario as Jose Perez and Raoul Rosario, two Latin American immigrants employed as assistant cooks at Archie's bar.

<li><a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Meara_4f26.html" title="Anne Meara">Anne Meara</a> as Veronica Rooney (1979-1982), the cook at Archie Bunker's Place. She often made wisecracks and gave Archie a hard time. She insisted that Archie also hire her openly <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> nephew Fred as a waiter to help him pay for law school. She was an alcoholic and deep down pined to get back with her ex-husband, Carmine (who appeared in a few episodes and was played by Meara's real-life husband, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Stiller_0b52.html" title="Jerry Stiller">Jerry Stiller</a>), but knew it wasn't going to happen. Meara appeared sporadically throughout the show's final season.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Meek_b8be.html" title="Barbara Meek">Barbara Meek</a> portrayed Ellen Canby (1980-1982). Ellen was a black housekeeper who was hired by Archie. She also took care of Stephanie, and kept Archie's views in check. Though Archie still harbored some resentment toward black people by the time she arrived on the scene, he deeply respected Ellen and was grateful for the job she did in helping to raise Stephanie.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/n/Denise_Miller_a591.html" title="Denise Miller">Denise Miller</a>, who joined the cast in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_television.html" title="1981 in television">1981</a> as Archie's 18-year-old niece, Barbara Lee 'Billie' Bunker. Billie – who worked as a waitress at Archie Bunker's Place, was the daughter of Archie's long-estranged brother, Fred. Her principal love interest was Gary Rabinowitz (see below).</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Gordon_a631.html" title="Barry Gordon">Barry Gordon</a>, another <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_television.html" title="1981 in television">1981</a> addition to the cast, as Archie's Jewish accountant Gary Rabinowitz. Gary would quickly begin dating Billie, who was 15 years younger than he was. Just like Mike Stivic and Murray Klein before him, Gary's liberal beliefs often contrasted with those of conservative Archie.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Struthers_9e36.html" title="Sally Struthers">Sally Struthers</a> returned as Archie's daughter, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Stivic_badd.html" title="Gloria Stivic">Gloria Stivic</a>, for a few episodes. In addition to "Thanksgiving Reunion," Struthers guested in the 1982 two-part episode, "Gloria Comes Home," where she returns home from <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> with her son, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Stivic_5730.html" title="Joey Stivic">Joey</a> after divorcing Mike (who had run off to a commune). The character eventually moved on to her own <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin-off.html" title="Spin-off">spin-off</a> series, <i><a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_%28TV_series%29_7c53.html" title="Gloria (TV series)">Gloria</a></i>.

<p>Unlike the preceding show, <i>Archie Bunkers Place</i> was not videotaped before a live audience, with the exception of a few select episodes (including "Thanksgiving Reunion" and "Archie Alone")<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup>. Instead, the show was shot on a closed set with multiple cameras, with the best takes being edited together. The finished product was then shown to live audiences attending tapings of <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Day_at_a_Time_ea7d.html" title="One Day at a Time">One Day at a Time</a></i>, thus providing real laughter for the show <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup>. Over the end credits, O'Connor announced "<i>Archie Bunker's Place</i> was played to a studio audience for a live response," a practice which had originated in the last season of "All In the Family."</p>

<p>The series' most notable episode among critics was "Archie Alone" (the 1980-1981 <a href="../../../s/e/a/Season_premiere.html" title="Season premiere">season premiere</a>). In that episode, viewers learn that Edith had died of a stroke a month earlier (<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Stapleton_98c0.html" title="Jean Stapleton">Jean Stapleton</a> had resigned from her role), and Archie refuses to grieve. His refusal to let go of his emotions takes its toll on the Stephanie, until one day Archie sees Edith's slippers while in their bedroom. Archie finally breaks down and cries. Later, after a talk with Stephanie, he agrees to take her to visit Edith's grave. Notably, the British TV series <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Sickness_and_in_Health_a296.html" title="In Sickness and in Health">In Sickness and in Health</a></i>, the continuation of <i><a href="../../../t/i/l/Till_Death_Us_Do_Part_121f.html" title="Till Death Us Do Part">Till Death Us Do Part</a></i> on which All in the Family was based, had a similar episode in which Edith's British counterpart <a href="../../../e/l/s/Else_Garnett_06e8.html" title="Else Garnett">Else Garnett</a> died from natural causes. This was not a result of one series copying the other; both shows were forced to write these deaths in for coincidental reasons.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first season episode, "Thanksgiving Reunion," marked the final time the original ensemble from "All in the Family" – O'Connor, Stapleton, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Struthers_9e36.html" title="Sally Struthers">Sally Struthers</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Reiner_ca62.html" title="Rob Reiner">Rob Reiner</a> – appeared together. In that episode, Mike announces that he has lost his job as college professor after his participation in nude protest of a proposed nuclear power plant becomes public. This puts a further strain on his already troubled marriage to Gloria (who also admits she participated in the protest), and will foreshadow the Stivics' imminent divorce.</p>
<p>Later, comedian <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Rickles_279c.html" title="Don Rickles">Don Rickles</a> guest starred as a crusty boarder named Al Snyder, who rented a room from Archie's friend and neighbor Barney, whose wife Blanche had left him sometime earlier. Highlights of this episode are exchanges combining Rickles' insult humor and his character's curmudgeonly disposition with Archie's sincere but misguided efforts to resolve disputes between Snyder and Barney ("Okay, there whaddyacallit, you and me's gotta have a talk." "Hey, I don't wanna talk to you; take a hike." "Don't tell me to take a hike; I ain't goin' anywheres."). Eventually, the Rickles character is exhausted by the constant chatter and decides to rest ("I need a nap. When I wake up, Barney, I'll give you back your bathrobe. You can tear in half and use one half as a bed for your dog and the other half to clean out your dirty oven."). The Rickles character drifts off to sleep and dies. The episode ends with Barney pondering whether he'll wind up like Mr. Snyder: "Sore at the world, 'cause I'm all alone."</p>
