<p>First, strictly speaking, I didn't delete the article-I tagged it with a speedy deletion tag, which requests an administrator to review the article for deletion. An administrator then agreed that the article should be deleted, you can see who that was by looking at the page's deletion log.</p>
<p>The reason I tagged the article, however, was that it addressed the subject in quite superlative tones ("famous" and the like), but provided very little source material on her (much of it was on her parents and mentioned her only in passing). The article would have to be written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> tone and show how the subject is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> by the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biography notability guidelines</a>. If you have some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> which address her more in depth, I can have a look at it and help you in writing an article if one is warranted. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 23:24, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great - now we are getting somewhere. So - the removal of famous is not difficult to do - however, if you would like more source material that is better than a. Wilkepedia on her Mother, and NY Times on her Father, what would you like? There are hundreds of links to her publications. Do you want these? There are links to her work but these are commercial so I thought better not to post these. When you say reliable sources, I ask - what is more reliable than the NY Times? Please be more specific. Because of her geniology, I could list hundreds of source and I just don't want to waste my time or yours.</p>

<dd>I removed the speedy tag; when whether or not an article claims significance is in dispute, it's best to at least have a fuller debate, so that may happen, but I'm not nominating it right now. I think, in all honesty, if you can just give the basics of why she's a <i>significant</i> artist, that would help. Right now, the references are bad, because they basically don't back up anything in the article: the NYT link, for instance, only establishes who her father is, and Wikipedia articles are generally not considered reliable sources. But then, <a href="../../../e/p/_/WP%7EEP_8f86.html" title="WP:EP">articles don't have to be perfect right away.</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 23:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The NY Times would be a great source-however, all the NY Times piece verifies is, basically, that she <i>exists</i>, and who her parents were. That's not enough for someone to be <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notable biographically</a>. If she's published a good deal of work, that would go a long way toward establishing notability, but the best way to establish it is to find good sources which are <i>about</i> her, and not by her or someone associated by her. Those are the sources we can build good articles from. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 23:42, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't focus so much on who her parents are. Basically, even very famous children (<a href="../../../s/u/r/Suri_Cruise_64f5.html" title="Suri Cruise">Suri Cruise</a> comes to mind) are typically covered only in their parents' articles, and are usually just worth a mention. If this person is a notable artist in her own right, that's what needs to be established, and it would be good if you could find reliable sources that establish it. What I mean by notability is basically outlined at either <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or possibly <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> (artists are kind of like academics). One thing that would be good would be to find a list of her exhibitions, people can judge from that whether she's an important artist or a typical struggling one. What I mean by "reliable sources" is outlined at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but roughly, we're looking for something someone has written for a print publication, or an online one that has dedicated writers and a good reputation. We're also looking for sources to be independent, so something like her personal website is not a good source. To back up that she has exhibited in various places you might try to find mentions on the websites of the galleries or museums; that would be considered reliable. The best thing, though, would be if you could find articles written specifically about her in reliable press. I wouldn't ask for the deletion debate to occur, though, until you're ready to present your best evidence. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 23:56, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just one quick point, which is that since Wikipedia aims to be a tertiary source, articles should not be based on primary sources (most of the time, at least -- see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, where this is discussed). An article thoroughly based on <i>primary</i> sources would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which is disallowed on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 01:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

HI - yes, this fits. However, I wonder how much this effects the American usage. The word Jewelry is mainly spelled Jewelry in most common publications. The German and English ones spell it the way it is spelled here. Your thoughts?</p>
<p>Also - how can I look into being an editor for this topic? Thanks Archie Martin 02:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchiemartin_0cd2.html" title="User:Archiemartin">Archiemartin</a></p>

<dd>Hello there. Please answer in my talk page if necessary. Apparently, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Category:Jewelry" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Category:Jewelry" rel="nofollow">Category:Jewelry</a> was deleted according to a discussion. And it seems everything was moved to Jewellery. No idea why, you can ask around at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_7d72.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion</a> to see if anyone there knows. Since I am not English, but instead Spanish native, I don't really care about it&#160;:-) I guess it has to do with the fact most spelling here is US oriented. As for editor, just click the "edit this page" tab in articles you want to contribute, add the information you want and save the page. With time, you will be able to see who are the ones who contribute there the most, ask them if there is some WikiProject or similar related to Jewels, and get to know more about those topics.

That is great news. I will go after that area and see what I can find out.</p>
<p>IN the meantime -- do you think you could nominate me to be an administrator?</p>

<p>It appears the page is again flagged for deletion. I do not support this, as work is ongoing, but as I did not place the tag and am not an administrator I am not permitted to remove it. I have saved the talk page discussion in my userspace <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_sandbox2_2_e104.html" title="User:Seraphimblade/sandbox2/2">here</a> so that it can be continued in the event the page is deleted. (By the way, if you stick around I'll watch you for a possible admin nomination at some point, but you wouldn't have a chance yet. Most users want to see several months' experience and several thousand edits in a variety of areas of the encyclopedia and discussions on its policies, as well as the ability to remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> at all times.

<p>Hi, Archiemartin, and welcome to Wikipedia!

<p>WP procedure is a little complicated. The article was first nominated for speedy deletion. It should not have been, as that process is supposed to be used only for obviously uncontroversal items. Problem is that there are only a few hours to contest it, which creates problems if people abuse it.You caught it with hangon, and that is sufficient. But if it ever does get deleted, you can request undeletion--the speedy explains how. For any article so see there other than your own, you can remove the tag yourself and give an explanation.</p>
<p>In AfD the procedure takes 5 days, but if within a day or two everyone has voted the same way, it can be closed early. If too few people vote in the 5 days, the discussion is usually continued another 5. (And the decision can be appealed, but that starts getting complicated and really cumbersome.) It should end tonight. I'm glad you kept with it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 20:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>DGG - thanks for the heads up. I am hoping that this gets kept tonight. I really want to focus my energies on writing more articles in this category. My next subject, Dorie Nossiter is dead, so I am hoping that will not be as much of a headache as this one has been. I want this kept. I will keep with it, but it would really be nice to get this finalized. Since I kisy looked at it is after midnight, does this mean, I have to just keep on waiting and checking? Also - since I counted more keeps, (albeit a few were "weak keeps" that I rebutted, I do see consensus.

<dd>I am glad to be appreciated but the only way to avoid too much emotional investment in an article is to work on several at a time. Sometimes one will not work out. (PS, it's not measured by GMC or other clock time, but when someone gets to do it. There's a day or two variation. ) And it is only necessary to reply on your page or my page, not both.

<dd>Thanks for your note. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sock puppet (internet)">Sock puppet (internet)</a> may help, but the definition on Wikipedia is a bit broader than the one on usenet. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> says: "Do not use multiple accounts to create the illusion of greater support for an issue, to mislead others, or to circumvent a block. Do not ask your friends to create accounts to support you or anyone else." The second sentence, strictly speaking, is describing "meat puppetry". Wikipedia is indeed full to the brim with jargon, but the internet as a whole tends to be like that, it's just different jargon in different places.</dd>
<dd>As far as a new article goes, I usually write mine in a sandbox. Not the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a>, but a page under my user page. So, for example, you can write an article on Dorrie Nossiter, and see how it looks as you go along, by putting it at User:Archiemartin/Dorrie Nossiter, or by creating a new page at <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchiemartin_Sandbox_8139.html" title="User:Archiemartin/Sandbox">User:Archiemartin/Sandbox</a> and reuse it for all your work in progress. The only difference with a sandbox is that you don't add categories (like Category:American jewellers or whatever). Any templates, or images, or formatting, looks just the same. I link all of mine from my user page (you can see that on <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">User:Angusmclellan</a>) so that I remember what I'm working on. An example sandbox would be <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_Queen_Victoria_Jubilee_Institute_for_Nurses_bf12.html" title="User:Angusmclellan/Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute for Nurses">User:Angusmclellan/Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute for Nurses</a>.

<p>Hi Archie.</p>
<p>I wouldn't necessarily say I have any issues with you. I just had noticed what I thought appeared to be odd behavior and wanted to get outside input on how it should be handled. I wasn't sure if it was appropriate to directly accuse someone of sockpuppetry without trying to verify it first or not.</p>
<p>Basically, <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppetry</a> is editing under multiple accounts for any variety of reasons, in this case...for the purpose of voting and other shows of support.</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, you created and used accounts (Drregus, Bernardola) and your IP address (207.237.49.43 claiming the name jamjam) to add more "votes" on the AfD for Suz Andreasen. This is generally frowned upon, by some much more so than others.</p>
<p>Anyway...the AfD would have passed in either case, but I wanted someone else to look into the votes.</p>
<p>It looks like you are motivated and educated. I think you have a lot to offer Wikipedia. I just wanted to make sure you continued on the right foot.</p>

<dd>You've added a fair use license, so the image is now licensed. However, the use of an image under fair use requires a <a href="../../../f/u/r/WP%7EFUR_13d9.html" title="WP:FUR">fair use rationale</a> and information on why it's not replaceable. Also, the image must be used on Wikipedia, as fair use orphans can be deleted ("Use it or lose it") -- this is because orphanbot removed it from an article. You can restore it to that article. I've removed the no license tags and marked the other problem that now exist. Also, you said this is from the artist's spouse? Why can't the artist license the image themself? How are you related to them? Ideally, we want freely licensed images here at Wikipedia. If possible, the artist should be willing to license it under a free license.

<dd>You keep saying "these images are in the public domain", but just because they're on a website, doesn't make them in the public domain. For this image, the website you provided as source specifically says "Copyright 2006, 2007, all rights reserved" which means it can't be in the public domain, so fair use is the only route to go here. I think your rationale should provide something about if these jewelry pieces are available in a museum? Are they only sold on the internet? Are they only held privately and not worn by public figures? You seem to be saying that this jewelry peice is just to show an example of their work, is it possible to find/create an image of any of their work to be fine? If you answer all these, I would be fine with your removal of the tag (or you can contact me to do it).</dd>
<dd>As for the other images, if you're getting them from a website, that doesn't mean they're public domain. If the images were taken/published before 1922 in the US, then they may already be public domain. However, I would assume they weren't. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a> may by of some use to this direction. If not, the fair use route would still apply, and this would be an easier sell than the jewelry pieces since she has died. Good luck, and ask me if you need more help or have more questions. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 23:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see you uploaded another copy of this image with a tag saying that the image is public domain when it obviously isn't, so I deleted it. The truth is, we just may not be able to use that image on Wikipedia. Too bad, but there it is. If you really want some decoration for that article, you'll have to find a legitimately free image. If you can, maybe you could take your own picture of some of Suz Andreasen's work and upload that? Or if you can't, you could write to Suz Andreasen (or her website) and ask them to agree to give Wikipedia some images under a free license? You can look at <a href="../../../b/o/i/Wikipedia%7EBoilerplate_requests_for_permission_1da3.html" title="Wikipedia:Boilerplate requests for permission">Wikipedia:Boilerplate requests for permission</a> for some sample emails if you want somewhere to start. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 02:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think asking for the image to be released freely is the best option. If you get permission, forward it to the address on <a href="../../../s/u/c/Wikipedia%7ESuccessful_requests_for_permission_22f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Successful requests for permission">Wikipedia:Successful requests for permission</a> and re-upload the image saying permission granted to release into GFDL (or whatever free license), and the OTRS folks will post that permission was received to license the image under that license. An image in a "public" catalog may still be copyrighted. When asking for permission, be sure to link to where it will be used (ie, in an article about the artist) so they may be flattered enough to agree. Sure sure to mention that an image of their work (jewelry) cannot begin to impede on their work, as the digital medium cannot compare to the 3D world (or something along the lines). I'd give a few weeks for a reply before giving up and we can try something else, such as you taking a picture, like Mango mentioned. Good luck! --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 16:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since English is only my second (third actually) language and I use a bastardized version of it, I see no inconvenient to respell it the american way, my only concern per <a href="../../../e/n/g/WP%7EENGVAR_2a74.html" title="WP:ENGVAR">WP:ENGVAR</a> was the inconsistancy between the title of the article and the body of the text. Now that it's said, it is customary to follow the spelling of the first main contributor and if you perused the article's talk page, you saw that the question came before and no consensus was reached... I suggest, if it isn't done yet, to bring back the subject there before changing anything, see if it would upset some users and discuss the changes in depth with them.

<ol>
<li>What you want to get out of adoption?</li>

<p>Also, please contact me at anytime for any reason. You can't possible bug me enough.

<p>Mecu - thank you. I am grateful.</p>
<p>I will answer your Q&amp;A Below.</p>
<ol>
<li>What you want to get out of adoption?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am really seeking someone to help me learn the ropes more on WP. I am a pretty good editor, writer, researcher but my weak areas as you know are image copyright rule as well as the vast areas within WP and how to find them.</p>
<ol>
<li>What you want to accomplish here at Wikipedia?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to edit and write many articles for the Jewelry category, help implement the needed growth in the category of jewelry, art history and perhaps become and administrator. I think that is more than enough goals for now!:)</p>
<ol>
<li>What you like to do here on Wikipedia?</li>
</ol>
<p>I enjoy editing and also learning more.</p>
<ol>
<li>What are your problems at Wikipedia?</li>
</ol>
<p>English vs. American spelling and also just getting a response from posts in large public areas.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have any specific problems or questions I can answer now.</li>
</ol>
<p>None now - but I am sure I will have more in the future!</p>
