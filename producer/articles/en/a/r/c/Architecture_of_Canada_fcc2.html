<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_Canada_fcc2.html" title="Edit section: Climate and geography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Climate and geography</span></h2>
<p>Canada's geography is highly diverse, and there are thus important differences in architecture. In most of Canada building materials are abundant, the price of lumber and stone are low. The major exception are the prairie and the far north, where wood is in short supply. In the early history of the prairies the shortage of wood led to farm houses built of <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sod.html" title="Sod">sod</a> and urban structures to be far more frequently built of stone. In modern times the transportation systems has made most building materials easily available on the prairies, and today lumber is as standard as in the rest of the country. In the far north transportation costs of all goods are extremely high, and any construction project is expensive.</p>
<p>For the most part Canada is secure from major <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_disasters.html" title="Natural disasters">natural disasters</a> that affect the architecture of other nations. However, the Canadian climate needs to be taken into account for every structure. All buildings need to be well insulated to protect their inhabitants against the deadly cold of the long winters. Buildings must be designed to survive the repeated cycle of freezing and thawing that can shatter stone and move buildings off their foundations. In most of Canada, buildings must also be able to survive the heavy weight of snow, which can collapse certain structures. In coastal British Columbia, the region's heavy rainfall is a factor in weatherproofing buildings, and ignoring it can have expensive consequences.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_Canada_fcc2.html" title="Edit section: First Nations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Nations</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the arrival of Europeans the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Nations_0096.html" title="First Nations">First Nations</a> lived in a wide array of structures. The semi-nomadic peoples of the Maritimes, Quebec, and Northern Ontario, such as the <a href="../../../m/i/27/Mi%27kmaq.html" title="Mi'kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cree.html" title="Cree">Cree</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquin.html" title="Algonquin">Algonquin</a> generally lived in <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigwam.html" title="Wigwam">wigwams</a>. These were wood framed structures, covered with an outer layer of bark, reeds, or woven mats. In the Northeast United States the most common form of the wigwam was a dome, in Canada a cone shape was more common. These groups changed locations every few weeks or months. They would take the outer layer of the wigwam with them, and leave the heavy wood frame in place. The frame could be reused if the tribe returned to the location at a later date.</p>
<p>Further south, in what is today Southern Ontario and Quebec the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iroquois.html" title="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> society lived in permanent agricultural settlements holding several hundred to several thousand people. The standard form of housing was the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_long_house_eeef.html" title="Native American long house">long house</a>. These were large structures, several times longer than they were wide holding a large number of people. They were built with a frame of saplings or branches, covered with a layer of bark or woven mats.</p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Prairies_54dd.html" title="Canadian Prairies">Prairies</a> the standard form of life was a nomadic one, with the people often moving to a new location each day to follow the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bison.html" title="Bison">bison</a> herds. Housing thus had to be portable, and the <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipi.html" title="Tipi">tipi</a> was developed. The tipi consisted of a thin wooden frame and an outer covering of animal hides. The structures could be quickly erected, and were light enough to transport long distances.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Interior_bad6.html" title="British Columbia Interior">Interior of British Columbia</a> the standard for of home was the semi-permanent <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pit_house.html" title="Pit house">pit house</a>, thousands of relics of which, known as <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiggly_holes.html" title="Quiggly holes">quiggly holes</a> are scattered across the Interior landscape. These were structures shaped like an upturned bowl, placed on top of a three of four foot deep pit. The bowl, made of wood, would be covered with an insulating layer of earth. The house would be entered by climbing down a ladder at the centre of the roof. See <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiggly_hole.html" title="Quiggly hole">Quiggly hole</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the most impressive First Nations architecture was that of the settled people of the west coast such as the <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haida.html" title="Haida">Haida</a>. These people used advanced <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpentry.html" title="Carpentry">carpentry</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joinery.html" title="Joinery">joinery</a> skills to construct large houses of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thuja_plicata.html" title="Thuja plicata">redcedar</a> planks. These were large square, solidly built houses. The most advanced design was the six beam house, named for the number of beams that supported the roof. The front of each house would be decorated with a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totem_pole.html" title="Totem pole">heraldric pole</a>, the pole and sometimes the house would be brightly painted with artistic designs.</p>
<p>In the far north, where wood was scarce and solid shelter essential for survival, several unique and innovative architectural styles were developed. One of the most famous is the <a href="../../../i/g/l/Igloo.html" title="Igloo">igloo</a>, a domed structure made of snow, which was quite warm. In the summer months, when the igloos melted, tents made of seal skin, or other hides, were used. The <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thule_people.html" title="Thule people">Thule</a> adopted a design similar to the pit houses of the BC interior, but because of the lack of wood they instead used <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whale.html" title="Whale">whale</a> bones for the frame.</p>

<p>The first Europeans to inhabit what would become Canada were the French settlers of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_France_b15c.html" title="New France">New France</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acadia.html" title="Acadia">Acadia</a>. The initial settlements at <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Royal_fa77.html" title="Port Royal">Port Royal</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_City_5f2c.html" title="Quebec City">Quebec City</a> were most concerned with defence, against both First Nations and the English. For most of the early history of Quebec city it was dominated by the large fortress and outer walls. The city was divided into two sections. The Upper Town was home to the fortress, Intendant's house, and churches, these structures were built of stone in imitation of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque_architecture.html" title="Baroque architecture">Baroque architecture</a> then popular in France. The Lower Town consisted of densely packed structures on narrow streets, and was the commercial centre and home to the workers.</p>

<p>The settlers of the rural areas along the St. Lawrence largely came from <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a>, and the houses they built echoed their roots. The surroundings forced enough differences that a unique style developed, and the house of the New France farmer remains a symbol of French-Canadian nationalism. These were rectangular structures of one storey, but with an extremely tall and steep roof, sometimes almost twice as tall as the house below. This roof design perhaps developed to prevent the accumulation of snow. The houses were usually built of wood, though the surviving ones are almost all built of stone. Landmarks in the rural areas were the churches and the mansion of the <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seigneurial_system_of_New_France_74ce.html" title="Seigneurial system of New France">seigneurs</a>. The seigneurs built much larger homes for themselves, but rarely were the manors ornate. Each parish had its church, often smaller copies of major churches in Quebec City or Montreal. A unique style of French-Canadian church thus developed.</p>
<p>The first English settlements in what would become Canada were in Newfoundland, growing out of the temporary fishing settlements that had been established in the sixteenth century. The first English settlement in the Maritimes was in Halifax, and then along the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Shore_168e.html" title="South Shore">South Shore</a>. The style that developed in the Maritimes was very close to the architecture of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a>. Trade links between the two areas were close, and many of the settlers in the Maritimes were from there. Some of the first houses erected in Halifax were actually prefabricated structures assembled in Boston or New York and shipped to the new settlement. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cod_%28house%29_ad55.html" title="Cape Cod (house)">Cape Cod style</a> cottages were built throughout the region. However, the influence of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Protestants_0142.html" title="Foreign Protestants">Foreign Protestants</a> was also felt as the architecture of the region also borrowed some techniques and styles from Germany and Switzerland.</p>

<p>The English speaking population of Canada grew dramatically with the influx of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Empire_Loyalists_b44c.html" title="United Empire Loyalists">United Empire Loyalists</a> after the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>. This doubled the population of the Maritimes and brought the first significant European population to what was soon <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Canada_49b4.html" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a>. One of the most popular styles in the pre-revolutionary United States was <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_architecture.html" title="Georgian architecture">Georgian</a>, after the revolution this style fell out of favour due to its association with the colonial regime, but the Loyalists embraced the style as an overt symbol of their loyalty. The style had also, however, fallen out of style in Britain, and Canada was alone in embracing Georgian architecture for much of the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In Lower Canada the Georgian style was employed by the English minority, but this minority dominated the commercial and political class. French-Canadian architecture kept many of its traditional forms, but also adopted some English styles. Throughout British North America the Georgian style was mostly used by the middle and upper classes, and also for institutional buildings such as churches and government structures. In rural areas, and among the urban poor, simpler styles dominated. In the Maritimes the New England style cottages continued to be popular. For the first settlers in Ontario the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Log_cabin.html" title="Log cabin">log cabin</a> was the standard first house. Logs were a byproduct of the need the clear the land, and log cabins were cheap and easy to build. After a few years of farming it was typical to build a more elegant farmhouse. The most common design was the Ontario Style House, which consisted of a rectangular wood building with the main <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gable.html" title="Gable">gable</a> over the short sides, and a smaller gable over the main entrance.</p>
<p>The pattern of building in the west was very different. The first settlements in much of the West were the forts of the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company_f47f.html" title="Hudson's Bay Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Company_1837.html" title="Northwest Company">Northwest Company</a> and the cabins of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metis.html" title="Metis">Metis</a>. The next important presence was that of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_f10d.html" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>. The railway needed to build stations every 13 km of its 4200 km route in order to rewater the steam engines. Many of these stations became a nucleus of towns. These stations were built to standardized designs, with a number of different sizes for stations of differing importance. Other important monuments throughout the prairies were the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grain_elevators.html" title="Grain elevators">grain elevators</a>, and the banks which competed with each other by building ever more ornate structures.</p>
<p>While there is little wood native to the prairies, the railway enabled it to be imported at relatively low cost. It was still common to build a first temporary home out of <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sod.html" title="Sod">sod</a>. For those who were unsure of how to build a home, an industry of predesigned and prefabricated homes sold by catalogue developed. A settler could simply order plans for a few dollars, or also order the precut lumber, and premade doors and windows. The <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eaton%27s.html" title="Eaton's">Eaton's catalogue</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a> offered homes from a shack for $165 to a nine room house for $1,025. These structures were erected across the prairies.</p>
<p>For some immigrants to the prairies, most notably the Ukrainians, there was not enough capital to buy a predesigned home, but since the immigrants were highly experienced with farming on the very similar Ukrainian steppe, houses identical to the peasant cottages of Eastern Europe were built across the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prairies.html" title="Prairies">prairies</a>. These cottages had characteristic flared thatched roofs and white plaster walls. Even more notable were the <a href="../../../o/n/i/Onion_dome.html" title="Onion dome">onion domed</a> Ukrainian churches built across the prairies. Other groups such as the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutterites.html" title="Hutterites">Hutterites</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doukhobors.html" title="Doukhobors">Doukhobors</a> also built unique structures. In the long run, however, the second and third generation immigrants tended to embrace the more British styles: the churches remained distinctly Eastern, but the houses largely conformed to the rest.</p>

<p>Victorian styles of architecture dominated in Canada from the min-nineteenth century up to the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>. Unlike during the previous centuries there was now easy communication between Canada and the architectural centres of the United States and Britain. It was common for Canadian architects to travel, study, and work in these other areas, and it was also increasingly common to hire foreign architects. This meant that ideas and styles developed elsewhere were quickly adopted in Canada. These were diverse styles, but one common element were attempts to revive ideas of the past. The first such style to come to prominence was the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Revival_d3b9.html" title="Gothic Revival">Gothic Revival</a> style, which first came to Canada in the 1830s. This became the dominant architectural style for churches, especially Anglican and Roman Catholic ones, which both embraced Gothic Revival as evidence of their conservatism. It also was used for scholastic structures, such as universities and some houses. One of the most prominent Gothic Revival Structures were the original <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Canada_4c02.html" title="Parliament of Canada">Parliament Buildings</a> in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Other revived styles also became prominent. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanesque_Revival_87fc.html" title="Romanesque Revival">Romanesque Revival</a> buildings such as the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Legislature_726b.html" title="British Columbia Legislature">British Columbia Legislature</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_City_Hall_%28Toronto%29_a364.html" title="Old City Hall (Toronto)">Old Toronto City Hall</a>, and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langevin_Block_3cdc.html" title="Langevin Block">Langevin Block</a> were erected in this period. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_architecture.html" title="Neoclassical architecture">Neoclassicism</a> became popular for banks, and for train station such as Toronto's <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Station_%28Toronto%29_9e4b.html" title="Union Station (Toronto)">Union Station</a>. Several <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Empire_Style_8013.html" title="Second Empire Style">Second Empire Style</a> structures were erected such as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Assembly_of_Quebec_3aee.html" title="National Assembly of Quebec">National Assembly of Quebec</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Legislative_Building_cec2.html" title="Manitoba Legislative Building">Manitoba Legislative Building</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_City_Hall_a646.html" title="Montreal City Hall">Montreal City Hall</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick_f4b1.html" title="Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick">Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick</a>. In the 1890s <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Anne_Style_6a94.html" title="Queen Anne Style">Queen Anne Style</a> architecture became the dominant one for upper and middle class houses across Canada. Early in the twentieth style the <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_Style_3b53.html" title="Tudor Style">Tudor Style</a> became quite popular, especially on the West Coast.</p>

<p>In the period after the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_nationalism.html" title="Canadian nationalism">Canadian nationalism</a> led to attempts to proclaim a unique Canadian architecture, distinct from that of Britain and the United States. One style promoted as distinctly Canadian was the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada%27s_grand_railway_hotels.html" title="Canada's grand railway hotels">Château Style</a>, also known as Railway Gothic. This style first appeared in the late nineteenth century with grandiose railway hotels such as the <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2teau_Frontenac_fb62.html" title="Château Frontenac">Château Frontenac</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banff_Springs_Hotel_0be8.html" title="Banff Springs Hotel">Banff Springs Hotel</a>. It was a mix of Victorian Gothic Revival with castles of the <a href="../../../l/o/i/Loire.html" title="Loire">Loire</a> in France. The railways were seen as symbols of Canada, and the mix of French and English ideas was also considered distinctly Canadian . During the Interwar years the Château style was used in several prominent public structures, such as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court</a> building. Prime Minister <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King_85ed.html" title="William Lyon Mackenzie King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a> was a prominent supporter of the style. The third and current <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel_Vancouver_52c6.html" title="Hotel Vancouver">Hotel Vancouver</a>, the last of the great Gothic railway hotels, was also completed after the start of World War II, though it had been under construction until 1929 (its predecessor was Italian Renaissance, a common style in late Victorian and Edwardian British Columbia).</p>
<p>The desire for a unique Canadian style also led to a revival of the Neo Gothic style during the interwar period. In part because of the prominence of the Parliament Buildings and the CPR's "railway Gothic", Gothic architecture had become closely associated with Canada and while the United States embraced <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Deco_3600.html" title="Art Deco">Art Deco</a> Canadian architects returned to the Middle Ages for inspiration, by way of John Ruskin's writings on Neo-Gothic, the most Victorian of all styles. Thus, when the Centre Block of the Parliament burnt down it was rebuilt in a similar Gothic style to that that had been used sixty years earlier.</p>
<p>At the same time developments, especially those in United States, were not ignored. Toronto closely followed Chicago and New York as the home of skyscrapers employing new steel framed construction and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevator.html" title="Elevator">elevators</a>. Toronto's influence on other Canadian cities, largely because of the control of capital (especially banks) meant that Western Canadian cities, particularly Vancouver, became filled with lesser versions of their counterparts in Toronto (e.g. <a href="../../../t/d/_/TD_Tower_%28Vancouver%29_9245.html" title="TD Tower (Vancouver)">TD Tower (Vancouver)</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bentall_Centre_%28Vancouver%29_5142.html" title="Bentall Centre (Vancouver)">Bentall Centre (Vancouver)</a> which displaced the city's older and distinctly Edwardian flavour.</p>
<p>Modernism appeared in a number of guises. In the 1930s and 1920s the banks and insurance companies embraced Modern Classicism. The <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prairie_Style_0666.html" title="Prairie Style">Prairie Style</a>, well suited to the Canadian terrain, became a popular one for homes and other structures, especially the designs of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Sullivan_30e3.html" title="Francis Sullivan">Francis Sullivan</a>. In British Columbia, the <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungalow.html" title="Bungalow">bungalow</a> style popular in British India became a fixture in local house design, and styles such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_and_Crafts_5c45.html" title="Arts and Crafts">Arts and Crafts</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Anne_653a.html" title="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</a> and emulations of Californian Spanish and other distinctly western North America styles were common.</p>
<p>In Vancouver during the 1950s and 1960s, modernist architectures inspired by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_96e4.html" title="Frank Lloyd Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> and fostered by the unique building materials and physical setting resulted in various daring new styles of housing, particularly on Vancouver's ritzy <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Shore_1982.html" title="North Shore">North Shore</a>, featuring open beams, glass walls, and innovative floor plans. Vancouver architect <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Erickson_d76f.html" title="Arthur Erickson">Arthur Erickson</a>, more known for grandiose exercises in instititutional concrete such as Robson Square and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Fraser_University_b6e7.html" title="Simon Fraser University">Simon Fraser University</a>, pioneered the British Columbia version of the "West Coast style", variations of which are also common in Washington, Oregon and California. Despite the impersonality of his large-scale projects, Erickson-designed houses are prized for their intimacy and taste, as well as their advantageous use of natural settings. A lesser, though much more common, form of modernist architecture developed during the 1960s was the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Special_0693.html" title="Vancouver Special">Vancouver Special</a>, a two-storey stuccoed box which took up most of a city lot, and typically featured two suites, one upstairs and one downstairs.</p>
<p>The movements and styles popular in the United States and Britain were not totally ignored in Canada. Several <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Deco_3600.html" title="Art Deco">Art Deco</a> structures were erected, such as the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_City_Hall_ff46.html" title="Vancouver City Hall">Vancouver City Hall</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Building_6de0.html" title="Marine Building">Marine Building</a> also in that city and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce_Court_9a00.html" title="Commerce Court">Commerce Court North</a> in Toronto. The <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_Style_2a4a.html" title="Georgian Style">Georgian</a> revival that was underway in the United States also made some incursions to Canada, as did diverse styles such as <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Revival_97fc.html" title="Egyptian Revival">Egyptian Revival</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Colonial_Style_bb21.html" title="Spanish Colonial Style">Spanish Colonial</a> styles.</p>

<p>After the Second World War, the desire for unique Canadian styles faded as the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Style_ef4d.html" title="International Style">International Style</a> came to dominate the Canadian scene in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of the most prominent Canadian projects of this period were designed by foreigners, who won open contests. Prominent modernists such as <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe_fd65.html" title="Ludwig Mies van der Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a> and <a href="../../../i/2E/m/I.M._Pei_42bf.html" title="I.M. Pei">I.M. Pei</a> designed major works in Canada. At the same time top Canadian architects did much of their work abroad. One of the first and most prominent modernist structures was <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe_fd65.html" title="Ludwig Mies van der Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>'s <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto-Dominion_Centre_0f52.html" title="Toronto-Dominion Centre">Toronto-Dominion Centre</a> was one of the most prominent of the early glass panelled office towers, which would be imitated around the world. The International Style period coincided with a major building boom in Canada, and few restrictions on massive building projects. International Style skyscrapers came to dominate many of Canada's major cities, especially Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto. In Montreal fewer such buildings were erected, but those that were such as <a href="../../../p/l/a/Place_Ville-Marie_b2ea.html" title="Place Ville-Marie">Place Ville-Marie</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Place_Victoria_701d.html" title="Place Victoria">Place Victoria</a>, were large enough to dominate the skyline.</p>
<p>The modernist styles had even mixed results when applied to residential structures, such as the large <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housing_project.html" title="Housing project">housing projects</a> constructed in this era. Massive Canadian housing projects, such as <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._James_Town_5b70.html" title="St. James Town">St. James Town</a>, were far less disastrous than their counterparts in the United States. The post war period saw the rise of massive and low density <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburbs.html" title="Suburbs">suburbs</a> surrounding most Canadian cities, with <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Mills_23a6.html" title="Don Mills">Don Mills</a> being Canada's first community constructed on rigidly modernist lines. One important development was the rise of <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_malls.html" title="Shopping malls">shopping malls</a> that became the commercial, and often social, centres of these suburban areas.</p>
<p>While the glass boxes of the International Style skyscraper were at first unique and interesting, the idea was soon repeated to the point of ubiquity. Architects attempted to put new twists into such towers, such as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_City_Hall_f248.html" title="Toronto City Hall">Toronto City Hall</a>. By the 1970s a backlash was underway against modernism, and Canada was one of its centres. Prominent anti-modernists such as <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Jacobs_e451.html" title="Jane Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Baird_8575.html" title="George Baird">George Baird</a> were based in Canada.</p>
<p>The new Canadian architecture once again turned to the past. A prominent heritage preservation movement has developed, and most city's today have a heritage district of restored structures. Old factories and warehouses, rather than be demolished, have been refurbished, such as the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Quay_Terminal_94f3.html" title="Queen's Quay Terminal">Queen's Quay Terminal</a>, a former warehouse that was rebuilt into a mix of stores, condos, and a theatre. New buildings have also again begun to echo the past. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massey_College_ab4a.html" title="Massey College">Massey College</a>'s concrete Gothicism is an early example, and other structures have reflected the Chateau Style.</p>
