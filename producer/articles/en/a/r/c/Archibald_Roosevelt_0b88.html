<p>With the outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914, there had been a heightened concern about the nation's readiness for military engagement. Only the month before Congress had belatedly recognized the significance of military aviation by authorizing the creation of an Aviation Section in the Signal Corps. In 1915 Major General <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Wood_5e4f.html" title="Leonard Wood">Leonard Wood</a>, a friend of Archie's father since the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Rider_22bd.html" title="Rough Rider">Rough Rider</a> days, organized a summer camp at Plattsburg, New York, to provide military training for business and professional men at their own expense.</p>
<p>It would be this summer training program that would provide the basis of a greatly expanded junior officers corps when the Country entered World War I. During that fateful summer of 1915, many well-heeled young men from some of the finist East Coast schools, including all three Roosevelt sons would attend the Camp.</p>
<p>When the United States entered the war, commissions were offered to the graduates of these schools based on their performance. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Defense_Act_of_1916_d52f.html" title="National Defense Act of 1916">National Defense Act of 1916</a> continued the student military training and the businessmen's summer camps and placed them on a firmer legal basis by authorizing an Officers' Reserve Corps and a Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC).</p>
<p>After the declaration of war, when the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Expeditionary_Force_a109.html" title="American Expeditionary Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> was organizing, Theodore Roosevelt wired Major General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_J._Pershing_797d.html" title="John J. Pershing">John "Black Jack" Pershing</a> asking if his sons could accompany him to Europe as privates. Pershing accepted, but, based on their training at Plattsburg, Archie was offered a commission with rank of second lieutenant, while Ted, Jr. was offered a commission and the rank of major. Quentin had already been accepted into the fledging Army Air Service.</p>
<p>Archie thefore, joined the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>, shipped over to France and was wounded while in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> with the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._1st_Infantry_Division_d8ad.html" title="U.S. 1st Infantry Division">U.S. 1st Infantry Division</a>. His wounds were so severe he was discharged from the Army with full disability. He had ended the war as an Army <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a>. For his valor, Roosevelt received the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> government's <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croix_de_Guerre_4dd9.html" title="Croix de Guerre">Croix de Guerre</a>.</p>

<p>After the death of his father in 1919, he was the one who sent a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegram.html" title="Telegram">telegram</a> informing all his siblings. After the end of the war, he worked for a time as an executive with the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinclair_Oil_6902.html" title="Sinclair Oil">Sinclair Oil Company</a>. Eventually, after resigining from Sinclair, Roosevelt gave key testimony to investigators probing the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teapot_Dome_Scandal_0b88.html" title="Teapot Dome Scandal">Teapot Dome Scandal</a>, in which Roosevelt was not implicated. Following this, Roosevelt took a job working for a cousin in the family investment firm, Roosevelt &amp; Son.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1932, Roosevelt, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Coolidge_91e2.html" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Marshall_Bullit_860f.html" title="William Marshall Bullit">William Marshall Bullit</a>, and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_E._Byrd_ea20.html" title="Richard E.

Byrd</a>, among others, formed a conservative pressure group known as the National Economy League, which called for balancing the federal budget by cutting appropriations for veterans in half.</p>

<p>Following the attack on <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_865a.html" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, in 1942, Roosevelt tried to rejoin the Army. He was turned down for active duty because of both his age (48 in 1942) and because of his previous discharge on full disability. He wrote his cousin, US President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_4d26.html" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> requesting a commission and explaining, "There may come many places and many times … where you would like to have the son of the former President and someone with your name to share the dangers of soldiers or sailors or marines in some tough spot … I would be perfect for such a job … You would not be throwing away [someone] who was useful elsewhere."</p>
<p>FDR interceded on his behalf and he was commissioned a Lieutenant Colonel. Given command of the US Army's 162nd Infantry, <a href="../../../4/1/s/41st_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_e029.html" title="41st Infantry Division (United States)">41st Infantry Division</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> from 1943 into early 1944. Working with the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_3rd_Division_%28World_War_II%29_6ed3.html" title="Australian 3rd Division (World War II)">Australian 3rd Division</a>, Roosevelt and his men played an important role in the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamaua-Lae_campaign_6a48.html" title="Salamaua-Lae campaign">Salamaua campaign</a>. His service was recognized in the naming of a battleground during the campaign: the Battle of Roosevelt Ridge.</p>
<p>He was later wounded a second time in combat in the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Theater_of_Operations_d01b.html" title="Pacific Theater of Operations">Pacific Theater of Operations</a>, for which he earned the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Star_18bc.html" title="Silver Star">Silver Star</a> with Oak Leaf Clusters. A grenade shattered the same knee Roosevelt had injured during combat in WWI, thus earning him the dubious distinction of being the only American to ever be classified as 100% disabled twice and thus holds the distinction of being the only serviceman retired on full disability from both world wars.</p>

<p>Following the end of the war, Archie Roosevelt formed the investment firm of Roosevelt and Cross, a brokerage house specializing in municipal bonds. It is still a going concern with offices in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Providence, Buffalo and Hartford.</p>
<p>During the early 1950s, Archie became affiliated with a variety of extreme right wing organizations and causes. He joined the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Birch_Society_d54f.html" title="John Birch Society">John Birch Society</a>, and was the founder of the controversial Veritas Foundation, dedicated to the routing out of presumed socialist influence at Harvard and other major colleges and universities. Writing in the book <i>America's Political Dynasties</i> (Doubleday, 1966), Stephen Hess commented: "Archie Roosevelt has, in recent years, added the family's name to many ultra-rightist causes. As a trustee of the Veritas Foundation he is a leader among those seeking to root out subversion at Harvard. He also sent a letter to every U.S. Senator, stating 'modern technical civilization does not seem to be as well handled by the black man as by the white man in the United States.' Present civil rights difficulties he blamed on 'socialist plotters.'"</p>
<p>In 1954, when the Theodore Roosevelt Association made a decision to award the Theodore Roosevelt Medal for Distinguished Public Service to black diplomat <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Bunche_52f9.html" title="Ralph Bunche">Ralph Bunche</a>, Archie loudly protested the award. He even went so far as to write and publish a 44-page pamphlet that attempted to prove Bunche had been working as an agent of the "International Communist Conspiracy" for more than two decades.</p>
<p>In his introduction to Zygmund Dobbs' <i>The Great Deceit: Social Pseudo-Sciences</i> (Sayville, NY: The Veritas Foundation, 1964), Archie wrote: "Socialists have infiltrated our schools, our law courts, our government, our MEDIA OF COMMUNICATIONS. ... the Socialist movement is made up of a relatively small number of people who have developed the TECHNIQUE OF INFLUENCING large masses of people to a VERY HIGH DEGREE."</p>

<p>Archie's wife, Grace Lockwood Roosevelt died in an automobile crash near her home in Cold Spring Harbor in 1971, with her husband Archie at the wheel. He was understandably inconsolable over this tragedy and her loss contributed to his physical decline.</p>
<p>Roosevelt died eight years later - on 13 October 1979 - of a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a>, at 85 at the Stuart Convalesent Home in <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart%2C_Florida_f5ce.html" title="Stuart, Florida">Stuart, Florida</a>.
