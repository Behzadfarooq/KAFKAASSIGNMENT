<p>I present this scentence as an example. "Kennewick Man is an example of archaeology interacting with modern culture". My question is How? What is the point of this scentence if there is no explanation of HOW Kennewick man is an example etc.&#160;? It is pointless otherwise.</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavio_Biondo_8528.html" title="Flavio Biondo">Flavio Biondo</a> is an Italian historian and author who has been called "The First Archaeologist". He wrote three influential books that systematically described the topography and ruins of Rome in the early 15th century. The first time anything like that had been done anywhere. My interest is history, and not archaeology, I was hopeing someone could help me if or where he belongs in this article and in what capacity. Did not see a "history of archaeology" section. I don't want to call him "the first" if it is hype, but I have seen it used in other sources, and don't know enough about the field to know how accurate a claim it is. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 06:22, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A reference on the page <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_archaeology.html" title="History of archaeology">History of archaeology</a> would be great! Personally, if you can give a reference to an academic who called him the first archaeologist then I'd use it, otherwise I'd put "one of the first".

<p>I was recently asked how one could become a "forensic archaeologist" and couldn't quite understand the concept. The term "forensic" (something to do with the court system, law, current criminal investigations) and "archaeology" (something to do with the past) didn't seem to jive well. Well, I did a bit of search and apparently UCL offers a masters course in "forensic archaeological science" and I even found a definition on one of the websites. Apparently it's supposed to be "archaeology using method and theory borrowed from the forensic sciences (I guess kind of like palaeopathology... but I can't see why it would have to be specifically forsensic science), OR using archaeological method and theory to aid in forensic research of a current, on-going criminal investigation". The latter tends to make a little more sense, because I can see how archaeological techniques (excavation, recording and interpretation of stratigraphic information, etc.) could be of help at a crime scene, especially if the dead bodies are buried (which, I guess, they often are). Any way, I was wondering if forensic archaeology should be added to the list of subdisciplines and exactly how to define it if it should.<a href="../../../r/a/w/User%7ERawhead_8ceb.html" title="User:Rawhead">rawhead</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>A friend of mine did the UCL Forensics MA, stabbed and buried a load of dead sheep for her thesis. The police use forensic archs in murder investigations, as yes the work involves excavating shallow graves and keeping a thorough record of the work as well as borrowing a lot from pathology in terms of bone analysis and studying trauma. The UN hired a load to go and dig up the mass graves in Bosnia and some have gone out to excavate Saddam's mass graves in Iraq. It is gruesome stuff and most archaeologists prefer their bones not have flesh still on them but it is easily the best-paying area of the field if you can stomach it. I'm sure we can thrash out a definition on the article page. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 12:57, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If forensic archaeology was to be called a subdiscipline, it would be a subdiscipline of archaeology. The subdisciplines discussed in the article, however, are the four subdisciplines of anthropology (archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology and linguistic anthropology). Labelling forensic archaeology as a subdiscipline of archaeology would not be exactly correct, though. It's more a combination of archaeology and biological anthropology.Tpstigers 02:59, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "Relations with the public" section seems fine to me. All the material therein is significant. As for the title, I have considered "Archaeology for the layman" (inappropriately gender specific term), "Public face of archaeology" (too racy), "Amateur archaeology" (too narrow) and others. I cannot come up with anything satisfactory. This reflects the prevailing problems with public involvement with arcaheology, I guess. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 19:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I cannot think of any other profession that could call as one of its own a fictional character as famous <i>and</i> as inaccurate as Indiana Jones. Also, for a variety of reasons many of the objects of archeological study have considerable commercial value — which is often in direct conflict with archeology values. Reasons enough for a section on archeology and the public. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 19:49, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>Edir:"<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_detector.html" title="Metal detector">Metal detectors</a> can be used to locate metal artifacts." The use of metal detectors to locate metal artifacts is not archaeology, but treasure-hunting. The previous text is better; however, some text on the actual use of metal detectors in professional archaeology would be welcome. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 16:47, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The use of metal detectors to find and retrieve metal artefacts without recording their context may well be treasure hunting. But that is not what the text says. Changing " <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_detector.html" title="Metal detector">Metal detectors</a> can be used to locate metal artifacts." to " <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_detector.html" title="Metal detector">Metal detectors</a> sense the presence of ancient metal artifacts." implies that archaeology is only concerned with the "ancient". It is also a more passive form than that which it replaces (but that is secondary). Uses that fall outside the identification of "ancient metal artefacts" include musketball distribution analysis on English Civil War battlefields, service cable location during evaluation, and metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of nineteenth century ship wreck. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 18:12, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Theo is correct. One thing we must be very vigilant about in this article is <i>not</i> to give the impression that archeologists only study the past. The only thing of substance effected by Wetman's change is to add the word "ancient" which is wrong — inaccurate and misleading. Using metal detectors to find artefacts is not necessarily "treasure-hunting," nor is it necessarily archeology. What matters is the <i>purpose</i>. If the purpose is to accumulate items that have a market value today, that is treasure hunting; if the purpose is to gain insight into other ways of life, that is archeology. Metal detectors are tools, nothing more. It all depends on how they are used. Wetman is right that it would be good to provide some actual examples of archeologists using metal detectors, or have a citation to an archeology textbook.<a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:39, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is just to inform people that I want Wikipedia to accept a general policy that BC and AD represent a Christian Point of View and should be used only when they are appropriate, that is, in the context of expressing or providing an account of a Christian point of view.

<p>I changed the first sentence of the last paragraph in the CRM section. "Cultural resources management has doubtless mitigated the destruction of the archaeological record by the ever-sprawling works of the Western world, but it leaves something to be desired" is not NPOV. (Admittedly, what I replaced it with was somewhat weaselly.) I also changed the last sentence of the first paragraph in the looting section, because "rob" is not an especially NPOV word. (Also, if the local peoples in question don't <i>care</i> about the artifacts, it's arguably not robbing in the first place.)</p>
<p>I flagged the descendent peoples section as NPOV because. . . well, I think it is. Statments such as "American archaeologists have paid them little heed," "this mistrust is well-founded," "carting away any artefacts and human remains," and "adding insult to injury" display a POV in favor of the local peoples making the complaints.</p>
<p>The first line in the "importance and applicability" section also bothers me a bit -- that's a pretty hefty claim, and strikes me as slightly POV; some more detail and/or an attribution would be a good idea. Also, the line about archaeology being described as "a craft that uses the sciences to illuminate the humanities" should probably be attributed to someone.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the article could possibly use some general NPOV cleaning up; there are a lot of authoritative "this has been beneficial" statements, for instance, which could easily be tweaked into something like "the vast majority of archaeologists have found this to be benefical."</p>

<p>Some of the controversies are deeper than those indicated. Kennewick Man, in particular, has an added complexity that is significant: The Native people claim him as an ancestor because the body was recovered from whey they lived, but the current standard opinion in Archaeology is that the body long predates the arrival of the current occupants, and so Kennewick Man is from a different population, possibly one supplanted by these current residents. This makes it particularly difficult to resolve, as the terms of the debate are debatable -- should the local Native peoples be asked for their opinion about what to do with an ancestor when the body is not (to the best of current scientific evidence) actually of an ancestor?

<p>Can we remove this sentence? "Archaeologists study artifacts, which are anything showing signs of human use or modification."

<p>I keep adding an alternative spelling (though to be honest it is the ORIGINAL English spelling) of the word archæology with the ligature "æ". The user Kevinalewis keeps removing my addition to the Wikipedia page insisting that the spelling means something other than archaeology. It means the same thing, except a ligature is being used because the word originates from Old English. Refer to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/archaeology" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/archaeology" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary: Archaeology</a> to view the spelling listed as a variant. Also the spelling is accepted and regarded as correct by the Oxford English Dictonary, which is known as the most comprehensive and scholarly dictionary of the English language. The spelling is not archaic, it is simply not commonly used, however if the Greek spelling is going to be shown, then the original English spelling should as well. To return to the original arguement, a ligature simply denotes a sound intermediate between those of a and e (it does not change the meaning of a word as Kevinalewis is claiming). Refer to <a href="../../../%C3%A6/_/_/%C3%86.html" title="Æ">Æ</a> to teach yourself more about ligatures and spelling, and as you will notice the image in the page proudly uses the word "archæology" as its main example. placed by --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeakslowly_89b0.html" title="User:Speakslowly">Speakslowly</a> 18:56, 11 March 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeakslowly_89b0.html" title="User:Speakslowly">User:Speakslowly</a></p>

<dd>Also I do know what ligatures are, so we can drop that. On wider reading it does appear that the word is being used (by exception) as a synonym for "Archaeology". That of itself does not make Wikictionary the arbiter it is as flawed a source as this is. OED is another matter, unfortunately I don't have direct access to that (or space for it for that matter). What does appear to be the case in the dictionaries and sources I "have" consulted that it does have an alternative meaning which is not brought out in your entry here. I will leave the entry as is at present but I believe we need to adjust it to reflect it's rarity or at very least draw attention to it's variant meaning, see my web reference above. Sorry to be a pain but if we are to be seen as reliable we "must" be scrupulous in what we allow to stand in wikipedia. It is not meant to be aggresive or in anyway finally deny that you know something I don't.

<dd>Excuse me for not understanding the structure of a talk page. However you keep insisting that Archology means something else, but I have never mentioned Archology. I am insisting that Archæology with the ligature means the same thing. I understand that in Wikipedia we strive for factual information, and I am not pursuing a different spelling for a joke. I will continue to say that Archæology with the ligature means the same thing as Archaeology, and it has no other meaning. Archology with an o is something completely different which is something I have never brought up since that is what YOUR argument is about. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeakslowly_89b0.html" title="User:Speakslowly">Speakslowly</a> 18:56, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah ha, It appears we are getting somewhere (and I am not going mad!) When you write "æ" in the main article to achieve "Archæology" what I see on my browser on two different machines is "Archology". That must be where the confusion is comming from. Perhaps you could have a bit of a look at this as not everyone will be using the same browsers or even fonts.

<dd>I figured something weird was going on like that. And no I've been generating the æ the same manner each time. You hold down the ALT key and using the numbers on the right side of the keyboard you type in 0230. So I'm assuming the hatchet is being buried and we can continue with other things involving archæology, as opposed to fights about spelling. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeakslowly_89b0.html" title="User:Speakslowly">Speakslowly</a> 20:22, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hatchet was never out - I was thinking that one of us had lost it, but sanity is restored. Interesting that some people are actually using the work I thought was the issue, "Archology" to mean "Archaeology" even though that "does" mean something different.

<dd>The section "Usage" reads like a diatribe. Yes, the more common spelling in the U. S. of the word "archaeology" is the the ae, but the alternative spelling is also definitely widely used, e.g., by the U. S. government agencies working in archaeology.</dd>

<p>The spelling of artifact with an i is the standard spelling in U. S. archaeology. As I understand Wik procedures, if a subject is international, the spelling is set by the first user of the term in an article. If this is correct, then let us abide by that - some-body with a faster computer than mine could check out the history of the use of the word in this article. <a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdammers_e118.html" title="User:Kdammers">Kdammers</a> 08:26, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The spelling of artefact with an E is standard in non-American archaeology. I do not particularly wish to start an 'America v. The rest of the world' debate, but I have never read a book about archaeology which spelt it with an i. Thought this comment would be relevant in this case. fluoronaut 09:07, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am an archaeologist first trained in the U. S. and have never seen a book of archaeology or a professional article in the U. S. where it is NOT spelled with an 'i.' But my point was simply that the spelling in this article should abide by Wik norms. If that menas first come first rules and the first person to whrite the word in this article wrote it the British way, then it should be spelled with a 'e'; whereas if it got changed along the way, it should be reverted. <a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdammers_e118.html" title="User:Kdammers">Kdammers</a> 09:17, 30 April 2006 (UTC) I have finally been able to view the earliest text. While it is horrible, it does contain 'artifact' with an 'i.' Thus, if I am correct in understanding Wik norms, let's change it. (I'm not interested in a battle either.) BTW, this Hong Kong site uses the 'i' version: <a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/en/relic_c.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/en/relic_c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/en/relic_c.htm</a>.

<p><cite>18:29, 19 January 2003 Deb (just a start on the history of the discipline)</cite> It's spelt with an E.

<dd>I agree (When I looked earlier, one of the first two entries seemed to have it with an 'i,' but I guess I som-how was not on the archaeology page proper.). <a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdammers_e118.html" title="User:Kdammers">Kdammers</a> 11:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everytime I read this, the more I dislike it. Although it might be a widespread colloquial term for what in the UK is often termed 'digger', I just don't see its relevance here. Plus, its full of non-verifiable pers. opinions, like the claim that its seen as bad form to use it if you haven't been one yourself. Says who? Unless anyone strongly objects, I suggest creating a new page called <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shovelbum.html" title="Shovelbum">Shovelbum</a>, and replacing this paragraph with a brief sentence (and link) that notes that this term exists among some archaeologists in the US. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattus_151d.html" title="User:Rattus">Rattus</a> 15:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can not say I am a big fan of this term myself and find myself agreeing with you.

<dd>Ethnoarcheology is also an important field in US anthropology. And while it is true that in most UK universities (and some US) archeology is distinct from anthropology, there <i>are</i> UK universities that combine them. Cambridge has a faculty of archeology and anthropology, bringing them together. Bristol has a department of anthropology and archeology. University of Wales, Lampeter. So some UK departments are moving toward the American model. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I don't personally care which we use, according to the rules we should be using <b>artefact</b> instead of <b>artifact</b> as the former predates the latter in the history of this article. However, there may be good reason for changing to 'artifact': British English speakers may be more used to the 'e' version, but will certainly be aware of the 'i' version; but American English speakers probably automatically think 'artefact' (sic) is spelt wrongly (bless)—hence the frequent changes by do-gooders. To save the frequent rv that will inevitably happen with this, what do people think about a global change to 'artifact'? <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattus_151d.html" title="User:Rattus">Rattus</a> 21:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did some wiki-excavation of this article, because we are reviewing all articles in Version 0.5 that have seen their assessment go down (in this case GA to B). I notice that between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Archaeology&amp;diff=88952723&amp;oldid=57851734" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Archaeology&amp;diff=88952723&amp;oldid=57851734" rel="nofollow">the June 10 version and the current one</a> the entire section on excavation was lost, and a subheading was changed. I see a fair bit of blanking occurred, so I'm guessing this was a result of vandalism. I'm adding this lost material back in, and recommending that we then use the most recent version of the article. I'm only passing through, but I wanted to ask those who maintain the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please check that my reverts are appropriate. If the material was subsumed into other parts of the article, please revert me.</li>
<li>Please check the above "diff" to see if there any other things that jump out as being lost. It's a shame to see something that a person spent hours writing should get lost in this way.
