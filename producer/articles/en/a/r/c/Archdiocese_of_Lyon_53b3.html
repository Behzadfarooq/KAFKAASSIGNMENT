<p>The "Deacon of Vienne", martyred at <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyon.html" title="Lyon">Lyon</a> during the persecution of 177, was probably a deacon installed at <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienne.html" title="Vienne">Vienne</a> by the ecclesiastical authority of Lyon. The confluence of the Rhône and the Saône, where sixty Gallic tribes had erected the famous altar to Rome and <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus.html" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>, was also the centre from which Christianity was gradually propagated throughout Gaul. The presence at Lyon of numerous Asiatic Christians and their almost daily communications with the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orient.html" title="Orient">Orient</a> were likely to arouse the susceptibilities of the Gallo-Romans. A persecution arose under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Aurelius_49af.html" title="Marcus Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>. Its victims at Lyon numbered forty-eight, half of them of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greek</a> origin, half Gallo-Roman, among others <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Blandina_b922.html" title="St. Blandina">St. Blandina</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Pothinus_7f0a.html" title="St. Pothinus">St. Pothinus</a>, first Bishop of Lyon, sent to Gaul by <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Polycarp_5c3b.html" title="St. Polycarp">St. Polycarp</a> about the middle of the second century. The legend according to which he was sent by <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Clement_3bfc.html" title="St. Clement">St. Clement</a> dates from the twelfth century and is without foundation. The letter addressed to the Christians of Asia and Phrygia in the name of the faithful of Vienne and Lyon, and relating the persecution of 177, is considered by <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Renan_5482.html" title="Ernest Renan">Ernest Renan</a> as one of the most extraordinary documents possessed by any literature; it is the baptismal certificate of Christianity in France. The successor of St. Pothinus was the illustrious St. Irenæus, 177-202.</p>
<p>The discovery on the Hill of St. Sebastian of ruins of a naumachia capable of being transformed into an amphitheatre, and of some fragments of inscriptions apparently belonging to an altar of Augustus, has led several archæologists to believe that the martyrs of Lyon suffered death on this hill. Very ancient tradition, however, represents the church of Ainay as erected at the place of their martyrdom. The crypt of St. Pothinus, under the choir of the church of St. Nizier was destroyed in 1884. But there are still revered at Lyon the prison cell of St. Pothinus, where Anne of Austria, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIV_868b.html" title="Louis XIV">Louis XIV</a>, and <a href="../../../p/i/u/Pius_VII_3f9c.html" title="Pius VII">Pius VII</a> came to pray, and the crypt of St. Irenæus built at the end of the fifth century by St. Patiens, which contains the body of St. Irenæus. There are numerous funerary inscriptions of primitive Christianity in Lyon; the earliest dates from the year 334. In the second and third centuries the See of Lyon enjoyed great renown throughout Gaul, witness the local legends of Besançon and of several other cities relative to the missionaries sent out by St. Irenæus. Faustinus, bishop in the second half of the third century, wrote to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Cyprian_ad41.html" title="St. Cyprian">St. Cyprian</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_I_07ad.html" title="Pope Stephen I">Pope Stephen I</a>, in 254, regarding the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novatian.html" title="Novatian">Novatian</a> tendencies of Marcian, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Arles_1906.html" title="Bishop of Arles">Bishop of Arles</a>. But when <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocletian.html" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>'s new provincial organization (<a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetrarchy.html" title="Tetrarchy">tetrarchy</a>) had taken away from Lyon its position as metropolis of the three Gauls, the prestige of Lyon diminished for a time.</p>

<p>At the end of the empire and during the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merovingian.html" title="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> period several saints are counted among the Bishops of Lyon: <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Justus_e305.html" title="St. Justus">St. Justus</a> (374-381) who died in a monastery in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebaid.html" title="Thebaid">Thebaid</a> (<a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>) and was renowned for the orthodoxy of his doctrine in the struggle against <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arianism</a> (the church of the Machabees, whither his body was brought, was as early as the fifty century a place of pilgrimage under the name of the collegiate church of St. Justus), St. Alpinus and St. Martin (disciple of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Martin_of_Tours_6db9.html" title="St. Martin of Tours">St. Martin of Tours</a>; end of fourth century); St. Antiochus (400-410); St. Elpidius (410-422); St. Sicarius (422-33); St. Eucherius (c. 433-50), a monk of Lérins and the author of homilies, from whom doubtless dates the foundation at Lyon of the "hermitages" of which more will be said below; St. Patiens (456-98) who successfully combated the famine and Arianism, and whom Sidonius Apollinaris praised in a poem; St. Lupicinus (491-94); St. Rusticus (494-501); St. Stephanus (d. Before 515), who with St. Avitus of Vienne, convoked a council at Lyon for the conversion of the Arians; St. Viventiolus (515-523), who in 517 presided with St. Avitus at the Council of Epaone; St. Lupus, a monk, afterwards bishop (535-42), probably the first archbishop, who when signing in 438 the Council of Orléans added the title of "metropolitanus"; St. Sardot or <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacerdos.html" title="Sacerdos">Sacerdos</a> (549-542), who presided in 549 at the Council of Orléans, and who obtained from King Childebert the foundation of the general hospital; St. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicetius_of_Lyon_7b6f.html" title="Nicetius of Lyon">Nicetius</a> or Nizier (552-73), who received from the pope the title of patriarch, and whose tomb was honoured by miracles. The prestige of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Nicetius_3e04.html" title="St. Nicetius">St. Nicetius</a> was lasting; his successor St. Priseus (573-588) bore the title of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">patriarch</a>, and brought the council of 585 to decide that national synods should be convened every three years at the instance of the patriarch and of the king; St. Ætherius (588-603), who was a correspondent of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Gregory_the_Great_3a31.html" title="St. Gregory the Great">St. Gregory the Great</a> and who perhaps consecrated <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Canterbury_bee9.html" title="Augustine of Canterbury">St. Augustine</a>, the Apostle of England; <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Aredius_10d6.html" title="St. Aredius">St. Aredius</a> (603-615); St. Annemundus or Chamond (c. 650), friend of St. Wilfrid, godfather of <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clotaire_III_f2b8.html" title="Clotaire III">Clotaire III</a>, put to death by <a href="../../../e/b/r/Ebroin.html" title="Ebroin">Ebroin</a> together with his brother, and patron of the town of Saint-Chamond; St. Genesius or Genes (660-679 or 680), Benedictine Abbot of <a href="../../../f/o/n/Fontenelle.html" title="Fontenelle">Fontenelle</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_almoner.html" title="Grand almoner">grand almoner</a> and minister of Queen Bathilde; St. Lambertus (c. 680-690), also Abbot of Fontenelle.</p>
<p>At the end of the fifth century Lyon was the capital of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Burgundy_7da9.html" title="Kingdom of Burgundy">Kingdom of Burgundy</a>, but after 534 it passed under the domination of the kings of France. Ravaged by the Saracens in 725, the city was restored through the liberality of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> who established a rich library in the monastery of Ile Barbe. In the time of St. Patiens and the priest Constans (d. 488) the school of Lyon was famous; Sidonius Apollinaris was educated there. The letter of Leidrade to Charlemagne (807) shows the care taken by the emperor for the restoration of learning in Lyon. With the aid of the deacon <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florus_of_Lyon_12e2.html" title="Florus of Lyon">Florus</a> he made the school so prosperous that in the tenth century Englishmen went thither to study. Under Charlemagne and his immediate successors, the Bishops of Lyon, whose ascendancy was attested by the number of councils over which they were called to preside, played an important theological part. Adoptionism had no more active enemies than Leidrade (798-814) and Agobard (814-840). When Felix of Urgel continued rebellious to the condemnations pronounced against Adoptionism from 791-799 by the Councils of Ciutad, Friuli, Ratisbon, Frankfort, and Rome, Charlemagne conceived the idea of sending to Urgel with Nebridius, Bishop of Narbonne, and St. Benedict, abbot of the monastery of Aniane, Archbishop Leidrade, a native of Nuremberg and Charlemagne's librarian. They preached against <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoptionism.html" title="Adoptionism">Adoptionism</a> in Spain, conducted Felix in 799 to the Council of Aachen, where he seemed to submit to the arguments of Alcuin, and then brought him back to his diocese. But the submission of Felix was not complete; Agobard, "Chorepiscopus" of Lyon, convicted him anew of Adoptionism in a secret conference, and when Felix died in 815 there was found among his papers a treatise in which he professed Adoptionism. Then Agobard, who had become Archbishop of Lyon in 814 after Leidrade's retirement to the monastery of St. Médard of Soissons, composed a long treatise which completed the ruin of that heresy.</p>
<p><a name="Agobard" id="Agobard"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Lyon_53b3.html" title="Edit section: Agobard">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Agobard</span></h3>
<p>Agobard displayed great activity as a pastor and a publicist in his opposition to the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> and to various superstitions. His rooted hatred for all <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstition.html" title="Superstition">superstition</a> led him in his treatise on images into certain expressions which savoured of Iconoclasm. The five historical treatises which he wrote in 833 to justify the deposition of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_Pious_e7e4.html" title="Louis the Pious">Louis the Pious</a>, who had been his benefactor, are a stain on his life. Louis the Pious having been restored to power, caused Agobard to be deposed in 835 by the Council of Thionville, but three years later gave him back his see, in which he died in 840. During the exile of Agobard the See of Lyon had been for a short time administered by <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalarius_of_Metz_25e8.html" title="Amalarius of Metz">Amalarius of Metz</a>, whom the deacon Florus charged with heretical opinions regarding the "triforme corpus Christi", and who took part in the controversies with Gottschalk on the subject of predestination. Amolon (841-852) and St. Remy (852-75) continued the struggle against the heresy of Valence, which condemned this heresy, and also was engaged in strife with Hincmar. From 879-1032 Lyon formed part of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Provence_c47c.html" title="Kingdom of Provence">Kingdom of Provence</a> and afterwards of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Kingdom_of_Burgundy_1280.html" title="Second Kingdom of Burgundy">second Kingdom of Burgundy</a>. When in 1032 <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_III_of_Burgundy_cf4c.html" title="Rudolph III of Burgundy">Rudolph III of Burgundy</a>, ceded his states to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_2fab.html" title="Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor">Conrad II</a>, the portion of Lyon situated on the left bank of the Saône became, at least nominally, an imperial city. Finally Archbishop Burchard, brother of Rudolph, claimed rights of sovereignty over Lyon as inherited from his mother, Mathilde of France; in this way the government of Lyon instead of being exercised by the distant emperor, became a matter of dispute between the counts who claimed the inheritance and the successive archbishops.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Lyon_53b3.html" title="Edit section: Saint Gebuin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Saint Gebuin</span></h3>
<p>Lyon attracted the attention of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_Hildebrand_5b6b.html" title="Cardinal Hildebrand">Cardinal Hildebrand</a>, who held a council there in 1055 against the simoniacal bishops. In 1076, as Gregory VII, he deposed Archbishop Humbert (1063-76) for <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simony.html" title="Simony">simony</a>. Saint Gebuin (Jubinus), who succeeded Humbert was the confidant of Gregory VII and contributed to the reform of the Church by the two councils of 1080 and 1082, at which were excommunicated <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manasses_I%2C_Archbishop_of_Reims_1ced.html" title="Manasses I, Archbishop of Reims">Manasses of Reims</a>, Fulk of Anjou, and the monks of Marmoutiers.</p>
<p>It was under the episcopate of Saint Gebuin that Gregory VII (20 April, 1079) established the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primacy.html" title="Primacy">primacy</a> of the Church of Lyon over the Provinces of Rouen, Tours, and Sens, which primacy was specially confirmed by <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callistus_II_0326.html" title="Callistus II">Callistus II</a>, despite the letter written to him in 1126 by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_VI_of_France_bd57.html" title="Louis VI of France">Louis VI</a> in favour of the church of <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sens.html" title="Sens">Sens</a>. As far as it regarded the Province of <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen.html" title="Rouen">Rouen</a> this letter was later suppressed by a decree of the king's council in 1702, at the request of Colbert, Archbishop of Rouen.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_of_Die_8c4d.html" title="Hugh of Die">Hugh of Die</a> (1081-1106), the successor of St. Gebuin, the friend of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Anselm_b8b0.html" title="St. Anselm">St. Anselm</a>, and for a while legate of Gregory VII in France and Burgundy, had differences later on with <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_III_6cd8.html" title="Victor III">Victor III</a>, who excommunicated him for a time, also with <a href="../../../p/a/s/Paschal_II_19d2.html" title="Paschal II">Paschal II</a>. The latter pope came to Lyon in 1106, consecrated the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilica.html" title="Basilica">basilica</a> of <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ainay.html" title="Ainay">Ainay</a>, and dedicated one of its altars in honour of the Immaculate Conception. The Feast of the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaculate_Conception_40bb.html" title="Immaculate Conception">Immaculate Conception</a> was solemnized at Lyon about 1128, perhaps at the instance of St. Anselm of Canterbury, and St. Bernard wrote to the canons of Lyon to complain that they should have instituted a feast without consulting the pope.</p>

<p>As soon as <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Becket_4204.html" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, had been proclaimed Blessed (1173), his cult was instituted at Lyon. Lyon of the 12th century thus has a glorious place in the history of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgy</a> and even of <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">dogma</a>, but the twelfth century was also marked by the heresy of Peter Waldo and the Waldenses, the Poor Men of Lyon, who were opposed by Jean de Bellème (1181-1193), and by an important change in the political situation of the archbishops.</p>
<p>In 1157 Emperor <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Barbarossa_8d47.html" title="Frederick Barbarossa">Frederick Barbarossa</a> confirmed the sovereignty of the Archbishops of Lyon; thenceforth there was a lively contest between them and the counts. An arbitration effected by the pope in 1167 had no result, but by the treaty of 1173 Guy, Count of Forez, ceded to the canons of the primatial church of St. John his title of count of Lyon and his temporal authority.</p>
<p>Then came the growth of the Commune, more belated in Lyon than in many other cities, but in 1193 the archbishop had to make some concession to the citizens. The 13th century was a period of conflict. Three times, in 1207, 1269, and 1290, grave troubles broke out between the partisans of the archbishop who dwelt in the château of Pierre Seize, those of the count-canons who lived in a separate quarter near the cathedral, and those of the townsfolk. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_X_7b12.html" title="Gregory X">Gregory X</a> attempted, but without success, to restore peace by two Acts, 2 April, 1273, and <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a> <a href="../../../1/2/7/1274.html" title="1274">1274</a>. The kings of France were always inclined to side with the commune; after the siege of Lyon by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_X_of_France_9a76.html" title="Louis X of France">Louis X</a> (1310) the treaty of 10 April, 1312, definitively attached Lyon to the Kingdom of France, but, until the beginning of the 15th century the Church of Lyon was allowed to coin its own money.</p>
<p>If the 13th century had imperilled the political sovereignty of the archbishops, it had on the other hand made Lyon a kind of second Rome. Gregory X was a former canon of Lyon, while Innocent V, as <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_of_Tarantaise_1333.html" title="Peter of Tarantaise">Peter of Tarantaise</a>, was Archbishop of Lyon from 1272 to 1273. <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocent_IV_dc48.html" title="Innocent IV">Innocent IV</a> and Gregory X sought refuge at Lyon from the Hohenstaufen, and held there two general <a href="../../../c/o/u/Councils_of_Lyon_cfa9.html" title="Councils of Lyon">councils of Lyon</a>. Local tradition relates that it was on seeing the red hat of the canons of Lyon that the courtiers of Innocent IV conceived the idea of obtaining from the Council of Lyon its decree that the cardinals should henceforth wear red hats. The sojourn of Innocent IV at Lyon was marked by numerous works of public utility, to which the pope gave vigorous encouragement. He granted <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indulgence.html" title="Indulgence">indulgences</a> to the faithful who should assist in the construction of the bridge over the Rhône, replacing that destroyed about 1190 by the passage of the troops of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_I_of_England_89e8.html" title="Richard I of England">Richard Cœur de Lion</a> on their way to the Crusade. The building of the churches of St. John and St. Justus was pushed forward with activity; he sent delegates even to England to solicit alms for this purpose and he consecrated the high altar in both churches.</p>
<p>At Lyon were crowned <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_V_8057.html" title="Clement V">Clement V</a> (1305) and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXII_2681.html" title="Pope John XXII">Pope John XXII</a> (1310); at Lyon in 1449 the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipope_Felix_V_c923.html" title="Antipope Felix V">antipope Felix V</a> renounced the tiara; there, too, was held in 1512, without any definite conclusion, the last session of the schismatical <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Pisa_5c79.html" title="Council of Pisa">Council of Pisa</a> against <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_II_fba4.html" title="Julius II">Julius II</a>. In 1560 the Calvinists took Lyon by surprise, but they were driven out by Antoine d'Albon, Abbot of Savigny and later Archbishop of Lyon. Again masters of Lyon in 1562 they were driven thence by the Maréchal de Vieuville. At the command of the famous Baron des Adrets they committed numerous acts of violence in the region of Montbrison. It was at Lyon that <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_IV_of_France_71ad.html" title="Henry IV of France">Henry IV of France</a>, the converted Calvinist king, married <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_de_Medicis_f2d3.html" title="Marie de Medicis">Marie de Medicis</a> (9 December, 1600).</p>

<p>The principal Archbishops of Lyon during the modern period were: Guy III d'Auvergne, Cardinal de Bologne (1340-1342), who as a diplomat rendered great service to the Holy See; <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_Jean_de_Lorraine_ad99.html" title="Cardinal Jean de Lorraine">Cardinal Jean de Lorraine</a> (1537-1539); Hippolyte d'Este, Cardinal of Ferrara (1539-1550), whom king <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_I_of_France_1152.html" title="Francis I of France">Francis I of France</a> named <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_protector.html" title="Cardinal protector">Cardinal protector</a> of the crown of France at the court of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_III_fefa.html" title="Pope Paul III">Pope Paul III</a>, and a patron of scholars; Cardinal François de Tournon (1550-1562), who negotiated several times between Francis I and <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Charles_V_039a.html" title="Emperor Charles V">Emperor Charles V</a>, combated the Reformation and founded the Collège de Tournon, which the Jesuits later made one of the most celebrated educational establishments of the kingdom; Antoine d'Albon (1562-1574), editor of Rufinus and Ausonius; Pierre d'Epinac (1573-1599), active auxiliary of the League; Cardinal Alphonse Louis du Plessis de Richelieu (1628-1563), brother of the minister of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIII_of_France_261e.html" title="Louis XIII of France">Louis XIII</a>; Cardinal de Tencin (1740-1758); Antoine de Montazet (1758-1788), a prelate of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jansenist.html" title="Jansenist">Jansenist</a> tendencies, whose liturgical works will be referred to later, and who had published for his seminary by the Oratorian Joseph Valla, six volumes of "Institutiones theologicæ" known as "Théologie de Lyon", and spread throughout Italy by Scipio Ricci until condemned by the Index in 1792; Marbeuf (1788-1799), who died in exile at Lübeck in 1799 and whose vicar-general Castillon was beheaded at Lyon in 1794; Antoine Adrien Lamourette (1742-1794), deputy to the Constitutional Assembly, who brought about by a curious speech (7 July, 1792) an understanding between all parties, to which was given the jesting name of "Baiser Lamourette", and who was constitutional Bishop of Lyon from 27 March, 1791, to 11 January, 1794, the date of his death on the scaffold. Among the archbishops subsequent to the Concordat must be mentioned: Joseph Fesch under whose episcopate <a href="../../../p/i/u/Pius_VII_3f9c.html" title="Pius VII">Pius VII</a> twice visited Lyon, in November 1804, and April, 1805, and in 1822 the Society for the Propagation of the Faith was founded; Maurice de Bonald (1840-1870), son of the philosopher; Ginoulhiac (1870-1875), known by his "Histoire du dogme catholique pendant let trois premiers siècles".</p>
<p>At the end of the old regime the primatial chapter consisted of 32 canons, each able to prove 32 degrees of military nobility; each of these canons bore the title of Count of Lyon. The Chapter of Lyon has the honour of numbering among its canons four popes (<a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocent_IV_dc48.html" title="Innocent IV">Innocent IV</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_X_7b12.html" title="Gregory X">Gregory X</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/n/Boniface_VIII_7b63.html" title="Boniface VIII">Boniface VIII</a>, and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_V_8057.html" title="Clement V">Clement V</a>), 20 cardinals, 20 archbishops, more than 80 bishops, and finally 3 persons of officially recognized sanctity: St. Ismidon of Sassenage, later <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Die_00bf.html" title="Bishop of Die">Bishop of Die</a> (d. About 1116), Blessed Louis Aleman and Blessed François d'Estaing, later Bishop of Rodez (d. In 1501).</p>
<p>The city of Lyon numbered 5 collegiate churches and the diocese 14 others. There were 4 chapters of noble canonesses. The Jesuits had at Lyon the Collège de la Trinité, founded in 1527 by a lay confraternity which ceded it to them in 1565, the Collège Notre Dame, founded in 1630, a house of probation, a professed house, and other colleges in the diocese. Convents were perhaps more numerous here than in any other part of France. The Petites Ecoles founded in 1670 by Démia, a priest of Bourg, contributed much to primary instruction at Lyon. Since the law of 1875 concerning higher education Lyon possesses Catholic faculties of theology, letters, sciences, and law.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Lyon honours as saints: <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Epipodius_1736.html" title="St. Epipodius">St. Epipodius</a> and his companion St. Alexander, probably martyrs under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Aurelius_49af.html" title="Marcus Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>; the priest St. Peregrinus (third century); St. Baldonor (Galmier), a native of Aveizieux, at first a locksmith, whose piety was remarked by the bishop, St. Viventiolus; he became a cleric at the Abbey of St. Justus, then subdeacon, and died about 760; the thermal resort of "Aquæ Segestæ", in whose church Viventiolus met him, has taken the name of St. Galmier; St. Viator (d. About 390), who followed the Bishop, St. Justus, to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebaid.html" title="Thebaid">Thebaid</a>; Sts. Romanus and Lupicinus (fifth century), natives of the Diocese of Lyon, who lived as solitaries within the present territory of the Diocese of St. Claude; St. Consortia, d. about 578, who according to a legend, criticized by Tillemont, was a daughter of St. Eucherius; St. Rambert, soldier and martyr in the seventh century, patron of the town of the same name; Blessed Jean Pierre Néel, b. in 1832 at Ste. Catherine sur Riviere, martyred at Kay-Tcheou in 1862.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerson.html" title="Gerson">Gerson</a>, whose old age was spent at Lyon in the cloister of St. Paul, where he instructed poor children, died there in 1429. <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Francis_de_Sales_aae6.html" title="St. Francis de Sales">St. Francis de Sales</a> died at Lyon, 28 December, 1622. The Curé Colombet de St. Amour was celebrated at St. Etienne in the seventeenth century for the generosity with which he founded the Hôtel-Dieu (the charity hospital), also free schools, and fed the workmen during the famine of 1693.</p>
<p>M. Guigue has catalogued the eleven "<a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermit.html" title="Hermit">hermitages</a>" (eight of them for men and three for women) which were distinctive of the ascetical life of Christian Lyon in the Middle Ages; these were cells in which persons shut themselves up for life after four years of trial. The system of hermitages along the lines described by Grimalaius and Olbredus in the ninth century flourished especially from the eleventh to the thirteenth century, and disappeared completely in the sixteenth. These hermitages were the private property of a neighbouring church or monastery, which installed therein for life a male or female recluse. The general almshouse of Lyon, or charity hospital, was founded in 1532 after the great famine of 1531 under the supervision of eight administrators chosen from among the more important citizens.</p>
<p>The institution of the jubilee of St. Nizier dates beyond a doubt to the stay of <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocent_IV_dc48.html" title="Innocent IV">Innocent IV</a> at Lyon. This jubilee, which had all the privileges of the secular jubilees of Rome, was celebrated each time that Low Thursday, the feast of St. Nizier, coincided with 2 April, i.e. whenever the feast of Easter itself was on the earliest day allowed by the paschal cycle, namely 22 March. In 1818, when this coincidence occurred, the feast of St. Nizier was not celebrated. But the cathedral of St. John also enjoys a great jubilee each time that the feast of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John_the_Baptist_a353.html" title="St. John the Baptist">St. John the Baptist</a> coincides with <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpus_Christi_40eb.html" title="Corpus Christi">Corpus Christi</a>, that is, whenever the feast of Corpus Christi falls on 24 June. It is certain that in 1451 the coincidence of these two feasts was celebrated with special splendour by the population of Lyon, then emerging from the troubles of the Hundred Years' War, but there is no document to prove that the jubilee indulgence existed at that date. However, Lyonnese tradition places the first great jubilee in 1451; subsequent jubilees took place in 1546, 1666, 1734 and 1886.</p>
<p>"Among the Churches of France", wrote St. Bernard to the canons of Lyon, "that of Lyon has hitherto had ascendancy over all the others, as much for the dignity of its see as for its praiseworthy institutions. It is especially in the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Office_50b5.html" title="Divine Office">Divine Office</a> that this judicious Church has never readily acquiesced in unexpected and sudden novelties, and has never submitted to be tarnished by innovations which are becoming only to youth".</p>
<p>In the 18th century Bishop Montazet, contrary to the Bull of <a href="../../../p/i/u/Pius_V_abd7.html" title="Pius V">Pius V</a> on the Breviary, changed the text of the Breviary and the Missal, from which there resulted a whole century of troubles for the Church of Lyon. The efforts of Pius IX and Cardinal Bonald to suppress the innovations of Montazet provoked great resistance on the part of the canons, who feared an attempt against the traditional Lyonnese ceremonies. This culminated in 1861 in a protest on the part of the clergy and the laity, as much with regard to the civil power as to the Vatican. Finally, on 4 February, 1864, at a reception of the parish priests of Lyon, <a href="../../../p/i/u/Pius_IX_676f.html" title="Pius IX">Pius IX</a> declared his displeasure at this agitation and assured them that nothing should be changed in the ancient Lyonnese ceremonies; by a Brief of 17 March, 1864, he ordered the progressive introduction of the Roman Breviary and Missal in the diocese. The primatial church of Lyon adopted them for public services 8 December, 1869. One of the most touching rites of the ancient Gallican liturgy, retained by the Church of Lyon, is the blessing of the people by the bishop at the moment of Communion.</p>
