	    <p>The link to Shadow from this page goes to the phenomenon of light, not the Jungian concept of Shadow. I hope someone will have the knowledge and energy to correct this.</p>
<hr />
<p>Very, very easygoing approach to archetypes: for Jung, there are 4 archetypes: Self, Shadow, Animus &amp; Anima. Anyone can check in "Man and his symbols" or in classic books by June Singer and Anthony Storr, as well as on Jung's linx online <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 22:05, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Isn't the Persona an archetype as well? And is the Shadow in fact technically an archetype? From my reading, the Shadow is a complex, formed by the social environment, but connected to the archetype of "the enemy".</p>

<p>I couldn't quite figure out what two parts of this article were trying to say. The first, which mentions the misuse of "archetype" for "prototype", "stereotype", and "epitome", immediately precedes a list of "examples". It isn't clear whether these are supposed to be prototypes, stereotypes, epitomes, or some combination of the three. Unless it's the last (which I doubt — how are any of these "epitomes"?), this should be clarified.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. We need to collectively determine whether or not these two sentences are correlated and edit once we've collectively arrived at some sort of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>: "Archetype is sometimes broadly and misleadingly used to refer to a prototype, a stereotype or an epitome. It may thus indicate a type of person, e.g. a mother, a father, a hero, a warrior or a martyr." First, we're saying what archetypes are <i>not</i>, and then giving examples of a mother, father, hero, warrior, or martyr. Are these archetypes, prototypes, stereotypes, and/or epitomes? What <i>-types</i> are they? Specifically:</dd>

<dd>I say that a Archetype is a standard accepted type. In other words an example of what is considered standard for whatever something is a type of. A stereotype is what people automatically expect when they first encounter soemthing, regardless of the fact. A prototype is the first example of that type. For example, Superman is considered a Stereotypical super powered hero, like hercules and achilles, but he is ALSO a Prototype of comic characters.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Comics characters encounter many things that are VERY different from tradition heroes that came before, thus prototypes had to be formed for them. Superman was an adaptation of a traditional type of character into a non tradition genre.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what epitomes mean, but I'll check that out. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorrupt_one_8b41.html" title="User:Corrupt one">Corrupt one</a> 00:29, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You raise a couple interesting points, <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorrupt_one_8b41.html" title="User:Corrupt one">Corrupt one</a>. Superman is a derivative prototype of other heroes. A savior, not the savior, but one who rescues, one who saves. And since Superman has been popularized for greater than a half century, I would argue that he can be referred to as an archetype. You write above that "A prototype is the first example of that type." Wrong. An archetype is the first example. The first orginal model on which all other prototypes are copied. Let me put it this way: <b>Archetype</b> = The architect of the blueprint; <i>Prototype</i> = an early working model of that blueprint. But, for reference, a <i>Prototype</i> is synonomous with <i>Archetype</i>, as evidenced by the dictionary description from Webster:</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Main Entry: pro·to·type<br /></i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Pronunciation: 'prO-t&amp;-"tIp<br /></dd>
<dd>Function: noun<br /></dd>
<dd>Etymology: French, from Greek prOtotypon, from neuter of prOtotypos archetypal, from prOt- + typos type<br /></dd>
<dd>1&#160;: an original model on which something is patterned&#160;: ARCHETYPE<br /></dd>
<dd>2&#160;: an individual that exhibits the essential features of a later type<br /></dd>
<dd>3&#160;: a standard or typical example<br /></dd>
<dd>4&#160;: a first full-scale and usually functional form of a new type or design of a construction (as an airplane)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, as we see above in definitions 1-3 of <i>prototype</i> as indicated above defines the synonomous relationship with archetype in which we're trying to understand. And then, as you can see in definition 4, the meaning of prototype leaps from the blueprint, it takes it just one step further...it takes us to the moon because Saturn V became a reality. Definition 4 will aptly describe the first prototypical man-made nuclear fusion reactor (there are a few in development...they are prototypes...all other nuclear power plants are fission, not fusion). If something is archetypical, it's the absolute first, if something is prototypical, it's a working model. If something is typical, it's a copy. Granted, I believe archetype and prototype can certainly be interchangeable, but I like to reserve archetype to being the absolute first, the arch, the overarching idea, person, concept, or idea. Pro - to - type ... "pro"... to do. To implement. Like professional. One who implements. So, we have somewhat of an evolution of meaning here. Types. Archetype. Archetypal. Prototype. Prototypical. Type. Typical. Catching my drift? Let me know what you find out about epitome. You might want to check some psych lit. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 17:14, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Actualy, you have it a bit wrong. If an archtype is the first of its type, then each archtypical character is therefore the first of its type, which goes against everything that has been said so far.</p>
<p>I agree with 1, in the way that it says it is an original model on which something is patterned. If something is patterned on it, then it becomes the archetype of that something, the main and most basic example of it. Numbers 2 and 4 I accept without explaination. Number 3 is something I will be thinking about.</p>
<p>I have also noticed you did NOT include the definition of archtype from that dictionary as well, in order to compare the definitions.</p>
<p>I will give you this, and only this so far: A prototype can be considered to be the first of that archtype, and is THUS the archtype of it. However, not ALL archtypes are prototypes! <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorrupt_one_8b41.html" title="User:Corrupt one">Corrupt one</a> 05:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether that idea originated from Jung, but Joseph Campbell always said that in dreams, water symbolises the unconscious mind. He talks about that in episode 1 of his "The Power of Myth" interviews.</p>
<p>More disturbing still is that some of the examples are ones Jung himself elaborated on as being archetypes.</p>

<p>I cut the below list from the article, as it is awkwardly written (what noun does "by reviewing history" modify?), makes unsubstantiated claims (as I can think of characters that are neither male nor female and I myself do not identify with any of the listed archetypes), and appears to be plagiarized from "The Complete Writer's Guide to Heroes and Heroines":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By reviewing history, myth, legend, movies, literature and the world around us, 16 master archetypes have been created, 8 male and 8 female. At core, every well-defined hero or heroine falls under one of these archetypes. Because they are so widespread in real life and fiction, we unconsciously identify with each one. HERO: The Chief The Bad Boy The Best Friend The Charmer The Lost Soul The Professor The Swashbuckler The Warrior HEROINE: The Boss The Seductress The Spunky Kid The Free Spirit The Waif The Librarian The Crusader The Nurturer</p>

<p>The "Cultural archetypes analysis" section says that "archetypes" are "psychologies" that have "infiltrated mass thought". I think it is trying to say that some branches of cultural analysis use archetypes to explain (perhaps sociological) behavior, but I'm not familiar with the topic so I hesitate to copyedit that (unsourced) content.

Thank you. I did delete it, but not for lack of appreciation. I think the brilliance of Johnny Depp is that I can't think of a single archetype that Sparrow really conforms to. He's not the trickster, as he's too unwitting in his own success, and he's also got elements of the reluctant hero and the man-child. And he's a drunk.

<p>I find this page confusing in that it first promises archetypes in the context of psychology AND literature, and then restricts itself to psychology. Should there be a separate page for literary archetypes? I added a disambiguation link for literary archetypes that takes you to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_characters.html" title="Stock characters">stock characters</a>, although I am not sure that said page is sufficient to cover the concepts of archetypes in literature.

<dd>I see no reason why we have to spin it off for disambiguation. As it stands in the article, the word's usage is prominently depicted first and foremost in the etymological context, its place in the literary world (of which psychology has contributed greatly to), and finally psychological usage, which conveys a scientific and humanistic approach to understanding archetype's role. I think this article has adequately captured the two primary functions of the word — I agree more examples of archetypes would be a wonderful addition. This could be expanded greatly, but I think it should be done here (until it gets too big or too confusing). For instance, in the current edition of the article, Shakespeare is the preeminent example (archetypical in and of himself), but there must be other individuals that, with explanation, can offer us excellent examples of archetypes, i.e. Greek / Roman myths, fairy tales, legends, biblical or other canonical types / characters (fictional or otherwise), classical lit, historical (founding fathers type stuff), innovators / inventors, geniuses, contemporary popular culture icons, and so on. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a>, I echo your call for <b>comparative lit scholars</b> to contribute, and <b>anyone else</b> who can take a quality run with this stuff in any of these areas to shed more light upon our prized word, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archetype.html" title="Archetype">archetype</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 21:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you even read the etymology section? "The usage of psychological archetype reveals that it was advanced by Jung in c. 1919 and generally adopted in the social sciences (see Jungian archetypes section below), although the study of archetype frameworks has undergone multiple academic treatments and applications." Psychological archetypes were advanced long after archetype had a definition. Literature was around long before Jung's archetype. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 01:48, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I have. The term is a term useful in the study of psyche - ie psychology, including when studying a character in literature. It's irrelevant as to when Jung adopted the term for his writings. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 03:58, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You imply that archetypes are foremost a part of psychology, and then pertain to literature as a subcategory. This is wrong. As <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> said, this page should do justice to archetypes as a facet of both psychology and literature. Removing any reference to literature in the introduction is confusing and harmful. Jung's work draws heavily on literature, particularly mythology, and is as useful in the study of writing as it is in psychology. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 04:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

The Steely-Eyed Missile Worker has an encyclopedic body of knowledge of the mechanical and electrical fields of discipline, which comprise the technical expertise relating to the components of a rocket’s structural and dynamic systems functionally organized as electrical, mechanical, or propulsion systems. If allowed, the Steely-Eyed Missile Worker could independently trouble-shoot and fix any resolvable anomalous issue that afflicts his rocket. He can readily identify any such issue through use of diagnostic equipment or his own senses. He “knows the rocket” and is familiar enough with the sound, look, and smell of his rocket, that he notices when any of these are “out-of-family” and further investigates the variance from the norm. The Steely-Eyed Missile Worker has a vast array of technical skills correlating to his technical knowledge. He applies these skills quickly and efficiently, taking a high degree of pride in the craftsmanship of his work. Against significant political pressure, he takes the time required to do the job correctly. His work ethic is above reproach. When the mission needs require it, he will work through breaks and lunch for double digits of hours, and will sustain this for double digits of days. The Steely-Eyed Missile Worker will work day and night and sacrifice his family time, sleep, physical comfort and well-being, in order to maintain the launch schedule. Without batting an eye, the Steely-Eyed Missile Worker will work in an exposed very high space or confined space, in close proximity to explosive and or toxic components or materials. Steely-Eyed Missile Worker nobly remains quiet, but rolls his eyes, while he remains unknown and unacknowledged, while the fruits of his labor, the glory and accolades pour forth onto people in suits, some of whom he’s never seen before. If anything goes awry, Steely-Eyed Missile Worker may see his name in the newspaper, or find himself in the unemployment line, if he survived the anomalous incident. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.121.251.215 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.121.251.215_757d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.121.251.215">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Relevance to this article, anon?? If you like, create a List of archetypes/stereotypes article where you can put Jung's archetypes and a whole nested structure of other archetypes (or stereotypes since many seem to think archetype=stereotype) identified in mythology, literature and in motion picture. I don't think the exhaustive list belongs in this article. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 01:30, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a>. There are thousands of archetypes, the most important of which are already described in this article. The Steely-Eyed Missile Worker is not an important one that advances our understanding of archetype in literature or psychology above and beyond what we already know. Even though it's a new one to me, respectfully, it doesn't hold relevance here. Make a new article for that one. And register on Wikipedia.

<li>I just wanted to add a slight point of disagreement with the comparison between "Neo" from the Matrix and Gilgamesh that appears at the beginning of the section on literature and archetypes. I personally feel that this comparison is completely without merit. Perhaps I would be less inclined to think so if the contributer had provided an argument, even a sentence-long one, for his/her claim. I have always understood Neo to be a Christ-like figure, in the sense of his redemptive capacity for humankind. Although Gilgamesh certainly shared Christ's "quest" for eternal life, there are large differences in the style and quality of the outcome of said "quest." And while I would strongly characterize both Christ (Neo) and Gilgamesh as hero archetypes, Christ (and Neo) are more definitely savior/hero types.

<dl>
<dd>Yep, I see what you're saying. I can't remember who added that or why, and I'm too lazy to thumb through the page history...doesn't matter. Yeah, instead of Neo, why not Luke Skywalker (even though he kissed his sister), or Indiana Jones, or Jack Ryan, or Frodo for crying out loud. Who cares about Neo as a savior archetype? I don't. The Matrix was an alright film—not the best ever—but ok. The Matric trilogy as a whole was lame. No resistance from me if you want to delete the Neo reference, or modify it somehow. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 21:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to know where the "Steely-Eyed Missile Worker" is from. I have never noticed one. An Archtype is a type of character to me; extras in the background or non characters, as they have no character of their own.</p>
<p>I believe that a before something can be called an archtype, examples have to be provided, and to have what they are an archtype of specified. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorrupt_one_8b41.html" title="User:Corrupt one">Corrupt one</a> 02:29, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>... does not belong on this page. Archetypes are types of <i>literary characters,</i> not real people. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 13:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that Michael Jackson shouldn't be included. Not notable enough to me, but others may disagree. But I certainly disagree with the notion that archetypes are purely fictional or literary characters. That's simply not the case. Select adjectives point to how individuals may be titled as derivatives of the archetypes themselves, for instance "Shakespearean" (relating to Shakespeare), "Adamic" (relating to Adam), the pronoun "prophetic" - of or relating to the prophets, or if we say someone is "a veritable Tarantino" or "the Lee Iacocca of our day", or "the modern-day Ghandi", all archetypal labels based on real people, active as metaphors by virtue of their established archetype. An archetype is not just <i>an</i> example — it is <i>the</i> prime example. Fictional archetypes are essential in our culture. They shape us and our children to be sure. But what better archetypes are there to have other than real people, those who have lived and died, those whose legacy lives on, notoriously or otherwise? Imagine that. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 18:03, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That makes a lot of sense. Certainly archetypes are often based on real people. What I meant to say is more that real people, although they can be described as fitting an archetype, aren't appropriately described as examples of them (unless, of course, the person IS the archetype). To do so could be potentially disparaging and unverifiable. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 19:07, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
