<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcadia_University_50cf.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The school was founded in <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaver%2C_Pennsylvania_cc75.html" title="Beaver, Pennsylvania">Beaver, Pennsylvania</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>. By <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a> it had attained collegiate status, under the auspices of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Episcopal_Church_1306.html" title="Methodist Episcopal Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a>, and was named <b>Beaver College</b>. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> Beaver College moved east to <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenkintown%2C_Pennsylvania_725b.html" title="Jenkintown, Pennsylvania">Jenkintown, Pennsylvania</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, the school acquired the current campus in Glenside. The college operated both the Jenkintown and Glenside campuses into the mid-1960's, when it consolidated all activities onto the Glenside campus.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2001.html" title="July 2001">July 2001</a>, upon attaining university status, Beaver College officially changed its name to Arcadia University. It was thought that a new name would emphasize the school's position as one of the top small institutions of higher learning on the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Coast_of_the_United_States_0292.html" title="East Coast of the United States">East Coast</a>, and would cement its change in designation from "<a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a>" to "<a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a>." The decision was also made in part to shed its association with the former commonly derided name. As then-president Bette Landman noted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"[The name] <i>too often elicits ridicule in the form of derogatory remarks pertaining to the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaver.html" title="Beaver">rodent</a>, the TV show '<a href="../../../l/e/a/Leave_It_to_Beaver_40dd.html" title="Leave It to Beaver">Leave It to Beaver</a>' and the vulgar reference to the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html#B" title="Sexual slang">female anatomy</a></i>."</dd>
</dl>
<p>During the subsequent years, memorabilia from the former name became very popular for Arcadia students to give as gifts.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcadia_University_50cf.html" title="Edit section: Undergraduate programs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Undergraduate programs</span></h2>
<p>The university offers over 50 fields of study, in 8 academic departments, in its undergraduate programs. The academic departments are Business Administration and Economics, Computer Science and Mathematics, Education, Fine Arts, the Humanities, Sciences &amp; Pre-Health, the Social Sciences and inter-disciplinary programs.</p>

<p>Graduate and professional studies at Arcadia University range widely from the liberal arts to the primarily professional, from the doctoral level to workshops. Arcadia's international perspective is reflected in programs such as its accelerated part-time MBA with an International Perspective, its Master of Arts in International Peace and Conflict Resolution and its new program in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Graduate_School_of_International_Relations_and_Diplomacy_f6ea.html" title="American Graduate School of International Relations and Diplomacy">Paris, France</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcadia_University_50cf.html" title="Edit section: International Programs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">International Programs</span></h2>
<p>The university is known for its <a href="../../../s/t/u/Study_abroad.html" title="Study abroad">study abroad</a> programs. Nearly 95% of undergraduates at Arcadia study in another country at least once during their college careers.</p>
<p>Arcadia's commitment to a global education has gained wide recognition. Open Doors 2005, the Institute of International Education’s annual census, lists Arcadia University in fourth place—nationally—among masters institutions, ranked by “undergraduate participation in study abroad”—with a rate higher than all doctoral institutions.</p>
<p>In the 2006 edition of its magazine, Arcadia was able to announce that "strategic growth finds Arcadia adding a graduate school campus in Paris, forging a new study abroad program in China, setting up a Physician Assistant program in Delaware and opening a peace center in Tanzania". These and other successful projects were rewarded in 2006—declared the Year of Study Abroad by the U.S. Congress—when Arcadia’s creation of an integrative learning environment infused with international and multicultural experiences has earned it the prestigious 2006 Senator Paul Simon Award for Campus Internationalization from NAFSA, the Association of International Educators.</p>
<p>Also in 2006, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education approved Arcadia’s proposal to establish an additional location in Paris and to extend its accreditation to cover the Masters in International Relations and Diplomacy offered in the French capital by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Graduate_School_of_International_Relations_and_Diplomacy_f6ea.html" title="American Graduate School of International Relations and Diplomacy">American Graduate School of International Relations and Diplomacy</a> (AGSIRD) an institution created in 1994 by an enthusiastic group of international lawyers, scholars and diplomats, in partnership with the University of Paris 11.</p>

Women's sports teams include basketball, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball. Rugby is a popular but unofficial campus sport.

The station went through periods of inactivity followed by great student interest, however by the time the school's name change took place, WBVR was not operational. In 2004, students managed to generate a great deal of interest in the radio station again. By the fall of 2005, student membership had increased to over 30, and then in March 2006 started broadcasting live on the internet. The Arc plans to return to radio broadcasting when a station in the vicinity of the college becomes available.</p>
