<p>Archibald "Archie" Andrews debuted in <i>Pep Comics</i> 22 (December, 1941), and six decades later, he is still a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">redheaded</a> 17-year-old.</p>

Love triangle: Veronica, Archie, Betty</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Archie lives in <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdale_%28Archie_Comics%29_22a7.html" title="Riverdale (Archie Comics)">Riverdale</a>, attends <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">Riverdale High</a> and is the only son of Mary Andrews and mid-level business executive Fred Andrews.</p>
<p>Archie is a typical small-town average teenager. He studies in Riverdale High School, and he is also a lead singer of The Archies band. Generous, well-mannered, but clumsy, he is genuinely liked by many of his friends. Unfortunately, Archie is a bit of a womanizer and always tries to score dates with many beautiful girls. He is the center of the eternal love triangle/quadruple between <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veronica_Lodge_c1ee.html" title="Veronica Lodge">Veronica Lodge</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Cooper_6f41.html" title="Betty Cooper">Betty Cooper</a>, and sometimes with <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Blossom_ae66.html" title="Cheryl Blossom">Cheryl Blossom</a>. His best friend is Jughead Jones, who has been his friend since they were kids. He is also a great athlete who excels in sports such as football, basketball, baseball and hockey.</p>
<p>Archie often takes odd jobs to pay for his various projects and his dates. Archie is a good fellow, but he often acts clumsily, coming in conflict with Veronica's father <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Lodge_c7ca.html" title="Hiram Lodge">Hiram Lodge</a> and Riverdale High's principal, <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Weatherbee_46e5.html" title="Mr. Weatherbee">Waldo Weatherbee</a>. As the lead singer of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Archies_6146.html" title="The Archies">The Archies</a></i>, Archie performs with Betty, Veronica, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggie_Mantle_0bd8.html" title="Reggie Mantle">Reggie Mantle</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/g/Jughead_Jones_0a59.html" title="Jughead Jones">Forsythe Pendleton "Jughead" Jones</a>.</p>

In <i>Pep Comics</i> #22, Archie was "Chick", a name later given to Betty's older brother, Chic.</div>
</div>

<p>A number of the comic book stories have revealed the Andrews family's origins in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, with "Andy Andrews" immigrating to the United States and befriending <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moose_Mason_c9fd.html" title="Moose Mason">Moose Mason</a>'s Russian ancestor, who was immigrating at the same time. Archie has been depicted wearing the traditional <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilt.html" title="Kilt">kilt</a> of his ancestors and playing <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagpipes.html" title="Bagpipes">bagpipes</a> (but not very well).</p>
<p>In addition to having many <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobby.html" title="Hobby">hobbies</a>, Archie is passionate about his car. For decades, he was shown driving a 1916 <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Model_T_913a.html" title="Ford Model T">Ford Model T</a> jalopy called "Betsy." Betsy was destroyed in <i>Life With Archie</i> #238 (Sep '83), after Archie had Dilton Doiley install a rocket-propelled motor for a race. A test run destroyed the jalopy, but was replaced by a brand new hot rod won in a raffle by Archie's friends. In a story where Archie tried to have his jalopy insured, he described it as being a "<a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford.html" title="Ford">Ford</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevy.html" title="Chevy">Chevy</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_%28automobile%29.html" title="Plymouth (automobile)">Plymouth</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierce-Arrow_f619.html" title="Pierce-Arrow">Pierce-Arrow</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packard.html" title="Packard">Packard</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/DeSoto_%28automobile%29_96f6.html" title="DeSoto (automobile)">DeSoto</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson_Motor_Car_Company_4d0f.html" title="Hudson Motor Car Company">Hudson</a>..." The insurance agent originally thought Archie wanted to insure several cars, but then Archie explained that his jalopy was "a collection of replacement parts from several junkyards", with some parts of the car dating back to 1926.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Archie acquired a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Mustang_816d.html" title="Ford Mustang">Ford Mustang</a>.</p>
<p>In one story from Archie Double Digest #175, Archie met Supro, a human from the planet Astromid. Supro is a brown-haired teen wearing orange pants, a blue jacket with a yellow shirt underneath, and brown shoes. Supro uses the ability to control the minds of other people (except those that have a combination of red hair and freckles like Archie, who had a resistance to it) and make them do his Astromidian pledge, which is "I pledge allegiance to the planet Astromid and bow to all that Astromidian superiority". Supro also has the ability to make other people's shoes and socks stuck to the floor when he says "chontz", which it worked well against Archie. Also in that story, Archie gave Supro a hot dog with mustard on it. Supro believed that mustard was called "blorg" to anyone on his home planet, Astromid, thus the mustard on his hot dog had dissolved Supro in seconds.</p>
<p>On a story from Pals 'N' Gals Double Digest #108, Archie told Betty that a painting was missing from the Riverdale Museum, pointing out that it was not destroyed, but stolen by an antogonist named Machine Master himself, or one of his "mechanical people". Machine Master was also armed with a cane that fires the "incinerator ray".</p>

<p>Archie often greets his friends at <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Tate_f9de.html" title="Pop Tate">Pop Tate</a>'s Chocklit Shoppe. This <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_shop.html" title="Soda shop">soda shop</a>, a frequent hangout of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie%27s_Gang_6f13.html" title="Archie's Gang">Archie's Gang</a>, was based on real-life locations frequented by teenagers in <a href="../../../h/a/v/Haverhill%2C_Massachusetts_ddc0.html" title="Haverhill, Massachusetts">Haverhill, Massachusetts</a>, during the 1930s -- Crown Confectionery and the Chocolate Shop on Merrimack Street and the Tuscarora on Winter Street.</p>
<p>Bob Montana went to high school in Haverhill from 1936 to 1939, and his sketchbook, an illustrated diary of life in Haverhill, was the true origin on Archie and his friends. Montana's daughters once made pages from this sketchbook available online.</p>
<p>Several real-life residents of Haverhill became characters in Montana's creation, such as Arnold Daggett, the model for Moose, and Skinny Linehan (Jughead). At a 1989 reunion of Montana's classmates, Daggett said that he recognized himself in one strip "where I was getting kicked out of class."</p>
<p>Miss Grundy was inspired by school librarian Elizabeth Tuck, while Haverhill High School principal Earl McLeod was the basis for Mr. Weatherbee. Montana knew the Massachusetts' Brahmin political family, the Lodges, because he had once painted a mural for them; he combined that name with actress <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veronica_Lake_1e54.html" title="Veronica Lake">Veronica Lake</a> to create the character of Veronica Lodge. Betty was based on Montana's girlfriend in New York.</p>
<p>After four years in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Signal_Corps_b973.html" title="U.S. Army Signal Corps">U.S. Army Signal Corps</a>, Montana returned in 1946 to launch the <i>Archie</i> newspaper comic strip, which he drew until his death in 1975.</p>

<p>Montana's characters were heard on radio in the early 1940s. <i>Archie Andrews</i> began on the Blue Network on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, switched to Mutual in 1944, and then continued on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> from 1945 until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">September 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>.

Archie's relationships over 60 years</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Initially, when Archie was known as "Chick", he was trying to woo the <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_next_door.html" title="Girl next door">girl next door</a> Betty Cooper for his object of affection. Initially, Betty only considered him as an annoying red head neighbour. When Veronica came to Riverdale, "Chick" switched his attention to her, leading Betty to jealousy. She then tried to win "Chick"'s affection back.</p>
<p>It is hard to decide which one Archie truly loves: Betty or Veronica. Because of his famous indecision between the girls, the terminology of Betty and Veronica syndrome is now being coined.</p>

Betty and Veronica fighting over Archie</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Archie says in many occasions and stories that he considers Betty to be his best friend, someone that he can confide in, and is more comfortable with her. But on other occasions, he likes going on a date with Betty. Even when Jughead asked him whether he likes kissing Betty, Archie blushly answered yes. With Betty sporadically dating <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Blossom_ed39.html" title="Jason Blossom">Jason Blossom</a> currently, he shows a tinge of jealousy. Archie also admitted on several occasions that whenever he wants to have his ego lifted up, he comes to Betty who will shower him with affection.</p>
<p>Archie also considers Veronica to be his girlfriend. Beautiful, stylish, and not to mention one of the richest girls in Riverdale, Veronica can easily manipulate him, and although he sometimes realizes it, he cannot do anything about it. Archie is always fighting for her affection, especially with other boys and his main rival, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggie_Mantle_0bd8.html" title="Reggie Mantle">Reggie Mantle</a>. Archie admits for some unexplained reason that Veronica can always take control over him. Sometimes he can be his own man, sometimes he can't (variants of this revelation exist as a result of differing writers).</p>

The day before the play was scheduled to open, Archie Comics issued a cease and desist order threatening litigation if the play proceeded as written. <i>"The play was to depict Archie and his pals from Riverdale growing up, coming out and facing censorship.
