<li>Vote to keep; while the term is certainly ridiculous (in my opinion), we shouldn't use that as a basis for removing the article. This article provides valid information about this term, and would be useful to people looking up 'cybofree'. Anyone else would not even know it existed, and would thus not be bothered by it in any way. --<a href="../../../j/h/o/User%7EJholman_d00c.html" title="User:Jholman">Jeff</a> 22:47, Jun 1, 2004 (UTC)

<li>This completely ignores the real argument: the article should be deleted because the term has no currency whatsoever beyond the two people who wrote a paper about it. WP does not exist for the promotion of their invention. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 23:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<li>Delete. A term a couple of academics made up in hopes that other people would adopt it. Google returns 17 hits for "cybofree", every last one of them associated with the Manoj and Azariah. -- Let me explain that invention of neologisms is very common in some fields. It is a form of advertising: every time someone mentions the neologism, it reflects well on the authors. There are hundreds of academic journals, and they generate many neologisms every year, the vast majority of which do not enter common use. Until someone comes up with some evidence, we should consider "cybofree" an idiosyncratic neologism. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E.

The very purpose of WIKIPEDIA or any encyclopaedia is to enable people to find obscure or rare terms on any given subject. In this context, Cybofree is a relatively new term in the area of cyborgs. The journal in which it has been published&#160;;<a href="http://http://www.biol.tsukuba.ac.jp/~macer/EJAIB.html" class="external text" title="http://http://www.biol.tsukuba.ac.jp/~macer/EJAIB.html" rel="nofollow">Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics</a> is a well respected and credible journal. You don't just delete it assuming that the author wishes to advertise. Deletion would be justified only if the purpose of the internet is to prevent new information; however rare or crazy, from reaching the people.Please read and understand what a term means before blatantly deciding it's worth. This is a request, not an argument. <a href="../../../v/r/m/User%7EVRmanoj_f520.html" title="User:VRmanoj">VRmanoj</a> 20:36, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>D</b>elete. The referenced paper is a proposal for this new term, which does not seem to have been adopted in the relevant fields. The paper seems to have been peer-reviewed in the field of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioethics.html" title="Bioethics">bioethics</a>, so perhaps a new title could be found, and the article written as more than a stub. As it stands it seems to relate to psychology more than bioethics. --<a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZigger_b33b.html" title="User:Zigger">Zigger</a> 04:01, 2004 Jun 6 (UTC)</li>

<li>Almost an interesting concept, but its a very subjectively written page, and has no real basis yet. It also fails to clearly state what Wikipolice are, just alludes to thier necissity and formation. Definately at least move, perhaps delete. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siroxo</a> 22:42, Jun 1, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>So gentlemen, I work and you just vote for deletion! Moreover, you are using gobbledygook like vandalism (an editor who initiated hundreds of enclycopedic articles is, <i>by definition</i> not a vandal) and <i>oh golly</i>. What is the purpose of Wikipedia if contributors write, and Wikipolice deletes. You see the point? This proves that the page is <i>badly</i> needed. So, <i>gentle</i>men, just thhhinkkkk again, before you offer VfD, with a stress on thinking not on your POV&#160;:O)!
<ul>
<li>It sound like you would be more at home with the editorial policies at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>, so if you don't think the people here will give you the chance to write the article as you want it, why not just go there? This certainly doesn't seem to be accomplishing anything with your time. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> 23:28, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<li>No thank you, <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a>! Redirection is not a good, constructive, genuine authoring policy. Have gone through months of research only to see my criticism of Conventional Medicine dismissed in a second by an imbecile, and put beyond Wiki traffic. If Wiki has articles on tampons and fists, which do nothing to improve the Wikipedian image, Wikipolice is here to stay, for it certainly improves it - and they need their own police&#160;:O) Besides, I'd rather lose a bit to earn a lot of my time, in the "tolerance with the wolves is cruelty to the lambs" line of thought&#160;:O) - <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">irismeister</a> 23:36, 2004 Jun 1 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Couldn't redirection be good? If there we a positive and a negative article for a topic then the reader would be forced to consider both and make up his own mind. Articles could still have review, and be improved, but the problem of wikipolice with a totally different worldview would not exist. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> 23:50, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>No vote yet. I moved it to Wikipedia:Wikipolice, on the grounds that it is not encyclopedic but may deserve more than 5 minutes consideration on meta.

<li>Not sure what to do with this but it doesn't belong in namespace. Certainly not vandalism.It <i>is</i> POV and original research, but Irismeister does make a few good points.

<dd>Delete, of course, for reasons given above. I'm afraid I see it as almost but not <i>quite</i> eligible for speedy delete, because: I can't find a separate VfD debate on Mind-Brain.com; the discussions on Shawn Mikula and Mind-Brain.com were sufficiently mixed up that reviewing Template:VfD-Shawn_Mikula it's not 100.00000% clear that there was consensus on Mind-Brain.com; and the titles and content of the two articles are very similar but not absolutely identical. Title and text are close enough for speedy delete had there really been a well-articulated consensus on Mind-Brain.com, as opposed to "throw 'em both out." Text of old Mind-Brain.com article was (reformatted for compactness, external link omitted)
<dl>
<dd>Mind-Brain.com is a brainchild of Shawn Mikula which was established in 2002 to develop, implement and support a wide range of neuroinformatics tools, services, databases, and information, and to foster communication and collaboration between neuroscientists, scientists from other fields, technicians, and engineers for the purposes of facilitating and accelerating the development of neuroscience and neurotechnologies. Objectives: Core Objective: To develop neuroscience and neurotechnologies with the intent of using them as tools for the enhancement and expansion of normal healthy human consciousness. Tangential Objectives: 1) To increase public awareness of the potentials offered by neuroscience and to educate the lay public in neuroscience matters; 2) To bring together highly motivated and competent scientists and other individuals for the purpose of achieving our core objective. 3) To provide useful neuroscience services, tools, databases, and information for the facilitation of neuroscience research.</dd>

<li>If this is a Mikula article, it needs to go swiftly due to its author's prior declaration that his content was not licensed under the GFDL.

<dd>The issue was that, back in the first Mikula flareup, this user posted a bunch of articles that mentioned Shawn Mikula. The articles were kept for a while, but eventually the mentions of Shawn Mikula were taken out by various editors. This user then claimed that, unless the articles kept their mention of Shawn Mikula, Wikipedia did not have permission to use his copyrighted material. The pages were all deleted at this point, as sort of a good faith "Oh, you ddn't quite understand the GFDL" thing. My view is that this action means that it is uncertain whether a given contribution by this user is GFDL or not, and that we need to err on the side of "no lawsuit". <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:35, Jun 3, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete, because the article is <b>useless.</b> Entire content is "The Department of Botany at Guelph carries out research and teaching in Botany," plus a link. You don't have to go to Wikipedia to know that any big university has a department of botany, or to find out what such a department does. Anyone who wants Guelph's published Web information can find it easily via Google. Since the topic itself is not obviously encyclopedic, having a stub placeholder contributes nothing. Anyone who knows enough <i>notable</i> things about this department to write an article about it can just go ahead and write it at any time; it's not as if this stub gives them a useful head-start or will serve as a reminder that we really need such an article. Someone could write a bot to generate thousands of such articles. "The Department of Zoology at the University of Wisconsin carries out research and teaching in Zoology." "The Yale department of Genetics carries out research and teaching in Genetics." "The Case Western Reserve department of Economics carries out research and teaching in Economics." These statements are close to being vacuously true. Almost-vacuously-true statements are not encyclopedic. If, say, the University of Wisconsin School of Agriculture operated an ice-cream store, now <i>that</i> would be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 14:54, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
