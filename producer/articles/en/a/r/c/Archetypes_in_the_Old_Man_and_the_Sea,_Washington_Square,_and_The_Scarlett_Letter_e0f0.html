<p>In order to succeed a person must set personal goals and live up to them. Personal goals are a vital part of life and without them a person is hopelessly lost without guidance. Characters from the novels The Scarlet Letter, Washington Square, and The Old Man and the Sea, all exhibit a desire to fulfill a personal goal. Each of these individuals carries out and accomplishes his goals in ways such as: revenge, control, and a desire for redemption. Characters traits that reoccur throughout various novels are called archetypes which is defined as “Insert Dictionary Definition” (Dictionary 1). Personal goals are the derivity by which the essence of human life is supported. Life is sustained by a desire to achieve greatness by striving towards a goal or motive.</p>
<p>Roger Chillingworth is a villain who is fanatical about finding the true father of his wife's illegitimate child. “. . . Chillingworth's position is the most paradoxical of all. As the betrayed husband, the injured party, he claims our sympathy. Yet through dedicating his life to revenge, he becomes the worst sinner of all . . .” (GreenhavenSL 62). Hester Prynne is involuntarly made to leave her home country due to her husband's desire to emigrate (Twayne 64). Prynne has an affair with a man whom she truly loves where upon she is instructed by the town leaders to prominently display a scarlet letter placed upon her bosom (Twayne 64). Chillingworth first makes his appearance in the crowd of onlookers who are watching the public shaming of Hester Prynne. Chillingworth at that moment makes it his personal mission to find out the identity of Prynne's lover (Twayne 16).</p>
<p>Retribution and retaliation become the centerfold of Chillingworth's goals. It consumes him. Hawthorne contends that “Chillingworth becomes guilty of what Hawthorne saw as the unpardonable sin by probing Dimmesdale's heart without sympathy, under the guise of ministering to him as a physician, until he comes close to murdering him, both physically and spiritually” (GreenhavenSL 71). Chillingworth hastily discovers that Dimmesdale is likely hiding something and moves on in his initial hypothesize to further dote upon it. He moves in with Dimmesdale so that he can procure and take his own look at the man that he thinks has wronged him (Hawthorne 60).Johnson states that "Chillingworth uses his "black art" to control Dimmesdale, the target of his vengeance" (Johnson 155). His motives have changed from finding out who had wronged him to devastating the life of another man. Chillingworth enjoyed learning before arriving in the New World but even that has changed. Chillingworth had been described as “"a man well stricken in years, a pale, thin, scholar-like visage, with eyes dim and bleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books" (65). . . "a man of thought, the bookworm of great libraries (78)”.(Johnson 17). Even when he married Hester, this man of the study and laboratory already had a humped back. His deformity of body finally represents a deformity of character in which heart and soul play little part. As a result, he becomes at last bent over toward the ground, more like a snake than a human being.</p>
<p>Santiago is an elderly, old man that is part of the traditional Cuban fishing villages (Hemingway 10). Unique among the people, "Santiago's self-reflective quality--his articulation of his own essence as he unravels the mystery of his sea-life, his visible world, and the world of his spirit--makes him unique among Hemingway's protagonists" (Waggoner). Santiago is a fisherman that is unable to catch enough fish (Hemingway 9). The old man had a little boy who befriended him. Santiago took him under his wing and mentored him the ways of fishing. The boy's parents looked down upon Santiago because of his shortcomings in catching fish and considered him “salao”, which is the worst form of unlucky” (Hemingway 9). “The boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.” (Hemingway 9). Santiago decides that he must embark upon a personal journey in order to prove himself to the boy, the boy's parents the other fishermen and also himself (Tyler 130).</p>
<p>As a result of the skepticism of the boy's parents, the old man sails far out into the sea to wrestle with the sea and the elements of nature (Tyler 130). After some time the man hooks a marlin, one of the great fish, and battles with it (Hemingway 43). Throughout his epic journey the man is forced to contend with sharks, fatigue, cuts and sores, loss of equipment, and the deficiency of food. “The giant marlin is a sympathetic character for whom the old man develops a certain fondness and the sharks who destroy all but the marlin's skeleton are villains whom he detests: the astonishing fact remains that one human being is enough to make a genuine narrative” (Bloom 22). The marlin is also on his own journey: a journey to survive and to escape the bite of the old man's fishing hook but the man is determined to outlast him (Bloom 63).</p>
<p>In the book Washington Square, Dr. Arthur Sloper possesses extensive knowledge and the people of the area consider him to be one of the unparalleled physicians of the time period (James 2). His wife and son had died, one a victim of child birth, the other a fatality of a childhood adversity (James 3). Before dying, Sloper's wife had a simplistic daughter, Catherine, who is contrary to everything Mrs. Sloper is and everything which she embodies (James 3-4). Catherine's "plain looks and lack of charm have fated her to be unloved even by her own family" ("'Heiress' Is a Plain" D04).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Sloper cruelly compares her to his beautiful late wife, and calculates that his daughter will only be loved for her money. This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy after Catherine engages in a hasty romance with the comely Morris Townsend (Jeffries Thaiss), full of charisma but reckless with money. Dr. Sloper catches onto his avarice right away and forbids the match, whisking Catherine off for an unhappy six months in Europe, where he chases after the ghost of his dead wife ("'Heiress' Is a Plain" D04).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Sloper entangles himself into his daughter's love affair in an demeaning and overbearing manner ("'Heiress' Is a Plain" D04). “Dr. Sloper has never forgiven Catherine for causing the death of his beautiful, beloved wife in childbirth, and for being, unlike her mother, homely. She grows up mocked and bullied by her father, yet his obedient, adoring slave” (Simon 1).</p>
<p>Throughout each respect novel all of the characters strive to achieve their personal goals. Dr. Arthur Sloper 's and Roger Chillingworth's personal goals are driven by an external force or person. Chillingworth is propelled by an ever growing desire to revengeful avenge the person who wronged him. Dr. Sloper is bent on controlling and micromanaging his daughter's life. Both of these men are pursuing their personal goals for the wrong reasons. If each of these men were to step away from the lives in which they live and examine the situation from a far, they might actually be able to see the problems in their relationships. Time is consumed chasing after harmful and trivial pursuits. Both Dr. Sloper and Roger Chillingworth work admittedly to tear the essence of human life from other human beings. Santiago on the other hand is on a different track as far as personal goals are concerned. He is a man that has lost one of his exceptional friends. He must prove to the boy's parents that he truly is a man of worth. Santiago's goal is internally driven and that is the reason that he sails to far out into the ocean, wrestles with the marlin, grapples with the sharks, and escapes the grips of hunger. He understands that friendship and camaraderie is more important than any materialistic pleasure that the world has to offer.</p>
<p>Personal goals help to set the scene for a novel. A character can be internally and also externally driven by factors that the reader cannot see without close examination. A man can use the goals that he has set and is driven be to influence and change the lives of a multitude of people around him but to the same extent man can also tear at the flesh of human existence such as in Chillingworth's case. Each characters idiosyncrasies thrust them through a world which is affected by their ambitions.</p>
