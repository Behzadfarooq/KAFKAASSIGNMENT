<p>The world in which Jesus lived was volatile, marked by cultural and political dilemmas. Culturally, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> had to grapple with the values and philosophy of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenism.html" title="Hellenism">Hellenism</a>, and the imperialism of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, together with the paradox that their <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> applied only to them, but revealed universal truths. This situation led to new interpretations of the Torah, influenced by Hellenic thought and in response to Gentile interest in Judaism.</p>
<p>All of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">land of Israel</a> belonged to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> at the time of Jesus' birth. It was directly ruled by the <a href="../../../i/d/u/Idumea.html" title="Idumea">Idumaean</a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html" title="Herod the Great">Herod the Great</a> who was appointed King of the Jews in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> in <a href="../../../3/9/_/39_BC_4583.html" title="39 BC">39 BC</a>/BCE by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Antony_ea43.html" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octavian.html" title="Octavian">Octavian</a>.

He combined <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaria.html" title="Samaria">Samaria</a>, and <a href="../../../i/d/u/Idumea.html" title="Idumea">Idumea</a> into <a href="../../../i/u/d/Iudaea_Province_84e3.html" title="Iudaea Province">Iudaea Province</a> which was placed under direct Roman administration and supervision by a Roman <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefect.html" title="Prefect">prefect</a> who appointed a Jewish High Priest for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod%27s_Temple_07a6.html" title="Herod's Temple">Herod's Temple</a> in Jerusalem. This situation existed, more or less, till <a href="../../../6/4/_/64.html" title="64">64</a> and the start of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Jewish_Revolt_f7b1.html" title="Great Jewish Revolt">Great Jewish Revolt</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilee.html" title="Galilee">Galilee</a>, where Jesus grew up according to the Gospels, remained under the jurisdiction of another of Herod's sons, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_Antipas_f79b.html" title="Herod Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetrarch.html" title="Tetrarch">Tetrarch</a> of Galilee and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perea.html" title="Perea">Perea</a>, from <a href="../../../4/_/b/4_BC_45c3.html" title="4 BC">4 BC</a>/BCE to <a href="../../../3/9/_/39.html" title="39">AD/CE 39</a>.</p>
<p>At this time Jesus' childhood hometown of Nazareth (Hebrew, <i>Natserath</i>) was, as revealed by archaeology, a tiny hamlet of a few hundred inhabitants. It had no <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">synagogue</a>, nor any public buildings. No gold, silver or imported goods have been found in it by archaeological excavation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a>, within 1st-century Judaism there were several sects, primarily the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadducees.html" title="Sadducees">Sadducees</a>, closely connected with the priesthood and the Temple, and the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, who were teachers and leaders of the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">synagogues</a>. They resented Roman occupation, but, according to historian Shaye Cohen (1988), were in Jesus' time relatively apolitical. In addition, isolated in small communities from these main groups, by choice, some even taking to remote desert caves in anticipation of the <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_times.html" title="End times">end times</a>, lived the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>, whose theology and philosophy are thought, by some scholars, to have influenced Jesus and/or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>.</p>
<p>Many Jews hoped that the Romans would be replaced by a Jewish king (or <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>) of the line of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_David_1375.html" title="King David">King David</a>â€”in their view the last legitimate Jewish regime. Most people at that time believed that their history was governed by God, meaning that even the conquest of Judea by the Romans was a divine act. Therefore the Romans would be replaced by a Jewish king only through divine intervention. Some, like John the Baptist in the first half of the century, and Yehoshua ben Ananias in the second half, claimed that a <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_God_9f58.html" title="Kingdom of God">messianic age</a> was at hand. Josephus' <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Antiquities_98a8.html" title="Jewish Antiquities">Jewish Antiquities</a> book 18 states there was a "fourth sect", in addition to Sadducees, Pharisees and Essenes, which scholars associate with those he called <a href="../../../z/e/a/Zealotry.html" title="Zealotry">Zealots</a>. They were founded by <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_of_Galilee_61cb.html" title="Judas of Galilee">Judas of Galilee</a> and Zadok the Pharisee in the year 6 against <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quirinius.html" title="Quirinius">Quirinius</a>' tax reform and "agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord." (18.1.6) They believed that the kingdom should be restored immediately, even through violent human action, and advocated direct action against the Romans. Roman reaction to the Zealots eventually led to the destruction of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod%27s_Temple_07a6.html" title="Herod's Temple">Herod's Temple</a> by <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vespasian.html" title="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> in August of <a href="../../../7/0/_/70.html" title="70">AD/CE 70</a> , and the subsequent decline of the Zealots, Sadducees and Essenes.</p>
<p>Some scholars have asserted that, despite the depictions of him as antagonistic towards the Pharisees, Jesus was a member of that group. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_EPSaunders"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_JesusBackground_52ef.html#endnote_EPSaunders" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_JesusBackground_52ef.html#endnote_EPSaunders" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span> See also <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html#.22Pharisees.22_and_Christianity" title="Pharisees">Pharisees and Christianity</a></p>

<p>Most scholars agree the Gospels were written shortly before or after the destruction of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod%27s_Temple_07a6.html" title="Herod's Temple">the Jewish Temple</a> by the Romans. According to most critical historians, Jesus probably lived in <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilee.html" title="Galilee">Galilee</a> for most of his life and he probably spoke <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>. Many have sought to reconstruct Jesus's life in terms of contemporaneous political, cultural, and religious currents in Israel, including differences between Galilee and Judea; between different sects such the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadducees.html" title="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>, and in terms of conflicts among Jews in the context of Roman occupation.</p>
<p>The Gospels record that Jesus was the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazarene.html" title="Nazarene">Nazarene</a>, but the meaning of this word is vague.<sup id="_ref-marginal_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-marginal" title="">[1]</a></sup> Some scholars assert that Jesus was himself a Pharisee.<sup id="_ref-JesusPharisee_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JesusPharisee" title="">[2]</a></sup> In Jesus' day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were the <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_the_Elder_502d.html" title="Hillel the Elder">House of Hillel</a> and the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Shammai_d682.html" title="House of Shammai">House of Shammai</a>. Jesus' assertion of hypocrisy may have been directed against the stricter members of the House of Shammai, although he also agreed with their teachings on divorce (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010:1-12;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010:1-12;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">Mark 10:1-12</a>).<sup id="_ref-Neusner_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Neusner" title="">[3]</a></sup> Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a) concerning the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shema_Yisrael_2a94.html" title="Shema Yisrael">greatest commandment</a> (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012:28-34;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012:28-34;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">Mark 12:28-34</a>) and the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethic_of_reciprocity.html" title="Ethic of reciprocity">Golden Rule</a> (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:12;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:12;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">Matthew 7:12</a>).

See <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus_53d0.html" title="Cultural and historical background of Jesus">Cultural and historical background of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_of_Jesus_ecb6.html" title="Aramaic of Jesus">Aramaic of Jesus</a> for more about Israel in Jesus' day and what effect this may have had on his life.</p>
<p>Examining the New Testament account of Jesus in light of historical knowledge about the time when Jesus was purported to live, as well as historical knowledge about the time during which the New Testament was written, has led several scholars to reinterpret many elements of the New Testament accounts. Of special interest has been <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament_1c55.html" title="Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament">the names and titles ascribed to Jesus</a>. <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a></i> (which is a title and not a part of his name) is an Anglicization of the Greek term for <i><a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a></i>, and literally means "anointed one". Historians have debated what this title might have meant at the time Jesus lived; some historians have suggested that other titles applied to Jesus in the New Testament (e.g. Lord, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_man.html" title="Son of man">Son of Man</a>, and Son of God) had meanings in the first century quite different from those meanings ascribed today: see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_8e8c.html" title="Names and titles of Jesus">Names and titles of Jesus</a>. The <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Enlightenment_2fd3.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> and the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_Revolution_7d9c.html" title="Scientific Revolution">Scientific Revolution</a> brought skepticism regarding the historical accuracy of these texts. Although some critical scholars, including archeologists, continue to use them as points of reference in the study of ancient Near Eastern history<sup id="_ref-archeology_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-archeology" title="">[7]</a></sup> others have come to view the texts as cultural and literary documents, generally regarding them as part of the genre of literature called <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a>, an account of a holy person regarded as representing a moral and divine ideal. Hagiography has a principal aim of the glorification of the religion itself and of the example set by the perfect holy person represented as its central focus.</p>
