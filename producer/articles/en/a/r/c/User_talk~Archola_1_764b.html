<p>I promise not to use the nick name again but it was a new one to me and it really made me laugh. Don't worry no one will get the wrong idea as thanks to the sock thing they all know I'm a married woman! I've just ignored Raisinman as he's obviously got an agenda that doesn't include improving the article.

<dd>Sorry for barging in, but I'm just curious how you can be so sure they're not linked when the only articles <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobeaston99_838b.html" title="User:Robeaston99">User:Robeaston99</a> has edited are <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Steadman_9c22.html" title="Robert Steadman">Robert Steadman</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> (a vote) and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> (a vote), articles very related to User:Robsteadman and even the name Robeaston is similar to Robsteadman, yet in the case of Deskana where he uses a public IP address that has been found vandalising before you were so sure he was the culprit. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and all, no doubt, I'm just curious how this is so much more of a clear-cut case than Deskanas which you pursued and rob wants a permanent ban for. --<a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscillate_1952.html" title="User:Oscillate">Oscillate</a> 19:23, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did SOPHIA come to a judgement about the vandalism, or is she simply acting as an advocate for Rob? I'll let her answer the question; I just think we should be clear. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O. La</a> 20:21, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was going off her comments where she certainly seems very suspect (and continues to be) about Deskana's role in the vandalism; but with Robeaston whose edits have 100% <i>only</i> been Robsteadman-related (including two votes where Robsteadman also voted), you all are sure there is no link, not even a tiny discussion. To be clear, I'm not pursuing anything, nor do I want to start an accusation - I'm just confused. <strike>Is this to avoid hassle with rob or what?</strike> --<a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscillate_1952.html" title="User:Oscillate">Oscillate</a> 20:29, 2 March 2006 (UTC) -- <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, clearly. --<a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscillate_1952.html" title="User:Oscillate">Oscillate</a> 20:35, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we all agree there's a link, we're just not sure if the link is direct or indirect. I've tried to be consistent about both issues (and fair to both sides), so my own position is that for both Robeaston99 and Deskana, there was a link, but it was an indirect link. That's a hypothesis (not a conclusion) that is amenable to further evidence. Beyond that, I can only let others speak for themselves. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O. La</a> 20:37, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I resent the above accusations that I am linked to robeaston99 - particularly from DESKANA after his recent vandalism of my page ()be honest, you were responsible). I have no idea whjo robeaston99 is and I do not operate a sockpuppet. Now kindly retract your accusations and insinuations. After deskana's vandalism and the quorum/cabal calls and strangers turning up to supprt the unebncyclopedic version on the vote this is outrageous. And all a bit familiar from the way you all tried to get rid of SOPHIA. Robsteadman 22:31, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fine, I retract. The bigger issue is the perceived irregularaties of the current vote, an assertion that both sides have made. BTW I never tried to get rid of SOPHIA, in fact I helped to encourage her to come back. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<dd>I really didn't want to go into this as I think there is nothing to be gained but more bad feeling all round. I have done this job professionally and so maybe I'm being too impersonal about this - sysadmins do not AGF in these situations - they check all available facts and see how they stack up with the account of the user. Let's just say that if I had access to the logs I could confirm some aspects of his account where he has been a bit vague or contradicted himself about being logged on/not having time to log on. I have met initial responses to investigations like this before and experience has taught me that it usually means they are hedging their bets as they are not sure what you can find out. I might have jumped to conclusions but his lack of apology to Rob and his initial "tough it out" stance did not do him any favours in my view. Neither did the fact that he admitted to knowing about the vandalism from that IP but did nothing about it - I don't think he ever thought it could be linked back to an IP he had access to - it was his bad luck that a previous checkuser had revealed the location of the IP address. Even more bad luck for him was that I put two and two together. The guy is young so this all may be mistakes due to inexperience. I have seen Deskana wind Rob up - maybe you have to be on the other side to realise some of his posts are just one line comments that flame the debate without adding content. I have not said anything as Rob is a grown up and as I said before Deskana is still quite young. I also wonder what Deskana said to his friend to make him think it would be funny to put notices about being homosexual and a friend of jesus on Rob's user page. To completely exonerate him is naive and I suspect if this happened to some of the editors who have been supportive of Deskana they would feel differently. Interestingly enough - the only person who has nasty messages on their page about this is me. As they say "shoot the messenger". I'm also not happy that because Rob has different views to most of the editors and they have been frustrated by him no one thought he was due an apology. I have seen a lot of support for Deskana but I was the one who had to point out that he owes Rob an apology. Courtesy shouldn't be restricted along partisan lines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the Robeaston99 - I have said I would be surprised if it was a sock purely because I grant Rob more intelligence than to be that obvious - he works in a school so has access to IP's other than his own and he has seen all the Giovanni/SOPHIA sock stuff so is fully aware of what checks can be done and what will ring alarm bells.</dd>

<dd>I've just been edit clashed - Rob - Archola is not one of the ones I think you are angry with. I would be pretty fed up if I'd been vandalised and everyone was saying supportive words to the person either directly or indirectly responsible but Archola does not belong in that group. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> 23:11, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I did appear as sort of a character witness at Deskana's trial. Deskana is young (17) and I think that even if it was his friend who was guilty, it would be good if Deskana were to apologize for being indirectly responsible. This is the sort of thing that "builds character" (I hated when my father used that phrase, but I've grown old and wise enough to understand the sentiment). <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>Hiya, Arch. As it seems, <b>I</b> seem to have pinpointed the problem. It's been <b>told</b> to everyone now that Rob had sockpuppets. Can <b>you</b> believe it? I can't say I was <b>so</b> surprised.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I can speak no less than that I saw it coming. I knew something like this was bound to happen. My only query is, why only 24 hours? For someone who sockpuppeted to rig a vote (and to create his own vanity article), he got the same punishment as a 3RR violation. In fact, he's had worse 3RR punishments than this.</p>
<p>Honestly, you and CTS have worked the hardest on this page, is there a process for naming official moderators for a single Talk page?

<dd>Due process is one thing, and getting what is due is another. In fact, they are both what I'm trying to champion right now. If Rob is taken to ArbCom, those of us who believe he should leave will get to present our cases. Those who take a neutral stance, like you, can provide evidence as well. And those who are on his side, including he himself, get to present cases again. Go take a look at one of the cases at <a href="../../../a/r/b/WP%7EARBCOM_80fd.html" title="WP:ARBCOM">WP:ARBCOM</a>. The process is very, very fair, and acts in due process. It gives him a chance to defend himself but also gives Wikipedia a chance to render a verdict and end the issue, whether it means to allow him to stay, or to vote him off the island.</dd>

<p>The goal is to have a knowledgebase on christianity from a distinctly "C(hristian)POV" rather than the NPOV.</p>
<p>I know you are busy but I am actively seeking new sysops/admins to help me build this site up, and I would be positively thrilled if you could contribute in any capacity whatsoever. ((unsigned| Nsandwich}}</p>

<p>Hi Arch, the anonymous change to the Sacramental Union article was strongly in favor of the Real Presence, but his/her addition to the article was not NPOV. Notice that I will no longer say POV because POV is not necessarily bad. NonNeutralPointOfView is bad in my view. I think that this author was saying that the ELCA denied the Real Presence. BTW, I followed the link that you put on that article's talk page and was shown a "not available" page.

<p>Hello, Arch, I am with you on the relative conservatism/liberalism of the anonymous editor. I used to be ultra-conservative in my early years when we had the 70s split in the LCMS. My edits to this article rejecting the idea that sacramental union=consubstantiation is as conservative a position that anyone can come to: outside of the fact that it is true. I remember that Roman Catholics were told that the Lutheran position was consubstantiation. Then there was impanation too, which is an analogy to incarnation. In impanation the body and blood of Christ becomes bread in the same way as the "Word was made flesh." The Roman Catholics rightly brand that as heresy in the New Catholic Encyclopedia. Of course, that is my POV, but POV is not bad as long as it is not NNPOV! <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 14:47, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Archola, I just got back from a several day vacation, and after reading all that stuff from him on CTSW's talk page, is there some big problem or something with this person I should know about? <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 16:21, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is interesting that your pastor described your position as "consubstantiation," and to tell you the truth that idea is really close to the Lutheran position. From my understanding it is connected with this "local presence": having the body and blood present like regular food. It is "really" present and "physically" present to be eaten and drunk. Our LCMS 1943 expanded catechism states that it is "sacramentally" present. We reject a "spiritual presence" as the Reformed churches understand that present because they reject that we really eat and drink Christ's body and blood. Another way of describing it is that his body and blood are "supernaturally" present. The point is that everyone who eats and drinks the sacramental bread and wine eats and drinks in, with, and under the forms of them, the body and blood of Christ. Your pastor was 100% right when he said as you pointed out: "How this happens, we were told, was not revealed by God, and was thus a divine mystery beyond human understanding." That is why we do not say "consubstantiation" because that doctrine of William of Occam says too much. I think, though, that you were taught your catechism well. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 17:35, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course, Arch, more research needs to be done. I am interested, so I will do it. I think you have put your finger on the truth when you said that it was "broad": it is the position of William of Okham I believe. You don't like too much speculation, so it wouldn't be to your liking. It would not be to Luther's liking either. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 01:16, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Have you read Daniel Boyarin's <i>A Radical Jew</i>? Boyarin is a professor of TYalmud I think at Berkeley, and the book is on Paul in the Jewish/Hellenic context. If you are interested in the split between Jews and christians, I think you would find this a very thoughtful and interesting book. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 11:00, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Boyarin is brilliant, and he is a serious scholar, but his book <i>is</i> making an argument and is therefore arguable. If you want something on topic that is more careful (conservative) scholarship, I highly recommend chapter six of Shaye Cohen's <i>The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties (Hellenistic Culture and Society)</i> (University of California Press), which is entitled "Judaizing" or something like that. Cohen scrutinizes all of the primary sources available and draws whatever conclusions he thinks are justified, and makes it clear when the sources prevent one from arriving at a definitive conclusion. I think you will find it very interesting and useful. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:31, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We started a proposal <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely.</p>
<p>Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> with your suggestions on the policy. We have two subpages: Arguments and Sections. You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well...</p>

<p>Due to the change of Indiana from no daylight savings time to daylight savings time, Pulaski County had to choose a time zone -- Eastern or Central Daylight. The problem: some school districts cross county lines out there. So some students would be an hour ahead of the others. (and more headaches) The state threatened to sue if they excepted themselves from the switch. So they pronounced themselves a county without an official time zone. Anyone can set the clock the way they wish. Let the games begin! --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 21:46, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I got mad over things, but I got over it. I like to get along with others, and after I've had a little tussle with them, I'm over it. To quote Shakespeare: "You are yokèd with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire, who, much enforcèd, shows a hasty spark, and straight is cold again. (Julius Caesar IV.3.109-112). I cannot quit while I am just beginning! <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">Drboisclair</a> 21:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a {{fact}} tag wher I think you need cites. Let me know if you need assistance. BTW: I've kind of given up on the Adam and Eve page, Codex's edits made a mess of it with his Coptic/Rasta man interpretations and OR. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 18:22, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Try simple google (or Yahoo) searches. For example, tree+good+evil+fruit+fig, returned <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=tree%2Bgood%2Bevil%2Bfruit%2Bfig&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t-315&amp;x=wrt" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=tree%2Bgood%2Bevil%2Bfruit%2Bfig&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t-315&amp;x=wrt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> of which <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/t/tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/t/tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> would be a good starting place.
