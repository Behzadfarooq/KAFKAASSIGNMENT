The Babri Mosque site was one of the fourteen sites examined during this project. After a gap of many years since the ecavations the BB Lal led ASI team claimed in the Rashtriya Swayam-sevak Sangh (RSS) magazine Manthan in October 1990 of having found the pillar-bases of what may have been a temple at the site which must have belonged to a larger building than the Babri Mosque.</p>
<p>The team of archaeologists of the ASI, led by B.B. Lal, found rows of pillar-bases which must have belonged to a larger building than the Babri Mosque.</p>
<p>Accordingly, archaeological findings of burnt bases of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Column.html" title="Column">pillars</a> made of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brick.html" title="Brick">brick</a>, a few metres from the mosque indicated that a large temple stood in alignment with the Babri Mosque since the 11th century. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In a trench at a distance of four metres south of the mosque, parallel rows of pillar-foundations made of brick-bats and stones were found. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Professor Gupta later commented on the findings of the period prior to 1990: "Several of the temple pillars existing in the mosque and pillar- bases unearthed in the excavations conducted in the south of the mosque (although in the adjoining plot of land) show the same directional alignment. This will convince any student of architecture that two sets of material remains belong to one and the same complex.“ <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>In July 1992, eight eminent archaeologists (among them former ASI directors Dr. Y.D. Sharma and Dr. K.M. Srivastava) went to the Ramkot hill to evaluate and examine the findings. These findings included religious sculptures and a statue of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>. They said that the inner boundary of the disputed structure rests, at least on one side, on an earlier existing structure, which “may have belonged to an earlier temple”. (Indian Express, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">4 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.)

They concluded that these fragments belong to a temple of the <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagara.html" title="Nagara">Nagara</a> style (900-1200 AD).</p>
<p>Prof. S.P. Gupta commented on the discoveries: <i>"The team found that the objects were datable to the period ranging from the 10th through the 12th century AD, i.e., the period of the late <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pratihara.html" title="Pratihara">Pratiharas</a> and early Gahadvals. (....) These objects included a number of amakalas, i.e., the cogged-wheel type architectural element which crown the bhumi shikharas or spires of subsidiary shrines, as well as the top of the spire or the main <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikhara.html" title="Shikhara">shikhara</a> ... This is a characteristic feature of all north Indian temples of the early medieval period (...) There was other evidence - of cornices, pillar capitals, mouldings, door jambs with floral patterns and others - leaving little doubt regarding the existence of a 10th - 12th century temple complex at the site of Ayodhya."</i> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

The ASI report mentions a huge structure (11-12th century) on which a massive edifice, having a large pillared hall (or two halls), with at least three structural phases and three successive floors attached with it was constructed later on. The report also stated that "there is sufficient proof of existence of a massive and monumental structure having a minimum of 50 x 30 metre in north-south and east-west directions respectively just below the disputed structure". The ASI report of 2003 concluded that: "Viewing in totality and taking into account the archaeological evidence of a massive structure just below the disputed structure and evidence of continuity in structural phases from the tenth century onwards up to the construction of the disputed structure along with yield of stone and decorated bricks as well mutilated sculpture of divine couple...., fifty pillar bases in association of the huge structure, are indicative of remains which are distinctive features found associated with the temples of north India."</p>

<dd>"The inscription is composed in high-flown Sanskrit verse, except for a small portion in prose, and is engraved in the chaste and classical Nagari- script of the eleventh-twelfth century AD. It was evidently put up on the wall of the temple, the construction of which is recorded in the text inscribed on it. Line 15 of this inscription, for example, clearly tells us that a beautiful temple of Vishnu-Hari, built with heaps of stone (sila-samhati-grahais) and beautified with a golden <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spire.html" title="Spire">spire</a> (hiranya-kalasa-srisundaram) unparalleled by any other temple built by earlier kings (purvvair-apy-akrtam krtam nrpatibhir) was constructed. This wonderful temple (aty-adbhutam) was built in the temple- city (vibudh-alaayni) of Ayodhya situated in the Saketamandala (district, line 17) (...).

<p>Many Muslim and Marxist historians dispute the finding of ASI report, such as Dr Sushil Shrivastava in his review of ASI report. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>In fact, two Muslim graves were also recovered in the excavation and as reported in Outlook weekly. While the ASI videographed and photographed the graves on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, it avoided further analysis of the important evidence. The skeletons found at the site were not sent for carbon-dating, neither were the graves measured.<a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-joshi30403.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-joshi30403.htm" rel="nofollow">Countercurrents / Outlook</a>. Anirudha Srivastava a former ASI archaeologist said that in some trenches, some graves, terracotta and lime mortar and surkhi were also discovered which indicated Muslim habitation and it was also surmised that there existed some mosque on the site and that Babri was built on the site of another mosque. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Richard M Eaton, an American historian of medieval India, in his controversial Essays on Islam and Indian History (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-19-566265-2</a>) documents desecration of all Hindu temples between 1192 and 1760. The total adds up to 80. Eaton in his book does not claim that this list is exhaustive. Furthermore, each of theses 80 cases represents the destruction of not just one, but of a large number of temples. For example one of these 80 cases, the “1094: <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benares.html" title="Benares">Benares</a>, Ghurid army” case, refers to the Ghurid royal army that “destroyed nearly one thousand temples, and raised mosques on their foundations”. This figure of 80 cases doesn't include a Ram temple at Ayodhya.</p>
<p>They also refer to a study by the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeological_Survey_of_India_30d7.html" title="Archaeological Survey of India">Archaeological Survey of India</a> in 2003, conducted on the orders of the Indian Supreme Court, the evidence indicates that a Hindu temple did exist at the site prior to the construction of the mosque.</p>
<p>Hindu parties have criticized Muslims and Marxists for not studying this evidence. Press reports tended to underplay its importance, and often even stated that the ASI report (of the findings of the period <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">May 22</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_6.html" title="June 6">June 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>) didn't find anything. Sandipan Deb commented on the ASI report: “While most papers covering the new ASI report last week said that it claims there was no structure under the Babri Masjid, what the report actually says is that of the 30 recent trenches, the team has found man-made structures in eight, and none in sixteen. In five, they couldn’t decide due to ‘structural activities in the upper levels’ (mainly the plinth of the Babri Masjid). One trench they did not survey. Among the structures listed in the report are several brick walls ‘in eastwest orientation’, several ‘in northsouth orientation’, ‘decorated coloured floor’, several ‘pillar bases’, and a ‘1.64-metre high decorated black stone pillar (broken) with <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yaksha.html" title="Yaksha">yaksha</a> figurines on four corners’. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
There are Marxist historians who say the entire town of Ayodhya was settled by <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhists</a>, not Hindus, and the town had a large number of Buddha <a href="../../../v/i/h/Vihara.html" title="Vihara">viharas</a> (Buddhist shrines). Remains of some Buddhist shrines may be found in excavations, but they are unrelated to Hindu claims.</p>
<p>In 2003 it was alleged by the Marxist paper People's Democracy that the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hari.html" title="Hari">Hari</a>-<a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> inscription would correspond to an inscription dedicated to Vishnu that was supposedly missing in the <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucknow.html" title="Lucknow">Lucknow</a> State Museum since the 1980s. The museum director Jitendra Kumar however stated that the inscription had never been missing from the museum, although it wasn't on display and he showed the inscription of his museum at a press conference for all to see. It was different in shape, colour and text contents from the Vishnu-Hari inscription. <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup>. In addition, there are photographs that show the Kar Sevaks carrying a huge stone-slab bearing a sculpted frieze (e.g. In India Today, 31. December 1992: p.33). And the inscription has been examined by many leading <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epigraphist.html" title="Epigraphist">epigraphists</a> like Prof. Ajay Mitra Shastri.</p>
<p>There were also attempts by Babri Masjid supporters to prohibit all archaeological excavations at the disputed site. Naved Yar Khan's petition at the Supreme Court to prohibit all archaeological excavations at the Mosque site was rejected. <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup>. Similarly there were questions raised as to what level the archaeological digging should continue - should they stop till the point an evidence of Hindu temple was found with both Buddhists and Jains asking for the digging to continue much further to find if they could also lay claim to the site.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pillar bases were first discovered by the ASI's former director-general BB Lall in 1975. His report gave an enormous boost to the Ram Temple cause. It was however criticised by archaeologist D. Mandal. In the excavation of 2003, fifty of "pillar bases" were once again unearthed. Although they appear to be aligned, D. Mandal's conclusion by archaeological theory stated that: <i>"pillar bases" belonged to different periods, that is, all of them had never existed together at any point of time; they were not really in alignment with one another; they were not even pillar bases, but junctions of walls, bases of the load-bearing columns at the intersections of walls.</i> <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>BB Lal's announcement that brick base found in the vicinity of the masjid could be meant for sustaining pillars and therefore suggest the existence of a temple-like structure south of the Babri masjid has been taken by the BJP as the basic evidence for the existence of a temple where the masjid stood.</p>
<p>A group of pro-Marxist and pro-Babri Masjid experts examined the site notebook and register of antiquities connected with the Ayodhya excavations, studied the drawings, plans, photographs, and excavated material and found that the claim of Prof. Lal regarding the existence of a mandir-like structure was unsubstantiated. They alleged that the existence of a brick base for pillars does not prove that it could be of a temple. They also alleged that the eighteen objects which VHP claims to have found at the site during its excavations, which were witnessed neither by the Archaeological Survey of India experts nor by any other Marxist archaeologists or historians, are not in situ objects and could have been brought from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even in his own report submitted to the Archaeological Survey of India in 1976-77 and in 1979-80, Professor Lal had stated "several later medieval brick-and-kankar lime floors have been met with, but the entire late period was devoid of any special interest." The later medieval period indicated 17th-l8th centuries. If remains of a structure of 17th-l8th centuries, are found outside the masjid area, how do they prove the presence of a temple that was supposedly built in the 11th century and destroyed in the early 16th century? the Marxists asked. They also alleged that the excavations did not reveal any pillars, or roof material of the supposed temple at the site where the brick pillar base stood.</p>
<p>Interestingly, pieces of glazed ware pottery were unearthed from the trenches above the floors associated with the brick-pillar base structure and immediately below the general floor of the Babri Masjid. It was alleged that Islamic glazed-ware pottery has never been used in Hindu temple. Excavations conducted by Prof. A.K. Narain in other parts of Ayodhya, where he claimed to have unearthed glazed ware in the trenches, tried to uphold this view. Finds of Islamic glazed ware unearthed by both B.B. Lal and A.K. Narain make it possible that the Muslims lived in Ayodhya from the 13th century onwards and may have built a mosque at the site of an old ruin.</p>
<p>Now about the black basalt stone-pillars used in the four arches of the Masjid. VHP argues that they formed part of the temple which was destroyed. Similar pillars are also found in the graveyard nearby. All these differ in their style and diameter and their total lack of stratigraphic association rules out the possibility of their being an integral part of any single structure. Such pillars are also found in other parts of Ayodhya in completely unrelated contexts. Besides, the pillar bases existing at a distance of about 60 feet to the south of the Babri Masjid structure are in alignment with the pillars used in the Babd Masjid. They could have been part of a veranda or a dwelling place or an animal shed and are of no importance as such structures could be found in the area even now.</p>

<p>While in its interim report the ASI said it had found no signs of the temple. <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> The final ASI report of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> stated that there was evidence of a large Hindu temple having pre-existed the Babri mosque. Midway into the excavations the courts ordered the removal of the head of the ASI excavations for not following the excavation norms.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the basis of these investigations Suraj Bhan and former Chairman of the Indian Council of Historical Research <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Habib_21c1.html" title="Irfan Habib">Irfan Habib</a> concluded that what the ASI found was as a previous layer of mosque.</p>

<p>This was refuted by many scholars, including Professor <i>R. Nath</i> who concludes in <i>"The Baburi Masjid, p.78":</i> “The foregoing study of the architecture and site of the Baburi Masjid has shown, unequivocally and without any doubt, that it stands on the site of a Hindu temple which originally existed in the Ramkot on the bank of the river Sarayu, and Hindu temple material has also been used in its construction.”</p>

<p>The leaders of Babri Masjid Action - Reconstruction committee expressed reservations on the credibility of the ASI in carrying out the assignment impartially owing to political pressure. ASI comes under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, which was headed by Murli Manohar Joshi, himself an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> The Muslim side expressed doubts on the final ASI report saying that the notes and other draft items were destroyed by the ASI with the 24 hours of the final report submission.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> The sounding tests by a Canadian agency mentioned that some structure or anomalies could be established but that could not be a temple on a conclusive note.</p>
<p>Prof Suraj Bhan, who has personally taken an inventory of the site, said the ASI had clubbed pottery from the 11th to the 19th century together and not really distinguished them into different periods. He, however, questioned the basis for the ASI interpreting that a massive burnt brick structure was that of a Ram temple. "The Babri Masjid had a planned structure and the ASI findings conform to this plan. The Nagar style of star-shaped temple construction prevalent between the 9th and 12th century is not at all present at the structure," he said.</p>
<p>One of the central findings in the ASI report was a very large temple, the foundations of which far exceed the circumference of the Babri mosque. According to Irfan Habib the pillar-bases were actually the floor of the Babri Masjid, but a large part of the foundations was located outside the confines of the mosque and hence cannot possibly be confused with the mosque floor, except by a highly prejudiced mind.</p>
<p>Along the same lines as Habib, Muslim Personal Law Board secretary Mohammed Abdul Rahim Quraishi “said a team of well-known archaeologists including Prof. Suraj Bhan had visited the site and inspected the excavated pits and was of [the] opinion that there was evidence of an earlier mosque beneath the structure of the Babri Masjid”. (“ASI ‘finds’ temple, Muslim front says no”, Hinduonnet.com, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">25 August</a>. 2003)</p>
<p>The two agree on a pre-Babri Muslim presence, but it should ne <i>noted</i> that how Quraishi’s “interpretation” of the findings is already starkly at variance with Habib’s: the latter saw no mosque underneath, while Quraishi’s employee Bhan did. This indicates the non-seriousness of at least one of these interpretations, possibly both. By contrast, the ASI team could settle for a single interpretation, just one, which also converges with S.P. Gupta’s, K.N. Dixit’s and R.K. Sharma’s reading.</p>
<p>Noted lawyer Rajeev Dhawan said the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case has taken a wrong turn and the ASI report had no historical or moral significance and the conclusions were based on political considerations. However, anti-temple lawyer, Mr. Dhawan said, "The legal case did not relate to the question of whether a temple existed on the site or not".<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Special full Bench of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allahabad_High_Court_cfd1.html" title="Allahabad High Court">Allahabad High Court</a>, hearing the <a href="../../../a/y/o/Ayodhya.html" title="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a> title suits on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a> ruled that the report of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which carried out excavations to find out whether a temple had ever existed at the place where once the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babri_Masjid_23eb.html" title="Babri Masjid">Babri Masjid</a> stood, would be seen only in the light of further evidence in the case. The three-member bench further remarked “no doubt, the objections taken against the report have to be considered before the <a href="../../../a/s/i/ASI_b766.html" title="ASI">ASI</a> report is acted upon but that situation will arise only when the court decides the matter finally.”</p>
<p>The court remarked that it would not be advisable nor expedient to make any comments at this stage regarding the correctness or accuracy of the report, or the tenability or otherwise of the objections. Whether the report is biased or suffers from discrepancies or infirmities, or is unacceptable, for various reasons stated in objections have to be considered along with the rest of the evidence that has been brought on record, the Bench added and said that in its considered view this is not the proper stage to pronounce on these points.</p>
