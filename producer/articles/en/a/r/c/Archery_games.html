<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Broadhead Round">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Broadhead Round</span></h2>
<p>A variant of the animal round, a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadhead.html" title="Broadhead">broadhead</a> round features archers shooting broadhead-tipped arrows through various single-sheet, 2-D cardboard cutouts of animals that are hung between two wooden poles, strung in the air by bendable wire, with a large dirt mound behind it as a backstop. Like the other events in field archery, the archers in the broadhead round go from station to station to shoot from various distances and in unique circumstances; some stations may even employ a moving target. These stations do not list their yardages in order to create a ‘real field’ feel to the simulation provided by the competition.</p>
<p>The highest scoring is achieved by (1) scoring inside the highest scoring ring and (2) is done in one shot. Typically an archer is allowed one scoring shot unless he or she misses, which they are allowed another shot, but must reduce their score by half; if they miss, their score is zero and scoring for them is completed.</p>
<p>This is an old practice form of archery competition in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> that is still enjoyed today.</p>
<p><a name="Bionic_Buck" id="Bionic_Buck"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Bionic Buck">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bionic Buck</span></h2>
<p>Where only the most skilled and willing shooters with great quantities of arrows apply, a <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionic.html" title="Bionic">bionic</a> buck competition features archers attempting to shoot through a small hole in the kill area of a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cast_iron.html" title="Cast iron">cast iron</a> steel <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deer.html" title="Deer">deer</a> target. The hole size varies from two to four inches in diameter. Typically the archer is placed twenty yards from the bionic buck and given however many chances they have to succeed; success means having the arrow go through the hole, or otherwise if the arrow hits any the steel it will immediately drive the tip of the arrow back and shatter the arrow be it made of wood, aluminum, or carbon. Such a challenge usually can boost the ego of any archer, especially those who do not use sights or other mechanical means to 'sight' the target hole, but many more suffer the humilation of hitting the dreaded Bionic Buck; their misses very audible. A version of this type of target can be found at an American Archery club in the U.K. Liberty Archers, at R.A.F. Lakenheath, have a very good and quite famous (in N.F.A.S. circles) target called RoboDeer. Robodeer is a half sized deer made from steel cheqerplate with a 3 inch hole cut out for the kill area.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Golf Archery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Golf Archery</span></h2>
<p>This variation of clout archery uses the same rules and field as the classic <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a>, except the ball replaced by an arrow and the clubs replaced by a bow. There is sometimes competition between a golfer and an archer. The field should be free of other golfers.</p>
<p><a name="Night_Shooting" id="Night_Shooting"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Night Shooting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Night Shooting</span></h2>
<p>More of a family/children's event than a pure competition, night shooting consists of archers going out on a short, one round course using flashlights to light their way through the course and use the lights to shine the targets which often have reflective tape or paint on them. The course, laid out and roped off in advance before dark, is designed to keep all participants safe. The distances to the targets are very short, often not more than twenty yards, and the targets are typically quite large in size. In some cases there can be two shooting distance markers: a far one for adults, and a short one for children; the rules do allow for children to move closer if necessary in order to shoot. The short shooting distances are necessary since, at night, complete misses would mean the lost of an arrow(s). Though there is no inherent practical purposes for night shooting it just a different form of competition that's enjoyably fun. There are two variants: the Monster Shoot and the Racoon Shoot.</p>
<p><a name="Monster_Shoot" id="Monster_Shoot"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Monster Shoot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Monster Shoot</span></h3>
<p>Monsters Shoots says it all: instead of animals or FITA ring targets the archers are shooting at monsters like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein%27s_Monster_a05f.html" title="Frankenstein's Monster">Frankenstein's Monster</a>, the <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfman.html" title="Wolfman">Wolfman</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a>, and the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creature_from_the_Black_Lagoon_d27b.html" title="Creature from the Black Lagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>, and various other creatures of the night such as large bats. Children compete in this more than adults given the theme and competitors involved.</p>
<p><a name="Racoon_Shoot" id="Racoon_Shoot"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Racoon Shoot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Racoon Shoot</span></h3>
<p>This is a little more serious than a Monster Shoot as it is a little more competitive and adults are more involved. Animal round targets are used with the added touches of reflective tape or paint. The same scoring rules apply here as they do in the Animal Round whereas misses count against the score. Given how some of the animal targets can be small the challenge becomes a bit more significant and how the light is held to shine on the target is very important. Some of the distances can be ridiculously short, but more often than not it can prove how easy it is for anyone to miss the target completely.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Padded Arrow Sport">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Padded Arrow Sport</span></h2>
<p>A growing subculture sport activity has recently spawned, over the past 50 or so years, evolving into an organized, if somewhat dubious system of live action combat. A variation of the roleplay-based <a href="../../../l/a/r/LARP_4b3d.html" title="LARP">LARP</a>, Live Action Wargaming consists of individuals or often groups, numbering from fifty to over three hundred people, dressed in authentic armor and wielding padded sports weapons.</p>
<p>Some systems allow for the use of real bow and arrows in this sport, by limiting the bow draw weight from twenty to forty-five pounds and using blunted, coin-tipped arrows with heads wrapped in open-cell foam padding, thus producing a 'safety arrow'. It should be remembered that these are actual bows and arrows used, so precautions must always be taken and equipment checked frequently.</p>
<p>Unlike other modern-day uses of archery, 'foam archers' must face the difficult use of a far more clumsy projectile with a maximum effective range of perhaps only fifty or sixty feet. Rather than standing still, fantasy sport archers must face the challenge of hundreds of armored players, charging and competing on an actual sport battlefield, while effectively releasing shot upon shot during 'battle', without themselves being attacked or removed from the game, through an 'injury' point system or actual real life injury. Often, such archers are found on the field, releasing arrows as they run.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Running Buck">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Running Buck</span></h2>
<p>Here the goal is simply to hit a moving 3D animal target. The target may be motorized, or it may use gravity to slide down a ramp or rope and be manually reset after each run.</p>
<p><a name="Turkey_Tester" id="Turkey_Tester"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_games.html" title="Edit section: Turkey Tester">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Turkey Tester</span></h2>
<p>Though not as devastating to an arrow as the bionic buck but no less to an ego, the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">turkey</a> tester target is a durafoam 3-D target with a detachable head on its body; the posture of the turkey is in alert mode, body stiff and head sticking straight up. It's more of a contest than a competition to see who can take the head off the target; all other shots to the body do not count. In typical contests archers go one at a time, shooting only one shot from twenty yards. Given the pencil-like nature of the turkey head and neck, and the pressure of only being allowed to shoot once, the archer has to make the lone shot count. To achieve success, the arrow shot must take the head of the bird clean off, and the arrow must hit the head or neck; knock offs caused by hitting the body do not count.</p>
