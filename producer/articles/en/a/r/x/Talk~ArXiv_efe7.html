<p>Question: can arXiv.org be described as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">open content</a>? What is the licence or other conditions that arXiv materials are released under?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know about the licencing, but this question does rather not occur in most uses of the medium, where people want to learn information, but not modify or redistribute it. I think that (i) authors will generally agree to redistribution of their works, and (ii) authors reserve the right to remove their work from the public domain (which could for example be needed when an article appeared in a journal that forces the author to do this [sadly this already occured -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Baez_224a.html" title="John Baez">John Baez</a> discusses such issues on his homepage], in which case the author will hopefully no longer submit to or referee for this journal).

<p>The following paragraph currently in the article is wrong:</p>
<dl>
<dd>arXiv.org was formerly known as xxx.lanl.gov but it changed its name when it was found that censorware programs were blocking access to it from various sites, under the impression that the three letters 'X' in its name implied that it was a pornographic site. The idea of XXX was that it was one better than WWW in every way.</dd>
</dl>
<p>XXX was chosen by Paul Ginsparg as a joke to try to get the site and it's emails blocked. See <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/faq/skullfaq" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/help/faq/skullfaq" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/help/faq/skullfaq</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Also, the entire article is slanted towards mathematics, and there's no mention of the nlin category (non-linear sciences).</p>
<p>arXiv surpassed 300,000 papers in November 2004.</p>
<p>I'd make the changes myself, but I work for the arXiv, and thought that it could be a conflict of interest. So I'll let someone else in the community edit the page as a buffer between my POV and the the NPOV of the article. <a href="../../../k/t/h/User%7EKtheory_adb3.html" title="User:Ktheory">ktheory</a> 18:58, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

The FAQ (<a href="http://arxiv.org/help/faq/skullfaq" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/help/faq/skullfaq" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/help/faq/skullfaq</a>) you are pointing to is entirely unconvincing.

<p>"It is sometimes claimed that some censorware programs were preventing some users from accessing it at its previous address, xxx.lanl.gov, under the impression that the XXX in its name implied that it was a pornographic site; however, this is believed to be untrue: private internet service providers would not be financially viable if they blocked access to such sites."</p>
<p>This is true for residential ISPs. However, arXiv contains scholarly works that are intended in part to be useful to students accessing the web through a school ISP. In the United States and possibly other jurisdictions, internal ISPs run by the IT departments of public schools (both K-12 and university) and public libraries are <b>required by law</b> to use censorware on student-accessible machines, or they will lose funding.

<p>That little bit of text (currently "some small fraction of work remaining purely as e-prints and not published in peer-reviewed journals") gets quite a bit of editing attention. Does anyone have any evidence for this statement? My impression would be that to the contrary quite a lot of stuff put on the arXiv, perhaps even a majority, <i>never</i> gets published in a peer-reviewed journal. Does anyone have any numbers for this? <a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmharvey_69fb.html" title="User:Dmharvey">Dmharvey</a> 12:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh, for now, I'm going to change it to say "some" instead of "some small fraction", "some minority", etc. It's demonstrably true and verifiable that the vague "some" is correct. I don't believe there is any data from a verifiable source (in the sense of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>) that supports the other statements.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your impression, I guess it depends on where you look. Deuar and I have discussed this, and our impressions is that in our own specialties (mine is primarily math.GT), about 10% remain unpublished, with the rest getting published within a few years after submission. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 16:38, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I changed it to "some", but to make it more interesting (instead of almost a vacuous statement), I added that this includes even "very influential papers". I didn't find it necessary to cite this as there are, I think, enough examples, but if someone objects, one example is <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thurston_1755.html" title="William Thurston">William Thurston</a> and several of his preprints.

<dd>My problem with adding this is that it makes arXiv sound even more reliable. The article currently doesn't say anything about the papers not being peer reviewed, nor does it say anything about the inclusion of papers by various crackpots (the late Caroline Thompson, for example). I'm not sure how much of a problem this is outside Wikipedia, but people inside Wikipedia often try to mislead unknowing editors by giving references to such papers on arXiv. I would add this, but I am unsure of how to do so in an unbiased and elegant manner. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 19:50, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that Deuar's attempt to clarify the raised concerns has caused bigger problems. The edit basically consists mostly of opinion, albeit informed opinion. I don't believe it adheres to either <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> or <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>. If the concern is that the article does not mention explicitly it is not peer-reviewed (although it is implicit in the second sentence), we can just say that. We don't need to explain why this unreviewed eprint archive may not be as reliable as a peer-reviewed medium, or how certain articles may be reliable given certain conditions. Let's just stick with the facts and explain the whole idea of journal overlays (a major way refereed papers get on arXiv), endorsements, and so forth. Those are important pertinent issues and can <i>easily</i> be explained in a neutral manner. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 16:23, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Jitse, your edit falsely implies that the endorsement system has to do with ensuring correctness. As my edit should have made clear, the endorsement is NOT to ensure correctness but only that the submissions are appropriate and relevant to the research going on in the specified areas; also, for some reason, the comment in the first paragraph about the papers being eventually published is repeated (with the unverifiable "most"). I note that the Jackson article explicitly mentions the lack of statistics about which percentage of eprints gets published (while mentioning one informal test of 100 papers in hep-th by Kuperberg). It does mention that a majority of papers are submitted for publication though.</p>
<p>I will change it back to be correct, while keeping your citation and modifying your comment about the concerns, as the article doesn't quite make the point I believe you want, Jitse. The Jackson article mentions that people that use the arXiv are not concerned by the lack of peer-review, and that "junk", crank-type papers are actually infrequent. So while we could mention as Philosophus suggests, that such papers do exist on the arXiv, we would need to mention their rarity.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've edited based on these comments. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 05:34, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Jitse, your edit falsely implies that the endorsement system has to do with ensuring correctness." — Yes, my formulation was sloppy, sorry.</li>
<li>"the comment in the first paragraph about the papers being eventually published is repeated" — My plan was to remove it from the first paragraph, but I forgot that. I think it is logical to put the facts "some papers are not published in peer-reviewed journal" and "the majority are" next to each other. I edited to this effect.</li>
<li>"the article doesn't quite make the point I believe you want" — I think it is just that I was not very clear in expressing what I had in mind. I agree with your edits, modulo details.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I do have the impression that the endorsement system was put in place as an (incomplete) replacement for peer-review (but, working in one of the areas that does not use the arXiv much, I may well be wrong). For that reason, I put the "problems with no peer review" paragraph before the paragraph describing the endorsement system. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 06:11, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean by incomplete replacement, but it's never appeared to me that the endorsing was designed to be anything more than a very minimal barrier to keep out incredibly ridiculous papers, in order to minimize "cruft" buildup and reduce workload for those working for the arXiv. The requirements to be an endorser are fairly lax, and if you really wanted to, I'm sure you could find someone to endorse your latest proof of Fermat's Last Theorem&#160;:-) My impression is that endorsement is designed to keep out some of the cranks, but it certainly was never meant to seriously reduce the number of errors in papers on the arXiv.

<p>The website <a href="http://archivefreedom.org/" class="external free" title="http://archivefreedom.org/" rel="nofollow">http://archivefreedom.org/</a> is critical of arXiv claiming that it operates a blacklist. At least one of the people mentioned <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/scicom/PeoplePeter.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.liv.ac.uk/scicom/PeoplePeter.htm" rel="nofollow">Dr. Peter Rowlands</a> is a university lecture in a physic department which has been given the top rating for research in the UK (5A). The transcript <a href="http://archivefreedom.org/freedom/Rowlands.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archivefreedom.org/freedom/Rowlands.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> indicates this is not just obvious cranks being excluded.</p>
<p>Normally I would not think of including such a site in wikipedia, but it does seem on topic for this article. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 21:52, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone has disputed this should belong, which is why it has remained&#160;:-) So I'm a little puzzled as to what brought on this comment. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 01:00, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My mistake, it was mention on <a href="../../../p/s/e/Talk%7EPseudoscience_c64b.html" title="Talk:Pseudoscience">Talk:Pseudoscience</a>, I quickly scanned this article but did not notice it, at the end of a paragraph. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 10:43, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
