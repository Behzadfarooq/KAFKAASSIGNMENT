<p>I think that the creation of this page was a bit previous.

<dd>I was thinking we could have another subpage for each candidate's vote so that the transclusion would be easier and the statements and questions wouldn't clutter up the page.

<p>I'm not crazy about the following sentence, but I'm not an admin so I can't edit it: <i>You may vote in favour of, in opposition to, or abstain from (i.e. not voting) for any number of candidates.</i> How about this: <i>You may vote in favour of or in opposition to any number of candidates.

<dd>I sorted them now as Interiot, by percentage of support votes over total votes. I also fixed a bug which was counting neutral votes as oppose, and the bot will upload the new results soon. Seems that my bot's information is a bit more up-to-date than Interiot's tool for the moment, I guess because of the slow server. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 19:45, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Interesting. Are there other instances?

Moreover, as they also contravene point 2 to "vote for or against each individual candidate", they are effectively extra comments that should be moved/removed at Admin discretion ... just as any comment can be – i.e., I agree with you, jpg. Any toleration of such comments on the talk page will foster others to follow suit.</li>

<p>Of course neutral votes should be allowed. Many of the votes that resulted in creating the rules for this election included neutral votes. More importantly, the current voting rules (prior to your unilateral insertion) do not say "neutral votes aren't allowed", but that a "neutral vote is considered an abstention." So, the rules endorse the use of neutral votes, not oppose them. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-9 16:00</small></p>

<dd>I'm fine with my neutral vote not counting. That's not the point of it. The point of it is to weigh in on the matter. The system has been set up to have neutral votes discounted, but they could easily be set up in a different way, such as splitting each neutral vote as .5 support and .5 oppose, or some other way. Long comments are a different matter entirely, and trying to say that neutral votes are just comments is entirely wrong. If comments aren't allowed, that's fine, but deleting all neutrals, even those without comments, just makes no sense. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-9 18:27</small></dd>

<p>Just wondering, will candidates be removed or archived when it's extremely clear that the nomination cannot possibly succeed? There are currently several candidates with one or two supports and 30-40+ opposes. We do of course want everyone to have their chance, but at some point leaving these candidates up just seems like needless piling-on and might do more harm than good. Also, many of the least-likely candidates are themselves very new and may not fully understand what they were getting themselves into. I do not plan to remove any candidate myself, I'm just throwing the idea out there for consideration. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:48, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My opinion is that these "snowball" candidates should be contacted after the vote has run for 48 hours. At this point, they should be asked if they'd like to withdraw or remain in the election. As for determing which candidates are "snowball-in-heck" candidates, I think that anyone with less than 10% support would qualify. After the vote has run for a full week, the "snowball" candidates should be archived. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 15:58, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't seen anyone talk about actually <i>deleting</i> the votes, just recognizing that certain candidates (mainly brand-new users) are being nearly all voters. Once a few days of the election have passed, it's sensible to make modifications so that voters don't have to visit every single candidate's page before seeing if it's a pile-on oppose or not. On RfA, it's possible to see the tally of every nomination before deciding to vote. With this election, you have to visit the individual subpages in order to see the tally. If the tally could be placed on the main voting page, I'd see no problem with keeping the "snowballs" until the end. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:35, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, I and D. Given Jimbo's position/clarification to include neutral votes, I'm guessing he'd prefer to maintain all candidate votes and pages until the end of the election. This would dually provide voters with a better picture of whom to vote for and allow him to form a complete picture of whom to nominate afterwards ... not one based on arguably selective criteria regarding nascent "snowball" candidates.

<p>I am quite annoyed that I am spending over half my time in this process looking at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbie.html" title="Newbie">newbie</a> candidates, many of whom do not have enough time and/or edits here to even vote in this process! I for one strongly call for there to be such requirements for the candidates in future elections. My suggestion is to require at least one year in Wikipedia and 1,000 edits by the date of announcement for nominations to be eligible. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 21:03, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nominating, answering all those questions and putting yourself up to be rated by your peers like this is a big investment of time and emotional energy. To then be shot down without a fair hearing, because you are 'obviously' unqualified for the job, well, I know I'd feel hurt if it happened to me. I think most of the inexperienced candidates are well meaning, and looking to make a contribution. If it is absolutely necessary that each and every member of Arbcom is highly experienced, then we should say so up front. Instead, it's why did you bother to show up? It's a bit unfortunate all round. Clearly, there are enough people who hold the view that experience is necessary that it might as well be offical policy and spare everyone the effort.

<dd>I agree, as I said above I think removing these "snowball" candidates because some people think it is wasting their time seems trival. In addition, I think those who are pushing for removing candidates before the end of the election should look at their own motives behind the idea. If you don't want to vote for the "snowball" candidates then don't, but otherwise let them have their chance. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 11:13, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that once you have let someone into the process that you need to let then stay in it and see it through to its proper end. So I would oppose on fairness grounds any changing of the rules while the process is ongoing, including the removal of "snowball" candidates in the absense of <i>prior</i> rules for doing so. However, do note that I made my suggestion for future elections. The harder that it is to participate in a process such as this, the fewer will do so and the worse off Wikipedia will be for it. There "snowballs" are only bogging down the process, and can by proper rules be easily excluded. I strongly call for the creation of proper candidate standards for future elections. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:12, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I concur, ems. I think given the plethora of notions and setup required for this year's elections, with the hope of mitigating last year's challenges, some things are bound to slip through (and have).

<dd>While not agreeing myself to any proposed standing criteria (without prejudice to the proposal), I agree with all comments especially regarding to candidates that doesn't qualify for suffrage. An election in the "real world" have candidates requirement that is at least as strong (often stronger) as the suffrage requirement. One of the reason has clearly been shown here, in that those candidate don't stand a chance. We are wasting the time of both the candidates and the voters. -- <a href="../../../k/t/c/User%7EKTC_0713.html" title="User:KTC">KTC</a> 00:25, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It isn't just inexperience, its also the volume of candidates combined with the inability of candidates to succinctly address the office and function to which they're being elected. When I need to form-letter oppose candidates with a statement like "Candidate does not adequately address the nature of arbitration in their candidate statement. In ignorance: I must oppose. With so many candidates, the statement is the extent to which I can engage in becoming an informed voter. Any candidate so contemptuous of the demos as to make it difficult for me to become an informed voter: I must oppose, it bodes poorly for their capacity to take on social responsibility." that's a matter for serious concern <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 04:33, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are eight seats definitely up for election. As I read the main election page, there's a possibility that ArbCom might be expanded assuming more people gain majority approval, but it hasn't been decided pending the election outcome. FWIW, I calculate that as of now, the eighth most popular candidate has 77% support, and there are a total of 24 candidates with majority support. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 16:57, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>where do you get these numbers, short of looking at 65 subpages? Yes, it would make sense to enlarge the arbcom, seeing their backlog.

<dd>I actually have been looking at 65 subpages, before I noticed that two people have written scripts to do it! (see above). In fact it's interesting to compare what would have happened if the election had been on the old system, when you could only vote in favour of candidates, not against them. One particular candidate, who has a majority against her at present, is in eighth position on the total number of votes in favour.

<p>I'd like to float the suggestion (albeit it may not be in the right place) that for future large candidate list elections such as this, that the name-order be randomised rather than alphabetical. I'm basing this on my own growing fatigue at reading through each of the candidates' statements/questions one after another-- which means the lower down, the more likely the candidate is to be given short shrift-- but also on the real-world research which shows that there is positional bias in elections for candidates with names near the top. California court, for example, held that alphabetical listing was unconstitutional, and the state legislature enacted a requirement for randomisation in 1975. <a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/statewide_special_random_alpha.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/statewide_special_random_alpha.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/elec/13100-13121.html" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/elec/13100-13121.html" rel="nofollow">California Election Code Section 13112</a>)</p>

<dd>The above all apply to situations where you can only vote in favor of the candidate. There doesn't appear to be much of a correlation between alpha bet position and the amount of support you recive at present.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 19:02, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for pointing out the significant difference. However, the core of my contention is that the order candidates are placed results in decreasing attention for those lower down the list. The Princeton paper noted above found that even randomized, the candidate nearest the top would gain more support/votes, due in part to what they called "cognitive cost": "Our results are largely consistent with... a simple cognitive cost model of voting, where ballot order effects are due to cognitive costs of processing each candidate." Randomization would reduce the benefit of having a Wikipedia moniker which comes earlier in the alphabet-- although it wouldn't answer the benefit of being earlier in a list of candidates. To see if the cognitive cost is an issue here, we would merely need to wait until final results and count the amount of support/opposition comments each candidate has, with a focus principally on "unknown" candidates, and compare those to name position. —<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 19:34, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The concern would be most visible in lesser known candidates (as I noted above). Wikipedians will naturally respond first to those whose monikers they recognise, and then move onto those whose they don't. Now, whether this really matters (i.e. in terms of "fairness") is certainly a viable question; perhaps unknown candidates don't <i>deserve</i> recognition and no matter how the list is structured, they're not going to get votes anyway. But one might just as well say that this could be likened to a popularity contest, rather than an election based on qualifications, with an intent that all candidates receive equal attention/opportunity.--<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 20:50, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think that it may be helpful to make a list of the inexperienced cadidates, when they joined, the number of edits they had (as of 1/1/06), and the votes that they are getting. I have been thinking of a standard recently of 1 year and 2,500 votes as a qualification for this post. It may be on the high side, but I think that it would be helpful to list all of the current candidates who would fail to fit that bill (as of 1/1/06) and are running. I think that it would do a lot to quantify the need for a standard and help to determine what the standard should be.</p>
<p>I will start the list, but I am looking for the help of others in completing it. Even now I am putting more time into Wikipedia than I should. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that what you have done is to demonstrate that there is <b>not</b> a need for the standard that you suggest. Since at least a substantial portion (if not the vast majority) of the votes so far were cast before you posted your table, and the candidates with the lowest number of edits were (and are still) being overwhelmingly defeated, it looks like the "voters" are fully capable of figuring out for themselves who is qualified and who isn't.

<dd>You are missing the point. It is work to go through all of these candidates, and I have been tempted to stop dealing with them. It takes time from other things, after all. Indeed, I am sure that there are others who have given up early or just not bothered with ruling on 68 candidates. That is not good for the process. <i>If there is a rule such that it is a given that someone who does not meet those requirements will be defeated, then those people should not be allowed to run.</i> This makes the process more efficient and encourages greater participation. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:10, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From what I am seeing, the number of edits is more important than time in Wikipedia, although a shorter presense is a genuine hinderance. There is a gap between having 600 edits and having almost 2,000. The editors below this gap are all being totally panned. OTOH, the editors above the gap are generally doing much better, having a significantly higher percentage of support. (The exception, <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerenceong1992_0ff6.html" title="User:Terenceong1992">Terenceong1992</a>, is a 13-year-old who could not make up his mind about running.) However, even the people above the gap are not serious contenders for "winning" this election, and all are losing support due to the brevity oftheir time in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:33, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not a bad idea, but right now there are only 5 such candidates out of the 68 who started out in the race.

<dd>It was: there were arguments for and against it (enfranchisement) vis-a-vis the notion of a candidate voting for oneself being frowned upon during RfAdmin votes. It was decided (without consensus) to not include this in the election rules ... which I don't agree with. Now ...</dd>

<dd>Is there anything that can be done about it now? Given the neutral vote issues/ambiguities earlier, perhaps Jimbo should be consulted if it's truly contentious (and he was instrumental in resolving the nuetral vote issue)?

<dd>I'm glad that you agree with me, but your refusal to express your opinion on the other candidates is in its own way just as bad. It is as if you are looking to "pad" your total by not giving anyone else your own support. (I admit that you are not dragging them down either with opposition, but I doubt that you would oppose someone without good cause, and that can tell people useful things both about yourself and about the person you oppose.) --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 20:38, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My interest in ArbCom was from the standpoint of editorial challenge of reconciling differing viewpoints to produce a quality multi-faceted article. It is my impression that I grossly underestimated the social and political aspects of ArbCom as well as grossly overestimated the aforementioned editorial drive for quality encyclopedia above all else. As such, I am no longer interested in the position and wish to withdraw my candidacy.</p>

<p>In the light of the matter of inexperienced candidates discussed above, it may be worth considering to allow <i>only administrators</i> to become arbiters. This seems reasonable considering that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adminship is a matter of community trust and is said to be no big deal. ArbCom membership is a matter of <i>greater</i> community trust and <i>is</i> a big deal.</li>
<li>To my best knowledge, we never in the past had any arbiters that weren't admins.</li>
<li>It would be impractical to have arbiters that lack e.g. the ability to view deleted article history.</li>
<li>In the present election, <i>no</i> candidate that is not an admin has more than 31% support, and only two (Edivorce and Sam Spade) have more than 20% support.</li>
<li>Conversely, in the present election, <i>every</i> candidate with less than 20% support is not an admin.</li>
<li>People wishing to become arbiters can easily run for adminship a few weeks before an ArbCom election anyway, as that takes only a week with minimal bureaucracy.</li>

<dd>Is not the point here, as has been made in some votes by <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a>, that reading through 68 different candidate statements and questions takes some time, and especially so when a significant number were no hope candidates? In other words, would it not increase participation in the vote if non-admins were either disqualified, or (if this is considered harsh) speedily identified as such, so that voters can concentrate on the more obviously eligible? I'm just tossing this suggestion into the mix, don't know whether it's viable. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 15:48, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with David that 68 candidates were a bit too many, especially when a fair amount were very inexperienced. I think it would be reasonable to require <i>some</i> sort of minimum qualifications to run for ArbCom. Being an admin could be one of the ways to qualify, but not the only way. We could allow other means such as a petition or judgement by a bureaucrat. The purpose wouldn't be to keep out people who are simply unlikely to win (such as controversial editors), but instead to limit the field to those who won't be opposed by 90%+ of the voters due to inexperience. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:15, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From my quick count of the table above, it appears that seven of the candidates did not have suffrage because of low edit counts or recently created accounts.

I'm not against higher standards, but would like to hear if there is any opposition to making "must be eligible to vote" a baseline standard for candidacy. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 18:23, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without neccesarily supporting this, I do think we need some minimum standard to cut down on the wasted time surrounding hopeless candidacies. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:10, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Another possibility would be to remove candidates with less than X% support 48 hours after the election begins. The value of X should be low, perhaps around 10-15%, but that would still remove the bottom 20-25 candidates, and allow voters to spend more time considering the remaining candidates. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am trying to construct a table of the "inexperienced" candidates above, although I wonder if is should not cover all candidates. I am quite convinved from what I am seeing in that there is a threshold of experience with Wikipedia such that a candidate is not viable otherwise. The sense that I am getting is that time is much less important than the number of edits. Perhaps a standard of having made <s>5,000</s> 1,000 edits as an administrator (plus currently being an admin) would work.</dd>
<dd>I see nothing wrong with there being serious criteria for being able to run for this job. The top vote getters are people who have been very active, present for an extended and fairly non-controversial. Arbitrator is a serious position in Wikipedia. It should be a no-brainer that people who are not current admins, are not of long standing, and/or are not regular, active Wikipedians not only cannot win a post like this, but should not. Indeed, being an admin gives people a record of how they use their power that makes it much easier to judge what kind of arbitrator they would make, and those who cannot become admins or have lost their admin privilages are most likely those who would not make a good arbitrator. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 17:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. I changed my crtieria above after finding the <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> had only ~7,500 edits as of 1/1/06. That makes the use of the higher standard inappropriately prohibitive to potentially good candidates. Indeed, I now think more than ever that we need to somehow gather relevant stats of <i>all</i> of the candidates to get a good sense of what truly distinguishes the obviously unacceptable from those who do deserve a chance. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 17:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a middle ground, it would be easy to add columns to the "vote here" table stating whether the user is an admin or not, how many months since the user registered, and how many edits the user has. That's roughly what the <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST">Signpost</a> has been doing. While in most cases editcount or account age should not be solid grounds for supporting or opposing someone, users may want to use this data to set their personal "minimum bar". <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:53, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Now that I know about the Signpost articles, I will use them and the vote-counting scripts to update my table. I don't know if this is the time to update the vote page, but what I want is some sense of what qualities the more successful candidates have so that we can discuss whether those are appropriate criteria for candidacy. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 14:45, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the light of future elections, could someone please create statistics as to how many people vote on each day of the election, and how the candidates change? It seems to be the case that the results do not significantly change after the first <i>day</i>. Not that I would recommend holding an election for a single day, but it may be interesting to know whether there's actually a point in using two weeks rather than one (and I seem to recall some people suggesting the election last even longer). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:53, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The election has already been open several days and as I've only managed to view and vote on ~43 of 68 candidates (users <a href="../../../a/j/w/User%7EAjwebb_7a85.html" title="User:Ajwebb">Ajwebb</a> - <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaywither_7622.html" title="User:Maywither">Maywither</a>, inlcuding all but one of the now-withdrawn users in this range) and I'm spending about 50-75% of my Wikipedia time on this. And I shouldn't have spent as much time on it at work as I have. Also, remember <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Ta_bu_shi_da_yu_2_7ab2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ta bu shi da yu 2">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ta bu shi da yu 2</a> - things can change.

This user had less than 150 edits as of the start of the election (00:01 January 9) but made 34 edits during the day, starting at 02:31 and ending at 03:30. Those edits brought him/her across the 150 edit threshold. While the rules/instructions seemed pretty explicit (number of edits at the start of the elections), I'd thought I would bring it up here. I've tagged all her votes for now. Thoughts on this? My personal opinion is to not grant suffrage, as the instructions say at the <i>start</i> of the election.

<p>I did a several analyses on this data, looking for a criteria that would eliminate non-contenders fairly quickly. Interestingly, the one that really leaps out is <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant_6053.html" title="User:Radiant">Radiant</a>'s suggestion to require that candidates already be administrators. That would eliminate 29 candidates right off the bat, including the last 27. The highest ranked non-admin is ranked 34th in approval out of 68. So this looks like a very viable criteria.</p>
<p>A variation on this is to require that a candidate be three months an admin. That would eliminate 34 of the 68 candidates, with the highest ranked user affected being <a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a>, currently ranked 30th with 33.8% support. However, I would not go higher than 3 months for administrator experience, since you start working your way rapidly up the rankings after that.</p>
<p>I thought about other types of restrictions to use in addition. The ones that were attractive to me are time on Wikipedia and number of edits. However, the criteria I would use in those cases (6 months is the Wikipedia and 2,500 edits) seem to corrolate with being an admin for 3 months anyway. Indeed, there are several examples of non-admins who meet the other criteria but have &lt; 15% support.</p>
<p>I plan to update this table after the election are closed. However, I don't expect the gist of it to change. One final note: In hindsight, what got to me in this process was not there being 68 candidates, but hitting person after person who obviously did not deserve a chance at the job<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a href="#fn_1" title="">1</a></sup></span>. That kind of thing discourages participation, which is why establishing some kind of prerequisites for candidacy is so important. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:38, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><cite id="fn_1"><a href="#fn_1_back" title="">Note 1</a>:</cite> By "did not deserve" I meant due to obvious lack of experience. Certainly someone like <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">User:Everyking</a>, who was strongly opposed, still deserved the chance to try.

<dd>Great table! Technical question: did you do some kind of scripting wizzardry to add the extra data to the table, or was it done by hand? <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 06:45, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It was done by hand. Scripting was tempting until I found out about the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">Signpost</a> articles. With the data readily available I concluded that it was less work and bother than scripting (although I should at some point try my hand at it since I am a software engineer by trade). Note the since I used the Signpost, the data in as of 1/1/06 as I aimed for above. Obviously a script would be able to give me those numbers. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 17:55, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for the great work. Just one note of clarification: prior to 2003 actually means prior to RfA records being kept, with votes conducted on the mailing list. RfA was started in early July of 2003, so some candidates may have been granted adminship actually <i>in</i> 2003 but before <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">WP:RfA</a> was started.

<dd>Which is why the signpost lists me as being before 2003, while I was in 6/2003. I was promoted a month before rfa was created.

<li>Yes, I realized that my wording was a little ambigious (see the talk page of the first article), so if I remember correctly, I added a notice to the lead section clarifying that. I apologize for any confusion; I'll be sure to be more specific next time.

<p>I certainly hope no 'adminship' requirement is ever imposed. On one hand, adminship should be no big deal, so anyone sensible enough to be on the arbcomm should be suitable for adminship; on the other hand, some excellent users decide not to become admins for philosophical or other reasons. Something like "any user who has been an admin for three months can list himself for candidacy; other users must collect 20 supporting signatures to run" would cut out those at the bottom of the list and directly, rather than indirectly, require that a candidacy be viable to <i>some</i> other editors. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj">+</a> 23:18, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A candidate with 100 votes and 80% support has 80 supporters. A candidate with 200 votes and 70% support nearly twice as many supporters. Because the usual charts seem to emphasize proportion of vote, but the only important cut-off seems to be number of votes, I produced an alternative listing that lists candidates in descending order of votes, for those candidates with more than 50% of votes for support. I sorted scraped the screen from interiot's page at around 0400, Jan 15 (lag was at that time said to be about 12 hours) and then sorted them numerically and applied the cutoff by the following shell command:</p>
<p>$ sort -r -n -k 6 -t '(tab)' votes |awk -F'(tab)' '{if ($5 &gt;= 50) print;}'</p>
<p>(tab) above represents the ascii HT character.</p>
<p>The results. compiled for the fun of it:</p>

<li>Well, yes. But this system has the advantage of pointing out users that are heavily controversial. It's okay to have controversial editors, but they really should not be on the ArbCom; this is about the same reasoning why we don't require an RFA candidate to have, say, 50 supporters. So percentages are really the fairest way to go. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:27, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think analysis of this is premature seeing as the elections are still ongoing. Once the elections are complete I think looking at the voting patterns would be very interesting - graphs of voting rate would be interesting, as well as support:oppose ratios for people over time (I'm assuming that's what you man by "fairly unchanged"). Interiot's written a useful script which shows the current vote count already and I'm sure further such analysis will be done. I'm not sure how you would compare secret voting and public voting simply; without asking people whether they refrained from voting because it was open (I know UninvitedCompany has already made a statement announcing he's not voting because of the procedure) it's going to be difficult to do this. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 18:38, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, but there was discussion somewhere above that the election seems somewhat staid after the first day or so. I was wondering whether the fact that people can see the votes that have already been made had anything to do with this, an effect that many pundits view certain real-world elections to suffer. --<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">Victim of signature fascism</a> | help remove biblecruft 19:29, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a more general discussion of this a few days ago at <a href="#Inexperienced_candidates" title="">#Inexperienced candidates</a>, but I'd like to focus things a bit. What do people think about requiring candidates in future ArbCom elections to have suffrage in the election they run in? I think it's a completely reasonable requirement, not because users without suffrage shouldn't be on ArbCom (though in my strong opinion they shouldn't), but because they seem to be overwhelmingly losing in this election, and as such their candidacies are a waste of time for voters and themselves. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> | <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 03:30, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can think of a small number of non admins who would have a theoretical chance. The 1000 edit mark is handy because it means that most of the people who would be aloowed to run but don't have a chnace know this. At the same time it is well below the edit count that any linkely sucessful candidate would have.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 11:36, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having initiated the <a href="#Inexperienced_candidates" title="">#Inexperienced candidates</a> section above and the <a href="#Complete_candidate_statistics" title="">#Complete_candidate_statistics</a> refered to above, I most certainly support requiring sufferage as a minimal requirement. As for increasing the sufferage limit: I do not see much sense in that unless you want to restrict this election to very experienced users. I would point out that there does not seem the be overwhelming interest in the election overall, with Fred Bauder's total of 300 at this time probably being the tops. However, this does not preclude a higher candidacy limit.<br />
Just to repeat what I found above: Being an admin for the 3 months preceeding the request for candidates seemed to me to be the element that was most predictive of success. It seemed that in the process of earning an adminship and using it, going above 1,000 edits is almost inevitable. However, things did not work the other way around.<br />
As for <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">edivorce</a>, his showing demonstrates the power of a good candidate statement, but note that he was downrated by most people for lack of experience, and IMO it is not wise to select someone for this post without a record of actions to ensure that the person lives up to their hype. Therefore I see the 3-month adminship requirement as being both necessary and sufficient as a prerequisite for being an arbitrator. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:10, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are numerous Wikipedians who have made many thousands of edits (and who may not be Admins by choice, like me, or by consensus), and this proposal unnecessarily limits voter choices and obviates the experience and unique perspectives non-Admin candidates may bring. Alternatively, should we disqualify Admins who are controversial? No: an open election would be (and is) self-evident and the community should decide. If a voter has neither the patience not fortitude to wade through the many candidates and deliberate (and they have two weeks to do this), then they can move on to a candidate with whom they're more at ease with or not vote for them.

<dd>I this not as "instruction creep" but instead "qualification creep", and see it as being appropriate as Wikipedia matures. The goal is not to remove those who should not win, but instead those who obviously cannot win for quantatitively determinable reasons. Obviously "controversial" is hard to measure and does not neccesarily spell failure. In any case, I agree that it is best to let the people select from all qualified candidates. The goal of this is to eliminate a bunch of extra work that dedicated editors can do without. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 20:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about a compromise? In order to run you either have to be an admin or find an admin to sponsor your nomination? It should still eliminate most of candidates seriously lacking in experience, while allowing highly qualified non-admins to run if they want to. I would note that someone who can't find at least one admin who supports their position as Arbcom is going to be pretty hopeless when put to a vote. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 08:39, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I see a certain amount of resistance to my 3-months-as-an-admin proposal. I for one see several things that demand it:
<ol>
<li>Noone who does not meet this requirement is doing well at all. So right off the bat it is meeting the practical requirement to distinguish between the viable and non-viable candidates.</li>
<li>Becoming an admin demonstrates a willingness to be involved with the maintenance of Wikipedia and the ability to gain acceptance to a position of responsibility.</li>
<li>Becoming an admin demonstrates a certain amount of commitment to Wikipedia, which is essential for a post such as arbitrator. Also making active use of an adminship over an extended period is evidence that you will see the arbitrator's job through.</li>
<li>Being an admin for an extended period creates a record that others can use to judge your fitness to be an arbitrator. A number of candidates are being dragged down by their performance as an admin, and I find the prefereable to their being dragged down for being a bad arbitrator.</li>

<dd>I must admit that I was surprised to have my table above point in such a direction, but in hindsight it makes sense. Let those who want to move up have the relatively easily gotten adminship as a "first rung", and create a record for themself that can be used to evaluate the person as they seek higher positions. I see nothing but good coming from this. If a person cannot be bothered to become an admin, I really fail to see why they would want to bother with becoming an arbitrator, or why we should support them without the adminship experience to evaluate them with. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:57, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which of those four things are a big problem? As far as I can see, the system is working just fine. Being an admin is good way to demonstrate suitability, but I doubt it's the only way.

<dd>The system works, but not well IMO. Wikipedia has an obligation not to have us looking at obviously unqualified candidates, and this standard appears to be an excellent filter. Also, I see your concern at this point as being hypothetical. I would like to see a specific case where this standard would interfere with the ability of someone desirable to be a candidate. As best I can tell, in this election it would not have interefered with the candidacy of anyone viable. It also seems to work better than the "X time in Wikipedia" and/or "Y edits done" standards or any combination of them. Simplicity and effectiveness -- What more should a filter of this sort have? --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:47, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. A related question is whether Jimbo would care to appoint as an <s>administrator</s> arbitrator someone who is not already an established administrator. It seems to me that if Jimbo only wants to appoint established admins as aribitrators, then it is silly to let those who do not rise to that rubicon and therefore would not be appointed to run. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 20:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd be in favor of a quota for non-admin members of the arbitration committee. Perhaps two places on the committee to be reserved solely for suitably qualified non-administrators. Administrators tend to develop a certain administrator solidarity and it may sometimes take a non-admin arbitrator to say "hang on, this decision isn't quite right", and produce a result that would be more acceptable to the editors as a whole--most of whom are not administrators and have no aspirations to become one. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:25, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that far from being barred from standing non-admions should be on the arbcom, if necessary through a quota, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 00:16, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would oppose any hard requirements in any way. Rule creep. Unoficially, anybody willing to be an arbitrator better have at least one year as admin, at least 5,000 edits, experience in dispute resolution, etc. But codifying those would not be wise I think. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 04:05, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I actually am somewhat sympathetic to this. The first thing that is interesting to note is that the requirements that you list above would disqualify <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a>, who in both percentage and support-oppose standings is the leader. (She has only been an admin since 4/05.) Indeed, I realized from her being in the lead that anything more than 2,500 edits (Mindspillage had ~7,500 when the elections were called) and 1 year in Wikipedia is absolutely not viable. I also found myself looking at things like the candidate who made 1 edit in 3/04 and then did not come back until 11/04. Given that, when is their "real" start date? In any case, there needs to be a standard. At the minimum, noone should be a candidate who lacks sufferage in the election itself, but IMO we can do better. However, such a standard needs to be
<ol>
<li>simple,</li>
<li>reflective of the candidate's viablity,</li>
<li>reflective of the candidate's ability, and</li>
<li>not very difficult to attain.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Those requirements IMO are met by the adminship requirement. Even just a current adminship requrement seems to <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorting.html" title="Sorting">sort</a> the <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheat.html" title="Wheat">wheat</a> from the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaff.html" title="Chaff">chaff</a>, and to so do better than any number of edits and/or time in Wikipedia requirement. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:40, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure whether I can vote or not, probably not because I am recent in terms of formal registation. I have no way of knowing what the candidates actually do. The process could be as simple as clicking a button, but instead involves an unfamiliar edit.</p>
<p>The process is also is also open to hijack. There are more than 800,000 registered users, but from the number of votes that seem to have been cast, anyone who could organise a few hundred voters could get control, at least of the Arbitration Committee.</p>

<dd>it is pretty much imposible to organise wikipedians (which is why the final final version of the voteing page was sorted out in the half hour leading up to midnight).

<p>Since only people who had at least 150 edits on January 9 and were registered by September can vote, the number is actually very much smaller than 800,000, and if you removed people who have been gone for months or years, it gets even smaller. Others might have a better sense of what it actually is (or an automated way of finding out?) but I would guess there'd be a few thousand potential voters total. If some malicious sort wanted to hijack the election in the manner you'd describe, they'd either have to have gotten started on their hijack months ago (before we'd even determined the voting process), or they'd have to somehow recruit from among existing Wikipedians without anyone noticing, both of which seem extremely unlikely. Most of the people who are tuned in enough to process and policy to care about the arbcom have, in fact, voted, and very few other people, I suspect. My view is that overall it's gone pretty well. By the way, GwydionM, since you registered on October 18 you're not eligible to vote.
