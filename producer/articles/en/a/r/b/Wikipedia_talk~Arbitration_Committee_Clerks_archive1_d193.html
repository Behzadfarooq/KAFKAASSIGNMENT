<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comment on the merits of the proposal</span></h2>
<p>It's difficult to comment on the internal process of ArbCom when one has not actually seen it in operation, but from the outside the slow pace of some decisions does clearly show the workload and anything that lifts it is therefore valuable. One of the things that came up in the ArbCom election was an idea from <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> that a full explanation should be given of ArbCom decisions, and that met with general approval from his voters. This is perhaps an ideal job for the Clerks to do the drafting. Some users, however, felt that too often the process of Arbitration was confused with a Judicial process, which it isn't (a point made by <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> in his vote explanations), and I wonder whether an idea lifted from the Courts is perhaps straying into that area. My question above wasn't particularly motivated by a desire to offer myself as a Clerk but just wondering whether this would be expected by everyone else, given that it would seem to be logical; obviously the Chief Clerk as an ex-Arbitrator would be involved as an Emeritus position not as a potential replacement.</p>
<p>All in all I think it's worth trying. The issue of mailing list access may need to be viewed afresh if Clerks start writing opinions which are completely different to those expressed by the Arbitrators in their private discussions, but that's a bridge that can be crossed if it is arrived at. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 09:59, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I share the concerns about making the arbcom to much like the Judicial process, but I think opinions aren't neccessarly a bad thing. However, clerks work for the commitee as a whole.

<p>From my post on WikiEn-L:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I think this is a swell idea. Not only would I be glad to volunteer for this, but it would greatly speed up the process of arbitration, IMO. Currently the main problems causing the slowness at the arbcom are (IMO) the lack of staff to look into the evidence and add "eyeballs" (as per Linus' law) to the cases, and the lack of a lower-level form of binding dispute resolution (currently being hashed out at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Enforcement_ee90.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Enforcement">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Enforcement</a>). It would be great to have clerks for the arbcom, since many hands make light work. Without actually judging the cases themselves, the clerks could help compile evidence, propose things at the workshop, help format new cases properly, and deal with enquiries from the Wikipedia public.</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concerns with clerk process</span></h2>
<p>I am concerned about the process through which this policy was implemented - in particular, the lack of broad discussion on Wikipedia (I read about it on the mailing list archive) and the process by which the clerks will be selected. Frankly, I'm concerned at the possibility that this is a way to sneak in rejected candidates for Arbcom via the back door. Three of the names bandied about as potential clerks are individuals who were decisively rejected in the elections. To appoint them as deputies to Arbcom shows a lack of respect for the consensus of the Wikipedia community. In my opinion, if clerks must be appointed (and it's imperative that <i>something</i> be done to expedite the absurdly slow arbitration process), they should ideally be individuals who received at least over 50% of the vote in the Arbcom elections. Either that, or a separate set of elections for clerks should be held. This process lacks transparency and I have serious concerns about the individuals who may be chosen as a result. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 21:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The clerks have no direct power for one thing, and the office derives from the same "power" as the Commitee does itself, from Jimbo/the Foundation (as O understand it anyway). They are assistants to the comitee. The elections were <i>advisory</i>, not political suffrage. The consensus of the wikipedia community is that we have an ArbCom, we don't have a better solution, and they have the authority to get what help they need.

<dd>Clerks (I am interested in possibly being one btw since it would be nice to have an official position to what I've been doing for awhile which is helping out on arbcom pages) have only a couple of extra powers, they'll have write access to the mailing list which just means that they can submit mail to the mailing list without having to have a listadmin approve it first, and they can edit the proposed decision page. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 02:03, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It occurs to me to wonder exactly why it is necessary to appoint clerks to help arbiters, when it would be more straightforward to appoint more arbiters so that each has less work to do?

<dd>(1) Adding/replacing members of the arbitration committee is a nontrivial thing (and has, to date, always required either an election or a decree from Jimbo) while adding/replacing clerks is a lot simpler. (2) For reasons that are difficult to explain, when the throughput of cases is not crushingly high (as it has been for a while now - a result of the broken dispute resolution process) the arbcom works quite well. Each arbitrator does his own thing, tends to the cases he feels inclined to write up, 'etc. We learn to anticipate each other. Increasing the arbcom by 6 to 12 (tentatively the number of clerks we will probably end up with... or more) could very well result in a slower arbcom. This is what has happened on RFA -- often times increasing the number of bureacrats makes RFA go slower. (3) The more arbitrators we add, the greater than chances that our conversations on the mailing list will start to leak (4) 95% of the work that is, at this point, done by arbitrators is bureacratic paper-pushing that doesn't require an arbitrator <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As per above, clerks don't have the power to rule in cases. They do paperwork -- summing up cases, handling enquiries, formatting the pages properly, writing up *possible* findings of fact/proposed principles/remedies/whatever, etc. Making them fullfledged arbcom members would be giving them undue power to rule in cases, which we don't really need, IMO (if other proposals like giving RfC teeth and giving the arbcom clerks work out). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 03:45, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clerks are the ones who will weed through the complete <b>crap</b> on the evidence pages, going through the thousands and thousands of edits by disruptive users, to organize the case. I've been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=28682427&amp;oldid=28682204" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=28682427&amp;oldid=28682204" rel="nofollow">arguing</a> for some time now that arbitrators need this kind of help. People show up to complain and don't say anything other than "this guy said something mean." Only they say it in more than 500 words. And they link to no evidence at all, or items that are not evidence, or put it together in an unreadable and unuseful way. That means the arbitrators have to either say, "Sorry, I can't see the dispute here because the evidence is useless," or else dig through the mountains and mountains of sheer crap themselves. Having a team of folks do that work for them should be enormously helpful. It is NOT by any means a position of power. It is real grunt work. I've done it for one case I was on, and previously thought about getting involved by just volunteering to do so on random cases. In fact, this is pretty much something anybody could start doing in an unofficial capacity.</dd>
<dd>For those commenting that this is a way to "sneak failed Arbcom candidates through the back door," I don't see it that way at all. There is no power being granted to this proposed position. Only more work. (And I imagine there will be some folks selected who quickly discover it is too much work or too unrewarding.) I can think of persons whom I could not support for Arbcom who would in fact make great clerks. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 12:52, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but I still don't see it. First, we just had an election, so if more people are needed take 3 more arbiters, or 6 more, from those who got a support vote. Easiest thing in the world for more to be appointed right now.</dd>
<dd>Second, i don't see the logic of why more arbitrators means more beaurocracy. I am not saying more handling each case, simply more available so that the same number can be allocated to each case, and hence cases can be handled faster. I see no reason to worry they may become underemployed if they deal with all cases to hand. Far better to have several available to cover dropouts and inconvenient real world happenings. From what you say, the system works best when arbitrators are not under pressure.</dd>
<dd>Third, all this talk about clerks deciding what evidence is important frankly makes my skin crawl. The clerk decides what evidence the judge sees??? Which post exactly is the important one???</dd>
<dd>Fourth, security. I don't know what you guys talk about which might be top secret, but I am really not convinced that a group of judges discussing the facts of a wiki case strictly should need to be secret. Maybe people might be concerned about reprisals, but in my book, no judge should be saying things in secret which he would not be prepared to say in public. I would consider an argument about a need for secrecy as a reason against a proposal, not for it. But ultimately, either your security is OK, or it is not, and having fewer people is just crossing your fingers rather than fixing it.</dd>
<dd>fifth, why is it bad if an arbiters job is mainly pen pushing? But OK to get someone else to do the donkey work?

<dd>That is exactly the problem. If I was in Jimbo's shoes then I would undoubtedly keep firm control of my baby. But as someone interested in the possible future of the project, I have to decide whether that control is benign, or even desireable. I agree though, the impression given is exactly that arbiters are hand-picked to exercise control as jimbo would have it done. This measure appears designed to increase that control and reduce editor input into the process of choosing arbiters. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 00:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after edit conflict) First, it sounds like they don't need more people to vote; they just need more people to do basic tasks. Second, more people voting means votes take longer. Third, I assume the participants in the case will review any "cleaning up" the clerks do, and scream bloody murder if they don't like it, so there's not likely to be any sneaky inormation-control. Fourth, the point of ArbCom is to deal with problems smoothly, not to uphold all the rights in a real judicial system; I imagine the arbitrators speak privately to reach some kind of consensus, in addition to the occasional need to deal with private evidence. Fifth, arbitratrators don't just have a bigger bucket; they make important decisions. It's ok for them to <i>ask</i> for help if people are willing to give it, which apparently they are. Any of that help? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 21:11, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In response to your third point, I don't believe clerks will be in the business of hiding anything. In my understanding, clerks will submit a clear, organized brief for each case they clerk organizing the evidence and putting it into a form that can be understood. This will not replace evidence submitted by the parties (or their advocates ... if someone wants to really help the process, get the advocates to start representing people by presenting such briefs). I hear talk about clerks refactoring, and I think that will happen, but what I'm seeing is: "Party to the case presented a link to a page's history rather than a diff. Clerk will dig out the relevant diffs." or "Party to the case put things in a strange order or format. Clerk will clean it up." The ultimate answer to point three is that if you're a party to a case where you feel a clerk hid something, you present it yourself as evidence. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 21:12, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, this is beaurocracy creep. Not enough to have arbitrators, now they must have a staff because otherwise they can not do the task they volunteered to do. You say yourself that arbiters will be second-guessing their clerks. If an arbiter is to make a good decision he should be studying the evidence himself, not taking someone elses opinion. Anything else is to entirely turn the concept of a judge upside down. I appreciate that there is a whole load of mess in some of these cases, but the whole point of a good arbitrator is to be able to see through the mess himself. Is it the case that the clerks brief will be public information and part of the case? If so, this is more acceptable, but it still begs the question of who should choose people to do this. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 21:46, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just looked up trolling on wiki. It said 'The main motive for a user trolling is to disrupt the community in some way. Inflammatory, sarcastic, disruptive or humorous content is posted, meant to draw other users into engaging the troll in a fruitless confrontation.'. Interesting. I would suggest that it is not my behaviour which best fits the description of 'trolling'. I have come across the curious evolution of government on wiki. This is a page for posting comment, and I have done exactly that, commenting on-subject about the pretty obvious concern which still has not been answered, why invent appointed clerks when there already exist elected arbiters. If it is not possible to have a discussion on that subject, on this page, then the notion supposedly of running this entire organisation by consensus and agreement is pretty much a nonsense. Anyone reading this would see that the tactic here is to engage me in a side issue, while my position would be to get as many people as possible contributing to this debate.

<p>To the open/close cases, I've added "at AC direction" — this shouldn't be onerous. In cases where an outcome is not clear (e.g. arbs voting "first pref", "second pref" on varying lengths of sanction — the 2005 AC had a few of these that confused even us), the clerks would be expected to be clueful enough to ask.

<dd>Without wishing to derail this into a debate about the nature of open/closed decision making (since I've had about enough of that these last few days), even though the Arbitration Committee can discuss it privately, they have to make "detailed rationale for all their decisions public".

<dd>The AC has used unofficial clerking before. This is establishing a bunch of people to do the job as more of a job, i.e. to make sense of crap. No-one on the AC objects who's been through the job of being an arbitrator, you'll see - it's more like "OH GOD YES PLEASE! HELP US WITH THIS CRAP!" and picking people they have a good idea will do a good job of it&#160;;-) I wouldn't see a clerk as doing anything that <i>anyone</i> couldn't do on a /Workshop page; the difference would be that the AC is saying "Right, here's some crap needs handling. Please do it." Giving them opening/closing is also safe 'cos that's a mechanical task. the AC has talked about having a function like this for a few months, and the proposed setup is basically least disturbance to the way things are and shouldn't lead to crossing the streams we think - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 23:24, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not particularly concerned as to whether the Arbcom supports Kelly or not. What is far more important is that the <i>Wikipedia community</i> does not (she received less than 43% support, and withdrew from the race). Many of the "oppose" voters made it clear that they do not trust her judgment or discretion. To appoint Kelly as a clerk (who I suspect would actually strongly influence the decisions in many cases) would completely defy this consensus. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 20:33, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I imagine that if any members of the ArbCom feel that there is a need to create policy surrounding this aspect of their internal workings, those members are capable of doing so. In the absence of any expressed objection from any of them, I would assume that there is a tacit acceptance of the clerks on at least a trial basis. If the experiment stops working, we'll hear about it. With respect to the mailing list, it makes sense for them to discuss the internal workings of the Committee there—I suspect it dramatically improves the signal-to-noise ratio of their discussions. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My (outsider's) perspective is that the second clerk hat is less of an <i>amicus</i>-type role and more of an advanced executive assistant. They're digesting, condensing, and summarizing the comments of others, with at most a modest degree of editorial commentary.</dd>
<dd>As the arbitration process stands now, <i>anyone</i> can file an <i>amicus</i> brief with the ArbCom; it happens quite regularly when cases are before the committee that parties only tangentially involved will offer comments, evidence, or suggested remedies. This takes place on WP:RFArb and on the Evidence and Workshop pages of cases; the ArbCom seems fairly open to community involvement at all stages. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:44, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't really think that "amicus curiae" briefs are all that important - the fact fo the matter is that most arbcom cases do not require a monstrously subtle stroke to sort out - user is a crackpot conspiracy theorist who wants the Wiki to reflect their view. Therefore, user banned. User is an admin who blocks in content disputes. Therefore, user de-adminned. I see the proposed decisions aspect of the clerk role being more in the form of "Well, this is a lot like these cases, and this is what you did there that worked." And occasionally "This is a lot like this case, and this was a problem with the ruling in this case, so maybe you should try fixing it?" I don't see many cases at all where the arbitrators really, really have to get clever - Xed 2, Netoholic, Gzornenplatz, the Ed Poor cases, the ban on Wonderfool, the first Lyndon LaRouche case. Those are the only ones that spring to mind where the decisions were at all subtle and couldn't be guessed accurately by past precedent alone. And I think one role of the clerks is going to be to warn the arbitrators that they have one of those, and that they're going to need to sort it out very carefully. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:55, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently if an Arbitrator is unable to retain the support of the community, they are simply reassigned to the back office, to continue offending the sensibilities of the community from the safety and anonymity of the Clerk's desk? This seems like a poor way to deal with a failed (or withdrawn) nomination to ArbCom. This is simply a back door for Administrators to influence the committee, and is not an appropriate way to maintain neutral arbitration. I object in the strongest possible terms, particularly in light of the circumstances.

<dd>well now, there's an interesting application of political bribery. An example of why having appointed clerks at the gift of arbiters is a bad idea, and of the general problem with corruption of public officials with power of appointment. The whole point of having elections for arbcom is that the people contributing to decisions must be supported by the editors of wiki. If they can not gain that support they should not be making decisions on behalf of those editors. The scenario here seems to be becoming 'I've been a clerk for a year, now appoint me to arb'. How do you become a clerk?.. be friendly to the existing committee. So the committee effectively chooses its own successors.

<dd>I think this type of criticism reflects how people are getting the wrong idea about this, these aren't reserve arbitrators or anything else special and it's not something that needs a widescale election to decide, this is purely an internal matter of the arbcom wanting help in making the process easier. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 21:43, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Comment at the top of the page would suggest that some people are certainly thinking of them as prime candidates to be directly appointed as arbiters. Whatever the merits of the current arbiters, it is important to consider all the consequences of a new scheme. Wiki has a king, the nobility and principle of patronage seems to be spreading. The issue here is partly whether the arbiters should be able to redefine their own authority. The reason most countries end up with complicated political systems is just exactly to stop that sort of thing happening.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 21:58, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>The issue here is partly whether the arbiters should be able to redefine their own authority.</i> Nonsense again. This proposal adds nothing to the arbiter authority. Until you state that you understand that, it will be clear that you do not understand the policy.
