<dd>I was appointed as a "deputy mediator" under the committee to help out the backlog. I spent a long time mediating <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuro-linguistic_Programming_bd74.html" title="Neuro-linguistic Programming">Neuro-linguistic Programming</a>, while staying cool despite serious tensions there. Unfortunetely, after a month, an ArbCom case was filed and checkuser revealed that one side was just meatpuppets and socks (banned now). Nevertheless, I still feel that I learned quite a bit about staying cool, getting others to show more empathy to each other, and maintaining civility. I have participated on Several RfC's, after thinking about the issues, I'd usually endorse one of the mainy listed views (usually one would match my own more or less). However, I don't do much there as I feel that it has become to much of a hostile "pile-on" fest environment. AMA is not something I am interested on the grounds that we don't really need lawyers or wiki-lawyering here. The focus is to build an encyclopedia. Our policies are not that complicated (save copyright issues) and advocates tend to just add unneeded complexity and distraction. As for the Mediation Cabal, I feel that it is a good alternative to the committee, as it is fast and less bureaucrat. I feel that bureaucracy should only be used when needed. Where I to fail this bid for ArbCom, the Cabal might be my next step.

<p>Thank you for volunteering to take on this task, and for putting yourself through having to answer these questions. For what it's worth, these particular questions are going to all the candidates.</p>
<p>1. I've noticed that a total of thriteen people have resigned from the committee, and that there is currently one vacancy open in one of the tranches. Having members of the committee resign sometime during their term could create problems somewhere down the road. What do you think are the odds that you yourself might consider resigning during the course of your term, and what if any circumstances can you envision that might cause you to resign? Also, do you think that possibly negative feelings from others arising as a result of a decision you made could ever be likely to be cause for your own resignation?</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are a few potential personal issues that could cause it, and three years is a lot of time. Nevertheless, I doubt that should an event should case to much trouble. More so of a problem are people just being too busy to handle requests. I should not be too busy this or next year, though after that, it is hard to tell. I think this goes for most candidates.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 21:13, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. There may well arise cases where a dispute based on the inclusion of information whose accuracy is currently a point of seemingly reasonable controversy, possibly even bitter controversy, in that field of study. Should you encounter a case dealing with such information, and few if any of your colleagues on the committee were knowledgeable enough in the field for them to be people whose judgement in this matter could be completely relied upon, how do you think you would handle it? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 21:01, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If both parties are in a good faith dispute, and everything boils down to the correctness of a content statement, then that is effectively out the scope of ArbCom. One solution would be to redirect discussion to an article RfC and invite all of those knowledgible about the topic to discuss it. The article may have to be protected to the <i>status quo</i> version or preferably to a version that does not include that statements until things can be sorted out. This especially goes for a biography of a living person (though that is less likely to fit into this senario).<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 21:13, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the Wikipedia context, what is the difference (if any) between NPOV and SPOV (scientific point of view)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>On most topics, like <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a>, there is no SPOV. On topics like <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave_function_collapse.html" title="Wave function collapse">wave function collapse</a> there is only the SPOV, which acts as the NPOV. Sometimes NPOV containts both SPOV and ^SPOV (not scientific), but where the ^SPOV is minute and the supports lack numbers or credibility, like <a href="../../../n/l/p/NLP_8558.html" title="NLP">NLP</a>. Sometimes they overlap in a more notable way, like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_bang.html" title="Big bang">Big bang</a>. The SPOV should generally be given priority (first mentioned, more length), but the ^SPOV, as long as it is notable, deserves mention as well. That would include creationists arguments for the two above examples. We are not her to draw the conclusion, just to give people the topic description, history, and any notable arguments; an encyclopedia. Notice the "notible", as we are not here to dig up every argument given either, but just an encyclopedia.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:51, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>1. Express in a short paragraph, using any particular issue/incident that you feel strongly about (or lack thereof) in the past, on why editors must understand the importance of the ArbCom elections and making wise, informed decisions when they vote.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I can't think of any major failure of arbcom, though forcing a desysopped user to re-run on RfA stands out as annoying. But I don't see that as a major failure. Nevertheless it is always important to have a good fair ArbCom, so as to avoid not just misjudgement, but its wake, which can divide the community even further and cause ArbCom Enforcement to either be wheel-warred over or people may leave.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:00, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. Imagine. Say Jimbo grants you the authority to make, or abolish one policy with immediate and permanent effect, assuming no other limitations, no questions asked. What would that be?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I don't see any policy that bad that it really hurts the encyclopedia. And if there was one, I'd rather the community remove it as a)if its that bad they hopefully would see it, b)it would look more fair, and c)<b>I</b>, just one person, might be wrong, and the policy may not be bad.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. It is expected that some successful candidates will receive <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7ECheckuser_1b24.html" title="Wikipedia:Checkuser">checkuser</a> and <a href="../../../o/v/e/Wikipedia%7EOversight_b3cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Oversight">oversight</a> privileges. Have you read and understood foundation policies regulating these privileges, and able to help out fellow Wikipedians on avenues (e.g. <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>) in a timely manner should you be granted either or both of them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I have read up on Oversight and even helped to write that page. I've been an RfCU clerk for a while now as well.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:00, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. What is integrity, accountability and transparency to you on the ArbCom?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Integrity - fair, reasonable, recuse when involved</li>
<li>Accountability - this is fairly voluntary given current policy, but members should apologize for bad actions, take breaks, recuse from further involvement, or even resign in the case of a really bad faith or lazy wreckfull action.</li>
<li>Transparency - explain reasoning, use the "finding of facts/principles", try not to always use backrooms like the ArbCom mailing list.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:00, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>5. Humour, a tradition of Wikipedian culture, has seen through several controversies in recent history. This is including but not limited to <a href="../../../%29/_/_/WP%7E%29_085b.html" title="WP:)">bad jokes and other deleted nonsense</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> policies/essays, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fools%27_Day_4e24.html" title="April Fools' Day">April Fools' Day</a>, <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">whole userpages</a>, <a href="../../../u/b/x/WP%7EUBX_b286.html" title="WP:UBX">userboxes</a>... Do you think that they are all just harmless fun, or that they are all nonsense that must go?</p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>As long as it does not a)cross the line and attack people or b)possibly look like actual policy to new users, its fine.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:00, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Warning: Most of these are intended to be <b>tough</b>. Answering them properly will be hard. I don't expect anyone to actually withdraw themselves from nomination rather than answer these, but I do expect at least some to seriously think about it!</p>
<p>The one consolation is that your competitors for the positions will be asked them too. Notice that there are about one thousand admins, and about a dozen arbcom members, so the process to become an arbcom member may be expected to be <i>one hundred times</i> harder. <small>(Bonus question - do you think I hit that difficulty standard?)&#160;:-)</small></p>
<ol>
<li>A current Arbcom case, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Protecting_children%27s_privacy_df78.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy</a> is concerned with the decision of whether or not a proposed policy has consensus or not, and therefore whether or not it should be a policy/guideline. Whether or not the Arbcom has or should have the power of making this decision is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Protecting_children%27s_privacy_Workshop_9e7d.html#Role_of_Arbitration_Committee" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy/Workshop">hotly disputed</a>. Does Arbcom have this power? Should it have this power? Why or why not?
<dl>
<dd>The policy was ridden with poll rallying and discussion was ongoing. If a <i>new</i> policy is only supported by one poll (one I never even heard of till now) that involved rallying and serious discussion about its standing (not just ironing out issues or appending it), then it should be re-tagged as "proposed". "Rejected" is bad because it makes people look at it and think that discussion is done, and so they don't comment, which creates the "self-fulfulling" prophecy. The tag is only used for dead proposals, either clearly rejected by a representative<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Voice_of_All/Consensus" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Voice_of_All/Consensus" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> poll, or that never gained consensus and had been long inactive or only a handfull of the same people keep commenting on it to make it look "active". I have not looked at the merits of that particular discussion, however. Nevertheless, those are the principles. As for AC's scope, I'd say that there issues of protection and possible serious mis-tagging to be considered. In the broader sense, these principles are fairly obviously implied by the idea of gaining consensus and using discussion, so AC may simply be re-affirming these parameters in whatever "finding of principles" they use. That does not seem out of the scope of AC, however, anything more specific, such as "how many months of no discussion make it inactive" or "the poll must have X+ participants" such should be left to the community.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bottom line: <i>Arbcom has the power to consider policy protection and "rejected/historical" tag misuse when normal dispute channels failed and it had some possible noticable affect (such as the policy needlessly failing without discussion).</i> <b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 23:23, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>Similarly, a recently closed Arbcom case <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano</a> barely dodged the possibly similar issue of whether the Arbcom can, or should, determine whether Bureaucrats properly made someone an administrator. (Discussed, for example, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_Workshop_2a0c.html#Bureaucrat_decision_in_WP:RFA.2FCarnildo_3_overturned" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano/Workshop">here</a>). The current arbcom dodged the question (didn't reach agreement one way or the other, and ended up leaving it alone by omission), but you don't get to.&#160;:-) Does the arbcom have this power? Should it?
<dl>
<dd>AC can interpret "consensus" from our community build BCrat policy about when to promote to see if it was abused in an instance. However, it does not have the right to decide whether "broad considerations" or "narrow precent ranged" are the right way to use descrection as WP:BCRAT ambiguously says "Determine whether there is a general consensus that the person should be sysopped". "General" could mean "community at large"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Voice_of_All/Consensus#The_outside_community" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Voice_of_All/Consensus#The_outside_community" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or "those on RfA". Its up for the community to have that (needed) discussion. If the community decides to change it to include the community at a whole (as approximated by crats), then the 70-75% would become ideally mathematically illogical. However, a crats "approximation" may not be perfect either, just like assuming that the votes on RfA are representative of the whole community. Any discussion of this drifts from direct policy interpration far out into imagination. For example: <i>Instead of using a precent range, you could count all "active" users with X+ edits as "the whole" using an SQL query, and then look at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margin_of_error.html" title="Margin of error">margin of error</a> of the # of votes out of "the whole" and set a range there for discretion (say value a&lt;=x&lt;=b). Perhaps you could combine the percent range with the "margin of error"! There are many undefined constants there, and I just went through some possible mathematical models, each having some reason and merit. Maybe crats could have total descretion without the ranges.</i> <b>As you can see, this is no place for Arbcom</b>, but lengthy community discussion. There is just no clear, implied, answer. It is an open-ended question. Now I said earlier, that AC can decide if the policy definition of "RfA consensus" was abused, however it is ambigious. Therefore, currently, AC has even less power to decide this, as its is not allowed to just "pick" one over the other.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you agree with the above point, which service to the encyclopedia is <i>more</i> valuable - administration, or writing very good articles? For example, what happens when two editors, an administrator and a good article writer, come into conflict and/or commit a similar infraction - how should they be treated? Note that there are relatively the same number of current administrators and featured articles on the Wikipedia - about 1000 - however, while relatively few administrators have been de-adminned, many former featured articles have been de-featured, so there have been noticeably more featured articles written than administrators made. This is a really tough one to answer without offending at least one important group of people, and I will understand if you weasel your way out of answering it, but it was one of the issues brought up in the recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano</a>, so you can imagine it may come up again.
<dl>
<dd>This is an age-old question of society. However, there is a "distorter" coming from the pryamid like grouping: there are less admins that other active user. Since both site administration and content writing are needed in order to maintain and protect the content, then it follows that they both have an importance level of "needed". Comparing them is like saying "which is more needed, brain or heart?". Well the brain is more of the end product (like content), creating the mind, but if you remove the heart, it doesn't get blood and dies. So the question is somewhat moot. Now, the "distorter", is that any one admin, using simplistic probability, is more important than any one "non admin active user" as there are <i>less</i> admins than non-admins and non-admins can only work on content, whereas admins can do maintanence and content work. The admin and non-admin groups are equally needed, one just has more members and the loss of one is less noticed using simple models. However, since both tasks are needed, this is again moot, like the heart/brain example, and also, some non-admins do more than some other admins, as the activity levels are not normalized. I'd treat each equally important. <b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:16, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>For those who are administrators only - how do you feel about non-administrators on the arbcom?

<dd>ArbCom is not "congress", it always scares me when people want to stick different people on courts/judical committees just to "be representative" (in some extreme cases, in might be a good idea, where the typical judge's neutrality is hard to tell and questionable). I don't think we are at that kind of extreme situation. Also, if someone is trusted as an arbitrator, they have already surpassed the trust level of the average admin. They may need to see deleted pages, and perhaps a policy can be drafted to give them the "sysop" rights if they win. For now, I'd say "if they win" but that doesn't address the deleted page issue, which is why some policy could be proposed maybe...but its easier for non-admin AC members who win to just RfA. If they fail, then I suppose that they would just have to work around it. Making the aforementioned policy would resolve that, but thats just more bureaucracy and instruction creep.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:16, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3. Should ArbCom arbitrate policy disputes or any other matter outside user conduct issues? Why or why not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not really, AC is to decide on conduct, not so much on policy interpretation (save the more obvious).<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 02:40, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. Do you think there should be an age requirement for ArbCom? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, as long as the person is reasonable. However, age, to an extent, can be a decent heurestical factor.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. I have read on several websites (they even gave links to block logs) of Wikipedia admins who do things like indefinitely blocking accounts who have not edited for months, there was no CheckUser anything, no reports, and the admin didn't give any reason, just put personal attacks as the block reason (e.g. saying "troll"). Basically such cases seem done beyond punative, but just out of bullying. I saw at least ten of these, but so far I can only find one here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Rhobite&amp;page=User%3AThodin" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Rhobite&amp;page=User%3AThodin" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I don't feel like digging for hours, as I just want to ask your opinion of whether you support or oppose such admin activity because it's clear most support it. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If the user trolled/vandalized a long time ago, and no longer does anything, it would be as well to just leave the account alone rather than block.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3. What is your view on the current policy often called "kicking them while they're down" of deleting the user and talk pages of people who are blocked? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well this depends on how bad of a troll the use was. If it was a strict troll and thats it, then I'am OK with deleting and tagging it. If it was a user that actually helped, but was banned by arbcom, I'd tag the page but not delete it.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. What is your view on the practice on Wikipedia where a person blanks out text on talk pages because the text mentioned something wrong the person did or defeated them in an argument? The text blanked usually has no reason given. When there is a reason given, it's only a fake reason. In rare cases, the text is not blanked, but the entire talk page is archived including discussions hours old, blanking it out. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If its the user talk page, then I'd just frown on it. If its another talk page (like article talk), then it is rollbackable, as you do not just remove people's comments without a really good reason (personal attacks are not usually good enough unless truly virulent).<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>5. What is your view on the frequent practice of locking the talk page of someone who is banned to avoid communication with them? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Only do this if they use unblock abuse. I wrote the bot that maintains <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a> for user pages, and it is quite a list, that is often not dealt with (as far as looking the user's IP page goes).

<p>6. Why is it that in the past when in a conflict in ArbCom between non-admins and administrators that ArbCom has usually sided with the admins? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 16:53, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most likely, a user who had been here for months and was deemed trusty enough to be an admin will be unlikely to be the unreasonable party in a case. However, its not impossible, and has happened before (Freestylefrappe, Karmafist).<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 16:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, the ArbCom elections are coming up very soon and I was wondering if you would give your public assurance not to vote or comment on other candidates. I think this will help keep friction to a minimum. Imagine how ugly it would be if two people who vehemently publicly attacked and opposed each other both ended up sitting on the ArbCom together. I think, in the best interests of decorum, these kind of conflict of interest issues should be avoided.
