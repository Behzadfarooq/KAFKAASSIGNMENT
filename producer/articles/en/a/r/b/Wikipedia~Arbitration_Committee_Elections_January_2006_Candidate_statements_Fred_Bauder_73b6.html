<p>I notice you are very focused on Communism in your edits. Do you support communism, and if so, how does it affect your views of the way wikipedia should be run?

<dd>I am a sort of natural communist in the sense that I am comfortable working in that environment. I certainly don't support imposition of communism on anyone. I guess I have a preconception that everyone should pitch in and make Wikipedia a success, an excellent reverence source we can all be proud of.

<dd>As a practical matter, being an arbitrator takes so much time and effort that I am not able to participate effectively in Wikipedia politics. So the short answer is that there is nothing effective I could do from the position of an arbitrator. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 14:54, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: 63, retired attorney</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: About 30 hours a week, yes, that is how much I put in.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: I think the articles which have involved the most successful collaboration have been <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_USA_850c.html" title="Communist Party USA">Communist Party USA</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989_f021.html" title="Tiananmen Square protests of 1989">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>. Although these are controversial articles the breakdowns which occurred have, with the help of others, been successfully resolved. It should be noted that several years of service as an arbitrator has somewhat limited my editing recently.</p>
<p><i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>

<ol>
<li>As a current arbitrator, you're particularly well-suited to know the current problems with the arbcom. In your mind, what is the biggest problem with the arbcom, and what what will you do differently if reelected to help fix it?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Our biggest problem is folks who struggle hard to get elected, do a lot of work for a few days, then either quit completely or slow way down, limiting themselves to voting on conclusions, not doing the hard work of investigating problems and proposing solutions. It is hard to predict who might do this, other than in the case of arbitrators who have previously served. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:48, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>You write the lion's share of the proposals for the arbcom at present. Do you see this as a potentially negative thing? Do you think it would be beneficial for other arbitrators to take on a larger share of the proposed decisions? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 19:37, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We have so much work that those with the time and energy to investigate and make proposals need to do it. The problem with overdoing it is somewhat allayed by the /Workshop page which makes propositions more tentative, allowing feedback before propositions are advanced for actual voting. Recusing from a few cases helps too. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:48, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I note here and on your User page you state you are a retired lawyer (attorney) and on your Talk page other Wikipedians have referred to you in your capacity as a lawyer. For myself and others, assessing someone's legal training and experience is an important factor for consideration in electing them to serve on the Arbitration Committee. Therefore, would you kindly advise from which university you received your law degree and which State Bar, past or present, you have been admitted to. Thank you. - <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">Ted Wilkes</a> 17:16, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for the partial answer, but could you please tell us if you are now or have ever been a member of the State Bar?. - <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">Ted Wilkes</a> 19:30, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you.

<p>No, such a statement would not be factually correct and is irrelevant anyway, If I had actually done something serious it would be a different matter. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 22:05, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Do you find it to be a conflict of interest to vote on a case involving Wilkes, when just the day before, Wilkes had requested arbitration against you?</p>
<p>Most editors are not privy to the inside goings on of arbitration committee. Most editors are outsiders who can only look at diffs and histories of edits made by members of arbcom. From an editors point of view, how would someone objectively know that a member of arbcom is not misusing their power when they vote against a case critical of their behaviour? How would someone objectively know that a member of arbcom is not misuing their power by accepting a case against an editor who had criticized them the day before?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am upset, but all of the accusations by Ted Wilkes came after the case was accepted. If I recuse myself it opens the door for a user to pick a fight with an arbitrator so they are forced to recuse. If after a case is started you pick a fight with an arbitrator you just have to live with the consequences. Besides I think I can do right by Ted Wilkes and Wyss anyway. They have a good point regarding Onefortyone's edits, they just went a little too far. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 03:42, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The Wilkes request arbitration here and it clearly lists you as the main defendant, and the opening statement of his request states: <i>Fred Bauder said on his <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Candidate_statements_e6ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Candidate statements">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Candidate statements</a></i>. It seems clear to me that you had an immediate conflict of interest in Wilkes RfA against you, and that you should have recused yourself there. And given the dispute with Wilkes there, you should ahve recused yourself from the RfA against Wilkes made the next day by Redwolf24. Don't you see a conflict of interest when you are specificially named as the defendent in an RfA regardless of whatever accusations come out of the RfA? <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 21:33, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, at what point could an outside editor bring an arbiter to an RFA and expect that the arbiter recuse himself? Wilkes RfA against you seemed more focused on you being a member of arbcom and whetehr or not you purposefully hid your disbarment or whatever. You tried to say that it was an attempt by wilkes to appeal a prior decision. Do you see it a good rule of thumb to simply let a member to decide if he should recuse or not, even if to an outside observer it seems there is an obvious conflict of interest? <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 21:51, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(2) There is a conversational thread on the RFA talk page regarding this case, excerpted below</p>

<dd>Ted Wilkes' request for an RfA is not an appeal of a prior arbcom decision and therefore any votes to reject it which are based on that reason should be disqualified. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=28537713&amp;oldid=28332942" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=28537713&amp;oldid=28332942" rel="nofollow">Wyss 22:11, 16 November 200 (UTC)</a></dd>

<p>(2) The thread ends at this point. If this RfA is so "very simply" as Carnildo states, then why wasn't Wyss informed that an RfA about a member of arbcom's behaviour is not within arbcom's "jurisdiction", ending this whole debate immediately rather than allow the talk page to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=28691891#Fred_Bauder" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=28691891#Fred_Bauder" rel="nofollow">explode</a>?</p>
<p>(3) If it is clearly a case that arbcom is outside of arbcom's jurisdiction, then what harm could come of Fred Bauder recusing himself from the vote? Fred could have voted "recuse", knowing "very simply" that it was such a straightforward case that the other arbiters would reject as "out of jurisdiction".</p>
<p>(3.1) Wouldn't a vote to "recuse" on Fred's part have maintained a separation of any possible conflict of interests, still knowing that the rest of the members of arbcom would reject it as out of jurisdiction?</p>

More than 90% of the ArbCom opinions given after yours seem to be in agreement with you, even on some very controversial issues.

<dd>I am rather disappointed with my "leading" role. I would much rather have colleagues with the kind of time I have to work the cases up. I'd like to sit back and say yes or no too. I've been set on my ear a few times though. I don't think anyone is intimidated but I sometimes wonder if they had time to dig into the evidence extensively they might come to different conclusions. As to a secret ballot there are problems as the community needs to know how people vote. We do a lot of talking about cases on irc and the arbcom mailing list anyway. Anyone needs feedback so when they make a mistake it can be corrected.

<dd>The suggestion allows for unrestricted communication during the process, the ability to change votes at any time, and complete transparency of the votes after the case is closed.

<dd>We don't really try to get the "trains to run on time", perhaps prevent repeated head on collisions is more like it. Most disputes need to be worked out in the wiki way through consensus and negotiation. Basically we don't get involved unless more communitarian solutions have broken down.

<p>You are often asked to recuse yourself from cases on the ArbCom (and are probably the Arbitrator most often asked to do so).

<dd>Generally not, but the general question of whether we should recuse in the case of an editor who has attacked us has been considered, especially those, such as yourself, who are dissatisfied with the result of an arbitration.

Increasing the number of arbitrators is not an answer in itself. What we need is a few, more active arbitrators. That may involve trying out quite a few users, problem is, once an arbitrator, always an arbitrator so folks who think they could do it, but turn out not to be able to often continue in the position but don't do too much.

<p>I hope Fred won't mind if I speak up in advocacy here. Please look at some other workshops, Andriyk. In the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Webcomics_Proposed_decision_fb23.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Webcomics/Proposed decision">Webcomics decision</a>, most of the final decision (or the pending final decision; last time I looked it had passed a motion to close but still hadn't yet been closed) came directly from the workshop. Principles, findings of fact, and remedies, mostly word-for-word. The committee was highly selective in its use of workshop material, choosing that which it felt was appropriate, but the concept has been an overwhelming success and I'm sure it has cut clerical work by the committee down immensely. It has also provided editors with a substantial stake in the arbitration process, and experience of the kind of material and considerations that are useful to the committee in producing its final decision, although the deliberation itself remains largely opaque. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:48, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the other hand, you voted for banning me for one month "for creating irreversible page moves". Putting aside the question whether and how much the "irreversible page moves" disrupt Wikipedia, I promised do not do it anymore. How and in which way the one-month-ban would "prevent disruption or damage"? Would not just saying "Do not do it any more!" do the same job? Is there no contradiction between your statement and your vote? If ArbCom would like to change my behavior, why not just tell me clearly, what exactly should be changed?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 12:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>I am concerned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" rel="nofollow">templates</a> surviving AfD that appear to contrast with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">established policy</a>. In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a cause for concern on many levels. Not only is it a problem in itself, but the dispute over it is a problem with a vote on Templates for deletion to keep, followed by its deletion by those opposed to it. The more extreme of these templates violate <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>. In those cases deletion is justified, but as they become less offensive it becomes harder to make a determination. Just saying you oppose superstition would seem OK. Putting a specific label on it that singles out a group that may participate here can cross the line. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 21:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
