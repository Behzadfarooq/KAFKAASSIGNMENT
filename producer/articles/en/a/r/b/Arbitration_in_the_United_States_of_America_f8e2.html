<p>Arbitration may also serve a distinct purpose: as an alternative to strikes and lockouts as a means of resolving labor disputes.

<p>Agreements to arbitrate were not enforceable at common law, though once the parties had actually submitted a pending dispute to an arbitrator, the arbitrator's judgment was usually enforceable. The reasoning for this was that the power of the arbitrator arose solely from the <i>mutual</i> consent of the parties to his jurisdiction; but by the time a dispute reached the point that one party wished to take it to an arbitrator, the other often preferred to take their chances in court instead. Thus, without the consent of both parties to his jurisdiction, the arbitrator lacked the power to decide the case.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, large <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporations.html" title="Corporations">corporations</a> became increasingly opposed to this policy. They argued that too many valuable <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">business</a> relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive adversarial <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litigation.html" title="Litigation">litigation</a>, in courts whose rules differed significantly from the informal norms and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_%28norm%29.html" title="Convention (norm)">conventions</a> of businesspeople (the private law of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce.html" title="Commerce">commerce</a>, or <i>jus merchant</i>). Arbitration was promoted as being faster, less adversarial, and cheaper.</p>
<p>The result was the New York Arbitration Act of 1920, followed by the United States Arbitration Act of 1925. Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or unconscionability or some other ground for rescission which undermined the validity of the entire contract). The USAA is now known as the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Arbitration_Act_9ad0.html" title="Federal Arbitration Act">Federal Arbitration Act</a>. Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_commerce.html" title="Interstate commerce">interstate commerce</a>, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislature.html" title="Legislature">legislatures</a> to protect their <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer.html" title="Consumer">consumers</a> against powerful corporations.</p>
<p>Since commercial arbitration is based upon either contract law or the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_treaties.html" title="Law of treaties">law of treaties</a>, the agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration is a legally binding <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a>. All arbitral decisions are considered to be "final and binding." This does not, however, void the requirements of law. Any dispute not excluded from arbitration by virtue of law (e.g. criminal proceedings) may be submitted to arbitration.</p>

<p>Arbitration has also been used as a means of resolving labor disputes for more than a century. Labor organizations in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, such as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Labor_Union_62c8.html" title="National Labor Union">National Labor Union</a>, called for arbitration as early as 1866 as an alternative to strikes to resolve disputes over the wages, benefits and other rights that workers would enjoy. Governments have also relied on arbitration to resolve particularly large labor disputes, such as the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal_Strike_of_1902_c9f3.html" title="Coal Strike of 1902">Coal Strike of 1902</a>.</p>
<p>This type of arbitration is commonly known as interest arbitration, since it involves the mediation of the disputing parties' demands, rather than the disposition of a claim in the manner a court would act. Interest arbitration is still frequently used in the construction industry to resolve collective bargaining disputes. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Steelworkers_of_America_1f5e.html" title="United Steelworkers of America">United Steelworkers of America</a> adopted an elaborate form of interest arbitration, known as the Experimental Negotiating Agreement, in the 1970s as a means of avoiding the long and costly strikes that had made the industry vulnerable to foreign competition. <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> uses a variant of interest arbitration, in which an arbitrator chooses between the two sides' final offers, to set the terms for contracts for players who are not eligible for free agency.</p>
<p>Unions and employers have also employed arbitration to resolve employee grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalgamated_Clothing_Workers_of_America_8194.html" title="Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America">Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America</a> made arbitration a central element of the <i>Protocol of Peace</i> it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second decade of the twentieth century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Labor_Board_23ea.html" title="War Labor Board">War Labor Board</a>, which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy in three cases which came to be known as the Steelworkers' Trilogy. The Court held that grievance arbitration was a preferred dispute resolution technique and that courts could not overturn arbitrator's awards unless the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority,engaged in fraud or corruption, or violated basic due process.</p>

<p>In the United States securities industry, arbitration has long been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms are resolved in arbitration.</p>
<p>The process operates under its own rules, and is described in an article <a href="http://www.seclaw.com/arbover.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.seclaw.com/arbover.htm" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Securities Arbitration</a>. Securities arbitrations are held primarily by the <a href="http://www.nasdadr.com" class="external text" title="http://www.nasdadr.com" rel="nofollow">NASD Dispute Resolution</a> program and the <a href="http://www.nyse.com" class="external text" title="http://www.nyse.com" rel="nofollow">New York Stock Exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Some state court systems have promulgated court-ordered arbitration; family law (particularly child custody) is the most prominent example. Judicial arbitration is often merely advisory dispute resolution technique, serving as the first step toward resolution, but not binding either side and allowing for trial de novo. Litigation attorneys present their side of the case to an independent teritary lawyer, who issues an opinion on settlement. Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.</p>

<p>Various bodies of rules have been developed that can be used for arbitration proceedings. The two most important are the <a href="../../../u/n/c/UNCITRAL_0730.html" title="UNCITRAL">UNCITRAL</a> rules and the ICSID rules. The rules to be followed by the arbitrator are specified by the agreement establishing the arbitration.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards_4d81.html" title="Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards">Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards</a> (Done at New York, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">10 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>; Entered into force, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">7 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>; 330 U.N.T.S. 38, 1959) provides for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards on the territory of the contracting parties. Similar provisions are contained in the earlier Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards (Done at Geneva, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">26 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>; Entered into force, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">25 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>; L.N.T.S.&#160;???).</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions have instituted a limited grace period during which an arbitral decision may be appealed against, but after which there can be no appeal. In the case of arbitration under international law, a right of appeal does not in general exist, although one may be provided for by the arbitration agreement, provided a court exists capable of hearing the appeal.</p>
<p>When arbitration occurs under U.S. law, either party to an arbitration may appeal from the arbitrator's decision to a court, however the court will generally not change the arbitrator's findings of fact but will decide only whether the arbitrator was guilty of malfeasance, or whether the arbitrator exceeded the limits of his or her authority in the arbitral award or whether the award conflicts with positive law. The Supreme Court has described the standard of review as one of the narrowest known to Western jurisprudence. Wherever so seen, arbitration may be the best approach to the legal manners and parties involved.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration_in_the_United_States_of_America_f8e2.html" title="Edit section: Arbitrators">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arbitrators</span></h2>
<p>Arbitrators have wide latitude in crafting remedies in the arbitral decision, with the only real limitation being that they may not exceed the limits of their authority in their award. An example of exceeding arbitral authority might be awarding one party to a dispute the personal automobile of the other party when the dispute concerns the specific performance of a business-related contract.</p>
<p>It is open to the parties to restrict the possible awards that the abitrator can make. If this restriction requires a straight choice between the position of one party or the position of the other, then it is known as <i>pendulum arbitration</i> or <i>final offer arbitration</i>. It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it more likely they receive a favourable decision.</p>
<p>No definitive statement can be made concerning the credentials or experience levels of arbitrators, although some jurisdictions have elected to establish standards for arbitrators in certain fields. Several independent organizations, such as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Arbitration_Association_789a.html" title="American Arbitration Association">American Arbitration Association</a> and the National Arbitration Forum<a href="http://www.adrforum.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adrforum.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, offer arbitrator training programs and thus in effect, credentials. Generally speaking, however, the credibility of an arbitrator rests upon reputation, experience level in arbitrating particular issues, or expertise/experience in a particular field. Arbitrators are generally not required to be members of the legal profession.</p>
<p>To ensure effective arbitration and to increase the general credibility of the arbitral process, arbitrators will sometimes sit as a panel, usually consisting of three arbitrators. Often the three consist of an expert in the legal area within which the dispute falls (such as contract law in the case of a dispute over the terms and conditions of a contract), an expert in the industry within which the dispute falls (such as the construction industry, in the case of a dispute between a homeowner and his general contractor), and an experienced arbitrator.</p>
<p><a name="Critics" id="Critics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration_in_the_United_States_of_America_f8e2.html" title="Edit section: Critics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Critics</span></h2>
<p>Critics of arbitration argue that contractual requirements to arbitrate can be unfair to employees or consumers who have no power to negotiate what is often a form contract. In these cases, the choice of arbiter may be spelled out in a contract. The arbitration panel may contain industry experts who may be more sympathetic to the industry than to the individual. Also, some have argued that the fact that an arbitration company may handle many cases for a corporation while an individual rarely goes through arbitration twice may bias the arbitrators in favor of the company. On this note, many arbitration companies have these corporations as their sole source of income, further biasing their judgments. The fact that most arbitral procedures are not public, and that there may be no provision for an individual to be represented by counsel, may also work to the disadvantage of the individual. These potential disadvantages make the ethics and professionalism of arbitrators even more important.</p>
<p>Arbitration in the U.S. has also been criticized because of the unavailability of appellate review. Although the New York and federal arbitration laws were based on the English arbitration law of 1898, they omitted the English provision permitting for de novo review of questions of law. Thus, American courts can overturn arbitral rulings only for extremely gross procedural errors that violate <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process.html" title="Due process">due process</a>, but cannot reverse most substantive errors.</p>
<p>Unlike judicial opinions, arbitration opinions are often confidential. As a result, the law relating to activities (such as reinsurance contracts and certain types of securities industry disputes) where contracts to arbitrate are widespread may develop more slowly because the usual process of creating <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedent</a> is not available.</p>
<p>Critics say arbitration can mean high filing fees, unqualified arbitrators, lost legal rights, limited awards and no appeals. Filing a case in state Superior Court costs from $90 to $185, depending on the amount claimed. Filing fees for arbitration can cost thousands of dollars, depending on the case and the arbitration firm. Fees for hearing rooms and the arbitrator's time can run tens of thousands of dollars more and discourage individuals from pursuing a case.</p>
<p>In court, Judges or other judicial officers hear cases. Many arbitrators are former judges, but some are not even lawyers. Arbitrators are rarely required to follow the law and are regulated in only two states. Judges are usually assigned according to a rotation or by a presiding judge. Parties select arbitrators, usually from a list compiled by an arbitration firm. Firms offer parties various methods of striking names from the list and reducing them to one. If the parties cannot agree, the firm may designate an arbitrator. .</p>
<p>In courts, the right to a fair process is protected by legal safeguards such as discovery, testimony and evidence rules. Court rules do not apply to arbitration, meaning the arbitrator - sometimes guided by an arbitration agreement or the rules of an arbitration firm - controls the process.</p>
<p>Arbitration awards are generally lower than in court, and arbitration agreements sometimes limit the type of damages an individual can recover.</p>
<p>Judges' decisions are public record and subject to appeal. Most decisions by arbitrators are confidential. They cannot be appealed and are subject to judicial review only in narrow circumstances.</p>
<p>Critics say many arbitrators "cut the baby in half" irrespective of the merits of the parties' cases.</p>
