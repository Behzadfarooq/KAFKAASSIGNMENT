<p>The newspaper was born as a consequence of the split of the Labour Party in the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>. Unlike in most of the country, the was <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communistic</a> majority in the local party organisation in Trondheim, and the communistic branch, that became the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_Communist_Party_f592.html" title="Norwegian Communist Party">Norwegian Communist Party</a>, secured the parties assets, including the party newspaper <i><a href="../../../n/y/_/Ny_Tid_2c27.html" title="Ny Tid">Ny Tid</a></i>, that had been started in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>. Among <i>Ny Tid's</i> most known <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalists</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editor.html" title="Editor">editors</a> was <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Tranm%C3%A6l_dc4b.html" title="Martin Tranmæl">Martin Tranmæl</a>. The Labour Party in Trondheim prioritised the work to establish a new newspaper, and at the annual meeting it created an extra member fee for the purpose. A new newspaper was published on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> under the name "Arbeider-Avisen - organ for the Norwegian Labour Party". Within the party a lot of people saw the newspaper as a direct succession of Ny Tid.</p>
<p><i>Trøndelag Social-Demokrat</i>, that had been established by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democrats</a> that had left the party during the first party split in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> due to the membership in <a href="../../../k/o/m/Komintern.html" title="Komintern">Komintern</a>, was <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merger.html" title="Merger">merged</a> in to <i>Arbeider-Avisen</i> at the merger of the two parties in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>. Also the newspaper <i>Arbeidets Rett</i> in <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levanger.html" title="Levanger">Levanger</a> was merged with the new newspaper, making it a pan-<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B8/Tr%C3%B8ndelag.html" title="Trøndelag">Trøndelag</a> newspaper. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> <i>Ny Tid</i> lost the strugle against <i>Arbeider-Avisen</i> as the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a>' newspaper in Trøndelag and was closed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_Nygaardsvold_5b4e.html" title="Johan Nygaardsvold">Johan Nygaardsvold</a>'s government had created increased support the Labour Party in his own part of the country, something <i>Arbeider-Avisa</i> gained from.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbeider-Avisa_5731.html" title="Edit section: Stopped during the war">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stopped during the war</span></h3>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_invasion_of_Norway_26b5.html" title="German invasion of Norway">German invasion of Norway</a> the entire media environment in Trondheim changed. At the start of the war the city had four daily newspaper, the largest was <i>Dagsposten</i> (15,000 issues) followed by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> <i><a href="../../../a/d/r/Adresseavisen.html" title="Adresseavisen">Adresseavisen</a></i> (15,000 issues), <i>Arbeider-Avisen</i> (10,000 issues) and the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> <i>Nidaros</i> (10,000 issues).</p>
<p><i>Arbeider-Avisen</i> continued to come out during the war, but soon met problems. In <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article.html" title="Article">article</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editorial.html" title="Editorial">editorials</a> there were clear stands in cases that were in conflict with the German interests, resulting in that the newspaper was stopped for shorter or longer periods. The first such stop occurred on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> and the newspaper was stopped for six days. The punishment came after a small notice from a <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipalities_of_Norway_612b.html" title="Municipalities of Norway">municipal council</a> debate in <a href="../../../l/e/k/Leksvik.html" title="Leksvik">Leksvik</a> under the title "Someone who doesn't give up". Under the real message is was added: "We have taken under doubt to increase the line distance so the readers better can read between the lines". The final stop order came on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_29.html" title="January 29">January 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> when German and Norwegian <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> met up at <i>Adresseavisen's</i> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printing_press.html" title="Printing press">printing press</a> where <i>Arbeider-Avisen</i> was printed and wrecked the printed pages with a <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sledge_hammer.html" title="Sledge hammer">sledge hammer</a>. The three other Trondheim newspapers barely mentioned the event with a small notice from central authorities: "<i>Arbeider-Avisen</i> has lately repeatedly published articles and messages that only has had the intention of giving an unwanted ifluence on the newspapers readers, and by that evading civil obedience, at the same time it is damaging the work that Norwegian and German authorities are conducting in cooperation. The stop was intended to last only four weeks, but instad leaster throughout the entire war. The newspaper's editor Harald Langhelle was in October <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrest.html" title="Arrest">arrested</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution.html" title="Execution">executed</a> as one of ten after a <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotage</a> at Fosdalen Mines in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malm.html" title="Malm">Malm</a></p>

<p>When the peace came on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/r/o/Trondheims-Pressen_1237.html" title="Trondheims-Pressen">Trondheims-Pressen</a></i> was launched, a common newspaper created by <i>Adresseavisen</i>, <i>Arbeider-Avisen</i> and <i>Nidaros</i>. It was produced at <i>Adresseavisen</i> after press from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_resistance_movement.html" title="Norwegian resistance movement">resistance</a>, who wanted to avoid to much unfair competition because of the many newspapers that were stopped during the war. But on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a> the ordinary newspapers were back on the street, each with about 30,000 issues. <i>Dagsposten</i> was not part of the project, the newspaper had voluntarily been <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">nazified</a> during the was and did not survive the peace. The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">christian</a> <i>Dagsavisa</i> was established in the ruins of <i>Dagsposten</i> and survived about ten years. In light of communisms newgained popularity <i>Ny Tid</i> was published again for two years, before being closed again. Adresseavisen had during the war taken over both advertisers and subscribers who had fled from <i>Dagsposten</i>.</p>
<p>While <i>Adresseavisen</i> and to a certain extent <i>Nidaros</i> had intact production equipment, <i>Arbeider-Avisa</i> stated with nothing. Not even a pencil was left after the Germany occupants had cleansed the offices. But thanks to hard work from former employees and not least the labour unions, the newspaper could again start production, layout and printed at <i>Adresseavisen</i>, with Ole Øisang back as <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editor.html" title="Editor">editor</a>. <i>Adresseavisen</i> was convicted, as part of the newspaper trials after the war, to pay a compansation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_krone.html" title="Norwegian krone">NOK</a> 600,000 to all newspapers. Despite this, it didn't take many days after the war to see that <i>Adresseavisen</i> had won the newspaper war. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> <i>Arbeider-Avisa</i> (21.400) had half the number of subscibers as <i>Adresseavisen</i> (41.000).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbeider-Avisa_5731.html" title="Edit section: Post-war">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war</span></h3>
<p>After the war <i>Arbeider-Avisa</i> had three major developments. The number of issues fell, costs exceeding income and the removal of the church journalism. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> the newspaper merged with <i>Namdal Arbeiderbland</i> in the company A/S Trønderpresse and some time later with <i>Stjørdalens Blad</i> to strengthen the economy, something that also happened. The two other newspapers were demerged in the 1970s and 90s respectively.</p>
<p><i>Arbeider-Avisa</i> was an innovative newspaper when it came to technology. Early in the 1970s it converted to <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloidformat</a> at the same time it started printing in <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offset.html" title="Offset">offset</a> at its own press. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> it became a morning newspaper, but this was not a success since <i>Adresseavisen</i> was well established in the morning market. In the middle of the 1980s the newspaper was one of the first in Norway were the journalists wrote the articles directly into computers.</p>
<p>Only once, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, has the newspaper been close to the target issue number of 20,000, right before the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_European_Communities_membership_referendum%2C_1972_04f5.html" title="Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972">Norweigan EEC election in 1972</a>. Editor Eigil Gullvåg took a stand for Norwegian <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Economic_Community_18c5.html" title="European Economic Community">EEC membership</a>, unlike most of the <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a> in Central Norway and among the newspapers readers and the growth was changed to decline. <a href="../../../a/-/p/A-Pressen_583e.html" title="A-Pressen">Norsk Arbeiderpresse</a> (now A-Pressen) went into the ownership of <i>Arbeider-Avisa</i> in the late 1980s and declared the newspaper a priority area, but neither this put an end to the rumours of an imminent death. Editor Terje Dalen lead the first dramatic cut-back and 30 prosent of the employees had to quit in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. After 45 years in Folkets Hus in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midtbyen.html" title="Midtbyen">Midtbyen</a> <i>Arbeider-Avisa</i> moved the offices and press to a new building in <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lade%2C_Trondheim_d39d.html" title="Lade, Trondheim">Lade</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> under leadership of editor Bjørn Stuevold. In Folkets Hus in the city centre the offices had grown so much it had been in four floors, connected through labyrinths of corridors.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbeider-Avisa_5731.html" title="Edit section: Last years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Last years</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> the newspaper changed name to <i>Avisa Trondheim</i> at the same time it moved back to the city centre. On the owner side there had been a small revolution as Studentsamskipnaden i Trondheim (SiT) and Norske Aller became coowners of the multimedia corporation Trøndelag Avis og Kringkasting through a cooperation with Radio 1 and Norsk Arbeiderpresse. A major refinancing was to insure the newspaper a good economy without <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debt.html" title="Debt">debt</a>. As part of the agreement SiT was to buy between 2,000 and 3,000 subscriptions and give these onwards to its students, an agreement that met large resistance among the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">students</a> and was quickly abolished.</p>
<p>A refinancing in the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> was successful, where the competitor <i>Adresseavisen</i> was part. The year later all the emplyees in the newspaper were fired and asked to apply to new jobs in the newspaper in an attempt to reduce the number of employees and save money. But the losses contined, among others because fo the reduction in sold newspapers. Just at the end of the newspapers life the owners in A-Pressen asked <i>Adresseavisen</i> if they wanted joint ownership in the company, but before they answered A-Pressen declared the newspaper <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankrupt.html" title="Bankrupt">bankrupt</a>. The last issue came out on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> with 11,036 issues. Repeated attempts to start again failed. But after the bankruptcy was processed most of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creditor.html" title="Creditor">creditors</a> got their assets back. <i><a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagsavisen.html" title="Dagsavisen">Arbeiderbladet</a></i> bought the subscriber list while the Norwegian Labour Movement Archive and Library bought the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archive.html" title="Archive">archive</a>.</p>
