<p>Could we set a standard on whether pipes will be used in usernames or not? As of right now, 6 out of 9 usernames, as well as the User:Arbcom Candidate example, have their usernames piped. However, <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Candidate_statements_0622.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006/Candidate statements">this time last year</a>, all usernames were piped. So, for the sake of consistency, I'm going to pipe them all. (Usually, I'd just be bold and update it, with an explanation in an edit summary, but this is a rather important page, so I decided to give a thorough explanation here first.) <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a> 02:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quite a few editors, myself included, have some "questions for all candidates", while its a little late for this go around, perhaps in the next election we can look back at this to streamline the process (perhaps make a "questions for all candidates" page that gets subst:'d in for all new question pages. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 13:00, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. The effort to ask the questions of all the candidates should make sure that most such questions are worth asking.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 18:40, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with Geni. Is it not fairer when we ask questions to all rather than single out one candidate? Why would we want to punish this fairness with a penalty of having to do 35 unnecessary edits? I have one question that I'd like to ask primarily of one candidate, but since that is actually from a situation where (th)ey was helpful, I feel it would be unfair to impose this potential stumbling stone just on the helpful one. That said, maybe I just don't know enough about this election. Are there good arguments that outweigh my fairness concern? — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> <a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastianHelm_c25a.html" title="User talk:SebastianHelm">(talk)</a> 19:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Editcountitis" should be no more welcome here than on RfA, but I am sure a fair number of users will want to at least scan the candidates' edit counts (plus there may be one or two candidates who are under the eligibility minimum). I am advised that overuse of the edit counter tools uses significant server resources and results in delays for everyone, so we don't want a couple of hundred voters each individually running a count for each of a few dozen candidates. Would it make sense for the election officials to run the edit counter for each candidate as of a particular date and post the results somewhere (as is currently done on the talk page for RfA's)? Again, this is <i>not</i> to endorse overemphasis on anyone's edit count, but I am sure that it is information that some voters will want to have available conveniently as background information. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:40, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I'm going to take the non-pragmatic approach. Lets just <a href="../../../d/e/n/Wikipedia%7EDeny_recognition_05dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Deny recognition">deny recognition</a> of editcount, like we do to vandals. Granted, its a longshot that we can manage to keep it from infecting the elections, but why not try? What's there to lose?

<dd>No, my main concern isn't that the <i>edit counter</i> tool gets delayed; I've read that there is drag on the <i>Wikipedia server</i> (where the database with the text of Wikipedia lives) when too many people are running the count program at once.

<dd>There's an issue with posting tool results once, then again as new candidates come in later.

But I would like to get a rough idea of how active a candidate is, and in what space, and how long they have been editing, and how long an admin. I have been running FlCelloguy's tool, which must be the wrong way to do it, since each one takes a while, and sometimes it dies mid-run. Maybe someone could point me to a tool that runs easier? Because the issue is not whether it is easy to see the numbers. The issue is, will the numbers only be available to more experienced users. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 02:38, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, for those over 10K, I'm prepared to assume they have wide experience (seeing how long they've been around ties into that). For those with lower edits counts, I'd want to use an edit tool to look in more detail at where they've been editing. Then I would add these to the notes I am making on my user pages. As this will help me decide how to vote, I hope using my user pages in this way would be considered OK. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:10, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm feeling a bit frustrated here. The info exists, and some users have easier access than others. By not posting the data, there ends up being a closed group with information that is not generally available. This seems counter to the way Wikipedia should operate.</dd>
<dd>Yell at me if I cross a line, but, with all due respect, when you tell me what to consider and what not to consider, it only seems a step removed from telling me how to allocate my support. Deny me information if it is somehow in Wikipedia's best interests. Raise the edit count for sufferage to keep me from participating if novice users (400 edits, never participated in a <i>RFA</i>) should not be involved. But if I have a voice, I will decide for myself how to use it. I will decide for myself what matters and what does not. That's what I've been trying to hash out on <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_jd2718_ArbCom_notes_7561.html" title="User:Jd2718/jd2718 ArbCom notes">User:Jd2718/jd2718 ArbCom notes</a>.

<dd>There is quite a bit of information that is not generaly availible. Deletion histories for example. I will not tell you who to support and who not to support. I'm sure others will try to do so but I have no comment to make on the candidates other than those I have already made. I do retain the right to advise you as to what information to take into account. Histories of involvement in disputes is and places where they have had to make judgment calls are however you slice infinitely more significant than a candidate's edit count. I cannot not of course prevent you from using this flawed method to decide on candidates nor can I prevent you from spreading this information (well Ok I could but it is extreamly unlikely I would do so). If you want to know if candidates have taken breaks from the project then the logical thing to do would be to read through their talk page archives. This would have the advantage that you would learn far more about the candidate than you could from even the most broken down edit count.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 22:18, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Back to one colon. And when I found Radiant/Radiant!'s gap, I did read the logs and realize that I missed that departure (tied up with the mess around the pedophilia user box wheel wars and aftermath). The counts are not coming? Then they are not coming. But I wanted them to help me do my homework, not instead of doing my homework. In this case the counts directed me to an anomaly. Too bad they are not being made generally available. I, of course, accept this, but with disappointment. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 22:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I would do, once I'd looked at the spread of edits, is ask the candidate if they can explain any particular imbalance. If they can explain this, then it shows a good level of self-awareness, in my opinion. I agree that some data can be misleading when just presented as pure stats in a table, which is why I'd encourage people to come up with their own, extended versions of the table being worked on below, but to put them in their user space, not here. It would be nice if an objective version of the table remained here, or in fact be moved somewhere more visible (I'm hoping the people over at <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIGNPOST_5ebd.html" title="WP:SIGNPOST">WP:SIGNPOST</a> might run with this sort of thing in their articles). Any 'semi-official' version should obviously purely present data and not be misleading. In particular, having all the links to the statements and questions in one place is <b>very</b> useful to me. Also, I am pleased that the data on who has previously run for ArbCom is in the table, along with other accounts. This was not always clear from the candidate statements, though it was usually stated on the candidate's user pages. I think a certain amount of 'investigation' is to be expected for those running for ArbCom. Plus hard, tough questions based on those investigations. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:18, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is nothing to stop people "making notes" on the candidates on their own user pages, as a prelude to surveying them, reading their questions and statements, and then using a pin to select which ones to vote for, er, I mean carefully chose which ones to vote for. This could include pasting edit count tool results if a user wanted to compare different candidates. I made a brief start at this at <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_ArbCom_Elections_3585.html" title="User:Carcharoth/ArbCom Elections">User:Carcharoth/ArbCom_Elections</a> because I was interested in seeing the spread across ages of the candidates. Actually publicising such notes would be more problematic. I'm going to add a disclaimer to my notes before any candidate turns up and complains that I'm misrepresenting them...</p>
<p>Also, the Signpost two-part feature article on the candidates will do a better job of this, and they might summarise stuff such as age, gender and location (where known) and number of edits. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:58, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have always been curious about the need for a specific number of edits anyway. An administrator, or member of the arbitration committee, requires a certain level of wisdom, not editing frequency. A user with few edits who regularly participates in resolution disputes such as RfC or third opinions would appear (to me) far better qualified than a user with thousands of edits in popular culture articles and vandalism reverts. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 02:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The candidate with experience in dispute resolution and policy areas ought to have the 1000 edits in the normal course of dealing with those areas. The candidate who has only done popular culture articles and vandalism reverts should not be a candidate at all. It is a minimum threshhold; many users who should not be on ArbCom will exceed it, few users who should be on ArbCom will not exceed it. In addition, it does eliminate trivial candidates. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 02:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you can prove that you are the same user, then I don't see why not. To prove it, you'd need to have someone who is well-respected here who knows you in person. This would also in principle allow you to regain access to your old account, but as this would require a developer to directly change the database to either enable the email on that account or reset the password, and developers generally have better things to do, that might not happen in a hurry.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium"><font face="cursive" color="#808080">gadfium</font></a> 03:14, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree. Of course, if you had e-mail enabled on the old account, you can get a new password easily. If not, the policy is normally that you're out of luck, but I think an exception could be made for someone with 17,000 edits, and it's apparently not that big a deal to do (see Workshop discussion in the so-called Giano arbitration for more). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:18, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm I could do that, but if I do plan to run, I'm still thinking. I likely still have my email enabled.

<p>In my 6 months+ of protecting Wikipedia from vandalism attacks I have never once made an NPOV edit, something that is very hard to accomplish with human editors. I always express NPOV on any decision I make because I have no intelligence, I am only lines of code. I also never tire, I work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I think I have the most of edits of any account on this Wiki now, I have not counted since the toolserver database died. Taking a look at my talk page history, my overseers ensure that all concerns are promptly responded to.

<p>A petition to draft is a terrible idea. ArbCom is a big time commitment and if someone isn't interested in doing it then trying to force them into doing it is a bad idea.

<p>Well, I was very pleasantly surprised to see this, so thank you very much to Crzrussian. I considered running, and would find the time, but decided that I am probably still too new an editor (I became active around the beginning of July) to be the best choice. (I think even an RfA from me right now would draw some "too new, not enough edits yet" type opposes.) I intend to stay involved and may well run in 2007. (I am almost goaded into running right now after all by John Reid's comment, as I couldn't disagree more with the assumptions it makes, but I won't let that sway me.) <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 12:59, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, no, please! Don't mangle my words that way. I didn't say that being trained as a partisan would <i>make</i> anybody partisan; I said it was poor experience to play the part of an impartial judge.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In some cases, yes, lawyers who judge are perfectly impartial -- as between plaintiff and defendant. They may be trained partisans but most of them have played both sides of the fence and are also trained to be <i>professionally</i> partisan. Some lawyers do actually take moral careers but most are cheerfully immoral; if you walk in with cash in hand they will take your case. Sometimes, you don't even need money. In some ways, this is the foundation of the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adversarial_system.html" title="Adversarial system">adversarial system</a>: You can always get a lawyer to argue your side, even if it's patently absurd. If not for lawyers, every homebody picked up for walking down the street with a handgun in his pocket ten minutes after the local bottle shop clerk got capped would fry. A lawyer is on your side only while he's in court (or otherwise working for you); as soon as the gavel falls, he's out the door. It's a distinction that's lost on most laymen.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note that your local Bar Association has little to say about morality but much to say about professional ethics.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My objection has nothing to do with whether a lawyer comes to the bench with an ingrained bias in favor of, say, large awards to handgun victims -- or the reverse. I say a lawyer comes to the bench with a very strong, ineradicable bias in favor of <i><b>legalese</b></i>, legal maneuvers and trickery. A lawyer can tie up a courtroom for days with all kinds of ridiculous arguments, simply because the judge will entertain them. The judge won't say the arguments are silly any more than the attorney making them -- but you or I would, even after we understand them fully. Even if in the end, the judge raps the silly arguments down, justice delayed is justice denied (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ewart_Gladstone_b6ab.html" title="William Ewart Gladstone">Gladstone</a>). A layman judge will call a halt to this monkeybusiness; he can see it for what it is and has little tolerance for it. Lawyers are technicality junkies; their heads don't even begin to clear in the morning until they've had a strong shot of it.</dd>

<dd>I don't think the public is well served by judges who entertain weird arguments creeping in on tiny feet. Judges need to understand law right up to the point where it begins to become absurd. At that point, a little ignorance is good for all of us. I don't worry about Maximum Bob; he's not all that common. Most judges are as fair as they know how to be; it's a form of repentance, I believe, for a lifetime of battling by any means, fair or foul. But they're generally inclined to be lenient <i>to attorneys</i> with their legal fictions and that is <i>harsh</i> to all the rest of us. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_Q4ArbComminee_a803.html" title="User:John Reid/Q4ArbComminee">&#160;°</a> 03:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As of approx. 11:00, 20 November 2006 (UTC) there are 28 candidates for ArbCom. The total number of questions asked of these candidates is 1,100. Between the candidate statements and the questions and answers for each candidate, there is approximately 1,385K of text. I started to wade through all this to attempt to form my views on this, but frankly, it's just too much. The scary thing is, it's still growing. Here are the statistics:</p>

<p>Note: Some of the question counts might not be accurate because inconsistent formatting sometimes made it difficult to identify the questions from the answers. Also, in some cases there was a great deal of back-and-forth between the questioner and the candidate—in general, I only counted follow-up questions when they were separately identified as a question.</p>

<p>Answering the question in the header, it's hard to avoid that conclusion.

This is the first election I'll be voting in, so anyone with longer-term experience should correct me, but my understanding is that the endorsement and disendorsement pages would have related to a year in which the voting was done secretly (a la the recent Board election). This election is to be comparable to last year's, in which users posted supports or opposes to the candidates' voting pages, a bit more analogous to an RfA. So as I understand it, it will be possible for those who wish to hold off on voting and scan the votes and comments already cast. Again, someone correct me if I'm wrong, please. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two ways to make things less "out of hand". (1) The voters can work together in the wiki-way (many hands make light work) to produce summaries like the table below. (2) The candidates can demonstrate their suitability (or even their unsuitability) for ArbCom by refactoring and packaging and presenting the material, in a similar way that they may have to do if elected to ArbCom. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A few points. Firstly, the initial candidate page requested a 400 word entry. Adding this information to the statements will likely exceed that limit. Secondly, "refactoring" the material on the talk page implicitly invalidates the individual user's questions. If user Z asks a question for the third time, the better response, IMO, is to point him or her to where the question was answered the first time. Thirdly, similart sounding questions may have subtle but significant differences. Refactoring would remove this nuance. Perhaps wikipedia should also be interested in arbitors who are sensitive to nuance and subtelty wen dealing with interpersonal issues, than just ones who can synopsize main points. An ArbCom ruling needs to be clear and unambiguous; the discsussion need not, and perhaps should not, be bound to the same rigid guidelines. The questions here, I believe, are not meant to be in the form of ArbCom rulings; rather, they should ennable richer insight into the judgement of the candidates in order for each and every one of us to make the best decision that we can. In that vein, I feel that removing information would be counterproductive. If someone feels that they need to make a decision based on "headlines" instead of "story", that is their perogative, but it should not interfere with those of us who would like to gain the best understanding of the candidates that we can. Thanks.

<dd>Not I. This is a very silly rationale for voting (or non-voting). If some candidate's supporters are good at drawing stickers, it's their right to use promotional material for expressing opinions on their talk pages. This has nothing to do with the candidate. Furthermore, the stickers are applied on a very limited scope. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 09:04, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it possible to add more things to this table? I was thinking of things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>Date of self-nomination for this ArbCom election (ie. early on or later in the process)</s></li>
<li><s>Whether anyone is a <i>former</i> admin, or lost/resigned adminship and then regained it.</s></li>
<li><s>Whether anyone is a <i>former</i> (or current) ArbCom committee member</s></li>
<li><s>What other positions the candidates hold (eg. Bureaucrat, Steward, etc) - this could be done using the 'Special:Permissions' thingy, or whatever it is called.</s></li>
<li><s>Whether anyone was a candidate in previous ArbCom elections.</s></li>
<li><s>Whether any candidates have ever been blocked.</s></li>
<li><s>Turning the dates into actual length of time as an editor and as an admin</s></li>
<li><s>Using {{<a href="../../../a/d/m/Template%7EAdmin_f5de.html" title="Template:Admin">Admin</a>}} to help people look at what the candidates have done (for the admin candidates), and/or some variant of {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_1544.html" title="Template:User">User</a>}} (which would be more relevant for non-admin candidates).</s></li>
<li>Asking the candidates to aid the tracing of their contributions all the way back (as in the examples above) by revealing other accounts they have used to edit Wikipedia.</li>
<li><s>A column with a link linking straight to the candidate statement subsection.</s></li>
<li><s>A column with a link linking straight to the candidate's questions subpage.</s></li>
<li><s>A column for "Other accounts".</s></li>
<li><s>Selected personal information (eg. age) where revealed.</s></li>
<li><s>Add details of those who have previously been, or are currently, involved with areas such as the Mediation Cabal and Mediation Committee.</s></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these might require research. Some might not be considered suitable for publication in this form (eg. block stuff should maybe be dealt with on a per candidate basis). Some of these suggestions could be limited to being used in notes made by various users on their userpages, but some could be 'semi-official' by being used here. What do people think? Are all suitable, or only some? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 03:41, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some of these things aren't suitable <i>for a table</i> because they'd only apply to one or two people. For example, I believe that of those listed above, only Uninvited Company was a former arbitrator (and only for a couple of months, see his statement), and also that he's the only bureaucrat running. I don't believe any of the candidates are former (but not current) admins but someone can correct me if I'm wrong. The other information (except maybe the last, but Chacor seems on top of that one) could be compiled easily enough if anyone wanted to do it. Personally I don't think these are the most important issues in evaluating the candidates, but within reason, more information is better than less information. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Some of it is easily dealt with by footnotes. You would have a footnote to Uninvited Company pointing out the "former arbitrator" bit. If Jayjg ran, you would have a footnote saying "current arbitrator" (unless you have to formally step down to run), etc. I agree that some of it seems to be unnecessary, but gathering it all together would allow easier investigation by those who want to do that, and it would also make it easier for people to get an idea of some of the differences between the candidates. If the candidates are worried that people might vote on the basis of such a table, then they should say so. I would say that the "candidate statement" link and the "questions" link should be the first ones, to make clear that they are the important ones. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 04:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added block log links to candidates who have been blocked at least once.

<dd>I agree that many of those blocks are not really noteworthy. I wouldn't like to judge what a "minimal infraction" is though, so I would suggest linking to the block logs for all the candidates, and let the voters work things out for themselves, and let the candidates state in their candidate statements, or in response to questions, why they were blocked. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:06, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just added ages (where available) to the notes column. I'm looking at the results, and I'm no longer sure if this was a good idea. I find the age range of the candidates interesting (14-56 where given), but I am now thinking that the actual ages of individual candidates are not that relevant. What would be the best way to handle this? I am particularly concerned about how to handle the information on the two candidates under 18. Those two candidates, ironically, may typify, in my opinion, the best and worst of allowing Wikipedia to be edited by anyone (of any age). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 20:41, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no strong feelings one way or the other on including the age information, although personally I would disclaim any intention to rely much, if at all, on candidate ages as a factor in voting. (Sidenote: It's novel to be able to type "voting" instead of "!voting" on a page in Wikipedia space&#160;:) ). To the extent candidates have voluntarily revealed their ages, including on their userpages and/or question pages, the information is out there whether it's included in table or not. Note that we already have one arbitrator who is under 18 (unless he had a birthday recently), so that does not seem to be an issue. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK. Second question. If age is not that relevant, surely gender is even more irrelevant. Again, this is something I'd be interested in finding out (purely to see if more females than males are running - of course, with the age range, we can't say men/women!), but I wouldn't be that bothered about this. Following up on the comment about ages of current ArbCom members, what is the age and gender spread among the current ArbCom? Anyone know? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 20:52, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) For what it's worth, to the best of my knowledge, I believe the age range is from 17 (per <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">User:Sam Korn</a>) to 54 (per <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_Bauder_722b.html" title="User talk:Fred Bauder">User talk:Fred Bauder</a>, see top of page), and I believe the current membership (see <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee</a>) consists of 12 males and 2 females. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Third question. Location. Might be of interest to some, but probably irrelevant again for the purposes of deciding on votes. These questions of mine were prompted by looking at the age, gender and nationality spread among the recent WMF Board election candidates. And yes, I know that this is en-Wikipedia ArbCom, not WMF Board, but I thought the comparison might be of interest. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:07, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know where in Wikipedia namespace it would go, and I wouldn't want it to appear that this is an "official" table, since there is a lot of subjectivity into what items are to be included and which criteria might or should matter to voters. But in any event, I would suggest not moving it at least until December 1st, so that the candidates can have a couple of days to make sure the information about themselves is accurate, and so the list of candidates is finalized (December 1 is the deadline for nominations). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:28, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. Interesting. It does mess up the formatting of the table a bit, and the amount of involvment varies.

<dd>That list of cases is definitely incomplete. JzG was involved in the <i>St. Christopher</i> case and has commented (not sure whether he was a party) in at least two others. MONGO was involved (not surprisingly) in the <i>MONGO</i> case. Geogre and John Reid were both involved in the <i>Giano</i> case. I'm sure there are others.</dd>
<dd>I also fear that posting those links could be really misleading. I don't know whether they will suggest that users have experience with the arbitration process (which would be a positive) or have been called into arbitration for bad user conduct (which would be a negative). For example, in some cases these editors have been involved in cases purely because they were the victims of vicious personal attacks and had to bring the cases to defend themselves. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:50, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>In case anyone is wondering about the "account compromised" thing in the block log for me: that was a moronic mistake by me. On IRC, I forgot to put in the / when I did "identify" and then the password. More moronic than that, I used the same password as for Wikipedia. The compromise lasted about an hour. I got a password change, went back, set a new and different one, and all was well again. Still, I had my friend Bishonen block me during that compromised time to be absolutely sure that no abuse could take place. Other than that, I have not been blocked. (Well, when I edited from the Netscape ISP, that ran through AOL's modem pool, so I ended up blocked by a mass AOL block from time to time, which gave me a great deal of sympathy for our AOL cousins.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:10, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And a heads-up about mine: my email account was actually comprimised (I don't know how, but I'm suspecting a keylogger, as I don't type my Wiki password but do for my email), and obviously the troublemaker who got in checked my recently recieved mail and responded in an unwitting fashion. This is confirmed by the fact that my father (so annotated by the nickname "Dad") recieved a message in which I "confessed" to using drugs, raping small children and doing other really sick acts which I won't repeat. As I had been in conference with WMF and the OTRS team at the time, this was my #1 recieved mail, and a quick browse of the conversation (it was all Fwd: and Re:'s) would have made it click to whoever did it that pretending that I'm leaving and requesting a block on my account would cause me trouble.

<p>I appreciate the support, everyone, but it's basically as SlimVirgin says; the thought of being trolled again during the voting (and afterwards) the way I was last year is just a bit too much to tolerate, considering that it is a time-consuming and pretty much thankless volunteer job. I don't mind doing the work, but I'm not in the mood for the circus that proceeds getting on the Committee. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:58, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
