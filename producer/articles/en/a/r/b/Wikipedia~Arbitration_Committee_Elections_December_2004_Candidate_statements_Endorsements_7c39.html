<p>This page is for the listing of endorsements either by or for specific users.</p>
<p>For a short period of time, opposition could be placed on the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_Disendorsements_0591.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Disendorsements">Disendorsements</a> page. However, a community majority has indicate their preference for the latter page to be merged with this page, and all opposition has thusly been merged. It is therefore advised not to use the Disendorsements page for such matters anymore.</p>

<li>Fred, as a current Arbitrator, I would hope you could at least provide one specific reason why you feel this way. "Fox in the henhouse" is a rather cryptic statement that leaves me wondering what the heck you're talking about. Please, can you provide some tips of what to look for in 172's edit history that makes you think he would be so dangerous to the other hens? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 14:15, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>172 has a long history of aggressive point of view editing which he covers up with a smokescreen of "academic authority". He is especially active with edits which whitewash left-wing totalitarian governments, leaders and actions. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:01, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)

<li>I won't respond to this bullshit. I will say, though, that this is an unacceptable slander from someone the stature in the community of a member of the Arbitration Committee. I am a professional historian; and most of my family was murdered in Nazi death camps. I do not tolerate being likened to Holocaust deniers. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:30, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC) [Just to contextualize these comments, they were in response to a point added earlier to Fred Bauder's statement above likening me to Holocaust deniers.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. When Shorne insulted Stan, calling him an "idiot" and a "propagandist", (on 13 Oct 2004) 172 expressed his support for Shorne instead of disapproval for insulting other Wikipedians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I suspect the reason is that Shorne and 172 have similar political orientations. I'd like arbitrators to condemn people who hurl insults, not to encourage them. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 18:02, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It appears that I am being blacklisted for having "the same political orientation a Shorne." Yet I really doubt that Shorne thinks that we share the same political affliations, given that I'm a leader of a local U.S. Democratic Party organization. Not that this means much... Many of the victims of these kinds of McCarthyite attacks like the one above along with Fred Bauder's weren't communists either. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:30, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Blacklisted" and "McCarthyism." I feel your pain, man. Of course, if the Democratic Party was made up primarily of people like you that'll bode well for the Republican Party's future, so keep on truckin'.</li>
<li>I am not going to respond here to the allegations that I "insulted" someone and that 172 supported the putative insult. I do wish to confirm that 172 and I do indeed part ways politically. I am openly contemptuous of the US Democratic Party, which I see as almost identical to the US Republican Party. Despite our significant political differences, I strongly endorse 172's candidacy for the Arbitration Committee.
<ul>
<li>172's comment on the dispute between Shorne and Stan suggests that he perceived the conflict in political terms ("Shorne and me [172] vs Stan and the rest of the rightwing clique"). But what really matters is not political motivation, but rather encouraging personal attacks. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 09:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As is quite obvious to anyone who can read, 172 and I don't agree with the allegation of "personal attacks" supposedly made by me. Moreover, 172 was right to frame the conflict as a political one. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 17:22, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Oppose. As you can see here and on the discussion page for this page. He doesn't believe in democracy. That doesn't mean he can't stand in an "election", but it does mean he's declared he's unsuitable for the post of arbcom. I think arbcom users will want their democratic rights of fre speech and equal treatment. I find he talks to people in a way that would be antagonising to arbitration users, and we know how much tact is needed in arbcom cases. There's no reason to assume he'll suddenly become more tactful if he's voted in. I also oppose all candidates who use these confusing names and symbols. In this case "(yto)". <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 21:31, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

Cecropia can be fair, but sometimes needs to be beaten into it. In one case, it took Cecropia a long while to give up on using sysop privs to call a vote in which he participated. In another, Cecropia tried to decert a certified RfC, even lobbying one certifier to withdraw. And, curiously, in both cases Cecropia sided with the same POV.

<li>Mildly respond, that no sysop privileges or powers were used in the issue at hand, so HistoryBuffEr can say he feels I acted wrongly, but not as a sysop. I removed the <i>claim</i> of certification because HistoryBuffEr, as complainant, had made no attempt to resolve the dispute with the editor he brought the RfC against, as required by the plainly posted rules. I advised him that he could rightly claim to be a certifier if he simply engaged the editor he was complaining of (and I suggested ways) but HistoryBuffEr felt he shouldn't have to do so. That was his right, but it disqualified him as a certifier.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AHistoryBuffEr&amp;diff=6381251&amp;oldid=6371183" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AHistoryBuffEr&amp;diff=6381251&amp;oldid=6371183" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<li>If I haven't lulled you to sleep, Buff, thanks for the opportunity to reminisce about old times. Thanks also for the nice things you said about me while "mildly" opposing me.

<li>Well, you're making less sense than the occasion warrants. You seem to be saying that you want people not to vote for me for the ArbCom, on the grounds that I figured out that you are a provocative idiot (at times) <i>other than by</i> exchanges between the two of us.

<li>Well it sounds like you're asking for an answer - provoking one, I might say. If you believe I am a "provocative idiot", you could have said so in September, and I could have cited <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> then instead of now. And, the characterization more starkly clarifies the quality (poverty) of your judgement skills, quite relevant for the AC. But to answer your concealed query, I'm dubious of condemnations from users who have never interacted with a candidate, and feel they at least warrant some manner of justification (which now you have been so kind as to belatedly provide, to your discredit). <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 00:00, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Staunchly Oppose</b> For someone who claims ArbCom shouldn't be more prosecutorial, he certainly has become the equivalent of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torquemada.html" title="Torquemada">Torquemada</a> by accusing me without evidence (and despite my denials) of planting a hoax (that existed before I came to Wikipedia), overreacting to a little issue, making baseless insinuations, and continuing to subject me to his harassment. His continued haranguing of me has provoked anger and hatred for him, something I try to avoid. He is a self-righteous jackass on a power trip. His treatment of VeryVerily above (who while I haven't had too much contact with, but what I have had has been good so far) is just an example of why he shouldn't be endorsed. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 22:06, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason for the investigation is a number of statements by ExplorerCDT in the VFD discussion <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Cayley-Newbirth_operation_matrix_3a19.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix</a> where he implied that he was the perpetrator of the hoax. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 00:07, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Still, he won't take "no, I'm not responsible" as an answer, no matter how many times I've said it. Hardly the impartial arbitrator. He's two steps above a stalker who ignores when his victim says "Go Away." —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 00:20, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One can see some further discussion of these allegations at <a href="../../../e/x/p/User_talk%7EExplorerCDT_4402.html" title="User talk:ExplorerCDT">User_talk:ExplorerCDT</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_baf7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics</a>. The matter appears to be nearing resolution; there were statements made by ExplorerCDT of a suspicious nature, which did merit an investigation by Chrarles and others, but these statements have mostly been retracted, and ExplorerCDT has sort of promised to provide a page reference that proves (as he has since repeatedly claimed) that his initial support of the hoax was based on a misreading rather than a deliberate attempt at disinformation. If that occurs and Charles does not acknowledge that his investigation was overzealous, then I would say that there is some grounds to this objection. In all other cases however I would support the candidacy. <a href="../../../t/e/o/User%7ETeorth_1d14.html" title="User:Teorth">Terry</a> 23:48, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Support. My experience with Dante is admittedly limited, but in his role as mediator he seemed willing to put in real effort to understand the conflict (much more than it seems current arbs do), to be fair and receptive to all parties, and to generally be patient, reasonable, and unassuming. If he displayed these qualities in the low-profile, often overlooked, often thankless, and perhaps even powerless job of mediator, I'd suppose that he would perform even better in the more noticeable and perhaps more important job of arbitrator. If I knew him better, I would be more sure. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 04:01, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the record I have been here for nearly a year, but my username was changed. I have had two usernames in the past, <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.99.6.125.html" title="User:207.99.6.125">207.99.6.125</a>, and Not Wikipedia Administrator. I held out getting a named account for a long time because I had a static IP anyway and didn't think the benefits of a watchlist were worth it (now I disagree) and didn't want to deal with the hassle of logging in and out and so on. My second username was based on an amusing episode I noted involving some fool who got a username called "Wikipedia Administrator." Surprisingly, Guanaco immediately and without warning actually blocked me from the Wikipedia for (about?) a day (not just the username but the IP too). Although I was surprised at that, and was tempted to, you know, fight it and all that, blah, blah, as soon as the block seemed to expire I figured, whatever, who cares, and just switched to DG. It's not a very interesting name but it's simple, short, and meaningful (my initials). Sorry that you were under the misperception that I had only been here for a couple of months.</dd>
<dd>As for that "poor revert decision" I stand by it. What was wrong with it? I note that several edits later by other users, they're still there. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> <a href="../../../d/g/_/User_talk%7EDG_200a.html" title="User talk:DG">G.</a> 10:08, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I <b>strongly oppose</b> Grunt. If elected, Grunt will, as a minimum, have to remove himself from any discussions involving Americans or America-related issues (he publicly and persistently describeds himself as anti-American, and therefore would not be able to arbitrate objectively any such cases). Given the large number of American users, this would be a serious impediment to him filling this role. Accordingly, I disendorse Grunt. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 00:59, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>In principle I partly agree with jguk here. The crude stereotype of the "typical American" is so far from reality as to betray rather clouded judgement, and the issue of this has been brought up enough for him to have noticed. On the other hand, his judgement seems fine and unbiased on other matters, so I'm willing to treat this as an anomaly and give the benefit of the doubt. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 03:55, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you read this, at the wikiEN-1 mailing list, (if the link works), you'll see that when I let people know about admin abuse on The Wikipedia, he chose to comment on the case, and showed that he doesn't know how an arbcom should act. For example he was antagonistic, and didn't bother to check the relevant history, but still made a strong condemnation of me. He thinks you can be blocked for "openly supporting" other users.

<li><b>Strongly oppose.</b> I oppose the reëlection of any current arbitrator. All active members of the current arbitration commitee have demonstrated themselves to be corrupt, unaccountable, and unresponsive. This includes James F.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Based on his handling of the VeryVerily, Shore, and Gz cases. I have been hesitant to post disendorsements and I haven't so far; but I am brining myself to do so reluctantly in this case in order to spark a much needed discussion concerning the incumbent Arbitration Committee. Alienating and banning three valuable contributors for two months instead of thinking of a creative way of settling disputes over the inherently contentious topics on which these users write does not serve the community well. We need more creative problem-solvers on the Arbcom. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:57, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose.</b> This person, a member of the arbitration commitee, has tried to make me loosen my objections on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Talk%7EPrincess_Olga_of_Greece_and_Denmark_2741.html" title="Talk:Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark">Talk:Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark</a> using a pro-"Western world" advocacy (bigotry) that offends people of the Orient. Such short-sightedness can harm the spirit within Wikipedia's community, that is (and has to be) multinational. Furthermore, if someone who claims to represent the lowest common denominator of common sense in the so-called "Western world" has his way, then there's no chance for the rest of us to prove any point against him. <a href="../../../e/t/z/User%7EEtz_Haim_186d.html" title="User:Etz Haim">Etz Haim</a> 01:27, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

I have a strong distaste for this whole (dis)endorsement crap, but I was only doing what I was under the impression was agreed upon convention. The fact that both the organizers and Jimbo himself warned on this page against disendorsements (instead of using the other for their warning) did nothing to dissuade me either. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:15, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you were paying attention to the straw poll, it closes November 28. While it is highly unlikely there will be a sudden deluge of votes going in the opposite direction, I believe the common-sense thing to do is to avoid ruling out any possibility. Once the strawpoll's deadline is up, that will be that. I will respect the will of the majority, even if there's no consensus per se. I should note that the first poll of any kind — the survey Michael Snow started — is inconclusive, as nobody can even claim a simple majority, so it has no bearing on what happens to this page. As for Quadell's strawpoll, it's not over till it's over. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:37, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In addition to the reasons stated above by Fred Bauder and myself, the following is more evidence of Johnleemk's poor behavior that serves to weaken his candidacy.
<ol>
<li>Twice Johnleemk stated, <i>"I won't feed the trolls."</i> From there, he moved to advise another editor, <i>"Just don't feed the troll..."</i> Recently, he said, <i>"Well, I've had enough of feeding trolls for now. Hope you enjoyed your supper."</i> <b>Johnleemk is unfit for the Arbitration Committee because he does not make due on his commitments. Put differently, Johnleemk does not practice what he preaches.</b></li>
<li>When Johnleemk is faced with an argument he disagrees with (or doesn't understand), he lashes out in anger using a variety of taunts attempting to bait his intellectual opposition into attacking him. <b>Arbitrators that <i>cause</i> need for arbitration would be described as undesirable elements of Wikipedia. Johnleemk as an arbitrator would be an undesirable element.</b> <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 10:07, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, sure, because calling someone who claims that the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policies apply outside the article namespace a troll is an ad hominem...sure. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:50, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Nice strawman agin, bub, but that won't work on me. While I may be ambivalent on how well-fed trolls should be, I certainly know when trolls try to make a loaded argument. That won't work, not on me, sir. Perhaps if you resorted to something other than the NPOV policy I would entertain you further, but until then, you think I'm going to reason with someone whose arguments completely lack it? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:28, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: I am assuming you're including me as one of the flakes. Have you ever wondered why so many people have bad things to say about this fellow? He whines and complains as the perpetual victim on his user page about people doing this and saying that against him! People have bad things to say about this guy because of his bad behavior. But you can label us as flakes because we have different beliefs or opinions than you that's fine with me. If people don't think like you they are flakes or nuts or weird or crazy or sick or stupid or dumb right? Intolerance has been going on since the dawn of mankind. Pitchka 03:22, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC) Note: Neutrality reverted my comment immediately after I posted this! Look below people were allowed to make comments in the Oppose category!!!

<dd><i>ChrisO</i>: "...registered users appear to be mounting a campaign against Neutrality,..."-Campaigning in an election? How unreasonable. <i>Pitchka</i>: "Note: Neutrality reverted my comment immediately after I posted this!"- Pitchka is right. Supporters' comments can be replied to if opposers' comments can. And people have been doing so, for example in "Neutrality"'s opposers' section. People have a right to information about a candidate in an election, (If this is one), so they can then judge whether to vote for the candidate.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 19:42, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> After returing to this site for the first time since February, I came across this so-called "Neutrality" user and this project page through the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recent_changes.html" title="Recent changes">Recent changes</a> feature... Without bothering to state his reasoning, "Neutrality" reverted the addition of the funeral for a major African American cultural icon. (I am wondering if there is a racial motive for this; it seems as if Wikipedia users only post stories that concern its largely middle- to upper-class white American readership, as opposed to representing a variety of stories of interest to a diverse range of classes, national origins, racial backgrounds, etc.) <b>Revert warriors must not be given positions of authority on Wikipedia.</b> <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWenteng_08df.html" title="User:Wenteng">Wenteng</a> 04:20, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Numerous editors seem to have thought it was inappropriate but Wenteng keeps reverting it (as of this posting, Neutrality has reverted it a total of <i>one</i> time compared to Wenteng's <i>four</i> times).--<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:28, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

Raul forged a number of 83%. In previous votes for adminship (I think he only got in the 2nd or 3rd time he was nominated), Neutrality repeatedly attempted to have opposing votes disbarred.

<li>I just re-read the transcript at the link provided above, and it does not reflect poorly on Neutrality at all. If anyone's actions were questionable, it would have been the folks conducting the vote, because Neutrality was not yet an Admin at the time. In any case, the logistics of that vote is all water under the bridge, as Neutrality has repeatedly proven himself to be a worthy Administrator. But don't take my word for it - I encourage voters to look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Neutrality" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Neutrality" rel="nofollow">edit history of Neutrality</a> and compare it to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Xed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Xed" rel="nofollow">edit history of Xed</a>, and judge for yourself.

<dd>to use the site and I think he'll do it to others. Probably driving new people from the site, and causing people distress, and no one will know this is happening. I say causing distress because we all know that people don't like being discriminated against on notice boards and that they get really stressed by such abuse.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He mis-uses his position as an admin and I think he'll do real harm as an arbitrator. I thought he was just the sort of person who shouldn't be an admin. I voted against him and it seems clear to me since, that he's targetted me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He blocked me on 13th Nov 04 for a month with no justification. He broke the Blocking Policy that says admins must put a warning on the user's talk page first and a notice telling them why they've been blocked after. He didn't do either. I just saw this as I edited:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Your user name or IP address has been blocked by Neutrality.</dd>
<dd>The reason given is this:Maliciously acting in bad faith to disrupt Wikipedia"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He's made this nonsense up and he had no grounds to block me. A few days later, when I asked ,another admin un-bocked me. The next day I edited for the first time, a couple of notes about arbcom election propsals, and he blocked me again. Broke the Blocking Policy again as above and this time it was:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"20:25, 26 Nov 2004 Neutrality blocked WikiUser (talk) (contributions) with an expiry time of infinite (Legal threats, see <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-November/032220.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-November/032220.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-November/032220.html</a>.) "</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Needless to say I made no legal threats and I doubt if the Wikipedia mailing list is covered by the site rules anyway. (Anyone can join and use a mailing list if they've hgot an e-mail address.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mirv un-blocked me: "20:50, 26 Nov 2004 Mirv unblocked WikiUser (that is not a legal threat, but a complaint. In any case, legal threats are not a valid reason for blocking).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Either he doesn't know the rules, isn't interested in learning them, or he's deliberately breaking them. Whichever, he shouldn't be an admin/arbcom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think he enjoys blocking people for the sake of it. The Wikipedia:Block log shows that he blocks people longer than others and for less "misconduct". He often blocks for "indefinite" and "infinite". The fact that he blocked me for so long, and for more than he does others, too, shows I think, the misuse/grudge I was on about above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He has some un-acceptable bad habits. Some I've seen are:</dd>
<dd>Deleting whole paragraphs by other people, including in contentious circumstances, and marking them minor edits.</dd>
<dd>Changing the meaning of a sentence and marking it a minor edit.</dd>
<dd>Deleting and moving other people's posts even when they're part of complaint procedures.</dd>
<dd>Taking control of people's talk pages using the same abusive methods.</dd>
<dd>Reverting without explanation ignoring the edits others have done in-between.</dd>
<dd>Reverting a page and marking it minor edit.</dd>
<dd>Calling perfectly reasonable people trolls when he doesn't like their views or them.</dd>
<dd>Lying: he's had on his user page for ages that Rex071404 vandalised that page. If you check</dd>
<dd>the history you'll see that all he did was make a polite request (28th July 04). And check out Neutrality's idea of reasonable discussion in the subsequent postings on his talk page at that time.</dd>
<dd>Often ignores people's enquiries complaints they put on his talk page. Also archives them straight away.</dd>
<dd>If something shows him in a bad light he deletes it while leaving everything else that was there on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

You think they're wrong simply because they don't praise you. - "Neutrality" also called it vandalism and threatened to ban me immediately just for pointing out (to other users) links to his admin election page and the arbitration case he did against Rex071404.

<p><b>Strongly Oppose</b> I strongly oppose Neutrality for anymore advancement or "power" he thinks that he runs this place already. I was contributing a lot to two lists of peoples Pro-Choice and Pro-Life and it was getting a lot of contributions from like minded people who are interested in this subject matter. There are a lot of people who don't like the list pages in general and then there are the ones like Neutrality who don't like certain subject matters for political reasons. He didn't like the Pro-Life list and would change the whole article and list to a re-direct page even after many people contributed to it. He wouldn't leave it alone. He didn't touch the Pro-Choice page and list, just the Pro-Life page, we can all see where his bias lies.</p>
<p>I and others got into a revert war on this page and he would not talk it over or anything, it was his way or nothing. Literally nothing! After the page was split because the list became so big Neutrality didn't like it so he and his "buddies" voted to delete both the list of pro-life and pro-choice supporters! But everyone knew he wanted to get rid of the pro-life list at all cost. This was proved when the Pro-Choice list was restarted sometime later and there were just a few votes to erase it and Neutrality had no problem with that list and didn't even bother voting either way and neither did his buddies many of them can bee seen on the above Supporters list!</p>
<p>If you cross this Neutrality he will get even with you. He seems to have problems. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Pitchka</a> 02:18, Dec 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Strongly oppose. Inept, biased, unresponsive, vindictive. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 01:17, Nov 18, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Gzornenplatz's words are a bit strong. But Raul654 has been striking me as a bit cabalish lately; and he doesn't do nearly as good of a job explaining his reasoning in cases as, say, Jwrosenzweig. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 03:32, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not sure anti-endorsements belong here, but I (shockingly) agree with these sentiments. Although I once thought Raul was clearheaded and voted for him in the last election, my recent experiences have been very poor. He, in his role as arbitrator, made demeaning comments to me based on something he mistakenly believed I had done, due to failing to look at the material he had been given. There was no response to my further queries, much less an apology for his error. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 07:54, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've also noticed that a number of arbitrators, along with a number of the likely "frontrunners" in this race, have a bit of a self-righteous and condescending streak to them. They seem to believe that they have earned the trust of the community; and with they feel that they are entitled to 'talk down' to general users. However, their source of status may not be too impressive. Users like Raul are simply more 'trusted' and popular than users like Gzornenplatz because they can avoid certain kinds of conflict. This isn't the case because they are inherently better behaved than users who get in revert wars; it's just easy to steer clear of edit wars when you're spending most of your time on cleanup, meta, IRC, or the mailing list and not working on the contentious topics in which Gzornenplatz and VV are interested. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 12:23, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>World, take note: 172, I, and possibly Gz agree on something. People whose passions are in particle physics, ancient Greece, or children's toys will simply not be exposed to the same stresses that editors on communism or nationalism are. But this is a dubious ground for the air of superiority, of being a better person, the former type often exude <i>vis-a-vis</i> the latter. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 13:28, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing with VeryVerily. People like me are blackened as "edit warriors" solely because we write primarily on contentious political topics and have to put up with impossible people who revert everything we do without discussion. Those who deal primarily with <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macram%C3%A9.html" title="Macramé">macramé</a> or <a href="../../../r/h/u/Rhubarb.html" title="Rhubarb">rhubarb</a> get a good reputation merely by dint of avoiding controversial topics. As for Raul654 and the other haughty arbitrators, their record is available for anyone who cares to look at it. (See below for some references.) Merely being incumbents should bring them no glory: they have proven to be appallingly biased, unaccountable, and vindictive, not to mention slow to take their (unjust) actions. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 03:50, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>In my own defense</b> - for those who are unaware, all of the complaining users above (Gzornenplatz, 172, VeryVerily, and Shorne) are currently under investigation by the arbitration committee. In fact, taken together they are involved in almost half (5 out of 13) of the current cases. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 06:38, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)

<li>Before concluding from this insertion that we "complaining users" are acting out of spite, users would do well to consider why people whose cases are pending would antagonise an arbitrator. If we were acting wholly out of self-interest, we would curry favour with Raul654. Readers should also look into the record of Raul654. I have provided three links below that prove every single allegation stated above: inept, biased, unresponsive, vindictive, demeaning, self-righteous, condescending, superior, haughty, unaccountable, slow. More proof could easily be found.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Good user-- but his handling of the VeryVerily, Shore, and Gzornenplatz case has been very disappointing. VV, Shorne, and Gz are not vandals, cranks, or trolls; they are highly intelligent and prolific contributors.

When the Arbcom should have helped to resolve a series of conflicts, it intead treated these three users as criminals of sorts.

People come to The Wikipedia believing its glowing propaganda, then can find themselves targeted by this user when they may not even know they've broken a rule. He blocked me for 24 hours against the stated rules. I also object because of the large amount of offensive material he's put on The Wikipedia. This web site doesn't have an "18 only" agreement on the front page, so he's therefore also exposing children to this. He just wants the position but doesn't want to do the work involved. In the case against Rex071404 other arbcoms voted but he kept everyone hanging on for weeks: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FRex071404%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=7411374&amp;oldid=7123445" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FRex071404%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=7411374&amp;oldid=7123445" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>].

<p>I would support Sam. Sam has made excellent edits, particularly to articles involving religion and in particular Hinduism. Yes, he has strong views. But if you present him evidence, he will be swayed by your argument. One case in particular. I fukin explained to him that Shakti is not separate from Shiva and Shakti is worshipped to attain union with Shiva. Once presented, he did agree with me. You need a strong advocate like Sam especially on articles concerning religion. There's appears to be favor towards Western religious traditions and bias and ignorance towards Hinduism or Santana Dharma. There was no mention of Hindu saints or attributes of God in the article God until I put it in. As for his view on atheism, atheism and religion, like politics are always highly charged emotional issues. Sometimes, you need to have two tough minded people in order to achieve a neutral point of view. Sam and I collaborated on discussions of Brahman. There were some who claimed that there was no discussion of Brahman in the early vedas. I convinced others by mentioning Shri Rudram. I think Sam, can be convinced to your point of view if you show him evidence. That has been my experience with him. I know that others may have different experiences but as for disputes involving religion, he will have a broadminded approach.</p>

Btw, there is nothing wrong with other users publicizing what they believe to be Sam Spades' misdeeds (as long as they are honest); afterall doesn't free speech go both ways?

Wikipedians need to know they can trust the ArbCom. I could not trust an ArbCom with Sam on it. My experience with him has been that he can talk a good game about fairness and NPOV but he will not walk the walk; he will always phrase what he wants to do in terms of nice, neutral principles but it doesn't take long at all to see him switch to a different set of principles when the ones he was just advocating are no longer convenient. ArbCom needs people willing to adhere to one standard for everyone, and I see no hint that Sam Spade plans to drop the double standards that have caused me to not trust him even as an editor, let alone as an Arbitrator. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 05:32, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. Sam is a friendly fellow and a probably nice enough sort of guy in general, but based on my experiences with him concerning edits of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Talk%7EPantheism_a026.html" title="Talk:Pantheism">Pantheism</a>, I feel that he is a man with very strong POVs, and I do not feel that the evidence supports his claim that he is able to put them aside when editing. I also feel that Sam's former advocacy for the now banned user Paul Vogel (a known Neo-Nazi sympathizer) throws some question on the suitability of his personal and political beliefs to the responsibilities involved with the office. If Sam sympathizes with bigoted views (and I am not saying he does or does not, only that his involvement with Vogel raises some questions), I would see such a fact as a potential problem with his candidacy. Sam probably has the editing skills and dedication for the position, but I am not convinced that he has the NPOV commitment for it. As mentioned by others, Sam is fairly immoveable in the face of evidence against his POV, and he is not impressed by any number of legitimate credentials other editors may have regarding the subject matter. It seems that if Sam is editing an article, it belongs to him, and his presence alone overrules evidence, credentials, and logical argument from others. I do think that Sam honestly believes that the majority of his edits are in fact neutral and NPOV, but I do not agree that the facts support him in such a belief. Despite his claims to uphold NPOV, I feel that Sam is one of the most consistent POV editors I have come into contact with. I have only dealt with him in regard to the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">Pantheism</a> article, but his POV approach there has been pronounced and consistent since day one. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENaturyl_7ae3.html" title="User:Naturyl">Nat</a> 17:23, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Sam pays lip service to the NPOV policy whilst aggressively pursuing a campaign of politically motivated edits and edit wars across a wide range of articles (<a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">Far right</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a>, the list goes on). His uncivil behaviour and inability to discuss topics on anything but his own terms makes discussion and compromise impossible and wastes people's time. It is a sad indictment of Wikipedia that he hasn't been banned yet, never mind giving him a position of responsibility and power on ArbCom. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 11:42, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am a little reluctant to endorse sannse, purely because I have such great respect for her work with the Mediation Committee that I almost hate to see her leave it, even for so important a task as arbitration. But ultimately I feel compelled to endorse her, as I believe sannse's experience in moderating disputes and working with users to try and bring them together on issues would make her a particularly wise and inventive arbitrator -- we're constantly looking for new ways of resolving issues and applying fair remedies on the AC, and I think sannse's background suits her ideally to contribute in that way (in addition to her generally excellent judgment and keen sense of fairness). <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 00:13, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Theresa has shown remarkable resilience and good humor in the face of some of this site's worst trolls. I have seen in her both the patience necessary to deal with arbitration (an endeavor greatly requiring that virtue) and the soundness of judgment necessary to carry out reasonable remedies. Finally, someone who has dealt with trolls of many types is, I think, excellently qualified to be an arbitrator, both because she understands the pressures good users are often placed under, and because she understands the importance of rising above trolls rather than engaging in their tactics -- I believe this would help her craft responses to cases that both recognize the straits good users find themselves in and push these good users to avoid bad behavior despite said straits. I wholeheartedly endorse her for this position. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 23:49, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly oppose.</b> Theresa Knott has proven to be utterly supercilious, consistently taking the part of the administration and dismissing the legitimate complaints of the hoi polloi. See, for example, her extensive discussion over the past few days in <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html#Purge_the_arbitration_committee" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">User talk:Jimbo Wales#Purge the arbitration committee</a>, where she snapped "Stop whinging" at me in response to a complaint that has received considerable popular support, then continued to accuse another user of "whinging". Although she did eventually apologise for this display of condescension, her partiality towards the administration <i>coûte que coûte</i> is precisely the opposite of what we need at a time when so many people are complaining—with justice—of an élite cabal. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 04:04, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>OK I'm not sure if it's a good idea to defend myself here. But what the hell I'm going to do it anyway. I do not dismiss legitimate complaints of the hoi polloi. I have spoken on many occasions to admins and other users if I feel they have behaved out of line to other users.

When it comes to it I will reverse other admins if I feel they have not acted within policy. I did not "snap" at you. I reminded you that the AC decision was a tempory measure designed to protect wikipedia, and that your calling for the AC to be purged was whinging. The "other user" that I accused of whinging was Xed, who was complaining yet again, that he had been temp blocked over his insistance on keep adding jimbo's email to secretlondon to the requests for arbitration page despite the fact that it had already been rejected by the arbitrators. He used this blocking to attack me, even though I wasn't the one who blocked him. He also said that i appealed to authority when in actual fact i had said that the AC should not have duristiction over private emails. This is something I still think btw. All this happen months ago, so yes i do think that Xed brinig it up again is whinging. I also want to correct the "eventually apologised" statement you made. You complained that i was being condescending, I apologised for that the moment I read your complaint. There was no "eventually" about as any who reads jimbo's talk page can see. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 14:38, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did protect the page to stop the edit war. I have no idea if the version I protected was POV or not as I have no knowledge or interest in the subject. I was merely trying to stop the edit war. The edit war is between multiple users all reverting each other like crazy, there are hundreds and hundreds of edits to that article, I wouldn't have the faintest idea which version to revert to. Also note that this is the first interaction i have ever had with cheese dreams. He did not bring his concerns to me on my talk page, or on the talk page of the article. His first action on seeing me do something he didn't like was to start a rfc on me and then make this edit here.

<li>CheeseDreams, this seems to be a misunderstanding about the protection policy. The admin protecting a page is not supposed to choose which version or decide which is POV. To do so would make the admin an involved party. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 12:40, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note the way other admins such as RickK revert to a version before an edit war before protecting - thus retaining the article, during the protection, in a state more agreeable to both sides than either of the edit war versions, or at least one which they don't object to continuing to exist for a while. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 23:29, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Reverting to a "stable version" is a somewhat controversial practice. I know RickK does it, but many other admins do not.

<li>Xed you are a funny guy.You have changed your mind yet again on me! However this time you have made a very serious alligation. I suggest you explain how I have managed to to do this "election fraud" when the election hasn't even started yet. I would also like you to explain why my saying I support blankfazes organisation of this endorsement page means I have perfomed election fraud, especially when you haven't even opposed blankfaze. (In fact you supported him - you are ware that he was the one to move the oppose remarks to a seperate page?)<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 15:35, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Supporters and opposers need to be able to see clearly the comments of all parties in relation to the potential candidate. Putting opposing comments on a separate page is virtually deleting those comments since not many will look at that page, because they either don't know it exists or because they can't be bothered to jump through so many hoops. There is no real sense in putting the opposing votes on a separate page, so the only real reason can be that some candidates don't want others to see them. This matches your general view that admins are beyond reproach and complaints against them are not to be acted on, or even listened to. As for supporting blankfaze, my support or otherwise is based on careful consideration of the candidates positive and negative aspects. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 16:06, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you are saying that because you disagree with the way blankfaze organised the pages and I said "OK I can live with that" about it then it's acceptable to accuse me of election fraud but not him? Xed you are trolling. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 16:16, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>You are making incendiary comments, Xed. If you provide no solid reasoning behind them beyond saying you conducted "careful consideration of the candidates positive and negative aspects", you are opening yourself to accusations of trolling. Your conduct of discussion is controversial enough to cause others to flame you, and that is the typical definition of trolling. Either explain why you have not accused blankfaze of election fraud (and why you accused Theresa of supporting it instead of merely saying she tolerates it, although that would still be quite unacceptable for most) or strike out your false accusations. <small>Note: For the conspiracy theory-inclined, this is not an order, merely my opinion.

<li>There's nothing <i>incendiary</i> about my remarks. How I come to my desisions as really up to me. Blankfaze may be guilty of election fraud, but he doesn't share the numerous deficits of character that I have already shown Theresa to have. Theresa, by her words and actions, believes admins to be some sort of infallible clergy. She's even trying to make me withdraw my criticism of her intolerance of criticism! In Grunts nomination above (unless it's been deleted..), she criticized my giving an explanation for my opposition <i>even though Grunt had asked for one</i>. Thus my opinion of her is overwhelmingly negative, whereas my opinion of blankfaze is more ambiguous. You aren't asking the first user in Theresa's list to justify himself <i>(Strongly endorse. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;Jones</a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a>)</i>.

<p>For the Arbitration Committee to play a constructive role in producing an encyclopedia, its members must understand just what is involved in writing a good article on Wikipedia; and its members must understand that there is a difference between serious editors and trolls sabotoging the work of serious editors. Too many of current members of the committee, along with a number of candidates currently running, view disputes from a prism up high from the IRC channel, mailing list, or the conflict resolution pages. They are not the colleagues of the active editors and writers but rather increasingly distant and unsympathetic authorities over us. However, to be an arbitrator as constructive and accessible as, say, Jwrosenzweig, one has to engage with the community not just from the top down but also from the bottom up. This is why I feel compelled to endorse the following candidates aside from myself in no particular order that have toiled the hardest to write quality articles and maintain their quality:</p>

<p><b>what blankfaze has to say:</b></p>
<p>I'd just like to say that I think most everyone running, save for a handful of obviously unqualified nogoodniks, is worthy and qualified and I wish all such candidates the best of luck. As such, I see no need or ability to endorse certain candidates moreso than others – with two exceptions. I was going to attempt to endorse one candidate who I felt was hands-down the best man running; but such could not be done. Both <b>David Gerard</b> and <b>Raul654</b> came to mind. Hence, I endorse both of them and would like to vouch that they are both men of honour, neutrality, and levelheadedness:</p>

<p>When Shorne insulted Stan, calling him an "idiot" and a "propagandist", (on 13 Oct 2004) 172 expressed his support for Shorne instead of disapproval for insulting other Wikipedians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. I suspect the reason is that Shorne and 172 have similar political orientations. I'd like arbitrators to condemn people who hurl insults, not to encourage them. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 18:02, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have endorsed a number of editors who I know and respect. I don't want to enumerate them here as I may have missed someone worthy by foolish oversight or because I simply don't know them well enough. I have confidence that the community will elect the most appropriate candidates.</p>
<p>Frankly, since I am running myself, I am not comfortable with endorsing others lest it seem a <i>quid pro quo</i> or a solicitation of the same. However, since the endorsements are being widely done, I would feel bad to have others think I didn't care enough the worthies assembled here to express an opinion. Having said that, let me reiterate that I do not mean to downgrade those I haven't endorsed, and I will refrain from making negative endorsements. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 06:44, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am <b>ambivalent</b> about Raul and so have chosen not to vote. On the one hand, he does usually seem to aim for consensus and try to work out problems. On the other hand, I see him as a bit didactic. While he usually tries to be civil, he sometimes makes comments that are a little objectionable. I just don't know about this one, so I'm abstaining.</p>

<p>From my interactions with these users (and those they have had with others that I had chance to observe) I have seen nothing but good, and I just have this nice feeling inside about them being arbitrators, considering their grasp of policy. This is not to say that I don't think other candidates are great; I just feel these would make the best arbitrators among all the candidates. Ta bu shi da yu, sannse, Neutrality and Mirv were pretty close, though, but I feel I haven't seen enough of them to be sure they'd make good arbitrators:</p>

Not only this he repeatedly fails to answer direct questions on his reasons for failing to accept these multiple, well sourced references and this is directly contrary to Wikipedia policy.

<p>In my opinion, an arbitor is just a wiki-job, like tagging images or greeting newcomers. Not everyone is well suited to every job. There are some great editors I did not endorse. My endorsees are easy to find above; they're the ones sporting the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Image%7EQuadell_seal_of_approval.PNG_85b8.html" title="Image:Quadell seal of approval.PNG"><b>Q</b>uaint<b>Q</b>uadell<b>Q</b>uality Seals of Approval</a>.</p>
<p>For an arbitor, the requirements for my endorsement are:</p>
<ol>
<li>to have proven they can admit when they're wrong.</li>
<li>to have shown restraint in situations where they could have made a snarky comments but didn't</li>
<li>to treat everyone – even trolls – with respect.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Not all users, or even all admins, should fill those requirements; I think some people are much more fun because they don't. But arbitors should not necessarily be fun people.)</p>

<p>In my "Letter from the Founder" I wrote: "The only way we can coordinate our efforts in an efficient manner to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves, is to love our work and to love each other, even when we disagree. Mutual respect and a reasonable approach to disagreement are essential, and both of those are helped along enormously when we feel favorably towards each other just as a natural result of being volunteers together on this incredible ridiculous crazy fun project to change the world.</p>
<p>None of us is perfect in these matters; such is the human condition. But each of us can try each day, in our editing, in our mailing list posts, in our irc chats, and in our private emails, to reach for a higher standard than the Internet usually encourages, a standard of rational benevolence and love."</p>
<p>This page is a magnet and incentive for a different approach, one which I most vigorously reject for our community. I encourage people to avoid the use of this page, and instead stick to positive endorsements of people who you think will represent our values thoughtfully and rationally. If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 16:53, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's disappointing that Jimbo appears to attack as a troll anyone who has an objection to someone being an Arbitrator. Those who seek to discipline and judge us should surely be beyond reproach themselves and have the full support of the Wikipedia community. It's important that those who seek to set themselves above the rest are open to full scrutiny. I therefore encourage sensible use of this page. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 01:06, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page allows users to voice their concern about the candidates. Some candidates may simply by force of personality in their statements "appear" to be neutral, open minded candidates to be elected, when in actual fact they are nothing of the sort. It is important to prevent such obfuscation. In a real world election, it is never a case of each side stating how nice they are, without also warning the electorate about the dangers of choosing wrongly.</p>

His Nazi Party secured the most seats in the Reichstag, but never a majority, Communists also holding a large position, but not as many as the Nazis. After several dissolved governments, Hindenburg <i>appointed</i> Hitler Chancellor in perhaps history's most disastrous attaempt at what we '60s flower children would have called "co-opting": more like making the schoolyard bully into the head hall monitor in order to bind him to "the system." Hitler paid obeisence to Hindenburg. Some Germans were charmed: "The Field Marshall and the Corporal." Wasn't that warm and fuzzy? Not too many warm and fuzzy moments after that. <i>After</i> Hitler was chancellor the Nazis got 44% of the votes in the Reichstag, and only formed a government by making a coalition with another rightest party. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 08:36, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Pages outside the article namespace are governed by different policies, and large-scale rewrites are not permitted without community consensus, usually gathered from polls. If you read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> carefully, you'll find it states several times that the policy applies to articles. The correct inference, then is that this does not apply to pages that are not articles. There is a reason why it does not say in the very first sentence (or anywhere else), "Wikipedia policy is that all pages should have a neutral point of view". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:21, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue we were discussing was the validity of NPOV policy outside the main namespace, not the validity of blanking this page. I express no opinion either way, but NPOV policy most emphatically does not apply to pages outside the article namespace. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:36, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>but the policy that DOES apply to pages outside of articles is that non-offensive comments cannot be removed just because it suits the POV of an editor <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 19:09, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>I strongly believe in the ethical free exchange of information and ideas, and was under the impression that such a free market was a wiki ideal. For any informed vote, access to all relevant candidate information, even that which is negative, is not a luxury, but a necessity. Indeed, how else are uninformed voters to learn of hypocritical candidates who claim a high level of dedication to the policies and ideals yet who repeatedly fail to <i>"reach for a higher standard than the Internet usually encourages, a standard of rational benevolence and love ...in their editing, in their mailing list posts, in their irc chats, and in their private emails"</i>?</p>
<p>If seating an Arbitration Committee by informed voters casting informed votes is a goal of this process, then the information found on the Disendorsements page is beyond useful, it is required reading.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:31, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I tried to add an "<b>Oppose</b>" (of "Neutrality") and comment to this page and I have found it's not on the page. I'd like to know why, from the election organisers please. I'd also like to let other users know that it seems to have been removed by "Neutrality" himself. I found this on the page history:</li>
</ul>
<p>"22:20, <b>3 Dec 2004 Neutrality</b> (rm trollish nonsense. Every person is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.) (cur) (last) 21:40, <b>3 Dec 2004 WikiUser</b> (Oppose - Best I can do in interests of The Wikipedia.)"</p>
<p>FROM: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements/Neutrality&amp;diff=8113462&amp;oldid=8095213" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements/Neutrality&amp;diff=8113462&amp;oldid=8095213" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements/Neutrality&amp;diff=8113462&amp;oldid=8095213</a></p>
<p>and it's also on his history, yet it's not on the history of THIS page.</p>
<p>I call upon all who are concerned about the fairness of these elections to help me find out what's going on. 1. Why am I not allowed to post oppose comments here? And yet others can: Rebroad and LegCircus for example, who both opposed "Neutrality" after I did. 2. Why can "Neutrality", apparently, delete criticisms of him on this election page? 3. What other dodgy deletions are being done here?</p>
<p><br />
We're told on the Community Portal: "Get involved- Review the candidates in the Arbitration Committee elections and vote before December 18." The top of this page says: "Sign under the name of the candidate or candidates you endorse/oppose. <b>Your reasoning is welcome</b> but not required." <b>Sjc</b> says: "Strong oppose.", and "Neutrality" says: "May I ask why?" But he deletes it when someone tries to tell him why.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 20:01, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The tradition of public "oppose" statements that elucidate the rationale for opposition comes from <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>, where candidates are chosen by consensus and an honest evaluation is a necessary, if sometimes troubling, part of the discussion process. The arbitration committee election, on the other hand, is a voting process rather than a consensus one. Accordingly, each vote is given equal weight regardless of its rationale, and the rationale for failing to support a candidate need not be shared.</p>
<p>On behalf of the election organizers, I would like draw special attention to the portion of our <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Organizers_statement_6c02.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Organizers statement">earlier statement</a> where we ask you to show your disapproval only with your vote itself. It is our hope that this may be a collegial election. Since nearly all candidates are long-time contributors to the wiki, we would hope that the process will unfold in such a way that even those who are not elected will retain their dignity and the respect of the community.</p>
<p>In reviewing the "disendorsements" already made, I observe that few comments are surprising. Instead, allegiances and prior conflicts that have already been hashed out in the community are being trotted out for another go. Other than by serving as a handy index by gathering this material in a single place, little is accomplished through these listings.</p>
<p>We discourage additional listings on this page and suggest that those who have already added material here may wish to remove it.</p>

<dd>I disagree on endorsements -- it's helpful to have reasons, both so the affected party can open a discussion with the endorser, in case it's an accident or based on a misunderstanding that can be cleared up, and so we can tell if a disendorsement by user X actually has good reason or not. Blank endorsements/disendorsements mean nothing to me. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 21:32, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
