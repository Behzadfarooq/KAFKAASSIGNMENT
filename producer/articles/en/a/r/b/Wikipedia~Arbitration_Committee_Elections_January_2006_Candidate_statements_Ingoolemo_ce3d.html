	    <p>For me, the most important of the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">five pillars</a> is the one that states that we are an encyclopaedia. More than any other idea or policy, this is the one that will serve as my guiding principle if I am elected to the committee. However, this maxim is hardly a simple litmus test that can be applied with ease in every case. For example, an abrasive editor, however excellent the articles they write, may cause a net negative effect on our quality by poisoning the atmosphere for other contributors; blindly enforcing the rulebook is a poor mode of operation, but at the same time, ignoring the rulebook too much erodes community support. All members of the Arbitration Committee must be aware of the ripple effect from any decision, or the committee will lose its effectiveness. To sort through all the possible ramifications of any ruling is a task that requires a thoughtful, reasonable, and humble&#160;;) person such as myself.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I seriously believe that a rate of 1 hour a day (30 hours a month) is sufficient for me to formulate effective opinions. I'm quite willing to put in the time, because of my love for Wikipedia and because I already spend 100 hours a month here anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>My standards of neutrality are extremely high. When I embark on a heavy session of editorial review, I scrutinise every adjective and noun to ensure that it leaves judgement to the reader. I can always criticise one party as well as I can another. A few months ago, I helped rein in an edit war at <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> between <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a>. Because of my willingness to suggest common ground, both warriors listened to me and eventually calmed down. When I was <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Ingoolemo_12d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ingoolemo">nominated for adminship</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> said that 'he stays cool, calm, but firm in his dealings with other editors, in overheated situations.' My experience as an editor and my penchant for meticulous analysis of all human problems I face will make me an excellent—and humble&#160;;)—Arbitrator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I first created an account on Wikipedia so I could upload an image; this account was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Maanandil" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Maanandil" rel="nofollow">Maanandil</a>.

As one can see, these two accounts have fewer than five edits between them; both were created in my first few months here.</dd>

<dt><i>Being an arbitrator requires a finely tuned bullshit detector. What in your life has prepared you to detect bullshit with ease?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Among those of us who don't spout bullshit, most are able to discern it. There is no such thing as a finely tuned bullshit detector, because things are either bullshit or not. Some people are better than others are at detecting bullshit, but only slightly. I don't think I have much more to offer than the other candidates, but neither do they have much to offer over me.</dd>

<dl>
<dt><i>Do you hold any strong political or religious opinions (e.g. concerning George Bush, Islam, or on which end you should break a boiled egg)? If so, would you recuse yourself from cases centred on these?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I do hold many strong opinions on a number of issues, but I like to think that I don't let my feelings cloud my reasoning. I will gladly recuse myself if I have reason to doubt my objectivity. Even so, I have strong faith in my judgement.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><i>So that we can be sure, will you tell us, roughly, what those issues are?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I'm afraid I must decline. This question is too closely akin to the political litmus tests that attempt to boil important civic decisions down single issues.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><i>Yes, that's right. Its a litmus test to see if you are capable of being neutral or not, and whether any judgements you make, if elected, stand up to scruitiny for neutrality</i></dt>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>How willing are you to contest the decisions of other arbitrators rather than just "go with the flow"?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I hate to dodge the question with such a simplistic answer, but a simple one is all that's needed in this case: If every other Arbitrator is wrong, than I will gladly oppose their decisions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Again, I'm sorry to give such a simplistic answer, but it really is all that's necessary: requests to re-address are such a broad category that it's impossible to judge their merit as a whole; rather, merit must be analysed on a case-by-case basis.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><i>The question concerns them all. I.e. do you view <b>all</b> such requests as being <b>automatically</b> without merit?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I think my answer above explained this adequately, but I'm willing to make it simpler: <b>No</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them. Do you support this decision? [if current arbitrator] Does your visible behaviour on recent cases reflect this decision?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I certainly support the decision. Though the Committee was certainly not set up to be a Holy Inquisition, it lacks an officially established prosecutorial branch, and thus must carry out some such activities itself—within the bounds of certain guidelines, of course. The Committee should only broaden its investigations to users who were <i>heavily involved</i> in <i>the particular dispute</i>, and it should only do so if the dispute is causing major collateral damage.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><i>What about a series of different, and unrelated, disputes involving the same editor and a different 2nd party for each dispute, but presented to the committee as if a single dispute. Here it would appear the one editor was more of an issue than the others, wheras this is infact an illusion caused by selective grouping. Would you still only consider the one editor, or consider both sides for each sub-dispute?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>If the defendant has been the main aggressor or offending party in all of those disputes, and their <i>actions</i> in that dispute have caused major disruptions, the Committee should choose to take a prosecutorial role. The prosecution of plaintiffs should be held to an even higher standard. Again, the Committee must take action when serious harm is being done, but it isn't a witch-hunt for nonconformists either.</dd>

<dl>
<dt><i>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system? Do you think that the spirit of cooperation in Wikipedia would survive such a change?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>The original communitarian structure was meant to govern the dedicated and well-meaning corps of editors that helped create Wikipedia, not to keep malevolent elements at bay. The problem is not necessarily that Wikipedia has become less orderly, but that the factions of disorderly users has become more prominent. We do not need a more centralised system to deal with this issue; maintaining order is a mean, not an end. Our foremost goal is to ensure a working environment in which editors can write in peace.<br />
Seen from this perspective, it is clear that our cooperative ideals can be maintained even as we labour to keep the trains running. We need only supplement the old system with a stronger police force, not supplant it with a more regimented authority structure.</dd>

<dt><i>Do you support the creation of a <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Code_of_Conduct_4d1b.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Code of Conduct">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Code of Conduct</a> as I have just now suggested at <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html#A_sincere_question" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">User talk:Jimbo Wales#A sincere question</a>?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I will certainly support such a policy <i>if</i> it creates new rules that help uphold the integrity of the Committee. <s>However, I do not consider this likely, because the Committee has so far had few issues with its conduct. As the proposal is written now, it adds nothing further to the Committee's integrity. In fact, it sounds suspicioulsy like a solution in search of a problem. Its 'No Personal Attacks' clause is redundant with our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Personal_Attacks_af31.html" title="Wikipedia:No Personal Attacks">Wikipedia:No Personal Attacks</a> policy, and its section on 'Recusals' and 'Favoritism' would only be necessary if Arbitrators were completely untrustworthy. Worst of all, though, is the 'Transparency' section, which sounds like an attempt to provide <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">wikilawyers</a> an opportunity to overrule cases on procedural grounds. Furthermore, with the exception of the 'No Personal Attacks' clause, all the proposed policies are procedural rules, not codes of conduct. In short: the first three sections are unnecessary, and the last one is downright dangerous.</s><br />
Addendum: despite my opposition to formalising the proposed code of conduct as policy, I will make my pledge to follow the rules outlined in all sections except for the one dealing with 'Transparency'. (Date of response: December 13.)
<dl>
<dd>I have reviewed the current version of the policy, and I believe that many of its points are well-thought and worth merging with <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">current Arbitration policy</a>.

<dt><i>How do you view the role (and relative importance) of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> in the process of building a factually accurate encyclopedia?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Rules about civility are designed to keep Wikipedia operating smoothly. Some will disagree, but I firmly maintain that incivility has never made a single positive contribution to Wikipedia's functionality. The Civility policy is extremely important because it reinforces the fact that Discussion pages are meant for a reasonable exchange of ideas, not for flame wars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>How do you view editors who are normally correct in article namespace, but who may be perceived as rude – including to longtime, popular editors and admins – on Talk pages and the like?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>If an editor chooses to be <i>mildly</i> rude, but submits excellent content, it is not worth wringing our hands over. However, when their incivility reaches the point where it poisons the atmosphere or interferes with the work of other editors, it becomes unacceptable.<br />
Personally, though, I expect all of Wikipedia's best editors, as well as its prominent and popular ones, to hold themselves to especially high standards of decency. This is especially true of those who old office, because I expect them to behave in a manner almost completely beyond reproach. They are the people who set the tone for how other users act, and they must not muck it up.<br />
Please note that this question, and the answer I submitted, reflect on my personal ideals about how editors should conduct themselves, and not on the policies I support.</dd>

<dt><i>Do you support <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_Bill_of_Rights_7c14.html" title="Wikipedia:User Bill of Rights">Wikipedia:User Bill of Rights</a>?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Wikipedia may not be a micronation, but neither is it a sweatshop. Just as in conventional encyclopaedias, contractual guarantees should allow editors to expect us to uphold certain rights. So in that sense I support the creation of a 'Bill of Rights', but not necesarily in the fashion you intended. Rather, it should be viewed as a contract that ensures a positive relationship between encyclopaedia and encyclopaedist.<br />
However, I believe that the whole body of Wikipedia policy can serve as a contract as easily as an official 'Bill of Rights' can. Consequently, I oppose ratifying the current 'User prerogatives' as official policy, because it would be redundant with other policies that are currently working satisfactorily. However, it could eventually be a useful help page with some revision.<br />
Addendum: the first prerogative—prohibiting discrimination—is worth further investigation as a policy of its own.</dd>

<dt><i>How much of your Wikipedia time do you plan to spend on ArbCom business?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>As noted above, I expect to spend up to an hour a day, or however long I need to keep up with the load. I cannot reasonably estimate the fraction of my time this will occupy, because my Wikipedia activity tends to be rather erratic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>If you were elected and had to spend most of your time in ArbCom delibations, which projects would you consider to be the most negatively affected by your absence?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I have done a fair amount of work to deal with unsources images and the Candidates for Speedy Deletion, so those will suffer slightly from my absence. However, the most impacted will be <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAir_76dc.html" title="WP:Air">WikiProject Aircraft</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>To what extent would those projects be affected?</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>In the case of the first two, my abscence will only mean a slight increase in the workload on other users. However, WikiProject Aircraft will receive a pretty big blow. I'm one of its most active editors, working both to upgrade and to standardise content. I also consider myself one of the Project's leaders. I hope I won't be forced away from it, but I know that I can do even more for Wikipedia on the Arbitration Committee.</dd>

In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:39, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
