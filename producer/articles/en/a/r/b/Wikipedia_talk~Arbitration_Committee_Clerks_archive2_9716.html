<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why a clerks' office doesn't cross the streams</span></h2>
<p>I posted this above:</p>
<p>The AC has used unofficial clerking before. This is establishing a bunch of people to do the job as more of a job, i.e. to make sense of crap. No-one on the AC objects who's been through the job of being an arbitrator, you'll see - it's more like "OH GOD YES PLEASE! HELP US WITH THIS CRAP!" and picking people they have a good idea will do a good job of it&#160;;-)</p>
<p>I wouldn't see a clerk as doing anything that anyone couldn't do on a /Workshop page; the difference would be that the AC is saying "Right, here's some crap needs handling. Please do it." Giving them opening/closing is also safe 'cos that's a mechanical task. (When it isn't, they're bright enough to ask.)</p>
<p>The AC has talked about having a function like this for a few months, and the proposed setup is basically least disturbance to the way things are and shouldn't lead to crossing the streams we think. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 23:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I <i>did</i> volunteer for that reason. My objection isn't to the idea of clerks, but to what I feel is insufficient community input into the process, and the selection of individuals who were specifically rejected by the voters. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 00:25, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The community has never had input into the internal deliberation procedures of the arbcom. The formation of an arbcom listserv and IRC channel were not run by the community. The decision to keep former arbitrators on said listserv was not run by the community. This is no different from either of those. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:30, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(After edit conflict.) You're drifting into <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a> territory at this point, because any way I can think of to interpret your remarks it comes out as an underhanded accusation. The voters never said that <i>anybody</i> wasn't qualified to help out the ArbCom, they only voted on who would be <i>on</i> the ArbCom; if some people thought they were doing something else, they were mistaken. So do you have specific users you think would make bad clerks, or do you just think there's a big ArbCom cabal oppressing you? Either way, you're missing the whole point of the job. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 00:32, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think that <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> are all far too controversial in the Wikipedia community to be involved with the Arbitration Committee in this capacity. I have no doubt that these individuals have been, and are, acting <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">in good faith</a> and doing what they thought was right, and I realize that many valuable Wikipedians - people whom I respect - support them. However, it is clear that a large number of other Wikipedians, perhaps a majority (see the Arbcom votes) have serious concerns about the judgment and discretion of these individuals. Why choose people so controversial when there are many others who don't generate this level of discord among the community? I don't see how this constitutes a personal attack, any more than an "oppose" vote in a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">request for adminship</a> or in the ArbCom elections constitutes a personal attack. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 01:38, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because you're arguing that the arbcom is compelled not to trust or listen to people on the basis of the community's tendencies. Such that the arbcom elections become not only an election to arbcom, but a negative election to the Wikipedia Leper Colony. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 15:54, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>No, I think he is arguing that people who have been rejected as arbiters should also be considered unsiutable as arbiters assistants. That seems quite reasonable and in accord with how a reasonable person might view things. A more thorny issue would be whether some form of positive affirmation is necessary before becoming an assistant arbiter. It does depend upon whether clerks would have a real input into the decision making process, but from all that has been written here, they can not be useful as described unless they do. The issue is not that an arbiter is entitled to ask anyone at all to help him (which I would judge he <i>is</i> entitled to do), but that this person is given an official position and status. That is the tricky bit. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 01:06, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, they wouldn't be assistant arbitrators, more just like court clerks which entirely falls within the arbcom's power to appoint themselves without outside approval... Unless Jimbo or the board where to intervene and veto it. It is also true (to a certain extent) that the arbcom derives it's power from Jimbo and the board not from the community even though they rely on community support to implement any decisions they make and Jimbo at least this far has allowed community involvement in the arbcom selection process. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 01:15, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Arbcom is there because it has to be there, jimbo has no choice but to delegate.</i> - Things are like they are because they have to be that way? No, sorry, I think not. Jimbo delegated to the arbcom because he was overworked (and for the benefit of those who were not around prior to the arbcom - Jimbo intervened in VERY FEW cases - fewer than a half-dozen per year). Now, two years later, with almost 100-fold more users, and FAR more cases -- we're saying we are overworked. Somehow, I think we (the ones actually doing the work) are in a far better position to judge how necessary this is than you are. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:54, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no doubt that Arbcom is overworked. One need only look at the current case load to see that.

<dd>Yes we would care if they chose MSK as a clerk but we'd have no recourse since as mentioned before it's entirely up to the head clerk and the arbcom to decide who the clerks are.

<dd>I don't see what's wrong with the second statement -- if the arbitrators really feel MSK could be of service to them as a clerk, they could appoint her. As for the third statement, there are clearly going to be elections in the foreseeable future where we can vote out arbitrators whose performance has been less than satisfactory (obviously by not voting for them, or voting oppose if we still use the RfA style system). And as for the fourth system, it's correct that technically arbitrators aren't elected, but rather appointed by Jimbo. However, clearly the recent non-binding referendum/plebiscite/whatever has a major impact on his decision, seeing as the top eight candidates were all appointed to the arbcom. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:49, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sure they could've seen that reaction, but since most of it is based on unfounded assumptions about what clerkship entails, I don't think they have any special reason to react in other way other than by demonstrating that they are right. I mean, there was actually someone up there who didn't realize that clerk briefs are going to be submitted publicly. And so far I've yet to see any of the objectors acknowledge that if they wanted they could prepare such briefs themselves. Nobody realizes that this is just all about shoveling manure.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is an arbitrator's position in all but name</span></h2>
<p>Assuming good faith is really great, but let's be frank: We're supposed to think it's a <i>coincidence</i> that this position is created right after Kelly gets the arse, and the the first person to get the job (and beavering right away, thank you very much) is Kelly? It's a crock of shit and it stinks, and no amount of calling it powerful fertiliser is going to change that.</p>
<p>There are <i>eight</i> pages in any ArbCom, if someone wants to help "reviewing and summarizing evidence" then let them do it there, as opposed to on the eyes-only Arbitration Committee mailing list. And I'm confused as to why a bureaucratic system like this is good here, but bad in other places? Finally, it's all good to say "chosen by the ArbCom" but I notice that all the discussion has taken place off-wiki. What possible reason could there be for something as suppossedly straightforward as this being done in this way?</p>

<dd>(1) This was under discussion - both on the wiki and in the arbcom mailing list - for months prior to the election. (2) Karynn got the job for the rather simple reason that was the only ex-arbitrator willing to do it (the rest all went running and screaming). (3) People have been doing this unofficially previously, and there is nothing here to stop people from continuing to do it unofficially. The Clerks office is simply an attempt to make them more common and more organized. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 23:37, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok, remove access to the mailing list. This is the smelliest bit. While it's often said that the ArbCom needs a place to hold talks in private, there hasn't been any compelling argument presented as to why this needs to be expanded to the clerk. If their job is simply to distill the crap into digestable chunks, that is.</li>
<li>Create a "clerk's page" on which changes by anyone other than the clerk are reverted. Thus all the "reviewing and summarizing" is out in the open. What possible reason could we have for <i>not</i> letting everyone see the pre-digested chunks?</li>
<li>Remove the opening/closing powers, as well allowing edits to arbcom pages. These don't appear to be that burdensome based upon the actual numbers of edits required, and lends <i>way</i> too much of an air of cabalism.</li>
<li>Better yet, <i>chuck the whole thing</i>. I look up the page and see quite a few names of people who say they want to job. If these guys are <i>already</i> willing to roll up their sleeves, then simply ask them to do it and get to the workshop pages. Barring that, why is this required? We don't seem to have a "chair of cleanup" and that's a hell of a lot more of a pressing need than this.</li>
<li>Finally, all this "fingers in ears" talk is pretty shithouse. The ArbCom is judge, jury, and executionor rolled into one, and every time you make a statement like "we will because we can" you give more ammo the the "OMG cabal" crew. Wise up, at least <i>act</i> like you're responsive to the concerns of normal users.</li>

Or, we could just accept that the matter was discussed by the past ArbCom, the present Committee agrees that clerks would probably be useful and have raised no objection to them, and that using this page to sling mud at Kelly Martin and the others is really objectionable behaviour.</p>
<p>Try letting the clerks do their jobs for a couple of months. See what happens. There will be lots of time after that to raise a stink if they hurt the process, and I suspect that they will be a great deal of help.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Abuse of powers already</span></h2>
<p>Some have cautioned doubters to "wait and see". Kelly Martin has already shown her abuse of powers. In my case, the motion to close had been waiting for <b>six days</b> to close. It had the requisite number of votes. Rather than close the case, she just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FXed_2%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=36585593&amp;oldid=35846450" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FXed_2%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=36585593&amp;oldid=35846450" rel="nofollow">added a hash symbol</a>. Why is this relevant? Because previously in the case, she had voted to ban me for a year. And that proposal had not passed, so she chose not to close the case.

<dd>OK, I'll address both the point you were trying to make (that Kelly abused her powers) and the point you actually did make (that anytime something arbcom related occurs, all kinds of people come out of the woodwork with idiotic comments). In reply to the former: your comments are utterly without merit; go away.

<dd><small>(<i>inserted after edit conflict with Ryan and Fred</i>)</small></dd>
<dd>A few brief observations:
<ol>
<li>Mindspillage's vote was striken on January 19: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Xed_2/Proposed_decision&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35846450" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Xed_2/Proposed_decision&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35846450" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This took the motion to close to a bare pass (four support with one abstention.)</li>
<li>Kelly Martin became chair of the clerks on January 25: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Clerks&amp;diff=36654554&amp;oldid=36654317" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Clerks&amp;diff=36654554&amp;oldid=36654317" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>Kelly Martin fixed the formatting of the case on January 26: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration%2FXed_2%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=36585593&amp;oldid=35846450" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration%2FXed_2%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=36585593&amp;oldid=35846450" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Technically she <i>could</i> have closed the case, but may have been concerned about how to count the abstention or wanted to do the formatting first before getting into page closings.</li>
<li>Fred Bauder withdrew <i>his</i> approval for the motion to close less than an hour later: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Xed_2/Proposed_decision&amp;diff=36591064&amp;oldid=36585593" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Xed_2/Proposed_decision&amp;diff=36591064&amp;oldid=36585593" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. This brought the net votes to close to 2 (3 support minus 1 oppose), and indicated that a close by Kelly Martin would have been premature anyway—the ArbCom saw the need for further discussion.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In other words, Kelly Martin should be strung up for <i>failing to thwart the will of the ArbCom, because she failed to slavishly and instantaneously follow the letter of the case closure rule on her first full day as a clerk</i>...? How dare she. I note that in the absence of a clerk, the outcome of this series of events would have been exactly the same, with the sole exception that the formatting of the vote numbers would still be broken.</dd>

<dd>While true, that entirely misses the point: that Kelly hasn't biased the process. The only (non-cosmetic) edit to the case after she became clerk was by Fred Bauder, withdrawing his vote to close. The case would have stayed open in the absence of a clerk. It stayed open with a clerk, and now is slightly better-formatted. If you want to complain about the ArbCom taking too long to close cases, go ahead. I just don't see how Kelly Martin abused her powers by <i>not</i> altering the outcome of your case.</dd>
<dd>For all we know, Kelly might have sent an email to the arbitrators saying, "I'm going to close this case; does anyone have anything to add?" (Heck, doing so might even be a good idea as a general practice.) The text on the page says "<i>24 hours from the first motion is normally the fastest a case will close.</i>", not that a case with four support votes must be closed at exactly 24 hours. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are only 3 votes to close the case. Closing a case requires 4. We are still considering whether a one year ban of you is justified. You are not helping your case with this nonsense.

<li>Xed, I was going to say that this is bordering on the ridiculous, but it is in fact well into the zone of ridiculosity and no longer even bordering on the sane. If we had a BJAODN for ArbCom cases, then "adding a hash constitutes abuse of power" would fall right below "per nuclear law, this case must be deferred to the US supreme court". I'm somewhat tempted to go through your edit logs to see if you have added a hash mark (or even worse, an exclamation point) some time in your wikicareer, and if so to block you by your own logic for that abuse of power. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 02:13, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(After triple edit conflict, your guess is as good as mine as to where this goes in the thread.) By the looks of it, it had <i>five</i> votes for a couple of weeks before that. If you're going to assume bad faith here (and I certainly don't for a moment suggest you do), I don't see on what basis you'd conclude this was <i>Kelly'</i>s bad faith for failing to close it, when it now had fewer. Indeed I'd suggest it'd have looked odder if she had. And all this assumes some particular closing procedure comes into play, even when most of the arbiters haven't yet voted, when so far as I know there is not, and it really is their own business when to do so. If you think the failure to close any time after Jan. 3 was inappropriate, or requires explanation, you should surely take it up with the arbcom as a whole, and not single any individual out for what looks to most people to be an entirely innocent (in)action. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:20, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What happened here is that on my regular inspection of cases with motions to close, I noted that there was a formatting error that made the count look inappropriate and corrected it. I then added it to my notes as a case which was closable, meaning that I would send out a notice to the ArbCom that the case would close in 24 hours if nobody objected. (Under the ground rules that I'm working under, I am supposed to give the ArbCom 24 hours notice of opens or closes.) Before I could get around to sending that notice (since I generate a worklist before actually doing any work, and I do opens before closes), Fred Bauder, an Arbitrator, elected to strike his vote to close, making the case ineligible to be closed. It is not my place to question why Fred chose to strike his votes. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 02:16, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though to be fair to Xed(?), the accusation seems to be that the conflict of interest was in fixing the formatting(!?), when supposed you shouldn't have edited the page, and in <i>not</i> closing the case... without editing the page(??)? I think this is so far away from having a reasonable basis as to defy further chess notation on my part, but Xed seems to be so annoyed now, doubtless not helped by earlier baiting from a certain emergent double act, that I'm not sure what more can be done to prevail upon him to drop this. But I'll suggest for one last time dropping it anyway, and then retire from the field. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:37, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the problem here stems from the fact that Xed was under the impression that Kelly was obligated to close the case, and that not closing it constituted an abuse of power. Unfortunately for Xed, he could not be more wrong, and he's now realized it after dozens of people have commented to that effect. Now, in an effort to cover his own mistake of posting his specious complaint here, he is trying to concoct some conflit of interest complaint. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:30, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
