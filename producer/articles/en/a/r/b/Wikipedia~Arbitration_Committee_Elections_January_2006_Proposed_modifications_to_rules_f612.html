<p>This page is to outline proposed modifications to the rules for electing Arbitrators in the December 2005 and later elections. If you have further proposals, please add them at the end.</p>
<p>The December 2004 elections were noted for their rancour and a large number of clearly unsuitable candidates that contributed to it. At the same time 2005 has seen the Arbitrators workload increase greatly, with a high drop-out rate of Arbitrators unwilling to dedicate an ever-greater proportion of their time to a greater number of ever-more complex disputes.</p>
<p>These proposals, each of which is a stand-alone proposal, are aimed at reducing these problems. It is assumed that voting this year will be from 4 to 18 December, as it was for last year.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Proposed_modifications_to_rules_f612.html" title="Edit section: Proposal 1: Must be an admin to run for ArbCom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposal 1: Must be an admin to run for ArbCom</span></h2>
<p><i><b>To nominate yourself for the Arbitration Committee, you must be an admin. Repeatedly nominating yourself when you are not an admin will result in your account being blocked until the election is over.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Rationale</i></p>
<p>It is unlikely that the community would be willing to accept someone as an Arbitrator who they would not be willing to accept as an admin, and this would eliminate clearly inappropriate candidates at a stroke. By publicising this new rule well in advance, it would give time for good potential candidates who are not currently admins to apply for adminship before the election starts. The second sentence is to prevent trolling - it is not intended to apply to someone inadvertently breaking the rule (who would have their nomination removed and an appropriate note put on their talk page).</p>

<ul>
<li>The last election was bedevilled by a number of inappropriate "candidates". This proposal would stop those candidates, whilst still allowing all genuine contenders to stand, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 08:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have mixed reactions to this proposed rule. The temperament required to be an admin and the temperament required to be an arbitrator are quite different. An admin must act quickly, such as by blocking, and so must have a sense of timing as to when a situation is urgent and when it is not. An arbitrator should act with reflection and deliberation. In fact, a good arbitrator may sometimes not be a good admin, and vice versa. If the real problem was that people nominated themselves who had not earned the trust of the Wikipedia community, I would suggest that one alternative would be to eliminate self-nomination completely, and to require all candidates to be nominated by someone else. This would in itself eliminate trolling. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 16:26, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I support the rule change but I would delete the blocking. Simply declare that only admins may be candidates for arbitrator and that nomination of a non-admin is null and void. Requiring nomination by another user invites sock-puppetry and is somewhat arbitrary; I would prefer to keep self-nomination. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 16:31, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do we need a specific blocking provision for this? I would have thought that <i>repeated</i> renomination of an ineligible candidate would fall under the 'disruption' clause of the existing blocking policy. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 22:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Is there already a policy whereby those deliberately disrupting the election process can be summarily blocked (for a reasonable period of time)? The "blocking" sentence was only added in to put it beyond doubt - it'll never apply to anyone not deliberately disrupting the election, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 03:46, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What about requiring that a candidate's nomination be seconded by another editor with <i>x</i> number of votes at the time of the seconding, with <i>y%</i> of those votes having occurred prior to the candidate's nomination? This would allow non-admins to run, but allow for fewer frivolous candidates. Or maybe even require a thirding, as well? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 22:42, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am opposed to the proposal as-is. How about instead, treating both non-admin and admin prospective candidates equally. Make a process similar to <i>requests for adminship</i>, but call it <i>requests for candidacy</i>. So that the community has a chance to reach a consensus before the actual election, which is just the same as always. This would also help mitigate some of the objections to proposal 4 <b>expanding the number of positions</b>, namely, the possibility of there being unsuitable candidates and more positions which must be filled than candidates: since all candidates have already been determined to be suitable (by virtue of being candidates, that issue is gone). --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 23:34, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The problem with this is that it would elongate the election process (and still effectively allow anybody, regardless of their "good intentions" to run. By using a pre-existing pre-approval process, we obviate this. Maybe an alteration to allow all admins (who have, of course, already been through an earlier vetting procedure) can stand, and all non-admins who don't want to apply for adminship can apply through a similar process to be allowed to stand - but which will not make them an admin if they pass that process? Note that so far no non-admin has served or been elected as an Arbitrator, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 03:46, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have no problems with this, and I would also expect clearly bad-faith nominations (e.g. nominating a user that has 10 edits) to be summarily removed. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:06, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I oppose this. It's unnecessary. Let innapropriate candidates run and fail. This looks cabalistic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 16:01, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oppose, as per Theresa knott. Inappropriate/troll candidacies should be removed. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian">(t)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Merovingian_5415.html" title="Special:Contributions/Merovingian">(c)</a> 16:58, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>How would you decide whether a candidate is inappropriate or a troll? The last election was bedevilled by them, and all they did was make the whole process a lot more acrimonious. This is an attempt to define candidates that will clearly fail and to eliminate them immediately from the process. If you have a better way of doing this, what is it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I can't imagain someone who could get elected to arbcom not being able to make it as an admin. If they had some reason that they didn't want to be an admin then they could ask for thier admin powers to be removed after the election.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 00:03, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think instead of making only admins eligible, why not set the eligibility based on certain number of edits, as it is already done for a number of elections. For the Arbcom elections we can set the bar fairly high like 1000 or more article space edits. This should prevent most of the problems of inappropriate candidates. The people who disregard the rule would simply have their nomination voided. No need to ban anybody for this. I think it is not really neccessary to make people go through the admin process before nominating themselves for arbcom. people should be free to nominate themselves if they wish and meet the criteria. <a href="../../../k/a/a/User%7EKaal_8f50.html" title="User:Kaal">kaal</a> 05:54, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also oppose this rule per Theresa and Mero. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 14:02, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I also oppose this modification to the rules, for one thing it's overreaching and it stops many potentially good nominations as well as bad ones, second it seems to be to just be more uneccessary rule creep. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 18:04, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Are you saying there is a realistic possibility that WP would accept someone as an Arbitrator whom it wouldn't also accept as an admin? I certainly agree with Raul that I can't see this ever happening (it certainly hasn't happened or come close to happening so far). There are many good editors who for various reasons have not wished to stand for adminship to date. My guess is that these are not people who are likely to want to become an arbitrator anyway - but if they did, they'd have little problem becoming admins first. Without some restrictions to candidacy, the 2005 will be as plagued by disruptive candidates with no chance of success, in much the same way as the 2004 election was, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 07:45, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I became an arbiter before becoming an admin, as did several others. While there was a problem with meritless nominations last time, this is a poor way to solve it. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 22:49, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I oppose as well, the cabal should be a joke... not a reality... <b><a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch"><font color="#89CF19">Sasquatch</font></a></b><span style="background-color:#C1FF5F"><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">c</a></span> 23:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I was under the impression that adminship was not supposed be a big deal, and that it consisted entirely of a handful of tools intended for maintenance. This proposal would seem to fly in the face of that. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 08:29, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think restricting it to administrators is a good idea. There is a problem looking for a solution, but I don't think this is the solution needed. Perhaps requiring all candidates to have been wikipedians for x amount of time (6 months?) or to be an administrator would be better, as I personally think anyone who has only joined recently would be very unlikely to be elected. However if they are already trusted to be an administrator then imho they are extremely unlikely to be an inappropriate candidate. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 20:39, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak oppose</b> - This seems like a good idea because the issue of inappropriate candidates cluttering up the system is not good and can be a problem.

<li><b>Very Strong Oppose</b>. In fact, the opposite should be true: Arbs should be an absolutely independent party in any conflict, and since many an Admin has already had some involvement, either direct (as one of the opposing parties in a conflict) or indirect (as an enforcer of rules and guidelines on a conflict-in-the-making), in a conflict prior to it being put up for arbitration, they are not independent. Furthermore, since Admins a more often than not one of the parties in a conflict, asking a Arb/Admin for arbitration is like asking a wolf to arbitrate in the conflict between foxes and chickens. Arbitrators should not be allowed to be Admins! Any Admin privileges should be relinquished when being appointed to the Arb Committee. <a href="../../../m/h/a/User%7EMhaesen_c50b.html" title="User:Mhaesen">Mhaesen</a> 13:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I support this change. I'm a great believer in 'the right electoral system for the right election'. Here, the result should be the candidates the most people are content with. It is not the aim of the ArbCom elections to produce a committee with a balance of opinions, which is the explicit aim of proportional voting systems, so I would rule out STV. We also do not want cliques, so all arbitrators should run in one pool. I would however suggest that voters be compelled to use all their votes rather than be allowed to plump for one or two of their 'friends'. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 16:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Surely that does not apply here. No-one can be sure who will win, and the candidates are running as individuals rather than as party nominees. In any case tactical voting isn't "manipulation" - it's part of the system.

<li>I don't have to justify a claim I didn't make. As far as 'manipulation' goes, giving a voting preference to your preferred candidate in order to make their election more likely is a manipulation of the electoral system. It just happens to be an expected one. Surely the key question in all of this is: Who do we want elected? Do we want a spread of opinion so that every small clique can get their own pet arbitrator, or do we want a group of qualified and trusted arbitrators in whom the Wikipedia community has expressed confidence? If it's the former, then use a list system or STV. If it's the latter, we should use FPTP. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 22:35, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FPTP is most difficult to manipulate (in a non-party system) as it is so widely understood and follows the principle that everyone has an equal say in the matter. The only thing you can do to elect the candidates you want elected is to vote for them - so you have to vote positively. And every vote is equal. A positive voting system (rather than the negative one we currently use) may help get rid of some of the rancour of the 2004 election. Remember that tactical voting happens with every voting system, it's just less manipulative with FPTP - other systems are biased towards (1) those that understand them; (2) those that are particularly organised, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 03:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Plurality-at-large (a more accurate term for this approach) is a terrible choice because it eliminates minority view representation. If a small majority (e.g. 51%) votes in a consistent way, then that half of the electorare will elect 100% of the committee. The other 49% gets no representation at all. The simplest approach that solves this problem is just to give everyone one vote in stead of X votes. This will at least tend toward proportionality. The technical name for that is <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_non-transferable_vote.html" title="Single non-transferable vote">single non-transferable vote</a>. A slightly more complicated, better approach would be <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumulative_voting.html" title="Cumulative voting">cumulative voting</a>, which allows voters to vote X times, but they may stack multiple votes on a single candidate.

<li>That's not really true. If there are eight candidates each with a different view, then in effect you have eight parties, with one candidate each. That is a frequent situation in party elections. it may still be that one candidate is esposusing a minority view which nonetheless appeals to say 25% of the voters. Under this proposal he would have no chance and no representation for their views. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 20:50, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose.</b> The problem with <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plurality_electoral_system.html" title="Plurality electoral system">First Past the Post</a> is that it tends to polarize the electorate.

<li><b>Oppose.</b> The statement <i>the only thing you can do to help your candidate win is to vote for him/her!</i> is always true in almost every method.

The claim <i>Although the current method is called "approval voting", it is in effect a negative vote - you select which candidates you cannot stomach and vote for everyone else.</i> seems to be nothing but a "glass is half-empty" perspective.

<li><b>Oppose.</b> FPTP suffers from the terrible problem of vote splitting. A bad candidate can be selected if there is a bloc of voters that agrees on that candidate, even if the vast majority of voters dislike that candidate. An example of this is Scott Savol in the American Idol contest, who hung on even though most voters thought he was terrible. Vote splitting has also been an issue in recent presidential elections. Remember Ralph Nader? The value of approval is that it doesn't force you to choose between, say, Gore and Nader. andrew_myers 15 Aug 2005</li>
<li><b>Oppose.</b> This is the wrong remedy for the problem. If the problem is irrelevant candidates polluting the ballot, then propose a change to the nomination process. Switching the voting system to FPTP simply lowers the amount of information you collect from voters, and will increase the likelihood of tactical voting. Approval is easy for voters, is easy to tabulate, and provides more information than FPTP. Please keep it. James P. Cooper 15 Aug 2005</li>

<p>The approval-at-large system currently used to elect the Wikipedia Arbitration committee is not a good system. The proposed change to plurality-at-large (FPTP) would replace this with a worse one. The membership of Arbitration committee should reflect the full range of opinion amongst Wikipedia users not just the opinions of a majority or a plurality. The most appropriate method to use to elect the committee would be a candidate based system of proportional representation such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV). This would ensure that all shades of opinion are represented on the committee.</p>

<li>That is precisely what we don't want on the Arbcom. The effect will be the LaRouchites and the Scientologists (etc) organising to make sure they get their own arbitrator to swing cases their way. In my opinion the electoral system should make sure that all candidates with 'shades of opinion' should be kept off the committee. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 17:46, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don’t see the problem. The rules state that:</p>
<p>“Each part will be subject to a simple-majority vote amongst active non-recused Arbitrators - the list of active members being that listed on Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee.”</p>
<p>If the Scientologists get one member on the committee then that member cannot block a decision.</p>
<p>The rules also state:</p>
<p>“If an Arbitrator believes they have a conflict of interest in a case, they shall recuse themselves immediately from participation in the case. Users who believe Arbitrators have a conflict of interest should post an appropriate statement during the Arbitration process.”</p>
<p>So an arbitrator who was also a Scientologist would not be able to participate in a ruling on something like <a href="../../../o/t/_/OT_III_05f1.html" title="OT III">OT III</a> or <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenu.html" title="Xenu">Xenu</a>.</p>

<p>"Single transferable vote" is a method of selecting someone who is disliked the least. "Approval voting" is a more straightforward method of selecting people or are disliked the least. The difference being that under STV you order people in the way you dislike them, whereas in approval voting you just vote like/dislike. Let's just keep things simple (complicated just ends up confusing people or pissing them off and probably won't make much difference in the result anyway).</p>
<p>Incidentally, the reason why I propose FPTP is because it is the most straightforward positive method of voting. At present we have the most straightforward negative method of voting. The straightforwardness I completely agree with - it's just the positive/negative thing, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>STV isn't a method with anything like the characteristics you ascribe to it; it's not in any significant respect similar to approval voting, and your characterisation of it as a "negative" voting method seems to be entirely ad hoc. (Anything that isn't plurality-based?)</dd>
<dd>You're certainly playing "simplicity" to the hilt, but I don't think it stands up. For it to be a pressing argument, either the electorate must be too "unsophisticated" to successfully cast preference-style votes of any kind in a manner consistent with their desired outcome (but are on the other hand, capable of voting "tactically" in a plurality election in a way that does so); or the "officials" choosing and/or running the system are so incompetent or corrupt that a result inconsistent with those preferences can somehow be conjured (as per your accusations regarding Condorcet criterion). Both sound pretty far-fetched to me. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:23, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Entire nations "muddle through somehow" with STV and other preference-voting options; several are deliberately "backwards compatible" with single votes cast plurality-election-wise. Not only is wikipedia is a self-selecting electorate, votes "mis-cast" can be corrected while the election remains open. Just how many likely voters, in such circumstances, do you think a procedure like "rank your favoured candidates in order of preference" is likely to "disenfranchise"? This really does sound increasingly like the IBM sales pitch. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:52, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment: One of the criticisms of last year's vote was that the top winner got only a slim majority of approval, and many electees had less than 50% support. By limiting people to 8 votes, wouldn't this be exacerbating the problem? (Remember the "I'm with the 58% that didn't vote for Clinton" bumper stickers of 1997? We don't want that with the Arbcom.) – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 18:32, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another comment: I think the reason so few candidates got a majority of approval last year was that many voters were voting "yes" for the few people they knew they liked, and "no" for the rest. I.e., the <i>problem</i> was that it was a positive vote, not a negative one. If they had voted <i>negatively</i>, only voting no for the bad apples, the election would have gone much more smoothly. If we limit people to 8 votes, the same problem will come up -- many voter will only care about one or two candidates -- but it will prevent people from voting for all candidates they like (if they like more than eight). If we force people to vote for 8 (not less), then in practice many people will vote randomly for the rest. And adding randomization as a factor to the voting is probably a bad thing. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 18:32, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Good idea. As sometimes it may be the case that elections to a six month term and 18 month term happen simultaneously, I would say explicitly that the top vote-getter can chose which term they take (which is probably implicit). <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 16:39, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's standard practice, yes. As for having elections, well, in our experience they've been horrendously divisive, nasty experiences that end up being popularity contests (which is not any way to select a group of people who are meant to be trusted by all – or at the very least, as many as possible – of Wikipedians).

<li>It would be useful to codify which method we use. I'm tempted to suggest putting this proposal up against a direct alternative stating explicitly that Jimbo may fill casual vacancies, which would be filled on a permanent basis at the next annual election, and seeing which of the two commands greater community support. Personally I'd prefer to eliminate Jimbo from the procedure - solely because WP is now at such a stage that as far as possible WP should position itself so that it can operate normally without him.

<p>I'm not sure this is strictly about the election, but this seems like as good a place as any for this idea.</p>
<p>Designate alternates, as, say the top three candidates who are not elected. That is, if the top seven are elected, candidates eight through 10 by vote count would become alternates. If any member of the arbitration committee resigns, the alternate would fill in until the next election.</p>

<li>This one kind of depends on what happens with Proposal 4. If we have a pool of 24 arbiters (as suggested in P4) then having the committee reduced by three or four (or even six or seven) over the course of the year isn't going to be a disaster.

<li>I think this proposal could be a good idea even if we have an enlarged ArbCom. All candidates that receive at least X% of the vote could be eligible as an alternate. When the first ArbCom member resigns, the first alternate would be the top candidate (in terms of votes) who wasn't elected. As additional members resign, move down the list of alternates in descending order of votes. All alternates would have their term end after the next election (unless they were re-elected). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:17, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I would prefer this solution to premature vacancies, over a system that puts one person in charge of selecting replacements. I do think that more than one election annually is undesirable. Depending on what type of voting system is used, though, alternates should have to meet some minimal threshhold of number of votes received compared with the number of voters in order to be eligible to serve as replacement arbitrators. For instance, if approval voting is used, you might specify that any candidates who received affirmative votes from at least 30 percent of voters, but were not elected because other candidates received even more votes, would be retained on the list of alternates. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamawrites_ede8.html" title="User:Mamawrites">Mamawrites</a></li>
<li>You might end up in the invidious position that someone duly elected as one of the winning candidates would not have qualified to be put on the reserve list.

<p><i><b>Expand the number of arbitrators to about 30. The ArbCom will be divided into three subcommittees, or "circuits", of about nine users each. Each circuit will hear cases individually, usually in a rotating order based on when they are filed. To prevent playing one circuit off another, no circuit may interfere with the operations of another circuit. To allow for the inevitably greater workload as Wikipedia continues to grow, more arbitrators and more circuits may be added at every election. There will also be a three-member "Grand Jury", so to speak, which will determine which cases are accepted, assign them to circuits and resolve any "jurisdictional" disputes about which circuit will or will not hear cases. The Grand Jury cannot hear cases, stop cases in progress or otherwise direct a circuit to act or rule in a particular way.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Rationale</i> A proposal like this will help lighten the load of complex, time-consuming cases like <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Climate_change_dispute_69a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Climate change dispute">/Climate change dispute</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Trey_Stone_and_Davenbelle_8ab3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Trey Stone and Davenbelle">/Trey Stone and Davenbelle</a>, which bog down the entire ArbCom and prevent it from handling other cases. If a single circuit gets tied up in one case, the other circuits will be free to handle other cases as they come along. Unlike Proposal 4, arbitrators can hear more than one case at a time, with a caseload divided more or less equally among the entire Committee. One problem I can anticipate is that if a lot of arbitrators leave a particular circuit, its operations will essentially stop. This won't be so much of a problem if Proposals 3 and/or 6 pass. Another possible concern is that 30 seems like a lot of arbitrators. However, Wikipedia has expanded a lot since the last election and there are probably enough good candidates to fill all slots should such a proposal pass.</p>

<li>What is it about proposal 4 that would preclude having the ArbComm hear more than one case at a time? I understand that if the committee is expanded to 24 arbitrators, then more than 2 cases would not be possible simultaneously, but theoretically, 2 cases of 9 arbitrators each should be possible. If the committee is expanded to 30, 3 cases would be possible simultaneously, without implementing the proposal for circuits. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamawrites_ede8.html" title="User:Mamawrites">Mamawrites</a>

<li>I was under the impression Proposal 4 wouldn't allow a single <i>arbitrator</i> to hear more than one case. I could be wrong, though. However, Proposal 4, like 7, would allow the ArbCom as a whole to hear more cases. I think the advantage of 7 is that it would allow for <i>more</i> cases to be heard because the workload could be broken down between circuits as needed. If one circuit is extremely busy with a complex case involving multiple users, like <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Climate_change_dispute_69a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Climate change dispute">/Climate change dispute</a>, another circuit could take two or three smaller cases. <font color="green"><a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">sɪzlæk</span></font></a> [ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a> ]</font> 03:40, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is a possiblilty. But unfortunately, things like that happen with any judicial system with more than one deliberating body. Assuming the community continues to select arbitrators who respect community norms and consensus, the circuits will likely respect each others' precedents.

<li><b>Absolutely object in the strongest possible terms</b> This would be an absolute disaster. This method has only led to bitter arguments in Wikipedia in the past and is completely contrary to the way WP works - and it only appears to have been used in practice when politicians wish to achieve a result chosen beforehand. It is also extremely complicated (remember - some people even get first past the post, the simplest of all systems wrong - this one I can't even understand with a first-class maths degree!). It gives extreme undue weight to those voters who understand it (who are usually the same people that promote this method. Voting on WP can get bitter as it is. However, if we ever saw this method get adopted widespread in WP, it would make the past problems seem like a love-in, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 15:37, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly Oppose</b>. I agree with Jguk. We need a voting method that's simple and can be understood by the vast majority of voters.

<li><b>Support method, object to overall proposal</b> - I strongly support Condorcet methods for elections, and strongly encourage the Wikipedia community to get educated on their use. Arguments against Condorcet methods are often luddite in nature; Condorcet methods are complicated, but only as complicated as they need to be. Fairness is more important than complication, and Condorcet methods are much fairer than other methods. However, given that there's no support for any Condorcet method in the MediaWiki software, I think it's too soon to suggest its use for a Wikimedia election. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobLa_2262.html" title="User:RobLa">RobLa</a> 22:08, August 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Complicated" always means that the votes of those that understand the voting method are much, much more valuable than those that don't - and "complicated" also means that very few understand them (and it tends to be those that understand them that argue for them). I'm willing to be outvoted if the vote is fair - but I do strongly believe that every person's vote should carry equal weight. In practice condorcet voting is entirely anathema to that, and that, coupled with the divisiveness I've already seen when some people have tried to implement such methods on WP so far, mean that I object to this in the strongest possible terms, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 22:26, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Beware of words like "always" in arguments. Voting strategy in Condorcet is simple: rank all candidates based on your sincere preferences. This <i>almost</i> always works, so much so that with the right set of rules in place, the risk of a weird outcome is negligible. Election methods geeks like myself <a href="http://electorama.com/em" class="external text" title="http://electorama.com/em" rel="nofollow">like to argue</a> about those weird cases where it's not a good strategy, and what systems mitigate the strategic problems in the best way, but those cases are really rare.

<li>I have a first-class maths degree from Oxford, and whilst I admit I have never sat down for a few hours to work through the algebra, I really have no idea how best to vote on a condorcet method if I wish my preferred outcome to happen. If I cannot understand it, I'm fairly sure that most others cannot understand it - all I can understand is that those who promote such a method tend to end up celebrating their victory once the vote has closed.

<p>Like RobLa, I support Condorcet methods in general (especially <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_set.html" title="Smith set">Smith-efficient</a> methods), but I am not especially enthusiastic about this proposal. Condorcet methods are IMO the best systems when the goal is majority rule, but that is not the goal here. I find Jguk's objections to Condorcet to be quite weak.

<li>This potentially could lead to there being no elections in a given Decemeber if nobody wants to step-down then. I would support an addition along the lines of "One third of the seats will be up for election every december, if fewer than one third of the arbitrators wish to step down at the time of the elections, the seats held by the longest serving X abritrators will make up the balance (where X is the difference between the number of arbitrators stepping down and the number of seats to be contested). The X arbitrators may be re-elected, but may not serve longer than three years in total.". Yes this is very complicated, and it can probably be simplified, but I don't think it leaves any gaps. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 20:51, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although it's certainly true that people leaving to early is a problem, I don't see how this proposal would help with that; unlike mid-term burnouts, after all, anyone who faces the end of a term limit is going to immediately be either replaced or reelected. If anything, it seems to me that having people standing for election more often and constantly cycling the people in the ArbCom serves to <i>reduce</i> burnout. Possibly, if we wanted to fix the 'midterm burnout' problem, we could have a system where the X people who came in just below the pole in the election can be automatically moved in to replace ArbCom members as they resign midterm (serving out the rest of their terms), or temporarily tapped in by ArbCom members who need to take a break for one reason or another. Of course, there are could be a host of other problems inherent in that, but it might be worth considering. This would avoid both the difficulties of the midterm election proposal above, and the complexities having extra 'midterm-resigned' seats up for election that are referred to in this proposal. Last election we had several people who came in just a few percentage points short of getting an ArbCom seat... It's a shame to let seats stay empty until the next election and to leave the ArbCom understaffed if those people are still there and willing to serve. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:24, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i><b>All arbcom terms will become two years or until resignation, whichever comes first.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Rationale</i> Much like the three year proposal, only with more frequent elections.

<li><b>Oppose</b>, 3 is too small usually, too easily percieved to be swayed or random, to have enough credibility for the usual final court of appeal in wikipedia. Otherwise, the idea of a smaller panel with a rubber stamp "comments" by the rest of the committee (rather than plain agree/disagree which can seem to be a rubber stamp) is a good one. The small number suggested and users perception of the ability of a 3 member panel to be comprehensive and fair, is my main reservation and its a big one. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> 16:40, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>, (partly). Unless there are absolutely not enough candidates, it seems to me an advantage to have a larger pool of arbitrators from whom a sub-set can make a decision. This avoids difficulties when some are lost. So my objection is to the maximum panel size, not the minimum team. I would support a unanimous decision being required of a 3 person panel (otherwise it would be a wholly unclear result), but am not yet convinced it would even so be sufficiently definite. It might then require a process of appeal to the whole panel, but if that were agreeable then fine. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 09:29, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>When a case is voted for acceptance, committee members also state their feeling whether it should be heard by 5, 7 or 9 arbitrators. Most likely based upon complexity or significance. (An optional extra would be that (as <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a> suggests), after the case, any other arbcom members may comment, thus allowing further feedback; I think thats a good idea)</i></p>
<p><b>Rationale</b> Since the number of AC members on a case should not affect its neutrality or ability to make a decision, this should be a less controversial judgement, especially in conjunction with the "taxi rank" idea. It means simpler cases don't clog up the system, whilst due weight can be given to other more significant matters, whilst preserving NPOV. It also means that the majority of cases could be decided by a smaller but still credible panel, whilst more significant cases are less in need of appeal or review, since they already have a large panel in place hence more certainty of a considered opinion. Last, and not insiginifcantly, it keeps flexibility in the hands of arbitrators, whilst not overly complicating the system. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> 16:59, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Any sub-comittee needs to be appointed by an automatic process (i.e. next 7 on a list of those available), to avoid problems of possible bias selecting members. What is the question of commenting after the event? This would only apply if the remaining members disagreed with the decision, thereby undermining it. Sounds as though this needs an appeal process, at least if the arbitrators on the case are split in their decision? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 09:45, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i><b>Elections should be open to all Wikipedians, irrespective of their length of service or number of edits</b></i></p>
<p><i>Rationale</i> First of all, the current rule of ca. 3 months and 150 edits is actually contrary to the principles of good management: it does not have a rationale (why restrict voters in the first place) and the numbers are completely arbitrary, excluding potential voters with good faith. Second, anyone could be faced with an arbitration, also people who have just joined. These Wikipedians should also have a say in who is on the Arbitration Committee.</p>
<p><i>Alternative</i> Only registered users are allowed to vote</p>
