<p>Wikipedia is growing fast, and its response has been to secrete a shell of bureaucracy as sclerotic as any state. Too many rules, too many feet to tread on. Too many new editors scared away.</p>
<p>Arbitration is intrinsically slow and unscaleable. Administrators are individuals working in loose cooperation, which does scale.</p>
<p>Too many cases are reaching arbitration. We should be careful about the cases we accept, and give administrators more technological power by working with developers to share ideas for more tools to help them. Alternatives to blocking, more flexible IP and username blocking arrangements, more watchlists for administrators, subscribable watchlists, edit throttles for edit warriors, per-page blocking. Spending time and effort on this will be worth our while as a committee because it will reduce our caseload by empowering and strengthening Wikipedia's immune system.</p>
<p>Abusive treatment of newcomers starves the community of new blood and unnecessarily expands the class of disaffected trolls and vandals. Edit warring and biting by administrators and other experienced editors should be taken seriously because it drives people away. I want to focus on this. The administrators should take the bulk of the load, but the Committee should act as a check on the administrators.</p>
<p>The Arbitration Committee has a resource of previous cases and decisions, and what ensued from those decisions, that amount to the wisdom of some of the best wikipedians. The Committee, augmented by interested former members, should from time to time make non-binding recommendations to the community for policy clarifications or changes, with the aim of stimulating Wikipedia's immune system and reducing arbitration caseload.</p>

<p>In the case of the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_M._Wolters_cf41.html" title="Albert M. Wolters">Albert M. Wolters</a> article the application of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a> was straightforward. The article was caught in the usual stalement on <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">Votes for undeletion</a>, but a glance at the deleted article and the deletion debate was enough to convince me that, if undeleted, the chance of the article being deleted in an <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for deletion</a> rerun was minuscule. Because the controversial nature of IAR would draw more editors to the second deletion debate, I concluded that consensual support for the keeping of the article was guaranteed and that the wider consensus that would be gained would be in the interests of the community. Accordingly I ignored all rules to give it the chance of another run. I was right. The article got an overwhelming keep vote, a potential copyright problem was quickly fixed, and so the article remains.</p>
<p>I see absolutely no potential conflict between this and my candidate statement. Editors should always be free to innovate in the interests of the encyclopedia, subject to consensus.</p>
<p>In my opinion, checkuser access <i>must</i> only ever be given to qualified information technology specialists who are trusted by the development team, subject to the agreement of the Foundation. A vote of confirmation of such an appointment may be carried out if desired, but checkuser access must never be available solely because someone has enough votes. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:37, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_compass.html" title="Political compass">Political compass</a> I always rate something like -8.5, -7.5, extreme left libertarian. I would not recuse myself on political grounds because I don't judge people by their beliefs (I've believed some pretty unusual things in the course of my 49 years and it never stopped me being a decent human being).</p>
<p>I think my history as an editor demonstrates adequately that I don't go with the flow.</p>
<p>All requests for redress must be considered on their merits.</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware it's always been the case that all parties to Wikipedia arbitration are subject to rulings--moreover, there may be rulings on individuals not party to a case. I fully support this. I have always deliberately joined myself to arbitration cases in which I comment. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:49, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system? Do you think that the spirit of cooperation in Wikipedia would survive such a change? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 16:05, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion it is impossible for Wikipedia to become more orderly, or more centralized, even if I believed this to be desirable. It's far too vast and the resources are far too limited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The spirit of cooperation depends on the goodwill of individual editors being communicated through example. So far it seems to have survived, though I think the behavior of some experienced editors, particularly administrators, damages it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:55, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: 49. I'm a software developer.</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: Roughly fifty hours per month. It's going to eat into my editing time.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: I had around 7,000 edits, about half in main namespace, when I was made administrator in early March. I also happen to think that knowledge of policy and dispute resolution is important, and I've done everything from mediating disputes to bringing a case to arbitration.</p>
<p><i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>

<dd>Wikipedia is a wiki and a community. It has fairly tight rules and they should be enforced. Civility is very important; it's a major part of one current arbitration case in which I am involved.

<p>I like the workshops because they may be useful to arbitrators. Some aspects of arbitration must be opaque, sadly.</p>
<p>Arbitrators as subject to arbitration decisions must be treated as all editors. Sadly I fear this has not alwsays beem the case, particularly with regard to edit warring, which must always be condemned.</p>
<p>Criticism of arbitration decisions, per se, is absolutely not a violation of the assumption of good faith.</p>
<p>I would obviously recuse from a case in which I was personally involved.</p>
<p>Arbitration committee cases are not subject to formal reviewe, but they can be vetoed by Jimbo Wales.</p>
<p>Having said that, consensus is pretty powerful. I myself successfully initiated events that led to the overturning of one arbitration committee decision, so it's possible.

<p><i>(Being asked of all candidates)</i></p>
<p><i>Do you believe that regardless of Jimbo Wales' own views on the matter, the community should be able to strip arbitrators of their position under certain circumstances, and if so, what circumstances?</i></p>
<p><i>As a corollory:Do you believe, regardless of Jimbo Wales' view on the matter, that a large number of signatories (e.g. 150 requesting censure against 50 supporting the arbitrator) to an RFC against an arbitrator is enough that the arbitrator should be judged as having been rejected by the community in light of their actions, and consequently for them to be forcibly stripped of their post?</i></p>

<p>I absolutely and unconditionally oppose the view that editors individually or as a group have any right to depose an arbitrator. That is the role of the Board and Jimbo Wales.</p>
<p>I tend towards the view that the community's involvement in choosing arbitrators is almost always bad. They should probably all be appointed.</p>
<p>The NPOV question is a good one. I honestly don't think I've ever edited an article on which I have a strong opinion. It would seem rather unsporting.

I'm sure that the board is quite capable of deciding what to do all by itself. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:55, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you opposed to transparency? —<a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026"><i>James S.</i></a> 18:36, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would recuse when I felt myself unable to make a fair judgement in a case. I am adamantly opposed to transparency in the arbitration deliberation process. Arbitrators must be absolutely free from any taint of outside influence. The community must not attempt to influence the conduct of arbitrators. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:04, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How would you deal with irrational administrators? Especially when a bunch of them gang up on ordinary mortals. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShivraj_Singh_2774.html" title="User:Shivraj Singh">Shivraj Singh</a> 09:53, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an administrator I find it frustrating to see other administrators engage in actions that hurt the encyclopedia and drive off new users or, worse, convert their enthusiasm into annoyance, edit warring and trolling. My concerns on this can be seen in the Mel Etitis RfC and the Maoririder arbitration case, and to a certain extent in the Pigsonthewing case (although that case was somewhat symmetrical). Although one doesn't need an admin bit to play the asshole and drive people away, abuse of the admin bit should in some cases result in its removal.</dd>

<dd>On arbitration procedure, I was the editor who originated the motion to remit the Stevertigo RFA, which was ordered as part of an arbitration case in which the artbitrators could not reach agreement to deop him, back to the arbitration committee with a message: "We won't do your dirty work, we expect you to take the discussion to deop this person." This was a calculated move on my part to establish that arbcom has the power to do this. It succeeded beyond my wildest expectations. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:03, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
