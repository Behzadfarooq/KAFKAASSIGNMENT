<p><i>This photo is widely used on the internet, so I don't think there is any copyright issues. Besides, I do believe these pictures are in the public domain now.</i></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for your response. In order for Wikipedia to cover itself, all images have to have some type of copyright tag. If you believe it is {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairuse_cee7.html" title="Template:Fairuse">fairuse</a>}}, then please place the appropriate <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">copyright tag</a> on the image. You can do this either when you upload it or by using the edit tab later. It is mostly to cover Wiki, and all images that do not have tags, have a chance at being deleted. Also, if you wish to sign your comments, you may do so by using ~~~~, this way we can see who left the message and when. If you have any more questions, feel free to contact me. Thanks again. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#FF0033">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 06:38, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>As for the signatures, please do understand that my computer's performance is sub-par right now.</i></p>
<p>Thats very understandable, I don't personally mind, its just a bit easier to see who left the message, w/o checking history.

<p>I noticed that you made a recent addition to the article on Evan Mecham claiming that he was responsible for Arizona's loss of a Super Bowl and giving an estimate to the total economic impact of his time as Governor at over $500 million<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evan_Mecham&amp;curid=582070&amp;diff=33630531&amp;oldid=32462103" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evan_Mecham&amp;curid=582070&amp;diff=33630531&amp;oldid=32462103" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Do you have any sources for this information? I have searched for similar information in the past and was unable to find any (my sources indicate rumors of the Super Bowl being moved due to the lack of a MLK Day, not due to Mecham directly, and I have not found any estimates as to total economic impact just lost conventions). As the rest of the information in the article is fairly well sourced I would like to know were this information came from to maintain the same level of verifiability through the entire article. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 21:41, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You do not have to tell me what a wonder job Mecham did in office. I grew up in Tucson, and signed one of the recall petitions during my time as an undergraduate at the UofA.

<dd>I just noticed you're working on your user page and it's starting to come together nicely. If you need any help with graphics and layout, you can go around Wikipedia, find something you like, and use it (if you source who you took it from!). You can take anything you like from my page if you see what you like, though. Remember, if you have any questions, if you would like to become more involved, or if you simply would like to know how to warn vandals (for example), just leave me a message on my talk page! <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 08:29, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an area I'm pretty familiar with. Usually, the best way to catch vandalism is by just patrolling the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a> page which is accessable from the navigation menu. Although everyone is capable of vandalizing Wikipedia, 99% of it comes from users that are not logged in (the IP address guys) or users with red links for their user pages and talk pages (indicating that they have just joined up and don't know the rules yet. When patrolling recent changes (See: <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">Recent Changes Patrol</a>), really the only thing you can do is monitor edits made by those types of users because there are simply too many changes made to Wikipedia to monitor every one of them. While you are getting used to counter-vandalism, you might want to limit your recent changes search to only IP users (anons, as they are often called) by adding "/hideliu" (liu stands for <b>l</b>ogged <b>i</b>n <b>u</b>sers) to the recent changes URL like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Recentchanges/hideliu" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Recentchanges/hideliu" rel="nofollow">this</a>. You can click on those pages, click "history," see the changes made by the anon's edit/edits, and if you feel they are <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">actually vandalism</a> (and it is important to tell the difference between vandalism, good-faith (but messed-up) edits, POV edits, or things that are disputed on the talk page), you can click on the link to the article with the last good-faith edits. The line you are looking to click on will look like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(cur) (last) 03:23, January 6, 2006 24.80.118.62 (→History)</dd>

<dd>(cur) (last) 03:35, January 5, 2006 24.6.218.157 (→Sport)</dd>
<dd>(cur) (last) <b>17:12, January 4, 2006</b> Elephantus (rv random number changes)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This was taken from an actual page I reverted yesterday titled <a href="../../../s/p/l/Split.html" title="Split">Split</a> (which happens to be some city, apparently). I have bolded the area you want to click on when you notice that not only were 24.80.118.62's edits bad, but also 24.6.218.157's. However, if 24.6.218.157's edits were good, you should only revert back to his most recent edit. Anyway, just click on the part of the history page that I bolded, which will take you back to what that page looked like during that edit, click "edit this page" <b>inside that page</b>, scroll down to the edit summary where you can type in anything from "reverted anon edits" or "rvv" or, what I always do, "Revert to Elephantus," check it off as a minor edit, and save the page. Then when you look in the history of the page, you will see this line added to the top, except with your user name:
<dl>
<dd>(cur) (last) 03:24, January 6, 2006 JHMM13 m (Revert to Elephantus)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then, if you want to verify that you really did revert back to Elephantus (there is no reason to do this, I'm just showing you how), if you check his edit with the left radio button (those little circle check boxes in the history page) and your edit (the top one) with the right radio button, then hit the big button that says "Compare selected versions," you'll be taken to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Split&amp;diff=34088706&amp;oldid=33893814" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Split&amp;diff=34088706&amp;oldid=33893814" rel="nofollow">this page</a> where you can see that the versions are exactly the same. Once you've reverted the vandalism, then you can start warning the actual vandal, but for the time being, I have to run out to play some hockey. In the meantime, if you feel like you need to warn a vandal, please do your best to be very, very, very kind in correspondence with our policy on <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">not biting the newcomers</a>. In fact, right now, all you should copy onto a vandal's talk page if you see one is exactly this text: {{subst:test1}} ~~~~. I'll come back later on today to explain that and all the other templates you can use for vandalism.

<p>Hello, Arbiteroftruth. It seems that I am a little bit too skeptical and too sensitive about the discrimination against mainland Chinese. I am sorry if my wording has offended you. I agree with your point that Commonwealth spelling should be used for British figures. But it seems that the characters in the drama are all from non-Cantonese speaking region.

<p>I am very sure his last name is "Ngo" - a lot of people like to propagate their middle names within their family, I do not see how this implies that their last name is their "surname" + "middle" name. For example, George Bush (43) is George Walker Bush and his father (41) is George Herbert Walker Bush. I don't think we can infer that because people propagate their middle names that the surname then becomes "Ngo Dinh". The fact that the chinese wikipedia uses this, I feel does not mean that it is correct - although the article is about an extremely prominent politician, none of it is sourced and it is basically all speculation. All of the males on my mother's side of the family have the format "SURNAME MIDDLENAME" with the same middle name, and they call themselves the "PHI" family, and this is the case for all purposes, official and unofficial, even in Anglophonic format "MIDDLENAME SURNAME" .<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 01:14, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Perhaps you should make a note that his ancestors like to preserve their middle names to separate their "Ngo" family, but I think that he is still definitely a "Ngo". My mother's family however, do not justify that the preservation of the middle name is due to any "separateness", it's just a hereditary thing.

<p>Thanks for removing the extremist comments on the page. I have been trying to get it removed only for it to be added again. If you've any ideas for helping manage people who insist on putting extremist comments do let me know!

<li>I do not think that edits by <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangFeihung_c66c.html" title="User:WangFeihung">User:WangFeihung</a>/<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangFeiHung_8efe.html" title="User:WangFeiHung">User:WangFeiHung</a> amounts to a vandalism (or even simple vandalism). It just a highly POV edits that could be annoying. I do not know much about the Hong Kong history, but I believe the government of it was indeed unelected democratically and I guess Anson Chan indeed did not fight against this undemocratic rules. Is it possible to enter something like:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>On the other hand some political analysts</i> (who?) <i>note that Anson Chan did not fight against the British control of the Hong Kong nor against the non-democratic methods of forming its government. Thus, according to her opponents, she belongs to the Pro-Colonial, Pro-British crowd.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>If it is unacceptable you probably should go to some sort of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> process. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 05:08, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand it is perfectly well that Hong Kong was a paradise comparing with the PRC and obviously AC did not the luxury to fight London and Beijing simultaneously. I also understand that WangFeihung is producing the far-left edits. On the other hand the leftists are people too and state their opinion ( as an attributed opinion not as a fact) might be OK. I do not know how common are WangFeihung-like opinions. If they are as common as the Flat Earth, they should not be mentioned. In this case we need a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> or something. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 05:35, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand your feelings and indeed share them, but I can not just consider WeiFenghung's edits as vandalism without RfC or something showing that there his edits are against the consensus. Alternatively you could just revert him now and then (it does not seem he is inserting his edits very often). If you would find another admin who would agree to handle his edits as vandalism, it is fine with me. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 05:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Usually the requirement is to have at least 2-3 thousands edits overall. You only have a half of that. The low edit count is a problem that tend to disappear by itself in a few months. Maybe it is worth to do some Recent Change and New Article patrols, check categories, etc. A good admin is supposed to be interested not only in it is own but in the other people's articles as well. Always remember not only revert vandalism and unhelpful edits, but warn the vandals and discuss the peoblems with the other editors. You have very low count of edits in Wikipedia space, many people see it as a low involvement into the procedural part of wiki - try to be more active with AfD and other *fD. Village pump and policies discussions, etc. Otherwise you seems to be a "good admin material". Good luck. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 07:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I'm so sorry to learn of your problems: I hate any attempts to manipulate and distort the truth to serve particular political ends. However, I can offer no direct help in the particular matter you raise, which is beyond my area of expertise. I have no administrative powers myself, but I have alerted some other people who have. I wish you the very best of luck. <a href="../../../r/c/p/User%7ERcpaterson_27d2.html" title="User:Rcpaterson">Rcpaterson</a> 23:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
