	    <p>For the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_ratification_vote_b5a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy ratification vote">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy ratification vote</a> there were several hundred admins and many other eligible voters. With the one week timeline, just 28 people heard about it and voted before the polls were originally to close. If I didn't assume good will I'd assume that this short timeline repeat performance is trying to be a farce rather than a serious vote. This is a wiki. It's online. People often don't even visit once a week. It takes time for people to learn about these things to know that they can stand and more time to learn that the vote is open and vote. One week is grossly inadequate for either stage. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 23:46, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both I and Cam, as well as quite a few others from IRC, seem to think that a more sensible timing would be 2 weeks for votes, starting on the 31st (so standings in by the 30th). Thoughts?</dd>

<dd>If we're going to be using the exisiting software (and, really, we should, if for no other reason than that it's already there and so we won't be further delayed), it's approval-voting, so 80% support isn't something so easily calculated and also it isn't designed for...</dd>
<dd>What about a hard limit of a maximum of 6 (to balance with the 6 currently active members), and the first 6 who get more than 75% of the particpant voters' approval?</dd>

<dd>Assuming that we're electing two new arbitrators, how about promoting the two candidates who receive the largest number of "yes" votes? Going by percentages seems a bit unfair, especially to users who've been around for a while and work on naturally contentious subjects. For example, would we want someone who received 20 yes votes and 10 no votes not to be promoted while someone who received 5 yes votes but no votes in opposition to be promoted? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 22:49, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The way the software works, you can only vote yes for a person or not vote yes for a person, so the base is the same for all. What happens when none of the candidates receive the needed percentage? So far all of them look unacceptable to me. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 10:28, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On an unrelated matter, I assume that it would be... impolitic for current ArbComm members to make any public representations for or against any one user standing to be a member, lest this be seen as an annointment / cabal-like action?<br />

<p>A suggestion I made on the arbitration mailing list was to have a relatively large pool of arbitrators (lets say 30, but the exact number isn't important - it could just be as many as get x% approval) from which we draw smaller panels (of, say, five) to deal with one case each. This will make the workload of each individual arbitrator <i>much</i> more managable and allow <i>all</i> of them to <i>properly</i> look at the case they're dealing with (there are also, of course, reasons to oppose such a system). This would be quite a serious change in the format of the arbitration committee, though, so ought not to be rushed through. If we're looking to have a fairly quick vote, I think it would be best to just try and fill the two places that have been vacated. I know two people doesn't sound like much, but I do think it would make a difference. We can continue to discuss other ways of organising things and, hopefully, have some alternative method in time for the December elections.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I wouldn't be too concerned if we had two weeks each for nominations and voting, but I hope things won't be dragged out longer than that: these elections are a kind of emergency measure to fill gaps left in the committee by people leaving; they need to happen quite soon if they're to have any meaning. The seats will in any case be up for re-election in December, which isn't very far away.</p>
<p>I won't be voting or making any comments on the candidates myself, by the way. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dd>These sorts of changes would be a significant re-working of the policy, so perhaps we should discuss this <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_policy_b4cd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration policy">there</a>?</dd>
<dd>Expediting this would be a Good Thing, though, I agree.</dd>

<li>how many new Arbitrators do we need?

<li>At least 2, plus any others who get at least 75% of the votes, up to a maximum of 6?</li>

</li>
<li>what percentage of votes does someone need to become an Arbitrator?

<p>For who can vote, I propose anyone who has at least 10 edits to the article space as of July 15, 2004 and is not under a hard ban.

<dd>10 edits? Isn't that rather... low? We had a limit of 500 for the last vote. What about 100 edits, 1 month here?</dd>
<dd>As for who can stand perhaps 500 edits, 3 months here?</dd>
<dd>Also, would newly-elected non-sysop Arbitrators be made sysops, too? When we were initially created, all but one of our member were sysops. Perhaps this would be a bad thing?</dd>

<p>In my opinion the only purpose of qualifications for voting is to weed out sockpuppets. If someone managed to make a number of sockpuppets 10 days ago and posted with them 10 times without getting caught, in anticipation of some upcoming vote, well, I just don't think that's going to happen. I see no reason why arbitrators need to be sysops. In fact, it's perhaps better if they're not active as sysops while arbitrators. For running, I'd suggest no qualifications at all. Let the voters decide if the person meets their standards. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 15:52, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why would you assume that the only reason for voter qualifications is to weed out sock-puppets? The arbitration committee is a part of the internal functioning of Wikipedia. It is reasonable to expect someone to participate in the project for a substantial amount of time before we allow them to have a say in who sits on the committee. A new user is unlikely to even know what the arbitration committee is unless they've been causing problems. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 22:38, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<p>It's not my assumption of what is, it's my opinion of what should be. I see no reason for any qualification other than to weed out sockpuppetry. Arbitration affects everyone, so the arbitrators should be chosen by everyone. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 10:25, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It would be easiest to require users to have been registered for at least 3 months. The Boardvote software wouldn't need changing then. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:55, Jul 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Should we elect some reserve arbitrators to fill temporarily vacated seats due to people going on hiatus or having temporary outages? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:28, Jul 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest the two getting the most votes go on the permanent committee. Anyone else getting at least 75% of the votes (up to a maximum of 4 perhaps) are kept for the reserve committee to fill in when people are missing). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 18:46, Jul 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another idea would be to have people voting separately for who they want on the permanent and reserve committees. This allows people to express a preference for their favourite two by voting them into the permanent position, but still approve of any others they wouldn't mind holding the reserve posts. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 18:50, Jul 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is <i>anybody</i> going to get 75% approval? I calculated percentages for the board election once, and as I recall only one candidate actually received support from even 50% of the people who voted. I would suggest we keep the election simple - the two candidates with the most votes get the two open positions.</p>
<p>A reserve committee sounds nice in theory, but given the legalism people so often apply to the arbitration process, it likely would require some overly complex procedure to determine when a reserve arbitrator would fill in for a permanent arbitrator. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:07, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be fairly simple - those members of the arbcom who are listed on the arbitration committee page would be temporarily replaced by reserve arbitrators. Maybe we could also later put into place some policy whereby reservists vote on all cases under a "Reserve" section, and if, after some pre-determined period, not everyone has voted on a case, the reserve votes are counted until the full committee size has been voted. But that would be something that would have to be added to the policy later, I think. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 20:23, Jul 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does this mean they will be getting a new term, or will they be filling the term they are replacing? Apparently there are staggered terms? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 20:03, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see, so "permanent committee" just means they are able to actually vote on issues.

<p>I think having hot-spare Arbitators is a bad idea; it adds to the bureaucracy, and diminishes their interest. People should be either Arbitrators or not, not some half-way comprimise. If people do well, they are likely to do so for the next elections (which will be for 3 years, AIUI, instead of 6 months) in just 5 months' time. How about having a hard maximum of 4 new Arbitrators, and a hard miniumum of 50% of all voters' votes (75% is apparently too high)? Also, a RON option would be good...<br />

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_July_2004_6100.html" title="Edit section: Timeline issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Timeline issues</span></h2>
<p>People have raised concerns about providing enough time for candidates to sign up and for people to study the issues and vote. At the same time, we need to get the election done quickly so the new arbitrators can start work. Right now, no dates have actually been set, and I think that needs to be agreed on quickly.</p>
<p>Suggestions above range from one week to two weeks, both for the candidate registration period and the election itself. I would say that it's pretty clear that Jimbo's idea on the mailing list of 2-3 days won't fly. But unlike the board election, this one doesn't require a translation process or Foundation-wide publicity. So about ten days seems like it should be adequate. That would let us complete the process by the middle of August, which is about as long as I think we can afford to drag this out.</p>
<p>So, my specific suggestion is as follows - since Jimbo endorsed the proposed election late on Friday, July 23, use midnight UTC that evening as the starting point. The rest of the timeline could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Candidate registration closes at midnight UTC on Monday, August 2 (10 days from start)</li>
<li>Election opens on Wednesday, August 4 (everybody seems to like having one day where the candidate pool is set before the election actually starts)</li>
<li>Election closes at midnight UTC on Friday, August 13 (10 days from when it opens)</li>
<li>As soon as possible thereafter, election results are published and new arbitrators join the committee</li>
</ul>
<p>Any objections to this timeline? If not, I plan to put this on the page soon, so we have something concrete to work with. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:11, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I support. If anything, I think it's too slow - what's the point in electing people in August just to re-elect them in December? Do it ASAP. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 18:14, Jul 27, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hopefully both the people who think it's too slow and those who think it's too fast can accept that this is a reasonable compromise. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:21, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How about: close it July 31st (end-of-July Jimbo hoped for), freeze candidate page and revert any changes to it, election starts August 2nd, closes August 8th, results and new AC menbers start asap thereafter? 7 days seems quite enough - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 20:53, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's like herding frogs...</p>
<p>Why don't we just do something, anything, to get some more people on the arbitration committee, accept that it's not going to make everyone happy, and get on with it so that we've at least helped the problem along instead of debated it at great length? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:00, Jul 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>We can deal with not making everyone happy, but in order for the committee to enjoy the respect and support of the community, we also need to avoid making people too unhappy. Some people have serious concerns with a too-short timeframe, because the idea of an election is to let everyone vote, rather than figuring that the survey taken from a smaller sample is representative enough. But yes, obviously people want to do something, which is why I tried to move things forward by making a concrete proposal.</p>
<p>I agree that we need to get on with it, so I'm going to add the timeline to the page now. I will use my proposal, rather than the shorter one, because I'm still trying to take into account the concerns voiced originally. Also, I note that most of the support for a shorter time period is from people who are already candidates. I want to avoid creating the impression that existing candidates are trying to rush on before competitors can join the race (though I don't believe any of the candidates are acting out of such motivation). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:17, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I am particularly interested in knowing why. Not why these two are resigning, I can see their point; rather, why these two are resigning rather than the de facto no-votes I constantly see in arbcom decisions. If everybody who actually votes goes away, we might as well give up on the Arbitration Committee. - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a>|<a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHephaestos_50c2.html" title="User talk:Hephaestos">§</a> 03:13, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand either. Eloquence refused the appointment and has never voted, and UninvitedCompany left/resigned pretty early in the committee's existence. The vacancies have been around for a long time. I would be happy with fewer non-votes too, but we don't have a clear method of removing arbitrators who underparticipate. Though if any of them feel they can't devote the time necessary, they are welcome to resign, and we could have this election cover any additional vacancies as well. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:43, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, my addition was commented out, since apparently not everyone is sure this issue has been decided. I think it's implicit in Jimbo's posts about the committee, both <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-December/008779.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-December/008779.html" rel="nofollow">when it was established</a> and <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2004-July/016220.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2004-July/016220.html" rel="nofollow">in discussing this election</a>. The elected arbitrators will only serve for a brief time, sort of like a trial period, and it seems sensible to let them run for re-election. Does anyone actually object to allowing arbitrators to run again? If objections come up later, we can always discuss changing the policy. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:43, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the 3 months requirement for voting is an excellent one. I also think it needs questioning slightly. Can anyone tell me whether the 3 months is calculated from the 3rd, the 4th, the 13th, or some other date in August? What of a user who has switched usernames, or who has sought attribution of anonymous edits (but not yet gotten it)? I just want to make sure we have clear guidelines.

<ul>
<li>I think it is 3 months as calculated from the time that voting starts (00:00 UTC Wednesday, August 4). I think that if you don't meet that criterion at that time, regardless of other circumstances, i.e. changed usernames or edit attribution, then you just don't get to vote&#160;:-/ - <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 00:02, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And before anyone decides to complain - the 3 month thing is hardwired into the software. So there aren't any appeals and quibbling with people won't make a difference. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 00:11, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)

<li>Please Raul. We all know it could be changed, and quite easily, if we all agreed that it should be. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 01:12, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It could be changed by a developer, if there were a *lot* of support. As a general rule, they don't do anything otherwise. But since that doesn't appear to be the case, there's no sense in quibbling about it. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 01:21, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as I know, three months means 90 days before you vote, not before the vote starts. It won't take account of name changes or anonymous edits unless the names or edits were merged with the user's current account by a developer. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:33, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes that's correct. 90 days is easier to calculate than 3 months, you can just subtract the unix timestamps and compare with 7776000. This time is calculated when the user attempts to vote, and is saved into the vote log. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 08:54, Aug 4, 2004 (UTC)</li>
