<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A:I am 27 and study psychology.</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A:No clue, but I am certain I will be able to fulfil my duties.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A:<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_Contributions_3ceb.html" title="User:Sam Spade/Contributions">User:Sam Spade/Contributions</a></p>
<p><i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>
<p>A:No. When elected or appointed I will disclose such info to Jimbo and the other arbiters.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your responses. Looking at your final response, you are, as of date, the only candidate to refuse to make available information about the other accounts you have edited under. I see no problem in having multiple accounts as long as none are used abusively, counter to WP policies, or to deny responsibility for the edits. I'd be grateful if you'd reconsider, as your refusal to divulge implies (however wrongly) that there is something there you are looking to hide, whereas openness would allow myself, and other voters, to consider your WP edits in the whole.

<p>Q: Can you please explain why you believe "Jimbo and the other arbiters" are entitled to disclosure(s) that voters/the general public is not. Can you also comment on the importance, if any, of transparency in adjudication.<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 09:03, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Its not so much an entitlement I plan to give them, as much as it is one they already have. Jimbo owns the site, and he and the other arbiters can surely find a way to check if a given account is a sockpuppet. Ergo, it is reasonable (and required by policy I believe) for me to disclose such informations to them. Regarding transparency, everything should be transparent except information that could harm someone if made public. Things like peoples RL names and addresses or whatnot could be kept confidential, for example. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 18:28, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have often been both a salesman and a sociological/political/market researcher, so it is usually my job to be aware of when people are telling the truth, or when they are simply telling me what they think I want to hear.

<p><i>Do you hold any strong political or religious opinions (e.g. concerning George Bush, Islam, or on which end you should break a boiled egg)? If so, would you recuse yourself from cases centred on these?</i></p>
<p><i>How willing are you to contest the decisions of other arbitrators rather than just "go with the flow"?</i></p>
<p><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i></p>
<p><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them. Do you support this decision? [if current arbitrator] Does your visible behaviour on recent cases reflect this decision?</i></p>

<li><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_Theoretical_Biases_f1e5.html" title="User:Sam Spade/Theoretical Biases">User:Sam Spade/Theoretical Biases</a>. I feel there should be a neutral, verifiable, peer reviewed sum total of human knowledge. I favor the distrubution of such via <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a>. I would not recuse myself based on topics, but rather based on individuals and my history w them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My willingness to contest the opinions of arbiters, particularly regarding their lack of recusals is likely of near legendary proportions. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Silverback_c495.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Silverback">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Silverback</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Straw_poll_6303.html#No_more_appointees" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Straw poll">Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Straw_poll#No_more_appointees</a>, and etc...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think the appointed arbcom has done a rather bad job of this on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Nobs01_and_others_e8e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Nobs01 and others">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Nobs01_and_others</a>, starting w their flagrant bias in listing <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Nobs01_and_others_e8e3.html#Involved_parties" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Nobs01 and others">involved parties</a>. These arbiters egregious political bias is a clear indicator that Jimbo and his appointed arbiters should not be deciding who is and is not fit to judge.

<p>Could you clarify your statement:</p>

<li><i>I will be especially severe with administrators who violate policy, misuse their status, and disgrace their office. I will be particularly leniant with new users who clearly mean well, and I am particularly inclined to allow experienced users to act as mentors in such cases.</i></li>

<p>? We probably disagree as to what the words "merit" and "responsibility" mean.

<p>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system? Do you think that the spirit of cooperation in Wikipedia would survive such a change? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 16:02, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the wikipedia needs to go a completely different route. I think we need to reward one another for our good works. I think we need to criticise and punish each other far less. A ratio of 1 punishment/complaint to every five rewards/compliments sounds about right to me. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 18:32, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

How do you view editors who are normally correct in article namespace, but who may be perceived as rude – including to longtime, popular editors and admins – on Talk pages and the like?</li>
<li>Do you have an academic background of any kind, and if so, in what field?

<li>Being rude is unacceptable and drives off other contributors. <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> is among our most important policies.</li>
<li>Psychology. No one is rude to me IRL, at least not intentionally, and to my face. I am a big dangerous looking bald guy, who listens to metal and stands up for gun rights. As far as constructive criticism from profs, thats pretty standard, and usually involves grammer. I'm an A or B student, so there isn't much sharp criticism. My primary job as a student is to give the prof what he wants, which they usually make pretty clear. My secondary job is to amuse the prof, since his job is oftentimes dry and boring. If you asked them about me, they would probably say I am stimulating, friendly and possessed of a good sense of humor. For a criticism they may say I am long winded or inclined to bring out distracting or contentious topics from otherwise standard material.</li>
<li>I think it doesn't go nearly far enough. None of these mild suggestions should be ignored by the arbiters, but this proposal needs to be rewritten to increase accountability and facilitate enforcement.</li>

<dd>I oppose it, for the reason that open voting has been opposed thruout time. It promotes cliques, and all the uglines that goes with them.

Now, I must admit I know nothing of why it was deleted or the validity of the issues raised, but I'd still like to hear your take on the comments attributed to you in this RfC. The fact that you appear to trade insults with other users does not encourage me that your would be a good arbitrator. However, a solid explanation for these comments would go a long way to alleviating this concern.</p>

<dd>Your continuing insults speak for themself. As for the deleted link, it is visible to admins.

<dd>Sam's continuing insults? None here I can see. Please don't undelete the Rfc, which I had put a spedy delete on (or was somehow involved in the process) and needs to be seen in the light of the Rfc for Felonious Monk. I would remind you that Rfc's on editors not endorsed within 48 hours are subject to speedy deletion, and that you have no reasonable cause to undelete this one, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:24, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's why I didn't undelete it. And to me, the fact that Sam Spade immediately said I was trolling by raising this issue is insulting.</p>
<p>However, the greater point I raised here were the insults referenced within the RfC.

<p>All of this shows that Sam Spade has been having a long running feud with some users, in particular <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">User:FeloniousMonk</a>. Obviously I don't know all of the background to this and it appears that <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">User:FeloniousMonk</a> was involved in giving back the insults. However, since Sam Spade wants to be an arbitrator, I believe he must explain this insulting behavior. If he didn't want to be an arbitrator, then all of this wouldn't be that big a deal (in my opinion). I do find it ironic, though, that he has been taking Deeceevoice to task for her use of insults during discussions when it appears he does the same thing.

<p>There is no need to go digging for all this. I have already admitted to making the occasional slip of the tongue every 5,000 edits or so. You have made a total of 2,655 edits on 797 distinct pages, beginning in 2005-04-14 20:38:26 How you became an admin in so little time, w so few edits is beyond me. I never accused you of trolling, but rather admitted I was uncertain if you were, based on the unusual nature of your activities I have percived. For example, why you are choosing to dig up dirt from before your time is a bit perpelexing. Have you found anything I have done comparable to the sort of filth and hatemongering DC engages in and promotes? Feel free to keep looking, but I havn't the time to waste on such mudslinging. There is a reason why there is no disendorsements page this year. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 16:10, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alabamaboy, Felonious and Sam resolved their differences during Felonious' Rfadmin. Raking it up now serves absolutely no purpose. It took months before resolution occurred. Please can you let it lie, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:15, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I certainly don't do that. Indeed I have made the point more than once that being online, we have little basis for assuming one anothers race. "Black" (how do we know?) editors have no more, and no less right to edit any subject than anyone else, no more, and no less say. There are not any special rights granted on racial grounds, and there should not be. We shouldn't have to care about what race, politics, or etc... another contributer might have, nor be insulted based upon our own. That is why I oppose DC's controversial actions. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 16:23, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No I didn't believe you would engage in such activity. I don't think the race of a person should be taken into consideration at all myself either. Their cultural background and current cultural situation is much more important, and it seems to me that there are all sorts of (US centred) political stuff going on in that Rfc, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:32, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I imagine the latest one, as I am aware of the issues around it but am much too ignorant of race issues in the States to get involved, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:06, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm glad he worked out the issue with <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">User:FeloniousMonk</a> and I never said he made racist insults. However, the fact that he responds to my concerns by insultingly stating "How you became an admin in so little time, w so few edits is beyond me" suggests to me that he should not be an arbitrator. In addition, to say "I have already admitted to making the occasional slip of the tongue every 5,000 edits or so" is not a defense. That's like saying I'm not a criminal because I only break the law every now and then.</p>
<p>However, the ealier issues I raised are not the only personal attacks Sam Spade has engaged in. For example, in this <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Nobs01_and_others_e8e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Nobs01 and others">very recent arbitration</a>, the arbitrators found by a 7 to 0 vote that "Sam Spade has made personal attacks on Cberlet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cberlet&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15584503" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cberlet&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15584503" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_correctness&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13498444" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_correctness&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13498444" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>." As a result of this finding, Sam Spade was cautioned to avoid personal attacks. All of this evidence shows a pattern of insults which continues to this day. As a result, Sam Spade's ability to be a fair arbitrator should be questioned.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 16:45, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The fact that Sam wasn't sanctioned by the arbcom where other editors were also tells its own tale. I guess my question to Alabamaboy is "should Sam's record of occasionally getting wound up in the very dificult editing conditions that wikipedia has right now mean that we don't want him in the arbcom?" Do we prefer those who play the system, because they think power within it is more important than the encyclopedia, as members of our arbcom. At least Sam has shown he is a normal human being aware of the stresses involved in editing wikipedia, which could be useful experience in dealing with the stressed outness of others (and it is the wikistress that creates the Rfc's, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:06, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The funny thing is that I agree with you--people get upset and there is nothing wrong with that. As I've said, this whole Deeceevoice thing has ticked me off. Despite that, though, I have not personally insulted anyone during the affair (although I have made pointed comments about the overall affair but not to any individual editor). That said, I don't know if Sam would be a good arbitrator or not--and I guess it doesn't matter, since that is not my decision to make. <b>I do want to publically state, though, that he is an excellent editor with a proven track record of working to improve Wikipedia.</b> (emphasis provided by Alabamaboy) In the end, all of this must be considered during this decision process.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 17:18, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well that is very nice of you, thanks. If you want to know what I find objectionable about DC, have a look at her user page. I think she is violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> if nothing else. As far as yourself, you havn't insulted me that I have noticed, but suggesting that DC's RfAr was similar to a lynching struck me as extremely hyperbolic and contentious. She certainly is not being singled out for her race, nor will she be mistreated, altho those are both crimes I feel she is guilty of (singling others out for their race and mistreating them). As far as if I would be a good arbiter, I think reviewing my edits at length is a better judge of that than ancient RfC's and the like. Personally I'd like it if we were all alot more civil, myself included. This is to be an intellectually rigourous endeavor, is it not? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 21:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Definately should be as intellectually rigourous as humanly possible. I'm fully aware that Deeceevoice can be insulting and all, especially since I've been on the receiving end of some of her insults. That said, the reason I've gotten so worked up over her situation is that it does appear to me to be a vendetta driven by a few users (not you). I'm also aware that my use of lynching is "hyperbolic and contentious" but, to be honest, that was partly my intention. In private e-mail discussions, several other Wikipedian editors and myself kept coming back to this word to describe our feelings for what is happening to Deeceevoice. I finally decided that if I (and others) were saying this in private, it was dishonest not to say it in public. The use of the word was to let others know that this was how severely several of us see the affair. Anyway, all of this is now moving on. The arbitrators will make their ruling (likely citing Deeceevoice for not being civil) and then it will be her business how she deals with it. As I said, you are an excellent editor who, it appears, just gets worked at times over issues. Thanks for responding. Your last comment puts my concerns to rest on this matter. <b>If I had a vote for arbitrator (which I don't) I'd vote for you.</b> (emphasis again provided by Alabamaboy) Best, --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:25, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>

<dd>Wouldn't you prefer to know if the editor you are speaking to hates jews? or scientologists, or what-have-you? if you ask me its very generous of them to go out on a limb like that to describe their prejudices. Let us consider an editor who has an "I hate jews" w swastika template. He would probably have an obvious POV on certain articles, but not necessarilly <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botany.html" title="Botany">botany</a> articles, for example. Would you like to know that?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some people would like to know, and would like to see him banned based on his POV. Some would rather not know, and remain unaware of the strong feelings (of whatever kind) that editor holds. Still others would see him as a beneift to the encylopedia, so long as he obeys its guidelines and strives for inclusive NPOV.</dd>

Well, I am not a process wonk, or a rules lawyer, or whatever the heck some people think I am. I am able to see where the line is drawn between useful display of POV, and disruption.

<p>Thanks, that's a very good response, and I'm very happy with it.</p>
<p>But so that you understand the direction <i>my</i> question is coming from, I'll clarify my opinion. I have no problems with statement of personal opinions on userpages. An editor saying that he believes the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the Zinoviev Letter to be valid? Fine, it tells me a lot about why he makes the edits he does, and may help me to work with him. Although it may stray into advocacy, I don't think it need concern us except where it becomes, say, incitement to hatred or violence. Someone saying, for instance, "Muslims are all evil" anywhere on Wikipedia, I'd block, and I've done so for repeatedly saying that.</p>
<p>What concerns me is the amplifying effect of popping these statements into a cute little button that people stick on their userpage. Firstly it's a campaigning tool, enabling the systematic promotion of external political ideas through Wikipedia. Secondly it's an organizational tool. By clicking on an associated category or following the "what links here" link for the template, editors can get a list of like-minded people. Good if they're all people interested in archeology, perhaps not so good if they're all people who have said that they believe the zinoviev letter was a genuine document. I don't think you could get a cigarette paper between our opinions on self expression, so could you comment on these latter concerns, please? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:25, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
