<p>Arbustoo, please do not remove the Disputed Tags from the Jack Hyles or First Baptist Church Wikis. As noted in the talk section of the Jack Hyles wiki, these articles are in dispute, hence the tag.

<p>Hi Arbustoo, I hate to seem overly critical, but I think you need to look at your use of the 'minor edit' function. Minor edits are only for typo fixes &amp; formatting. Don't mark it as minor if you have added or deleted any info, and especially don't use it is you've done a revert. See <a href="../../../m/e/_/WP%7EME_2fa2.html" title="WP:ME">Minor edit</a> &amp; <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a>.

<dd>Yes, thanks, a great deal. I look forward to Arbusto/o giving this better attention. Don't know why JzG and JoshuaZ never noticed. They can be such sticklers for rules! <a href="../../../p/s/r/User%7EPSRuckman_19b2.html" title="User:PSRuckman">PSRuckman</a></dd>

<dd>Simple: once somebody has established a reputation as a reasonably neutral editor with a good grip of the ruiles you tend not to watch their every move. Nobody is above scrutiny, but neither is anybody required to critique every action by every editor. As far as I'm aware Arbustoo has never "corrected" perfectly correct British English spelling - people living in glass houses should not throw stones. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:24, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, different people have different issues they put emphasis on. In Ashmoo's case, he apparently cares about the rules for marking minor edits. (Actually, until I saw this I didn't know that reverts shouldn't be marked minor either for that matter). Don't assume bad faith just because you disagree with people. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:31, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your comments on <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_Nations_bfaf.html" title="University of the Nations">University of the Nations</a> (U of N) accreditation. No I am not trying to mislead anybody about the school's accreditation, but rather trying to follow the normal paradigm for university entries. You have been stating that the U of N is unaccredited in the first descriptive line for the Wiki entry. If you continue to do this, it will continually be deleted. If you would like to comment on a university's accreditation, I suggest that you do this in the section titled "accreditation", following the example of countless university entries throughout Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Secondly, your statement that the U of N is not accredited in the United States is true. However, as it is an international university offering courses around the world (and as its international provost office is in Switzerland, its transcripts and records office is in the UK), a far more relevant statement would of an international nature. I have updated it with a full and internationalized explanation.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have once again added the link for U of N Kona as this is the most important branch of the U of N. Please stop removing it as it is highly relevant information. Thank you. 82.33.116.35 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.33.116.35.html" title="User talk:82.33.116.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.33.116.35_6e32.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.33.116.35">contribs</a>)</p>

<dd>No, you are misleading people about the accreditation both in relation to the school in the US (Kona) that lacks accreditation and the international body schools. There is CHEA (North American accreditation) and <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> (international database) neither of which list the school. Your comments are POV and misrepresent what accreditation is.</dd>

<p>Thank you for your evenhandedness in this matter.</p>
<p>I will avoid editing the article but if you do not mind, I would like to contact you if I see any attempts by any parties to try to sabotage this article. That way a completely neutral party, which is what I presume you are, can determine if the change is worthy of edit.</p>
<p>At the very least I would like to insert criticisms in the discussion page.</p>
<p>I understand your points that you made. I do have couple of criticisms though. First, the statement The Seattle Times noted in article that included Kennedy-Western that some believe Wyoming has "become a haven for diploma mills." is in the seceond paragraph. Wouldn't it be better to put this under the section "Controversy and criticism"? And the second, mention that KWU is unaccredited in the opening sentence. Should this not also go under "Controversy and criticism?" Just my own, admittedly biased opinion.</p>
<p>On final thing to mention. I believe there should be more civility in this discussion. So that this does not become a mud slinging fest I will not mention names but if you read through the comments you will know what I am talking about. This discussion should be about the article and noting else.</p>
<p>And contrary to what that individual said I <i>do</i> edit and create other articles on other subjects, from such subjects as German Industrial Music to history, though the KWU article has taken up the bulk of my posts here.</p>
<p>Oh yea this also: I do not know that Honest Joe character. He is not a friend of mine and is doing nothing to help with that article.</p>

Considering the article is about a church its clear it's a bible college. It is unaccredited and should be mentioned in the article.

<p>I started working on an article offline on the history of diploma mills, but it appears that some relevant American publications are unavailable to me here in Sweden.

<p>More specifically, *Robert H Reid, <i>American degree mills, a study of their operations and of existing and potential ways to control them</i>, Washington, American Council on Education [1959], seems to be a standard work on this topic but unavailable around here (although it may be in one of the old dead-tree catalogues but missing from the electronic catalogues, if nobody has borrowed it in the last 20 years - I'll need to check that). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 15:09, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good work! Anyway, I started the History article in my userspace: User:Uppland/Dipmillhist. I will add what I can find there, but will need help eventually from people with access to possibly good references I can't locate here. I miss anything that gives an overview of the topic, rather than the snapshots I get from the various articles I have used so far. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:57, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I had done a brief look around the wiki trying to figure out what article to link to and was incredulous that one didn't already exist. In 2006, a diploma mill is much more likely that Wikipedia missing an article on a British university. Also, I read through some of the above sections. Very interesting.

<dd>Yes, but I read it differently. "Went to" probably means never graduated because it never stated what degree, what year, or if he graduated.

<p>Arbusto, part of Wikipedia is the free discussion of articles. You, apparently, are afraid of people making a fair presentation of Jack Hyles. You have no right to remove discussion of this subject in relevant forums. Jack Hyles is part of Fundamentalism, and so it is reasonable to ask about him in the page for Christian fundamentalism.</p>
<p>If you were so careful about following Wikipedia editorial guides, you should have noticed that <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> specifically states, "Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories." Yet, you have cared no more about the Jack Hyles article than to scavenge a few snippets from newspapers and dump them on the Jack Hyles page. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPooua_d79b.html" title="User:Pooua">Pooua</a> 17:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It sure does specifically state that one <b>should not offer <i>first-hand</i></b> and/or <b>breaking</b> news. The articles you want removed are neither. As for "censorship," you do not use wikipedia article talk pages for "further reading posts" or to recruit people to other articles. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 20:35, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, I'm not much of a fan of someone that swindles people out of money in the name of mythology...but you should cool it at Bob Cornuke, okay? Or the very least, try to change what you're saying rather than inflict bias into the statement.

<dd>As you can tell I am not the only one who wants it left in. The reason it was put in is he has an unaccredited "graduate degree" but has no undergraduate degree(s). As you probably know, in real academia this is not possible; not at all. So if you would like to avoid a revert war please find evidence of a bachlor's degree (I couldn't find anything) or make mention of this inconsistency. As it stands, it looks as if the education part is incomplete due to this inconsistenecy. The reader should know that this is Cornuke's education flaw and not the article. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 19:52, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks guys for giving me a hard time with the article on Johnson C. Philip. It was based upon solid research conducted by 3 theology students in 3 subsequent years in the Asian Christian Academy, where Philip studied for some time in 1978. Though I would have gradually added many more documentary evidence, Arbustoo was more interested in arbitrarily mutiliating the article. Whenever I gave a reply, he took the attitude of a prying wolf and, instead of addressing the issue I raised, he kept sidetracking the issues. Now you have anyway deleted the article. Meanwhile I did examine articles on people and found that many of the creiteria stipulated by Arbustoo was not followed in articles that have been on Wikipedia far longer than the Philip article. As a newbie I came to Wikipedia with great expectation. I wished to expand many more articles the way I did with the Philip article. But I have been bitten, stung, and humiliated by Arbustoo. I repeat, he dealt unfairly with me, the way the proverbial wolf told the lamb "if it was not you then it might be your father" and killed him. I came a last time to this forum to bid goodbye to all of you. I will not be coming back to Wiki to contribute any article. What is more, I would be spreading a word about this treatment to as many as possible so that they might not be stupid enough to join and then bitten by the more senior ones on the Wiki. I also know many Indians who contributed funds to the Wiki fund raising drive in recent times. I would be sharing my experience with them also. Good Bye.

However, since this person is linked to an accreditation mill, three unaccredited schools, and has no google hits outside of his personal webpages I suspect that the article was vanity to promote himself and the "schools" it runs. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 08:38, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just noticed this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_School_of_Apologetics_%26_Theology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50111544" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_School_of_Apologetics_%26_Theology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50111544" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. It seems a "new user" created the unaccredited "school" ran by Johnson C. Philip. Clearly, "someone" isn't quite done trying to make a name for an person of marginal notablity and the questionable schools he offers degrees for via the internet. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 01:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, I think it might be benificial to have the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy-Western_University_7d57.html" title="Kennedy-Western University">Kennedy-Western University</a> article mention that the University is a member of the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_Business_Bureau_a595.html" title="Better Business Bureau">Better Business Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://data.fortcollins.bbb.org/commonreport.html?bid=11000363" class="external free" title="http://data.fortcollins.bbb.org/commonreport.html?bid=11000363" rel="nofollow">http://data.fortcollins.bbb.org/commonreport.html?bid=11000363</a></p>
<p>Also I did do some checking and I asked someone about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy and I got this response:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>To the best of my knowledge, the "rule" against editing topics about which you are personally involved could only be found at <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, under the Bias section <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Bias" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">here</a>. There is no longer any mention of that rule; it must have been edited out some time ago. The WP:NPOV page is really dynamic, averaging several edits per day by a wide variety of users, and I don't have the time to search through the edit history to find it -- sorry, but I'm really busy right now.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In my opinion, that "rule" needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I think it originated from <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> where counter-vandalism hawks were trying to curb endless <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">non-notable</a> articles written about bands/websites/individuals by their lead singers/webmasters/autobiographers.</i></dd>

<p>I believe that an article about a TV News Series that happened at least 13 years ago is not notable enough to be mentioned on Wikipedia. Secondly, the details about this TV news series are so sketchy that the article can't even provide the name of the station, the date it aired, the time it aired, the reporters that worked on the story, who the reporters used for sources, or any of the other pertinent details. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 11:24, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Vivaldi's shown no interest in acknowledging that his efforts on certain pages lack consensus, preferring instead an unfortunate sort of response. Considering his response and my failing to get him to reconsider his method, I've reinstated your user conduct RFC against him, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Vivaldi_c8e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Vivaldi">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Vivaldi</a>, and certified the basis for the dispute. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:42, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No problem. I would suggest adding whatever sources are in the articles (if any) to the list page. Perhaps those entries could be unlinked, but we could keep a list with red links somewhere in project space or as a subpage of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning_8275.html" title="Talk:List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning">Talk:List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning</a> to be able to have an easy way to check for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchangeslinked&amp;target=List_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchangeslinked&amp;target=List_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning" rel="nofollow">related changes</a>".</p>

<dd>Actually, I did take note of your opinion on the anonymous editors history. Regardless of his history, you should have just made a statement rather than striking votes that were not yours. I can understand your concerns and see your point, but by removing and striking votes of the anonymous editor, you are in fact diverting attention that should have gone to investigating your claims to an investigation of your own edits, which naturally was not your intention.

<p>It's not worth noting on your arbitration with Vivaldi but what you're intrepreting as removing your comment was my reverting of the vandalism that you did to my comment, which happened to include your commenting on the vandalism. You don't explain away vandalism and there was no rational justification for you to vandalize my comment. You did this on <i>all 4 AfD</i>. On the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Jeremiah_e97c.html" title="David Jeremiah">David Jeremiah</a> AfD, since that is were the bulk of the discussion was taking place, I left you comments in as a placemat for discussion and I replied to you there. It would have been spammy to have the same discussion on each and every AfD.<br />
As for being uncivil, I was borderline and for that I do apologize. However your vandalism and accusations of sockpuppetry against me were, in my observation, a direct correlation of your lack of research into my contribution history. You saw that I was an anon and went from there. It was an easy springboard to the assumption that your lack of research into the notability of the subjects of the AfDs. You saw their author and went from there. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 11:21, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

That is what the above says. It doesn't accuse anyone of having a knee jerk negative reaction to Christians or Christianity. I'm puzzled by your offense, is there something else going on here that I need to know about? Is your real offense coming from my siding with Vivaldi?

If you start to feel offended in the future by something ive written in an AfD, feel free to bring it to my talk page so we can work it out. I'd hate for you to feel offended in the future due to misunderstandings like this one. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 00:10, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

There should be a better procedure than supercat (possibly a cat of unaccredited schools which allege but don't have a religious element to distinguish them from the actually religious ones)? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:16, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Without the unaccredited religious schools there are very few articles on secular unaccredited schools. Afterall, religious schools get latitude with not having accreditation, and thus there is more of them. These is less than 15 unaccredited articles that aren't religious. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 03:19, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>May I say something here? I just wanted to let it be known that I was not vandalizing the unaccredited articles. I saw that there were three unaccredited categories, and it seemed to me that "unaccredited institutions of higher learning" would make a good super-category and the others would make good sub-categories of that (well the other two could probably be combined into one). I did that, and then set to put all the articles in the appropriate category. I was not trying to offend you or undo your hard work, but simply help you make wikipedia the best it can be. It didn't seem right to have the three seperate categories that served much the same purpose and I was merely trying to put a more logical order to it. That said your solution, of combining them into one category, is equally good and I will support it. <a href="../../../m/g/r/User%7EMgroop_db91.html" title="User:Mgroop">Mgroop</a> 16:45, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also about <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_University_b244.html" title="Hamilton University">Hamilton University</a>, I read the article before I removed the category. But it is not a seminary or theological college. It was a business college that was using a defunct church as a way around the laws. I went to its website as well as looked up Richardson University, they don't give Bible degrees, they give business degrees. That means it is not a seminary, even if they are using a church to cheat the system. <a href="../../../m/g/r/User%7EMgroop_db91.html" title="User:Mgroop">Mgroop</a> 16:45, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, thought that might be it, but better to be sure. So. As you're probably aware, consensus isn't about vote-counting, but a weighing of arguments; while a strict vote count would have led me to delete the article, many of the delete votes didn't look to be very thought out. The subject appears to be a borderline notability case. The article isn't cruft, and has some verifiable sources. I was leaning toward "delete" and "no consensus" results, which leads me to close as "no consensus" -- if I can't decide which way consensus was headed, it indicates to me that consensus isn't settled.

<dd>The majority of keep votes were based on an article this person played Carengie Hall 11 years ago. The paper claimed he was hired because he was "inexpensive not distinguished." Moreover, as another user noted on the deletion that the promoter who hired Kendrick specializes in bringing out-of-town choirs to NY to sing there " - for a fee". Are the tours notable? Or did he simply hire a tour agent and spent his two week vacation in Europe? I opened the DRV, but am still curious as to what WP:V and BIO policies used.

<p>Looks like the DRV was closed endorsing the AfD result. Either way, I think you had some good points; I figured DRV would give us both some closure, where duking it out just between us would drive us both up the wall, annoyed at each other. But, you're more than free to start a second AfD ({{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfdx_3821.html" title="Template:Afdx">afdx</a>}} is a handy template for that) if you like. I'm not aware of any requirement that you wait, although giving the article some time (a week or two, I guess?) should avoid inclusionists accusing you of malicious intent. Good luck.

<dd>"Canvasing" seems a stretch and as for the motivation requirement of "<i>in order to strengthen one side of a debate</i>" there is no evidence to suggest that that was the purpose.

<p>Incorrect. I clicked on the link YOU provided and I replied where you started an area for me. It doesn't seem to have been removed. This is far from being resolved.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, you have yet to answer anything I was asking. The last edit I made, under Cmr924, was September 19th. I am assuming there was nothing wrong with this edit, as you have yet to respond to me when I brought it up.

<p>Thanks for your valiant filtering efforts. I have sometimes voted to keep unaccredited schools if they appear to have reliable verifiable documentation that they are training a good number of preachers, who are then able to obtain positions at churches within the related denomination. I am all for any of them being subjected to AfD, and have no sympathy for diploma mills which purport to grant degrees to further peoples's careers, but whose graduates find themselves with certificates which do not satisfy requirments of employers or other legitimate colleges. I also do not favor articles legitimizing places which trade a diploma for a check with no course requirements.I especially would not appreciate such places trying to use a Wikipedia article as proof of their legitimacy. I suppose if a bad diploma mill were infamous enought that its infamy had been widely covered in mainstream press an argument could be made for an article, just as we have articles on famous bad people. I encourage you to let me know when such an article is up for AfD. Thanks. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree keeping notable unaccredited schools is important and thanks for your interest; we can use help cleaning up the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_diploma_mills.html" title="List of diploma mills">List of diploma mills</a>. However, I do not like it when the school inclusionists contact each other (or use their school watch list) in an effort to keep the schools and I don't want to behave in a similiar manner to get attention on an article.

<dd>It seems like some washing. For example, to claim its a "private accreditor" doesn't make sense because all accreditation is private by definition in countries that use an accreditation system. In other countries that require state supervision, like Russia and China, there are no accreditors because they simply aren't needed. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 18:13, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the point of "private" versus "public" refers to the organization itself and it's standing as either a private organization/corp or a public non-profit or governmental agency. CHEA is a public non-profit, for isntance. 12.207.87.61 11:13, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The note that you are insisting upon about not being a current SACS candidate is the only statement in the article that is not cited using the &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; style. Could you switch to citation style, because the Wikipedia preference is to have all referencing in a single article use identical style. While your are at it, can you fix the spelling error and also replace "Currently" with "As of <i>today's date</i>". "Currently" is a form of wording that easily becomes false over time, while "As of date" plus a citation that uses a date doesn't become wrong, it just becomes out of date, so it is better in almost all situations. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 23:37, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>He's not any better known than other Islamic public speakers, it's just that the article has been the scene of frantic revert wars between those who find him hilarious (if you eat pork you'll be promiscuous, like pigs) and those who think that he's a brilliant man who has memorized the Qur'an, the Bible, the Vedas, etc., and who want to use the article to spread his fame and attract people to Islam. They simply do not see what is funny about his arguments and claims. The mockers put in something that seems transparently ridiculous to them and the supporters nod their heads and amplify. Then add a list of fifteen books and videos they want readers to buy.</p>
<p>It's accident, I think, that he is the subject of this back and forth. There are several other Muslim evangelists who have articles that seem to have been written by supporters.

<p>I would hope that what I have now added to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Blackshear_2991.html" title="Thomas Blackshear">Thomas Blackshear</a> places him firmly above the notability threshold. Frankly, not a topic I'm all that interested in, and I really don't want to put a ton of time into researching this. If you're satisfied, please remove the tag. If not, let me know and I'll find more. I have no doubt that he's more notable than what I can easily prove. Unfortunately, the more than half a million Google hits on him (!) are thick with sites selling his collectibles, so it's hard to find anything substantive.

<dd>This is not about BHCTI, it's about the fact that you were willing to publicly post your insults here to a user, when you clearly had no understanding of what the user was referencing. Furthermore, your tactics regarding BHCTI are just the tip of the iceberg of the methods that you have shamelessly applied to dozens of articles that don't meet your arbitrary standards. Vandalism is vandalism. While I disagreed with the removal of a category, I explained why I felt it belonged there, and never marked his repeated removals as vandalism. There is no possible way to assume good faith for his removal of specific portions of text that supported the presence of a category he wanted removed. There was ample explanation of what the situation was, and the user's choice to delete text from an article, that had explicit sources without justification, which was removed to enhance his argument is vandalism, plain and simple. He was warned, and will be blocked if he continues to do so. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:33, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Arbusto....let's just drop this. It's obvious Alansohn considers Wikipedia as his "baby" and God forbid someone else messes with it. I'm dropping it because to be honest, I don't have the time or patience to deal with someone as stubborn as he is. He is acting childish in that he is just not getting his way. Personally, I think its b/c he is an Orthodox Jew that he feels he must spread the word about Judaism and find any article that he can to link it to the religion. My point on the article was that I simply do not like labels but he has continued to add it. Then he felt that b/c I disagreed with him, that he "warned" me with vandalism or whatever. I'm a grown man. I leave the games to my little cousins. Its obvious he spends way too much time on here and takes things too personally. Instead of updating his 6000 items on his watchlist, he should probably be playing catch with his kid or more importantly, considering its after midnight, probably should be in bed with his wife. If he wants to label Cedarhurst as an Orthodox Jewish community, then let him. Its my hometown so I would think I have to right to edit the page whereas he only lived nearby before moving to NJ. You should Google him. He is all over the place with similar comments on Teaneck webpages. Pretty amusing stuff actually. You should see what he looks like lol. God knows what his job is if he has all this free time to edit pages all day. Anyway, thanks for the support.

<p>Arbustoo</p>
<p>We (ACSI) have noticed repeated changes you have made to this entry that are incorrect and irrelevent.</p>
<p>First of all, we do not accredit institutions of higher learning, therefore, the link to institutions not recognized by the government is erroneous and misleading. We should not be on the list at all, as the U.S. Government only recognizes those institutions that do accredit higher learning facilities. Appearing on the list suggests we accredit higher education institutions and we do not. Again, the Department of Education only recognizes institutions that accredit higher learning facilities, and we do not offer higher education accreditation.</p>
<p>Second, the case history and accomplishements of a lawyer should be handled by a link to a page concerning that lawyer, and not outlined on our entry. The selective history included only injects bias, and is not relevent to the case being discussed, which is that of discrimination against a point of view.</p>
<p>Third, we are not a scientific body, and are not on the list of scientific societies rejecting Intellgent Design, so why include such a link?</p>
<p>We wish to remain as objective and factual as possible. If you feel something is inaccurate, feel free to contact ACSI for clarification. We understand that you may not agree with the position of our organization on certain topics, but please refrain from injecting further inaccurate statements into our entry.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><br />
Supporting Materials:</p>
<p>From the State Department of Education:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“By law, the US Secretary of Education may only grant recognition (the term which the Department uses for accrediting bodies which it approves) to those accrediting agencies that accredit (i) institutions of higher education, provided the accrediting agency is a required element enabling those institutions to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered by the Department under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and (ii) institutions of higher education programs, provided the accreditation by the agency is a required element in enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered by the Department or other Federal agencies.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What this means, in practical terms, is that the Secretary does not have the authority to grant recognition to any accrediting agency that only accredits institutions or programs below the postsecondary level, i.e. at the elementary or secondary level. The Secretary does recognize three of the “schools” commissions of the regional accrediting bodies, but this is strictly for their accreditation of institutions that offer postsecondary education.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the College Board:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“As of January 1, 2001, we have added ACSI to our list of accrediting organization on our application code. This is the application that schools must submit to gain a six-digit code that will allow them access to ther students scores on all College Board and ACT exams. More importantly, this code will allow access to secure testing materials, thus permitting administration of exams given by the PSAT/NMSQT Program and Advanced Placement Program.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the office of Nonpublic Education (US Department of Education):</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security, through the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Student and Exchange Visitor Program is responsible for the review and adjudication of Form I-17, Petition for Approval of School Attendance by Nonimmigration Student. Title 8 Code of Federal Regulations Section 214.3 details the various requirements that petitioning private elementary and secondary schools must meet for approval. To this end, the US Department of Education, through the Office of Non-public Education, Office of Innovation and Improvement, hereby recommends that private (non-public) elementary and secondary schools providing evidence of one or more of the following criteria meet the definition of a school “accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body” as set forth in 8 CFR 214.3 (b) (2).”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>¨ Full membership in and accreditation or approval by the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) or the American Association of Christians Schools.</p>
<p>¨ All NCPSA fully recognized members - ACSI is a founding member of the National Council of Private Education and is recognized as a full membership agency in current standing.</p>
<p>¨ Accreditation or successful evaluation by an organization holding full membership in the Council for American Private Education (CAPE). ACSI is a full member.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
Regional Recognition:
</pre>
<p><br />
ACSI has written third party or dual accreditation agreements with five of the public accrediting agencies:</p>
<p><br />
Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC)</p>
<p>Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges (NAAS)</p>
<p>North Central Association (NCA)</p>
<p>Southern Association of Colleges &amp; Schools (SACS)</p>
<p>Middle States Association (MSA)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What this means is that an ACSI member school can get dual accreditiation with ACSI and one of the Regional Accrediting bodies by using the ACSI accreditation protocol. The regional bodies have recognized our protocol as an accreditation instrument that is fully acceptable to use. When accreditation visits are done we do them together, using a single instrument.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>State Recognition:</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Arbustoo. Pardon my lack of experience here, but is your ({{notability}} for short wave radio) on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans_World_Radio_c46a.html" title="Trans World Radio">Trans World Radio</a> simply a request for sources attesting to TWR's use of shortwave? Neil 03:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having heard nothing in response, and not wanting the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans_World_Radio_c46a.html" title="Trans World Radio">Trans World Radio</a> entry to disappear unnecessarily, I'm removing the ({{notability}} for short wave radio) tag. If the question is whether <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans_World_Radio_c46a.html" title="Trans World Radio">Trans World Radio</a> has in fact used shortwave, there are decades of World Radio Handbook issues (now <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Radio_TV_Handbook_78b6.html" title="World Radio TV Handbook">World Radio TV Handbook</a>) as well as engineers, listeners, and DX'ers who can attest to the fact. My parents worked with TWR for 35 years, and shortwave was a key capability that allowed them to reach their target countries. You can read all about it in Towers to Eternity (Paul E. Freed, Sceptre Books, Nashville, 1979, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0840757093</a>). This is my first time overriding somebody else's change, so I apologize if I'm breaching protocol. Neil 05:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Regarding the "one country link", remember that I suggested multiple times that you were free to add whatever citations you wanted, and that I was not the ideal person to pick which citations were inserted. All that is required here is to insert a single citation that affirms the statement being made.

<p>Unfortunately, the method you used for moving the two <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Battle_9951.html" title="Michael Battle">Michael Battle</a> articles around is not recommended (the method is called a "cut and paste" move). Such moves cause the edit history of an article to be separated from its past text, and make source of development and authors of an article a mystery to new readers. In this instance, it caused the history of related to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_J._Battle_de41.html" title="Michael J. Battle">Michael J. Battle</a> to be severed from its history, and caused the text for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_A._Battle_783e.html" title="Michael A. Battle">Michael A. Battle</a> to also be severed from its history. I reversed the edits, in effect re-joining the text with the history for each article, and re-moved the articles, and created a disambiguation page at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Battle_9951.html" title="Michael Battle">Michael Battle</a>, with additional redirects for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Battle_%28academic%29_d92e.html" title="Michael Battle (academic)">Michael Battle (academic)</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Battle_%28attorney%29_5f57.html" title="Michael Battle (attorney)">Michael Battle (attorney)</a>.
