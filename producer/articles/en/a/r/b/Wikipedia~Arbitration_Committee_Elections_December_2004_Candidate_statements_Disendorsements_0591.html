<li>Fred, as a current Arbitrator, I would hope you could at least provide one specific reason why you feel this way. "Fox in the henhouse" is a rather cryptic statement that leaves me wondering what the heck you're talking about. Please, can you provide some tips of what to look for in 172's edit history that makes you think he would be so dangerous to the other hens? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 14:15, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>172 has a long history of aggressive point of view editing which he covers up with a smokescreen of "academic authority". He is especially active with edits which whitewash left-wing totalitarian governments, leaders and actions. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:01, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. When Shorne insulted Stan, calling him an "idiot" and a "propagandist", (on 13 Oct 2004) 172 expressed his support for Shorne instead of disapproval for insulting other Wikipedians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The reason is that Shorne and 172 have similar political orientation. I'd like arbitrators to condemn people who hurl insults, not to encourage them. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 18:02, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose.</b> I've only had one encounter with 172, back in the days of Quickpolls. Admittedly, that was a contentious page; but I don't recall anyone more hostile than 172. His profanity is the only reason I've remembered him. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECribcage_bfde.html" title="User:Cribcage">Cribcage</a> 17:29, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On second thought, I don't want to make that accusation without offering citations. I've had no subsequent conversations with 172, so they were easy to find. Here's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Quickpolls&amp;diff=3262750&amp;oldid=3262726" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Quickpolls&amp;diff=3262750&amp;oldid=3262726" rel="nofollow">one</a>, and here's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Quickpolls&amp;diff=3262758&amp;oldid=3262750" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Quickpolls&amp;diff=3262758&amp;oldid=3262750" rel="nofollow">another</a>.

<li>Well, Verily, as this is a place for endorsements, not the opposite, I'd normally be inclined to just remove it.

</li>
<li>Oppose also. My only experience of Blankfaze is that he has reverted my contributions twice. First time with no explanation, and second time with an explanation that was no longer relevant, as I had made a different change the second time to cater for his objection. We are currently discussion his initial objection on his talk page, but at this stage I suspect it might be flawed! --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 19:18, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Blankfaze is being nice enough to explain himself now, but considering I'd only been a Wikipedian for a couple of days, his actions gave me a very bad first impression of both himself and of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 13:22, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oppose, without concensus, he removed cricisms, including those of himself, from the endorsements page and created this ghetto page. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:13, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)

<li>In my defence I was only trying to clean up the page, not do anything shady. I mean, come on, the page is for ENDORSEMENTS. It's not called "Discussion of candidates page". It was specifically created to provide a place for users to ENDORSE candidates.

<li>I declare my interest as a candidate. I strongly oppose Grunt. If elected, Grunt will, as a minimum, have to remove himself from any discussions involving Americans or America-related issues (he publicly and persistently describeds himself as anti-American, and therefore would not be able to arbitrate objectively any such cases). Given the large number of American users, this would be a serious impediment to him filling this role.

<li>I was under the impression that it was a given that until the survey period is over (November 28), this disendorsement page is to be used. I have a strong distaste for this whole (dis)endorsement crap, but I was only doing what I was under the impression was agreed upon convention. The fact that both the organizers and Jimbo himself warned on this page against disendorsements (instead of using the other for their warning) did nothing to dissuade me either. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:15, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you were paying attention to the straw poll, it closes November 28. While it is highly unlikely there will be a sudden deluge of votes going in the opposite direction, I believe the common-sense thing to do is to avoid ruling out any possibility. Once the strawpoll's deadline is up, that will be that. I will respect the will of the majority, even if there's no consensus per se. I should note that the first poll of any kind â the survey Michael Snow started â is inconclusive, as nobody can even claim a simple majority, so it has no bearing on what happens to this page. As for Quadell's strawpoll, it's not over till it's over. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:37, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> After returing to this site for the first time since February, I came across this so-called "Neutrality" user and this project page through the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recent_changes.html" title="Recent changes">Recent changes</a> feature... Without bothering to state his reasoning, "Neutrality" reverted the addition of the funeral for a major African American cultural icon. (I am wondering if there is a racial motive for this; it seems as if Wikipedia users only post stories that concern its largely middle- to upper-class white American readership, as opposed to representing a variety of stories of interest to a diverse range of classes, national origins, racial backgrounds, etc.) <b>Revert warriors must not be given positions of authority on Wikipedia.</b> <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWenteng_08df.html" title="User:Wenteng">Wenteng</a> 04:20, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Raul forged a number of 83%. In previous votes for adminship (I think he only got in the 2nd or 3rd time he was nominated), Neutrality repeatedly attempted to have opposing votes disbarred.

<ul>
<li>I just re-read the transcript at the link provided above, and it does not reflect poorly on Neutrality at all. If anyone's actions were questionable, it would have been the folks conducting the vote, because Neutrality was not yet an Admin at the time. In any case, the logistics of that vote is all water under the bridge, as Neutrality has repeatedly proven himself to be a worthy Administrator. But don't take my word for it - I encourage voters to look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Neutrality" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Neutrality" rel="nofollow">edit history of Neutrality</a> and compare it to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Xed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Xed" rel="nofollow">edit history of Xed</a>, and judge for yourself.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Votes to remove other users from an election that he is running in, when it should be obvious that he needs to recuse himself.

<li>--Oppose-- somebody deleted all of raul's oppose endorsments and his disendorsment section, seems a bti fishy to me. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck_F_f280.html" title="User:Chuck F">Chuck F</a> 03:00, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Strongly oppose. Inept, biased, unresponsive, vindictive. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 01:17, Nov 18, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Gzornenplatz's words are a bit strong. But Raul654 has been striking me as a bit cabalish lately; and he doesn't do nearly as good of a job explaining his reasoning in cases as, say, Jwrosenzweig. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 03:32, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not sure anti-endorsements belong here, but I (shockingly) agree with these sentiments. Although I once thought Raul was clearheaded and voted for him in the last election, my recent experiences have been very poor. He, in his role as arbitrator, made demeaning comments to me based on something he mistakenly believed I had done, due to failing to look at the material he had been given. There was no response to my further queries, much less an apology for his error. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 07:54, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've also noticed that a number of arbitrators, along with a number of the likely "frontrunners" in this race, have a bit of a self-righteous and condescending streak to them. They seem to believe that they have earned the trust of the community; and with they feel that they are entitled to 'talk down' to general users. However, their source of status may not be too impressive. Users like Raul are simply more 'trusted' and popular than users like Gzornenplatz because they can avoid certain kinds of conflict. This isn't the case because they are inherently better behaved than users who get in revert wars; it's just easy to steer clear of edit wars when you're spending most of your time on cleanup, meta, IRC, or the mailing list and not working on the contentious topics in which Gzornenplatz and VV are interested. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 12:23, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>World, take note: 172, I, and possibly Gz agree on something. People whose passions are in particle physics, ancient Greece, or children's toys will simply not be exposed to the same stresses that editors on communism or nationalism are. But this is a dubious ground for the air of superiority, of being a better person, the former type often exude <i>vis-a-vis</i> the latter. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 13:28, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing with VeryVerily. People like me are blackened as "edit warriors" solely because we write primarily on contentious political topics and have to put up with impossible people who revert everything we do without discussion. Those who deal primarily with <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macram%C3%A9.html" title="MacramÃ©">macramÃ©</a> or <a href="../../../r/h/u/Rhubarb.html" title="Rhubarb">rhubarb</a> get a good reputation merely by dint of avoiding controversial topics. As for Raul654 and the other haughty arbitrators, their record is available for anyone who cares to look at it. (See below for some references.) Merely being incumbents should bring them no glory: they have proven to be appallingly biased, unaccountable, and vindictive, not to mention slow to take their (unjust) actions. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 03:50, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my own defense - for those who are unaware, all of the complaining users above (Gzornenplatz, 172, VeryVerily, and Shorne) are currently under investigation by the arbitration committee. In fact, taken together they are involved in almost half (5 out of 13) of the current cases. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">âRaul654</a> 06:38, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Before concluding from this insertion that we "complaining users" are acting out of spite, users would do well to consider why people whose cases are pending would antagonise an arbitrator. If we were acting wholly out of self-interest, we would curry favour with Raul654. Readers should also look into the record of Raul654. I have provided three links below that prove every single allegation stated above: inept, biased, unresponsive, vindictive, demeaning, self-righteous, condescending, superior, haughty, unaccountable, slow.

<li>Oppose. From first to last all my interactions with Sam Spade have started with a snarl from him.

<li>Strongly <b>Oppose</b>. For reasons given a thousand times before Sam Spade is untrustworthy. His personality seems to change with weather or not he disagrees with an article or with another user. He might be cordial on pages that he agrees with, but utterly lacks civility on other pages. Btw, there is nothing wrong with other users publicizing what they believe to be Sam Spades' misdeeds (as long as they are honest); afterall doesn't free speech go both ways?

<li>I am frankly somewhat appalled by the company my strong <b>oppose</b> puts me in, but I think that perhaps that says something in itself, that so many Wikipedians who certainly do not agree on anything else <i>do</i> agree that Sam Spade should not be on the ArbCom. Wikipedians need to know they can trust the ArbCom. I could not trust an ArbCom with Sam on it. My experience with him has been that he can talk a good game about fairness and NPOV but he will not walk the walk; he will always phrase what he wants to do in terms of nice, neutral principles but it doesn't take long at all to see him switch to a different set of principles when the ones he was just advocating are no longer convenient. ArbCom needs people willing to adhere to one standard for everyone, and I see no hint that Sam Spade plans to drop the double standards that have caused me to not trust him even as an editor, let alone as an Arbitrator. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 05:32, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly oppose</b>.

<li><b>Oppose</b>....and in the strongest terms. Sam is completely unsuitable because of his inability to keep his personal agenda away from Wikepedia articles. He wastes massive amounts of lots of good folks time who fruitlessly point out carefully his errors, and he just will not budge in the face of crushing evidence that he is mistaken. He is completely immune to intellectual honesty and I feel very strongly that he would most certainly abuse his admin power to foist his views and Wikipedia would be all the lesser for it.

<li><b>Strongly oppose.</b> Theresa Knott has proven to be utterly supercilious, consistently taking the part of the administration and dismissing the legitimate complaints of the hoi polloi. See, for example, her extensive discussion over the past few days in <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html#Purge_the_arbitration_committee" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">User talk:Jimbo Wales#Purge the arbitration committee</a>, where she snapped "Stop whinging" at me in response to a complaint that has received considerable popular support, then continued to accuse another user of "whinging". Although she did eventually apologise for this display of condescension, her partiality towards the administration <i>coÃ»te que coÃ»te</i> is precisely the opposite of what we need at a time when so many people are complainingâwith justiceâof an Ã©lite cabal. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 04:04, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>OK I'm not sure if it's a good idea to defend myself here. But what the hell I'm going to do it anyway. I do not dismiss legitimate complaints of the hoi polloi.

When it comes to it I will reverse other admins if I feel they have not acted within policy. I did not "snap" at you. I reminded you that the AC decision was a tempory measure designed to protect wikipedia, and that your calling for the AC to be purged was whinging. The "other user" that I accused of whinging was Xed, who was complaining yet again, that he had been temp blocked over his insistance on keep adding jimbo's email to secretlondon to the requests for arbitration page despite the fact that it had already been rejected by the arbitrators. He used this blocking to attack me, even though I wasn't the one who blocked him. He also said that i appealed to authority when in actual fact i had said that the AC should not have duristiction over private emails. This is something I still think btw. All this happen months ago, so yes i do think that Xed brinig it up again is whinging. I also want to correct the "eventually apologised" statement you made. You complained that i was being condescending, I apologised for that the moment I read your complaint. There was no "eventually" about as any who reads jimbo's talk page can see. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 14:38, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did protect the page to stop the edit war. I have no idea if the version I protected was POV or not as I have no knowledge or interest in the subject. I was merely trying to stop the edit war. The edit war is between multiple users all reverting each other like crazy, there are hundreds and hundreds of edits to that article, I wouldn't have the faintest idea which version to revert to. Also note that this is the first interaction i have ever had with cheese dreams. He did not bring his concerns to me on my talk page, or on the talk page of the article. His first action on seeing me do something he didn't like was to start a rfc on me and then make this edit here.

<li>CheeseDreams, this seems to be a misunderstanding about the protection policy. The admin protecting a page is not supposed to choose which version or decide which is POV. To do so would make the admin an involved party. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 12:40, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Note the way other admins such as RickK revert to a version before an edit war before protecting - thus retaining the article, during the protection, in a state more agreeable to both sides than either of the edit war versions, or at least one which they don't object to continuing to exist for a while. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 23:29, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>Supporters and opposers need to be able to see clearly the comments of all parties in relation to the potential candidate. Putting opposing comments on a separate page is virtually deleting those comments since not many will look at that page, because they either don't know it exists or because they can't be bothered to jump through so many hoops. There is no real sense in putting the opposing votes on a separate page, so the only real reason can be that some candidates don't want others to see them. This matches your general view that admins are beyond reproach and complaints against them are not to be acted on, or even listened to.

<li>So you are saying that because you disagree with the way blankfaze organised the pages and I said "OK I can live with that" about it then it's acceptable to accuse me of election fraud but not him?

<li>You are making incendiary comments, Xed. If you provide no solid reasoning behind them beyond saying you conducted "careful consideration of the candidates positive and negative aspects", you are opening yourself to accusations of trolling. Your conduct of discussion is controversial enough to cause others to flame you, and that is the typical definition of trolling. Either explain why you have not accused blankfaze of election fraud (and why you accused Theresa of supporting it instead of merely saying she tolerates it, although that would still be quite unacceptable for most) or strike out your false accusations. <small>Note: For the conspiracy theory-inclined, this is not an order, merely my opinion.

<li>There's nothing <i>incendiary</i> about my remarks. How I come to my desisions as really up to me. Blankfaze may be guilty of election fraud, but he doesn't share the numerous deficits of character that I have already shown Theresa to have. Theresa, by her words and actions, believes admins to be some sort of infallible clergy. She's even trying to make me withdraw my criticism of her intolerance of criticism! In Grunts nomination above (unless it's been deleted..), she criticized my giving an explanation for my opposition <i>even though Grunt had asked for one</i>. Thus my opinion of her is overwhelmingly negative, whereas my opinion of blankfaze is more ambiguous. You aren't asking the first user in Theresa's list to justify himself <i>(Strongly endorse. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">âNo-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;Jones</a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a>)</i>.

<p>To Xed: First of all, props for the use of the word "ghettoise" and the "Keep your wig on Terry" and "Something similar happened in Florida a while ago" comments. A Good Laugh. However, I really do take offence at your notion that I "may be guilty of election fraud". Lastly I urge you to give up this campaign of yours against Theresa, because nothing good can come of it.

Specifically for his conduct on and related to the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">Talk Atheism</a> pages, seemingly because they do not fit in with his agenda which as Felonious Monk details above, is well documented and sadly biggoted is not too strong a word. Here he simply will not accept well sourced multiple references and conceding the point on the wide use of the weak or passive definition of Atheism. Not only this he repeatedly fails to answer direct questions on his reasons for failing to accept these multiple, well sourced references and this is directly contrary to Wikipedia policy. He also has sent a foul language abusive e-mail to Felonious Monk using the Wikipedia e-mail system following the start of these discussions. This is simply beyond the pale more especially in the light of his failure to express contrition for this.</dd>

<p>In my "Letter from the Founder" I wrote: "The only way we can coordinate our efforts in an efficient manner to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves, is to love our work and to love each other, even when we disagree. Mutual respect and a reasonable approach to disagreement are essential, and both of those are helped along enormously when we feel favorably towards each other just as a natural result of being volunteers together on this incredible ridiculous crazy fun project to change the world.</p>
<p>None of us is perfect in these matters; such is the human condition. But each of us can try each day, in our editing, in our mailing list posts, in our irc chats, and in our private emails, to reach for a higher standard than the Internet usually encourages, a standard of rational benevolence and love."</p>
<p>This page is a magnet and incentive for a different approach, one which I most vigorously reject for our community. I encourage people to avoid the use of this page, and instead stick to positive endorsements of people who you think will represent our values thoughtfully and rationally. If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 16:53, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's disappointing that Jimbo appears to attack as a troll anyone who has an objection to someone being an Arbitrator. Those who seek to discipline and judge us should surely be beyond reproach themselves and have the full support of the Wikipedia community. It's important that those who seek to set themselves above the rest are open to full scrutiny. I therefore encourage sensible use of this page. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 01:06, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page allows users to voice their concern about the candidates. Some candidates may simply by force of personality in their statements "appear" to be neutral, open minded candidates to be elected, when in actual fact they are nothing of the sort. It is important to prevent such obfuscation. In a real world election, it is never a case of each side stating how nice they are, without also warning the electorate about the dangers of choosing wrongly.</p>

His Nazi Party secured the most seats in the Reichstag, but never a majority, Communists also holding a large position, but not as many as the Nazis. After several dissolved governments, Hindenburg <i>appointed</i> Hitler Chancellor in perhaps history's most disastrous attaempt at what we '60s flower children would have called "co-opting": more like making the schoolyard bully into the head hall monitor in order to bind him to "the system." Hitler paid obeisence to Hindenburg. Some Germans were charmed: "The Field Marshall and the Corporal." Wasn't that warm and fuzzy? Not too many warm and fuzzy moments after that. <i>After</i> Hitler was chancellor the Nazis got 44% of the votes in the Reichstag, and only formed a government by making a coalition with another rightest party. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> Â®</a> 08:36, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>I strongly believe in the ethical free exchange of information and ideas, and was under the impression that such a free market was a wiki ideal. For any informed vote, access to all relevant candidate information, even that which is negative, is not a luxury, but a necessity. Indeed, how else are uninformed voters to learn of hypocritical candidates who claim a high level of dedication to the policies and ideals yet who repeatedly fail to <i>"reach for a higher standard than the Internet usually encourages, a standard of rational benevolence and love ...in their editing, in their mailing list posts, in their irc chats, and in their private emails"</i>?</p>

<p>The tradition of public "oppose" statements that elucidate the rationale for opposition comes from <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>, where candidates are chosen by consensus and an honest evaluation is a necessary, if sometimes troubling, part of the discussion process. The arbitration committee election, on the other hand, is a voting process rather than a consensus one. Accordingly, each vote is given equal weight regardless of its rationale, and the rationale for failing to support a candidate need not be shared.</p>
<p>On behalf of the election organizers, I would like draw special attention to the portion of our <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Organizers_statement_6c02.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Organizers statement">earlier statement</a> where we ask you to show your disapproval only with your vote itself. It is our hope that this may be a collegial election. Since nearly all candidates are long-time contributors to the wiki, we would hope that the process will unfold in such a way that even those who are not elected will retain their dignity and the respect of the community.</p>
<p>In reviewing the "disendorsements" already made, I observe that few comments are surprising. Instead, allegiances and prior conflicts that have already been hashed out in the community are being trotted out for another go. Other than by serving as a handy index by gathering this material in a single place, little is accomplished through these listings.</p>
<p>We discourage additional listings on this page and suggest that those who have already added material here may wish to remove it.</p>
