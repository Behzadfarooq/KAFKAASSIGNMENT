<dd><i><a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration.html" title="Arbitration">Arbitration</a>, in the context of law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution â€” specifically, a legal alternative to litigation whereby the parties to a dispute agree to submit their respective positions (through agreement or hearing) to a neutral third party (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Unfortunately, the present "Arbitration" process has become increasingly legalistic and punitive - more like a criminal court. Re-establishing the proper focus is the compass by which I will measure my work as an Arbitrator.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I will reject all requests for arbitration which are made to the Committee by persons who are not directly involved in the dispute.</b> The proliferation of "district attorney"-type requestors will end.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>I will expect that all parties entering into arbitration will accept the binding outcome.</b> If any party chooses not to enter arbitration or chooses to defy the binding outcome, then other processes, like mediation or adminstrator action, should be employed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>I will accept all complaints of misuse of adminstrator rights, so long as the <i>prima facia</i> case seems solid.</b> I fully endorse granting our administrators greater privilege in neutrally resolving conflicts, but likewise want to reassure the community that admins can come under review, as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last platform item is probably the most controversial, so I'll expand on it and show how it works with the others. If someone feels they are unduly restricted by an admin, they can appeal to the Arbitration process. If they do so, they and the administrator (implicitely) must accept the binding decision. In this way, a troublesome user can be handled by administrator consensus alone -- so many of the past and present cases could have been handled this way and gave us better results. Admins who are neutral and explain their reasoning will have the support of the community and the ArbCom. A troublesome user can either accept that adminstrator's ruling, or appeal and possibly face more stern restrictions. On the other hand, if someone is being treated unfairly, then ArbCom review of that admin becomes much more accessible. In short, I seek to give more responsibility to the good administrators, while protect against the bad ones. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 22:35, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In regards to the first part of your platform, if one must be party to a dispute to submit an arbitration case, how do you propose to deal with cases such as Anthony, Xed, and Netoholic where the dispute spanned multiple pages and multiple people? There would be no single user with the standing to raise these cases, leading the problems to go unresolved. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:28, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If these disputes were so wide-spread as you imply, then a suitable requestor should be available. Also, I would have rejected these cases unless the subject and the requestor both agreed to the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration.html" title="Arbitration">arbitration</a>. If all parties agreed, then the arbitration team would review the arguments and decide a firm course of action. Under my platform, individual disputes are handled as they arise. The present process seems to encourage blanket witchhunts where all disputes involving a user are laid out. It's my feeling that if users A, B, and C have a problem with a user, then three separate and narrowly focused arbitrations are more fair and can be handled very quickly. There is no reason an average arbitration can't be resolved in a few days if both sides are motivated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think your stance on these users is that they were so troublesome that it took a special prosecutor to handle them. This just isn't the case. Users who are simply troublesome should be warned, restricted, and then ultimately blocked by some neutral administrator(s). If that user feels that treatment is unfair, they themselves can request arbitration to resolve the dispute. This information should be communicated clearly to the user, but I trust the admin community to establish appropriate protocols. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 02:58, 7 November 2005 (UTC) (edited)</dd>

<dd>It's more an issue of nobody being involved in the case to the point where they were party to the bulk of it - anyone who filed the case would necessarily be filing it regarding a large amount of behavior they weren't involved with one way or another. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:55, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're missing the point entirely, though I can't tell if that is deliberate. There should not be a "case" -- this isn't some pseudo-courtroom. Arbitration, true arbitration, needs to be returned to Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 06:33, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what would you propose to leave open to deal with users such as those?

<dd>Stop things from getting so "bad" in the first place. By employing a true arbitration process, we can hopefully provide a means to deal with disputes before they get very large. A user who wants to act in good faith will recognize that they had their say in the arbitration and abide by the decision. "Problem users" are presumably those who act in bad faith or perhaps just cannot consistently work well with others. The really obvious ones are already handled by the admin community. What I say is that the admin community should also be able to handle the somewhat ambigious ones also, perhaps with something as simple as a WP:AN notice or an RFC. Recent cases brought against Rainbowwarrior1977, DotSix, Plautus satire, LevelCheck, and a few others were "no-brainers". The obvious bad-faith nature of these users means that any delay due to the back-logged arbitration process was detrimental to Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 04:03, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Question 2: Seeing as you are fully banned from the Wikipedia namespace until May, how do you expect to be an active arbitrator for the first four months of the year when you are prohibited from making edits to any arbitration pages? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:55, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think what you should ask is why that is of any relevance? I think if I were to be elected, that implicitely would show the community consensus for me to fulfill the roll of Arbitrator. I'm also confident that Jimbo would formally suspend that ban, at least on the ArbCom pages, if that sort of acknowledgement is needed.

<p>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system? Do you think that the spirit of cooperation in Wikipedia would survive such a change? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 16:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe my view is clear in my statement. I support the "no big deal" approach to adminship, so long as a suitable admin review process is available for the mistakes that get through.

<ol>
<li>I will not swear to it, but I do like the idea of having a community-driven set of guidelines for Arbitrators to follow. If it's got solid consensus, then my conduct will match it's intent as best as I can.</li>
<li>I think it's a lot longer and more verbose than is necessary.</li>
<li>I am not sure about the number of seats-- for now, it seems OK. The rest of the question is covered in my statement.</li>
<li>No, I was not very active during that page's active phase. I think my views align with the present consensus on all the items.</li>

<p>I would like to see you on ArbCom, but I have voted neutral because I find your second plank ambiguous. If a problem user (in ArbCom's best judgment, on the evidence) simply ignores an arbitration, should ArbCom sanction them, or not? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If a problem user ignores the arbitration, either by avoiding participation or by failing to adhere to any restrictions, they should be at the full mercy of administrator consensus. Even today, the ArbCom rarely/shouldn't actually enforce it's decisions. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 19:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But should there be an ArbCom finding to guide this consensus? A finding gives admins a lot more leeway? For example, imposing a 1RR; admins may enforce this against a problem user anyway, but without a finding the admins are less likely to be reversed or even sanctioned for doing so. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:02, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh yeah, much like today, when an arbitration commences, there will likely be specific findings that all parties have to abide. My proposal is based on the fact that the we do not use a true arbitration here on Wikipedia. Rather than be a mutual endeavor, it's run too much like a criminal court. Under my proposal, problem users (or those just presumed to be problems) must be the ones to initiate the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration.html" title="Arbitration">arbitration</a> in order to gain relief from what restrictions admins have placed on them. The same holds true to any users who are just in a disagreement and need a neutral outside decision-making body. Everyone comes into it with the desire to be bound by the decision. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:52, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I am concerned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" rel="nofollow">templates</a> surviving AfD that appear to contrast with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">established policy</a>. In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006?

<dd>I expressly dislike that any editors would choose to express advocacy (or dis-advocacy) on any issue. This is a place of verifiable knowledge, not a platform for making Wikipedia's content match one's personal convictions. On the other hand, I encourage editors to express areas of knowledge in which they are willing to contribute.</dd>
<dd>The role of the ArbCom should be first to investigate occasions where administrators have endorsed the use of advocacy templates, and remove their ability to interfere (restoring deletion of such templates is grounds for de-adminship). The administrators that are left, I feel, will represent the proper focus of this project and can then pass that focus onto the misguided editors that choose to create such templates, through deletions, blocks, etc. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 22:10, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
