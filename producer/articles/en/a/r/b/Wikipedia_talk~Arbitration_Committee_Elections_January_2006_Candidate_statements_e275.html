	    <p><b>A WARNING TO ALL WOULD-BE ARBITRATORS</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Being on the Arbitration Committee is the most thankless job on Wikipedia. It is absolutely impossible to do it such that people are happy with you. If you are doing a bad job, people complain; if you are doing a good job, people don't notice (or sometimes even then complain). All of your actions are examined under a microscope. People expect you to be the Oracle of all truth - to work miracles no matter how complicated the case, no matter how how bad the evidence, no matter how hostile and stubborn the disputants. And of course, there are the accusations of cabalism.</i> - <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_Raul%27s_laws_b426.html" title="User:Raul654/Raul's laws">Raul's 9th law of Wikipedia</a></dd>

<p>The page suggests that statements are about 250 words in length. I have added a notice saying that anything over 300 will be cut off, but I'd welcome views on this. At present there are 10 candidates, whose statements are of the following lengths (based on the Microsoft Works word count):</p>
<ul>
<li>172 - 303 words</li>
<li>Ambi - 356 words</li>
<li>Carbonite - 311 words</li>
<li>Filiocht - 201 words</li>
<li>Ilyanep - 324 words</li>
<li>Jtkiefer - 222 words</li>
<li>Luigi30 - 96 words</li>
<li>Merovingian - 247 words</li>
<li>Ral315 - 354 words</li>
<li>Redwolf24 - 224 words</li>
</ul>
<p>A cut-off of 300 words would mean that 5 of the existing 10 statements are trimmed. Interestingly, so would a cut-off of 250 words.</p>
<p>If the statements are cut-off the candidates should be notified on their talk pages so they can make any adjustments they deem appropriate, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:42, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is it really necessary to cut anything off? I'd perfer that we made a mandatory cut-off at 350, because I would have trouble cutting off 24 words (however, 350 would make Ambi and Ral315's too long). Our other option is no cut-off. — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="color:gray;">Ilγαηερ</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="color: #333333;">(Tαlκ)</span></a> 20:54, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jguk, you asked every candidate <i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i> I fail to see how this is pertinent to the ArbCom elections. The candidate's age shouldn't matter; indeed, this is a personal detail some may feel hesistant in disclosing. Knowing someone's age should <b>not</b> be a factor; it doesn't matter if the candidate is two, twelve, twenty-two, or (heaven forbid) two-hundred and twenty-two. If you're concerned about the maturity of the users, people should be able to evaluate that regardless of the age. Someone at fourteen or fifteen (which we have several candidates) can be just as mature as someone fourty or fifty, if not more. <b>It shouldn't matter.</b> You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and you shouldn't judge someone by his/her age, especially if someone is unwilling to disclose that piece of personal information. Also, you ask students to state what subjects they are taking. Again, it shouldn't matter. I really don't care if someone is taking underwater basket weaving 101, advanced literature, nuclear physics, or is working towards a Ph.D. in the arts; you don't need any qualifications to sit on the ArbCom, and I frankly don't see how the classes someone is taking should be included. If you're worried that a candidate might not have enough time, why not ask them so directly? <i>Do you feel that you will have enough time throughout your term to accomplish the tasks of ArbCom?</i> Jguk, I ask that you reconsider your first question. Of course, I respect your opinion, and I don't mind if candidates want to reply to that question, but I also ask that if someone does not wish to answer that question, that it not be held against him/her. Thanks very much for listening to me, and as always, I value your opinion. Thanks very much for your understanding! <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> | <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">W</a><sub><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">S</a></sub> 23:19, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I don't mind if candidates (such as you) want to answer, I just want to make sure that no one holds this question against a candidate if s/he doesn't want to answer it.

<p>Flcelloguy, there is a space explicitly set aside for questions and comments on candidates and I chose to ask some questions that I feel will better give me a view of the candidates. I'd be surprised if other wikipedians don't ask their own questions as well before the election's over. Candidates may, if they wish, answer them, and I hope that they will, but that is their free choice. Whether anyone else finds value in the answers to the questions I asked, I don't know - I guess some will, some won't. As far as what determines any wikipedian's vote, that is entirely up to that wikipedian, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 23:45, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, that's fine with me. I just ask that people respect a candidate's right not to answer some questions, if the candidate feels uncomfortable answering it, and ask that people not hold that against them. For example, if I asked every candidate <i>Where do you live? What is your phone number, your employer (if you have one), and your social security number?</i>, all the candidates would clearly refuse to answer. I just don't think that someone refusing to answer any type of question that is not directly pertinent to the ArbCom should be held against him/her.

<dd>I've taken the liberty and moved your comment to the bottom, Ingoolemo. That's exactly my point — I've seen multiple times where people have looked down on someone or believed that they were superior based on age. I've seen people say that because someone was younger then him, that his version had to be right. I don't think age should be a factor; judge the candidates by their actions, not their age. In addition, with the candidates giving their ages, some people might lose respect for the ArbCom — the same people who scorned those younger then them would scorn people younger then them judging them. I urge that people not take a candidate's age, occupation, or classes into account here.

<p>I suppose I have a view of this from another angle. I considered not answering this question for a different reason. Many of the electorate are likely to view me as a bit old and boring and probably not all that good at the technical stuff. But I decided in the end that I would answer it, because being a bit old and boring and probably not all that good at the technical stuff is part of what I am and influences the way I operate and interact. I think, though I may be wrong, that if I was young and energetic and good at the technical stuff, as many of the other candidates clearly are, I'd make that plain, too. I do agree most strongly that it is wrong to discriminate on the grounds of age here. But I would reserve the right to be put off a candidate with a track record of immature behaviour, be they 50 or 15. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 14:08, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm just curious, but why would you rule out someone who refused to give his/her age?

It's not like we're filing a job application here - ArbCom members aren't "employed" by the Wikimedia Foundation, they aren't paid, they're volunteers. Age is an extremely sensitive piece of personal information that some may be unwilling or be hesistant to disclose, and I don't see why that should be held against him/her. Judge the candidates by their actions, not by their ages.

<dd>You have no obligation to provide it, but likewise noone else has an obligation to avoid considering that in whatever voting process Jimbo works up for the coming election. There are a few reasons some people might consider age to be relevant, e.g. countering systemic bias or if someone is about to go to university for the first time and may have a hard time judging their workload. There are plenty of reasons to think other information might concievably lead to good reasons for judging candicates, and so I think it's very fair to ask for the info and judge based on the response or lack thereof. The SSN is obviously a red herring -- it's obvious that that information is dangerous to the giver and useless on Wikipedia. Age/Sex/etc should not be considered naturally sensitive -- they are things one gets a rough impression of immediately when meeting someone on the street. If they're sensitive to specific people, I understand, but consider it a minus if not disclosed. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 13:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Real-world qualifications have never been an issue in the past, and it disturbs me that they've suddenly come up now. I fail to see how voting a certain group of often potentially very good candidates for a reason that they can do nothing about does <i>anything</i> to solve systemic bias. I also think the study load example is a red herring - I was elected in December, three months before beginning university, and had no trouble at all handling study load and arbitration duties. In any case, I believe that should be an issue for the candidate, as they're the ones in the position to judge. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 15:11, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Ambi on this one, as I've stated above. I don't see how real-world qualifications should deal with this. What's next, asking candidates to submit a resume? Should we elect a Wikipedian automatically to the ArbCom if s/he has served as a judge? Age, contrary to what you say, is a highly sensisitive issue. If you're worried about the candidate's time, why not just ask, as other users have done? I still fail to see how age - or the classes someone is taking - is pertinent.

<p>Different WPians will vote for different reasons - just as in real-life. They have different priorities and different views on what is relevant. To me, background is interesting - it tells you something of how someone will think and react in a given situation - without it, all we have is their edits, which may or may not say much about the individual. Have a look at what happens in America when there is a Supreme Court nominee - Congress becomes very interested in how they will react and whether they will react properly. I really have no problems at all in allowing any Wikipedian to ask any question (subject to decency and libel laws). It's up to the candidates what questions they answer - and then up to the voters as to whether any answer, or failure to answer, is important to them.

<p>There are definately more...but need I really go on? The level of teenagers on Wikipedia is definately different than that of teenagers in the general public (as it is with most respected adults on Wikipedia as well). Kids who are on the general level who only worry about their next dance, girlfriend, or how to solve their next math problem (3+5) don't generally get involved in Wikipedia to the level of admin, mediator, or even bureaucrat.

<dd>What Sam said is true: kids are stupid, generally. But at wiki most of the kids here are exceptions, we're like those people who are 7 and a half feet tall... rare, but still around. I'm more annoyed at Grace Note saying he would never support a minor for an arbitrator. I'll tell you one thing: minors would speed up the process, we don't spend 40 hours a week at a job, and we got a lot of free time. Though it's agreeable that having a majority be children would be bad, only about 4 people running are minors, and to be honest, I only think one or two has a chance. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 01:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. Elections would take two weeks. If you assume 1 week of campaining or whatever prior to the vote they have got until about 1st December. Apointments require zero run up so give you even more time. The current sitution is not condusive to getting people to nominate themselves.

<li>Concur with Geni. This process is patently unfair to the community. I notice several candidacies that mention in their statement or edit sums that they are wary of this lack of process, or that they believe their candadicy will not be given fair consideration (Kim Bruning, Jtkiefer, Sam Korn, Filiocht's withdrawal). Also, the extreme brevity of Kelly Martin's candidate statement seems to indicate that she already knows it's not important to tell the community who she is and why she's running. The implications are extremely worrying. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 16:27, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Please note</b> that there is no scope for incoming or current Arbitrators to change the fundamental nature of the Committee in this appointment cycle, such as the whether it sits en banc or whether it considers content disputes.

<dd>I disagree with this. I think a candidate should boldly advocate making changes, but should realize that once you are selected that there will be a substantial burden of work and considerable inertia among the arbitration committee as to how they do things.

<dd>That is why the executions are in public, so the community knows what behavior leads to it. Consistent sanctions against abuse of power and authority by admins, will reduce its prevalence in the community. If they don't learn from the public "executions" of others, then their own "execution" will reduce the level of abuse. Frankly, I don't view de-adminning as a severe sanction, if the person receiving the sanction does view the deadmining rather than the abuse of community trust that led to it as severe, then they probably should not be an admin. So, I would be more likely to recommend a week or two deadminning for even small abuses, than I would in the case of a more fundamental participation in the community such as editing. Adminship is merely an opportunity to serve.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 04:25, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Overall I am dismayed with this undertaking. Those Wikipedians who are known for their evenhandedness, trustworthiness, and understanding appear (with a few notable exceptions) to have declined to put their names forward. The few questions being asked betray a misguided effort to further politicize the election, when in actual fact the AC has no legislative role. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 17:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's because those who are generally evenhanded, trustworthy and understanding are also aware that being elected into the ArbCom means devoting your life to it. Unless there were changes made that would streamline the ArbCom, I think people would shy away.. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 17:17, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>If</b>... and only if... I was somehow convinced that ArbCom would be somewhat streamlined and made so that the Arbitrators don't grow grey hairs, then I would consider reentering the ArbCom race. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 17:22, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be nice if the pool of arbitrators was large enough that breaks had minimal effect. For example, if there were 3 panels, each with 5 arbitrators, the ArbCom would be 3x as efficient. If there were 20-25 arbitrators in the pool, a few being on break or otherwise inactive wouldn't cause any harm. Allowing for ample "time-off" might encourage more users to run for ArbCom. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:31, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes indeed these are questions. They might be troubling questions for you that you would rather not want to answer, but nonetheless they are my questions. Here they are again. You may choose not to answer, but I appreciate if you do not remove them. Even though you may think they are worthless rants, I feel I have been abused by you and think to have the right to ask why.</dd>

<dd>You blocked me for one week with no just cause and accused me of using a sockpuppet with no evidence. This is libel and a lie Sir. You also blocked Nosharia’s account assuming he is my stockpuppet. So you wronged two people. I asked you for proof and I ask you again. Where is your proof Sir that Nosharia was my sockpuppet? Just the fact that he agreed with me is enough to convict both of us? If you can’t produce any proof, which certainly you can’t (It is very likely Nosharia posts from a different country than I do and this can be verified by checking our IP numbers) are you willing to acknowledge that you judged hastily and apologize to both of us? Can you overcome your pride and do the right thing? Will you also tell us if you are in the habit to “first shoot and then ask the question” how can you be trusted for the office you are seeking? Before voting for the respected Jtkiefer I suggest he should be investigated more thoroughly. He is the author of many blockings. Are all of them justifiable or are they the result of his abuse of power? Is the honorable Jtkiefer utterly fair-minded or is he motivated by religious and/or political zeal that undermine his capacity to serve as an unbiased arbitrator? I also wrote a complaint against you to Jimbo.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Abuse_of_administrative_power" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Abuse_of_administrative_power" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]Looks like he has no time to read the messages that people write to him.

<dd>A message to other administrators. Our dear Jtkiefer quick to block those whom he think are "bothersome" to him. He might block me indefinately for writing these questions/complaints. Will one of you stand for me and restore my account should he block me again? Remember "evil triumphs when good people do nothing". All dictators became dictators because no one stoped them. This might seem a minor thing but abuse is abuse it it should not be tolerated or it will only increase. Thanks! I hope it is all a misunderstanding and Jtkiefer will be able to clarify everything..<a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> 7, Jan 2006 04:36</dd>

<dd>That's a good question. I'll let someone else answer it. My question is when we vote, will we have to give a reason why we are voting yes/no. Also is the any rules in terms of responses by those we vote for or against and their responses. What I mean, is this going to turn into a free for all having people attack people that vote no against a candidate and give a reason that maybe the person running (or their supporters) don't like.</dd>
