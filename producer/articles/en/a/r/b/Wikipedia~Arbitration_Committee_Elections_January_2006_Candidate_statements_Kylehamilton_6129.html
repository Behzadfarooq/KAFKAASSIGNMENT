<p>1. I don't hold any what I would call strong political or religious I do belive in gay marraige and that the war in Iraq was wrong, but I also look at the war and see the good that were trying to do and if our mission there helps bring Demorcay to there people then I guess our soilders lifes and our money were not spent in vain. I can and Will put aside my views on things and stay neutral.</p>
<p>2. If a ruleing looks unjust to me I would talk to other arbitrators and look into re-addressing that case,</p>
<p>3. Nope as of now I don't view all requests to re-address cases but if I am elected I will read more of them aka all.</p>
<p>4. Yes if people help someone deface articles or edit where they have been told not to then all people involved should be broght up</p>

<li>Proposal 1: Must be an admin to run for ArbCom&#160;: <b>Very Stron Oppose Adminship and Arbitration are differnt and should stay so ones abilty to resolve conflict should not be based on edits. --Kylehamilton 00:23, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
<li>Proposal 2: Block voting&#160;: <b>Nutral</b></li>
<li>Proposal 3: Midyear elections&#160;: <b>Support haveing a large grouping of people for article arbitration is helpful --Kylehamilton 00:25, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
<li>Proposal 4: Expansion to 24 seats&#160;: <b>Strong Support We should look into adding ever more seats, the most commen complaints im hearing about Arbitration is that it takes months to have your case heard we should look into adding a addisional 20 people on top of the proposed 24</b></li>
<li>Proposal 5: Run-off election&#160;: <b>Nutral</b></li>
<li>Proposal 6: Alternates to fill vacancies<b>This one kind of depends on what happens with Proposal 4. If we have a pool of 24 arbiters (as suggested in P4) then having the committee reduced by three or four (or even six or seven) over the course of the year isn't going to be a disaster. This is an excellent idea if the committee isn't enlarged. SIDENOTE: Pureblade and I agreed with TenOfAllTrades he wrote this not myself I just agreed to it</b></li>
<li>Proposal 7: Expansion to 30 seats <b>Weak Support This is a simple concept that would only help speed up the Arbitration process, I like the idea of letting memebers of the arbitration committee sit on more then one case we should also look to adding up to 48 new members to the committee--Kylehamilton 00:31, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
<li>Proposal 8: Condorcet voting <b>Nutral</b></li>
<li>Proposal 9: Three year terms for all <b>Nutral</b></li>
<li>Proposal 10: Nulify all sockpuppet and puppetmaster votes <b>Support this is simpley common sense, good luck trying to enforce this.--Kylehamilton 00:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
<li>Proposal 11: Two year terms for all <b>Nutral</b></li>
<li>Proposal 12: Stay with 12 seats, with optional panels of 3 <b>Strong Oppose there should be around 48 members of the committee and only 3/5/7/9 should view cases, if it has to go to the full committee for some reson it better be good --Kylehamilton 01:06, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:47, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
