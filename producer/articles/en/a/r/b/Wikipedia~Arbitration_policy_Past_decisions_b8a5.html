<p>This page is meant to catalogue all principles passed in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Completed_requests_a893.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Completed requests">cases previously before the arbitration committee</a>. It includes all passed principles and the cases in which they were passed. It also includes decisions made about policy regarding cases (e.g. circumstances under which a case is accepted/rejected).</p>
<p>Note that the Arbitration Committee is not bound by precedent. This is to avoid having to repeat a ruling that may have proved not to be workable. However, some degree of consistency is considered generally desirable.</p>

<p>The Arbitration Committee will tend to <b>accept</b> requests where:</p>
<ul>
<li>most or all earlier steps of dispute resolution have been tried, and failed</li>
<li>the Arbitration Committee believes that earlier steps of dispute resolution are likely to fail</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arbitration Committee will tend to <b>reject</b> requests where:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no specific request, or the Arbitration Committee is unable to determine what the specific request is</li>
<li>a lack of jurisdiction is believed to exist; this usually happens in cases mostly involving the IRC channels, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Foundation_83d9.html" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a> board members, the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a> itself, etc.</li>
<li>earlier steps in dispute resolution have not been tried, and the Arbitration Committee feels they will help</li>
<li>the major disputants all demonstrate willingness to resolve the dispute via other means</li>
<li>the dispute relates mostly to content and not to disputants' behaviour</li>
<li>the Committee feels the grounds for the dispute are invalid or otherwise unworkable</li>
<li>a case is already underway involving the dispute in question (the new requests can often be <b>merged</b> into the old case, and this is usually done under these circumstances)</li>
<li>a previous Arbitration Committee decision covers the dispute and there is no need to update the decision</li>
</ul>
<p>Cases may be summarily <b>closed</b> without decision where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the major disputants all demonstrate willingness to resolve the dispute via other means</li>
<li>one or more of the major disputants cease contributing to Wikipedia (although this does not necessarily have to occur); the case is subject to reactivation if the disputant returns</li>
<li>the major disputants fail to present evidence within a reasonable amount of time of the case opening</li>

Occasional mistakes are entirely compatible with this–administrators are not expected to be perfect–but consistently poor judgement may result in reapplication for adminship via the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">requests for adminship procedure</a> or suspension or revocation of adminship.

<li>Administrators have been granted the power to execute certain commands which ordinary users can not execute. This includes the power to block users, to protect pages, to edit protected pages, and to delete and restore pages. All of these abilities must be used in accordance with policy (the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">page protection</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion</a> policies, respectively), and must never be used to "win" a content dispute.</li>
<li>One aspect of the responsibilities of an administrator is to attempt to prevent disruption to the Wikipedia site and its users. Administrators are authorized to use their best judgment in accordance with accepted principles in order to do this.</li>

<li>Users can be banned and unbanned by the Wikimedia Board, by Jimbo Wales personally, and by the Arbitration Committee.</li>
<li>One of the tools used to effect bans against people is to <i>block</i> a user account suspected of being used by them, which is a specific technical measure that stops the user account from editing; one result of this is that their IP address will be blocked from editing for 24 hours from each time that they attempt to edit with that account.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is inappropriate to remove blocks of well-referenced information which is germane to the subject from articles on the grounds that the information advances a point of view. Wikipedia's NPOV policy contemplates inclusion of all significant points of view.</li>
<li>Wikipedia's neutral point-of-view (NPOV) policy contemplates inclusion of all significant points of view regarding any subject on which there is division of opinion.</li>
<li>Wikipedia articles should contain information regarding the subject of the article; they are not a platform for advocacy regarding one or another point of view regarding the topic. Sweeping generalizations which label the subject of an article as one thing or another are inappropriate and not a substitute for adequate research regarding details of actual positions and actions which can speak for themselves.</li>
<li>Injection of personal viewpoints regarding the subject of an article is inappropriate and not to be resolved by debate among the editors of an article, but referenced from reputable outside resources. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>.</li>

<li>A strong point of view expressed elsewhere on a subject does not necessarily mean POV-pushing editing on Wikipedia; that can only be determined by the edits to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Unexplained deletions of portions of controversial articles are unacceptable.</li>
<li>Aggressive point-of-view editing can produce widespread reactions as editors attempt to combat an outbreak of it, mobilizing others to join the fray. While this creates the appearance of disorder, it is better seen as an attempt to deal with a refractory problem.</li>
<li>The Wikipedia policy of editing from a neutral point of view, a central and non-negotiable principle of Wikipedia, applies to situations where there are conflicting viewpoints and contemplates that significant viewpoints regarding such situations all be included in as fair a manner as possible.</li>
<li>Wikipedia users are usually expected to discuss changes which are controversial; while this does not necessarily mean discussing the edit before making it, if an edit is reverted a user should make an attempt at discussion before changing it back.</li>
<li>Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View policy contemplates including only significant published viewpoints regarding a subject. It does not extend to novel viewpoints developed by Wikipedia editors which have not been independently published in other venues.</li>
<li>When disputing the accuracy or neutrality of an article, users are always expected to give a reason on the article's talk page.</li>
<li>Editors with a national background are encouraged to edit from a Neutral Point of View, presenting the point of view they have knowledge of through their experience and culture without aggressively pushing their particular nationalist point of view by emphasizing it or minimizing or excluding other points of view.</li>
<li>Neutral point of view as defined on Wikipedia contemplates inclusion of all significant perspectives regarding a subject. While majority perspectives may be favored by more detailed coverage, minority perspectives should also receive sufficient coverage.

<ul>
<li>In general, Wikipedia policies are formulated through wide discussion by Wikipedia users who attempt by a process of consensus to make policies which advance the basic goal of creating a free and neutral encyclopedia. Wikipedia policy is discussed in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> and the associated articles <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_create_policy_4959.html" title="Wikipedia:How to create policy">Wikipedia:How to create policy</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>, See <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html#How_are_policies_decided.3F" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines#How_are_policies_decided.3F</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_policy_thinktank_91d8.html" title="Category:Wikipedia policy thinktank">Category:Wikipedia policy thinktank</a>.</li>
<li>In order for a proposed Wikipedia policy to be considered binding it is desirable that the proposal be widely publicized and discussed and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> reached.</li>
<li>In determination of specialized areas of policy, discussion on the talk page of the relevant project page plays a central role. It is important that sufficient interest be generated in the discussion to formulate a valid consensus.</li>
<li>Discussions of proposed policy are sometimes inconclusive or involve only a small group of users, thus questions arise of whether a valid policy has been formulated.</li>
<li>In instances where policy is ambiguous the solution is more discussion, not struggle through revert wars, assumption of bad faith or personal attacks.</li>
<li>Contributors are expected to follow <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_official_policy_9680.html" title="Category:Wikipedia official policy">Wikipedia official policy</a>, particularly the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">three-revert rule</a>, prohibition against <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view policy</a>.

<li>The Arbitration Committee may consider <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-policy_8a81.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-policy">current community norms and practice</a>, regardless of whether the community have got as far as writing up an "official" policy on the matter, in making its decisions.

By the same policy, we are to apply such judgements with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a>, discretion, and an eye to the expectations of the community</li>
<li>Contributors are expected to obey Wikipedia policies, including the three revert rule.</li>
<li>Certain customary practices used on Wikipedia are not written down, but can be ascertained by communication with other users.</li>
<li>Wikipedia users who demonstrate over a period of time that they are unable or unwilling to conform to Wikipedia policy may be banned.</li>

Adding large amounts of material to talk pages which does not relate to the article in the fashion above is considered inappropriate.</li>
<li>Wikipedia provides a variety of forums, including article and user talk pages, for communication by Wikipedia users regarding content of articles and Wikipedia policies and decisions which Wikipedia users are encouraged to use in furtherance of Wikipedia policies and goals.</li>
<li>Aggressive use of Wikipedia forums to mobilize support for point of view editing results in exacerbation of conflict.</li>
<li>The occasional light use of cross-posting to talk pages is part of Wikipedia's common practice. Excessive cross-posting goes against current Wikipedia community norms. In a broader context, it is "unwiki". Wikipedia editors make use of a variety of methods to avoid excessive cross-posting.</li>
<li>It is the practice on Wikipedia when a talk page becomes too long for convenient editing to move older material to archives linked from the main page.</li>
<li>Talk pages may be refactored in order to improve their usability, brief, unbiased summaries of past discussion may be useful, especially for new editors, see <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7ERefactoring_b7de.html" title="Wikipedia:Refactoring">Wikipedia:Refactoring</a>.</li>
<li>When disputing the accuracy or neutrality of an article, users are always expected to give a reason on the article's talk page.</li>
