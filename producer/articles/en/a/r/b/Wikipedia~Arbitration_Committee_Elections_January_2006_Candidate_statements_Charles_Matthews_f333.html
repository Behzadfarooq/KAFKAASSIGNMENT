<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: 51, writer</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: 15 or more; yes, I'll make that commitment</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: I think I've kept <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Steyn_9c12.html" title="Mark Steyn">Mark Steyn</a>, an obvious target for POV edits, in reasonable shape since Ed Poor created it. I don't seek out contentious matters, but neither do I run away from them if they get on my watchlist. (One exception was getting involved with <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a> in a face-off situation.) A recent example that came my way was at <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hilbert_de68.html" title="David Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>. I have done plenty with <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglosphere.html" title="Anglosphere">Anglosphere</a> to keep it informative. I run a major clean-up from <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_Imperial_Japan_4045.html" title="User:Charles Matthews/Imperial Japan">User:Charles Matthews/Imperial Japan</a>.</p>
<p><i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>

<p>You stated "I haven't been quite as active in 2005 as in 2004, for a couple of reasons I won't go into." Fair enough, but could you tell us whether these reasons involve disputes with Wikipedians, or person things unrelated to Wikipedia? Also, in what circumstances would you, if elected, step down before your term is up? – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>)</sup> 15:56, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system? Do you think that the spirit of cooperation in Wikipedia would survive such a change? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 15:52, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've only been here two-and-a-bit years, but it <i>never</i> worked perfectly. No Golden Age - and Jimbo agrees. I'm not for centralising because it's absurd to think anyone could manage the English Wikipedia, for sheer reasons of scale. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 19:42, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll probably end up posing this question to all whose views I don't already know:</p>
<p>What is, in your opinion, the proper use of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>?

<dl>
<dd>What it really says is - we are given discretion round here. We are very much judged by how we use that discretion; that's how the wiki idea works. I don't think it's an admin thing. It says the rules are <i>not more important</i> than taking some personal responsibility within the project. You don't therefore 'invoke' it. You appeal to wiki-experience in sticking your neck out, on occasion. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 18:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A lack of civility narrows the range of likely editors (rudeness is accepted mostly by the young and male) and I would therefore say it is detrimental on the <i>systemic bias</i> side. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 09:22, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a doctorate in mathematics, and around 15 years of rubbing shoulders in that field.

<dd>I have given some answer above already. The ArbCom are 'arbitrators', rather than a judiciary or executive, whatever people may think.

<li>If you were elected and had to spend most of your time in ArbCom deliberations, which projects would you consider to be the most negatively affected by your absence?

<li>The <i>decisions</i> should be transparent; you may mean the <i>process</i>, in which case I think 'public hearings' would not be appropriate.</li>
<li>Admins should not be held to different standards as far as everyday editing is concerned. The <i>sanction</i> of deprivation of admin powers is usefully something the ArbCom can use. I feel currently that it is most appropriate when admin powers have been abused. Clearly admin powers and their abuse is something the ArbCom has to look at, but there is no like-for-like there.</li>
<li>Quite likely that they are not assuming good faith. Why use a word like 'violation'?</li>
<li>If closely and personally involved, I would recuse. I can't define <i>closely</i> in an abstract way. It's always going to be case-by-case. I've edited thousands of articles, and come across hundreds of Wikipedians. I'm not going to tie my hands on this.</li>
<li>Jimbo can review them, no? You want an appeal court? If the trend to legalism prevails, it will do WP no good, even if it looks like a tidy constitution on paper. <i>Wiki does not work on the basis of rights</i>; wiki is a system of permissions, from which a co-operative community can arise. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 19:11, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If I didn't have confidence in people's ability to draw their own conclusions, and their good sense, I wouldn't stand in elections here. Try a spell-checker, if you are going to paste something all around the site; it shows some basic respect. And don't use policy as a cudgel. Of course the community should have a mechanism for removing any powers, at a pinch, but petitions are not a sound way. What you suggest is wide open to obvious abuse and demagogy, and could do huge damage to WP. And people should leave their <i>political or religious viewpoint</i> at the door here; not be probed about it once they are in. I think those who use these polarizing tactics on Wikipedians are destructive. I reject the whole business of putting Wikipedians on a left-right or any other spectrum.

<dd>I agree with James. The ArbCom has a primary duty, and that is to protect the good work that goes on daily, in every time zone it seems, of building an awesome encyclopedic resource for all online folk. Our community is actually quite robust, but in the end the ArbCom does have to ban people (which simply means they can no longer edit the English Wikipedia). It can be best for everybody, or just for the thousands of good editors.

There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace?

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006?

<p>I think I might have been spared the <i>interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern</i>. Yes, there is an issue. But the ArbCom is not legislative, does not set policy, and only polices policy in the sense that when people bring cases the background is policy. I'm putting myself forward as an experienced Wikipedian who understands the editing process and the people issues. Not as someone who has a full policy platform for the English Wikipedia. I would never claim to have all the answers. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 21:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the phrase <i>interpretating the interpretation</i> was an unfortunate grammar error. Thanks for your prompt and frank response. So you don't think that the arbitrators' work involves providing guidance, in the form of statements of principle that guide the interpretation of the fact in a case, on the values and policies of the encyclopedia project? Suppose you were an arbitrator in a case in which one of the parties proposed the following principle in a workshop, what would be your comment on it?</dd>

<p>I find CM's response to Tony's orginal question a little bit strange: I recall that ArbCom precedents are explicitly regarded as having force. I can understand many ArbCom members wanting to avoid general pronouncements, but to try to claim that ArbCom has nothing to do with making policy seems naive. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 22:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have twice above given my comments on precedent. I certainly don't think what the ArbCom has done in the past should necessarily be done in the future.</dd>

<dd>Otherwise, I'm getting a little puzzled as to the exact question here. <i>So you don't think that the arbitrators' work involves providing guidance, in the form of statements of principle that guide the interpretation of the fact in a case, on the values and policies of the encyclopedia project?</i> This is about 'WP is an encyclopedia', with a link to Jimbo's talk page about an AfD closure. An ArbCom decision of today. OK, maybe what <i>I think</i> is that such things are mostly like <i><a href="../../../o/b/i/Obiter_dicta.html" title="Obiter dicta">obiter dicta</a></i> as in a legal case. They may well come up in discussion, and be aired. Elect a new ArbCom and they can't be binding principles on the arbitrators. But I'm still not really comfortable with this. Of course if you want to say 'disruptive behaviour', which is the main remit of the ArbCom, you need to be able to answer 'disrupting what?'</dd>

<p>Sorry if I seem to be giving you a hard time. I voted for you and I think you'll make a fine arbitrator, whatever your answers here. Nevertheless as a participant in this election I would like to know what the candidates think of what another prominent candidate in a conversation with me recently referred to as "the elephant in the room." Partly because such decisions aren't binding on the committee (the committee is supposed to learn through experience) I'd like to be sure I know where incoming members of the committee stand. Whether or not they continue to uphold the principle that the community is subsidiary to the encyclopedia, I'd like them to know what is expected of them, and in turn I'd like to be sure that they're prepared to hold the line and support the encyclopedia, in the pinch, against the community. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:35, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
