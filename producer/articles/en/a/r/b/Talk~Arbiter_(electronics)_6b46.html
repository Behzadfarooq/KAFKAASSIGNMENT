<p>This article claims:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Yet metastability is an inevitable consequence of quantum indeterminacy, since if the inputs to an arbiter (flip flop) arrive almost simultaneosly the cicuit most likely will traverse a point of metastability.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Can you provide references to laboratory experiments that demonstrate this, by ruling out the non-quantum-mechanical explanations? For example, <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_bounce.html" title="Ground bounce">ground bounce</a> is currently taught by EE schools as one of the many causes of metastability, and quantum is not typically mentioned. Are there texts which explicitly develop this claim in a testable, verifiable fashion? <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 23:38, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_bounce.html" title="Ground bounce">Ground bounce</a> is not generally thought to be the cause of metastability in arbiters. There are published articles on metastability in arbiters that trace it back to quantum physics.--Carl Hewitt 23:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you provide references? None of the references provided in the current article even use the word "quantum". I have the luxury of being able to talk to people who work in this business. They rather question the applicability of the qantum explanation. We discussed a certain proprietary clock circuit that operates at frequencies well beyond what is currently available for chip clocks; fundamental to its design is is the fact that its driven into a curious "permanently metastable" state, with the actual clock phases pulled off in a very novel and unique fashion. It seems that a purely classical model of the circuit is able to adequtely model the fabricated devices, with regards to oxide thickness, doping, etc. Given that a leading-edge, state-of-the-art circuit designer who builds metastable circuits intentionally does not beleive in any quantum explanation for the circuit ... makes me wonder about the claims made in this article. I'd like to see some actual lab proof, as opposed to theoretical arguments. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:00, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mean, this is kind of important. If I can fabricate quantum logic at ordinary fabs using ordinary design rules, and build circuits that stay in quantum states for very long periods of time, this would have a huge and broad set of implications for people who are trying to do quantum computing. Under current technology, it is very hard to build systems which hang in an true quantum state without having the wave-function collapse. Having the ability to use ordinary fab techniques would change the state of the art. I'd really like to investigate more; this would be very exciting if there was anything to it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:07, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The indeterminate states that we are talking about here are <i>not</i> qubits so they can't be used for that kind of computing. There have been some experiments done to see how long an arbiter can be maintained in a metastable state. I am not sure what the current record is but I believe that for a well designed arbiter above room temperature that it is not a very large number of times longer than the time it takes an inverter to operate. So I would be very curious about a "permanently metastable" state for such an arbiter. Of course a well designed arbiter is supposed to exit a metastable state as rapidly as possible.--Carl Hewitt 01:47, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Appearently, publc talks were given so its not confidential. Its a ring of 5 or 7 or 11 gates hooked up so that it oscillates at a frequency slightly above the switching time for a single gate. The magic is that there are interconects running across the ring, e.g. some gates are skipped, the result is that subsequent stages are being driven to invert even as the driving stage hasn't switched itself. Sort of like a polynomial decoder, but with more feedback, hooked up to be free-running. The ring itself just sort of floats, the clocks are reconstructed off of it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:27, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I asked a similar question in regard to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy_in_computation.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy in computation">quantum indeterminacy in computation</a>. I find the claim that <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metastability.html" title="Metastability">metastability</a> is a quantum mechanical effect puzzling, and I gave a reference in which this claim is disputed.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 20:02, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you refute the claim there, but still don't cite anything in support. If they're not qubits, what are they? What exactly, is decohering? How does one make a lab test, so as to distinguish a quantum effect from some other effect? <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:41, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are dealing with entangled quantum states (that happen not to be qubits) that are decohering. Lab experiments are done in the standard way and they clearly show metastability. What exactly is your question about these experiments?--Carl Hewitt 05:23, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a system has entangled states, then, if one is clever, one may construct qubits from them. The only difference between qubits and entangled states is that the former were designed to specifically be easy to manipulate and control. If a system exhibits entangled states, I'm pretty sure someone somewhere has attempted to use it to build qubits. Of course, with only variable success.</dd>
