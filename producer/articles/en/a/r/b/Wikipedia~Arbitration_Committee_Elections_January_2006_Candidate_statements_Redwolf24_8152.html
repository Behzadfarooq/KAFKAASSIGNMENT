<p>I myself would like to lend a helping hand to the endevours of the arbcom. Some of my positions? I hate trolls, yet at the same time I believe in criminal rights. I strongly believe in such organizations as <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">WP:AMA</a>. As can be seen from my work at <a href="../../../m/c/_/WP%7EMC_8667.html" title="WP:MC">the medcom</a>, I often take out time of my own to reorganize stuff and make sure everyone's doing what they should be. I'd check the RfAr page often, voting on every case I could manage. I see a lot of cases only get the attention of maybe four members. Do we want four people deciding things that can potentially affect the whole project? The more the merrier, much like we should never close <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a>'s where only two people voted, and RfA's with 4 supports and no other votes. I had told a good friend of mine here I wasn't going to run for arbcom, but after my friends pushed me, I gained interest. I'd like to lend a helping hand. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 02:43, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps its worth noting that my proudest contribution is the reactivation of the medcom. Its also worth noting that I pulled out of the race after the events <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Admin_User:Redwolf24" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">here</a> thinking I didn't have a shot.

<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: I am 15, as most people know, which may cost me some votes. I am enrolled in the standard subjects, Math English Science History Gym. I took the S.A.T's at age 12 and got a 1300(/1600) if you want to test my brain...</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: I'm sure I'll spend a lot of time being one, but I already spend a lot of time on the wiki, it'd be a piece of cake, I have the time as I already spend 5 hours+ a day on the wiki. So unless you need more than 300 hours, I think I can handle it.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: As 172 has said, article editing is not my top priority. I have 20 to 30% of my edits there. However I am an exception: I am a mediator, in fact the chair of the medcom. I don't know how I could be a mediator if I couldn't place myself in the shoes of others. That should be the number 1 skill of the arbcom, the ability to place one's self in another's shoes.</p>
<p><i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>
<p>A: none, just Redwolf24.</p>

<p><i>Q: Why do some people seriously think you are "Willie on Wheels"? If you are not then why did you take their accusations so seriously? If push came to shove, how could you prove to us that you are not Willie on Wheels?</i><a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShelburne_Kismaayo_9407.html" title="User:Shelburne Kismaayo">Shelburne Kismaayo</a> 23:47, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A: no one really thought I was WoW, they just found my jokes suspicious. Some of them thought it immature and disrupting, which I disagree with, at least for the disrupting part. As for proving I'm not WoW, I can't think of a way to do that, but I think everyone knows I'm <i>not</i> Willy on Wheels, who has been here since 04 I believe, and I have been here since April. Why does this matter? Because I've been docked points for being too new. I could have registered an account a long time ago if I knew wiki existed. Willy is my senior, and I wish I even knew about the wiki back when Willy was around, it would have been fun to block the first one&#160;;-) <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 00:07, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>At fifteen, and with six months experience, you seem, at least superficially, less qualified than many for a seat on the committee.

<dd>Let's put it this way... its not time spent in days, its time spent in HOURS. If you've been here since 2003, and you spend an hour a week, then people who don't bother to research at all will say you're a better candidate. However there's me, and I spend hours every day on this site. I've read all the policies and most of the pages in the Wikipedia namespace. Anything I have to do as an arbitrator I have been doing as the medcom chair. Analyze evidence? Yup, have to, to make sure the RfM is legit. Know what cases to accept and which to reject? Again, yes. As a mediator (rather than the chair) I have to be able to communicate, remain cool, and put myself in people's shoes. And as for age, that shouldn't matter... Wikipedia is a utopia of all races sexes religions and ages living as equals, and in fact I never had to say my age, but I don't think the community will specifically care about age. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 22:39, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>The problem as I see it is that, if elected, you could be artitrating detailed, technical edit disputes amongst experts in their field. You would do this without any knowledge of how the article-editing process works, or of how disputes editing articles usually get resolved. Without that it's easy to perceive very small issues as big, or to miss the whole point of the dispute entirely. Your age means a lack of life experience, which just helps. The older you get the more arguments you see, your impression changes as you see some things dealt with better than others. Your perspective changes from the immediate to the longer term - which is important, as most editors going to ArbCom now are good editors making far more constructive edits to Wikipedia than your edit history shows you have ever done. The other problem your lack of article edits gives is that we cannot see how you would deal with a dispute yourself so have no real idea of how you'd react in given cases, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 06:33, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The other side of the coin regarding the qualifications of some of our young candidates is that the kind of 15-year-olds that spend their free time involving themselves in a worthy community project like Wikipedia demonstrate themselves to be the promising leaders of their generation. I find it highly commendable that they already are seeking to serve in leadership roles. Good for them, and hopefully the Arbcom will include a cross-section that is representative of ALL our editors, including our younger diligent contributors. The young perspective is important too. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 00:02, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The following questions are for each candidate, and do not specifically target you</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Do you hold any strong political or religious opinions (e.g. concerning George Bush, Islam, or on which end you should break a boiled egg)? If so, would you recuse yourself from cases centred on these?</i></p>
<p><i>How willing are you to contest the decisions of other arbitrators rather than just "go with the flow"?</i></p>
<p><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i></p>
<p><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them. Do you support this decision? [if current arbitrator] Does your visible behaviour on recent cases reflect this decision?</i></p>

<dd>I am apolitical, in the manner that I know about politics, but I choose to not associate myself with either of the major parties, or any minor parties. It's ridiculous the only people that can get power are those who have to be completely right or left to get a party's support. America is not Black or White in politics, most of us are grey, but our leaders must be on a polar end. I'm not biased for these reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would not go with the flow nor head-on contest other arbitrators. The first guy has to read all evidence, and I would read all evidence even if we had 3/0/0 on an issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The third question has such an obvious answer it only looks as if it is your personal opinion that arbitrators do this, which I strongly doubt as they're good people. If they do (unlikely, more likely a POV) then we should change that.</dd>

<dd>All parties can be investigated, and should be.

<p>As you probably are already aware, your age may be an issue to a lot of people. I am one of those people.</p>
<p>My particular concern is that, at your age, you are unlikely to have a broad grounding in the general background knowledge of (what passes for?) our culture. This potentially opens the door for others, possibly including fellow arbitrators, to foist their particular agendas upon you.</p>
<p>In light of my concerns about this, which I suspect others may share, how would you deal with conflicts that might be brought before you as an arbitrator on subjects about which you do not have good background knowledge? How would you keep yourself from just relying on the information supplied by another arbitrator or another person, information that might be biased?</p>

<p>At your age, you are unlikely to have a broad grounding in the general background knowledge of (what passes for?) of Zulu culture. You probably also have little grounding in Eskimo law, or Micronesian coming of age ritual.

<p>And for a perhaps more satisfying answer to Marsden - I've said this sooo many times, but I can say it again. I'm a mediator, and the chair of the medcom at that. As the medcom chair, I have leaps and bounds more experience in the dispute resolution process than your average Joe. Arbcom is about dispute resolution, not punitive matters anyway. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Seattle3_b4f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Seattle3"><font color="gray">Attention Washingtonians!</font></a> 05:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Medcom is the only one there that is an actual job, really. AFD is something I do when I have nothing else to do, I only weigh in at AN when I feel it's important, and nominating RfA's is just my way of trying to get all the admins we can.
