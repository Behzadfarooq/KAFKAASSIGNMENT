	    <p>Q: Given the less than pleasant results of last year's endorsements/disendorsements page, why are we doing this again? I don't think another long list of who likes who and who doesn't like who is really going to make wikipedia a better place, and I'm not sure voting should be done based on what third parties think of the candidate anyway. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 08:22, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree entirely, but I also don't think it's worth the crapfight that occurred last year over whether or whether not to have a disendorsements page. I simply hope others will join me in refraining from making the process nasty by disendorsing anyone. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:55, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I propose that we used unordered lists (<b>*</b>s) instead of numbered lists (<b>#</b>s). The whole point of the endorsement is to present reasons why a candidate would/would not be a good arbitrator. Counting the number of endorsements could always been done by the reader, but there should be less of a focus on quantity of endorsements. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:47, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are two points to this page: (1) if we tried to remove it, it would only come back and there would be lots of arguments as to its existence - and the hassle isn't worth it; (2) it gives users an opportunity to draw attention to the merits of a candidacy. Where someone writes "I like X", and offers no further comment, or "I hate X", and no further comment, it will not sway me. If someone instead points to evidence of things that may make someone a good or a bad Arb, or that we would be taking a risk with someone as an Arb, then I find that useful, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 17:07, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, it's far better to keep this page up than to take it down and hear months of complaints. It's also acts as a centralized forum to discuss the merits of various candidates. Although perhaps not in direct response to my comment, your points do seem to support my proposal to not use numbered lists. Is there a reason to quantify the endorsements of candidates? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:42, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been bold and changed the numbered list to a bulleted list since nobody seemed to object, it also makes more sense this way since even though it may look like an RFA these are not votes only opinion and having people count the numbers for or against the canidates would be detrimental to the process. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 22:28, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems candidacies have gotten underway without any official signal this time. This has undermined efforts at laying ground rules to prevent the problems that broke out over the endorsements last time. Still, I think it would be best to tell people that such comments (pro or con) should be posted in the user namespace, and no more than linked to here. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 02:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like this whole page to be abolished...because it creates so much animosity. Personally, I'm not going to "Oppose" anyone on this page, and I urge others to do the same. This creates the anger that we saw last year. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST"><font color="blue">W<sub>S</sub></font></a> 02:42, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like that the discussion is going on on a centralized page as opposed to having to go to all the users' talk pages. The latter would make voting for most people similar to voting for court judges; there is barely any centralized information availiable. — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="color:gray;">Ilγαηερ</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="color: #333333;">(Tαlκ)</span></a> 02:57, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People can certainly discuss with the candidates to learn their views, and I would strongly encourage the candidates to dedicate a page to this purpose. But a page for endorsements is not the same as a page for discussion, as the animosity that resulted last time shows. Knowing how other people plan to vote is not a discussion, and mostly it seems to facilitate either sheep "voting" or piling on. Why not set things up in a way so that real discussion can actually happen? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:04, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd support that but I'd prefer if the instructions were changed from endorsements to only encompass questions or comments directly to each canidate that way people don't flame war each other's talk pages in the name of endorsements, secondly I know it's unusual but I think it might be better if the page was deleted and noted on <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_3e6f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005">Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005</a> since there are already comments here that aren't entirely helpful to the process and since this page has been considered a bad idea since the get go it doesn't really need to be archived for all time. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 03:20, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe I'm being a bit stupid, or maybe I just haven't had time to read all the pages from start to finish. I stumbled across this project page (the page related to this talk page, not the talk page itself) last night. When I came back to it today, it had closed, and was replaced by a page where you can ask questions. How can people be elected if there's no possibility of voting for them? You can't get elected through questions, surely. (And I hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting to the talk page after the project page has been closed.)

<dd>Anne - this is not an elections page (the election will be conducted in december using the boardvote software Tim Starling wrote). This page was for endorsements and disendorsements - basically saying who you think would or would not make a good arbitrator. We had one last year and it was a disaster of unmitigated proportions, so the people who commented on this page decided (wisely) to do away with the practice for this year. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 19:34, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is to avoid last years bickering (and worse), not just to split it into per-candidate pages. If there are any points or statements you want to make can't you make them without the endorse/disendorse format? If you just write your piece under your statement it'll be there for all to read without there being anyone you're disagreeing or arguing with, just plain your views and plans. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 13:42, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
