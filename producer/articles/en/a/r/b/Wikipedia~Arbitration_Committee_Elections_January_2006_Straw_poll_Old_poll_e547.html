<p><br />
By the end of 2005, several seats on the Arbitration Committee will become vacant, and a number of candidates have stepped forward to fill them. Last year, a public election was held to make a selection from the candidates. This year, Jimbo has announced that he will appoint candidates directly.</p>
<p>There has been little community reaction to the change so far. Hence, this straw poll has been put together to gauge public opinion. Needless to say this poll is not official or binding in any way whatsoever. It is simply a measurement.</p>

<li>I'd like to see some strong evidence that any appointment-based system is likely to either a) produce a better set of arbiters, or b) produce more community support for them. In the absence of such, I'm presumptively in favour of some elective element. Reform of the process I'm certain there's scope for. And given the current burnout rate, it's not like JW won't get to make plenty of appointments anyway. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:51, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think in general an appointment system is a bad idea if only because they do not usually withstand the test of time. Minupla 03:16, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe, unequivocally, that elections should be held at periodic intervals to install (with set – twice/annually? – terms) and or remove ArbComm members. With authority comes responsibility, and votes dually incite and empower Wikipedians: votes will allow for the installation of members who have perhaps demonstrated meritorious service/judgement on Wp and to ensure true accountability if things somehow go awry. E Pluribus Anthony 06:15, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Besides: Jimbo/the board merely need to certify Wp votes, thereby freeing them up to focus on matters of greater importance and not details. E Pluribus Anthony 23:09, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>IIRC the 2004 elections were "advisory" elections, so if an unacceptable candidate were elected, or if there were evidence of sockpuppet abuse or other mischief, Jimbo or the Board could simply refuse to seat the candidate. Both can also remove an arbitrator or even disband the Committee. Thus, we already have ways to protect the community from rogue arbitrators. If the purpose of an appointment-based election system is to reduce the rancor and community tensions that surrounded the 2004 elections, that won't work either. It'll just fuel accusations of cabalism. We need to make the Arbcom election process less contentious, but I don't think an appointment system is the way to go. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak">Szyslak</a> (<a href="../../../s/z/y/Image%7ESzyslak_sig.png_93cc.html" class="image" title="Image:Szyslak sig.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/3/37/Szyslak_sig.png" alt="Image:Szyslak sig.png" width="42" height="15" longdesc="../../../s/z/y/Image%7ESzyslak_sig.png_93cc.html" /></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">+e</font></a> ]</small>) 07:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I prefer a mixture of an election combined with Jimbo weeding out anyone he considers to be unsuited for the position. I agree with others that we need to avoid the appearance of a cabal.

<li>The ArbCom needs the support of the community to enable it to function properly. We've already seen the problems and resentment caused by the appointment of people to the ArbCom (however necessary that may have been). Obviously, the best way that the community's support can be shown is through elections. --<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutter_c4c0.html" title="User:Grutter">G Rutter</a> 12:15, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see what could be wrong with having a democratically elected arbcom... Doesn't the Board have the power to weed out any elected arbitrator they deem unsuitable anyway?

<li>Traditionally disputes between the king and his people are resolved by the king appointing some ministers, the people electing others. Is wiki an absolute monarchy, a constitutional monachy, or a republic? There must be some sort of election so that editors can express their views. Most likely compromise would be both electors and monarch holding a veto on any appointments. Though judging from comments above, that is the case already.

<li>I support Jimbo on this, for a number of reasons. The last election was, IMO, a disaster, both in terms of the acrimony it provoked and in the outcome it generated. Reviewing the candidates that have put themselves forward this year, it seems to me that many of them misunderstand the role of the AC. The kneejerk "but we want to be free" response this has provoked (see the support votes above) does not recognize that Wikipedia is not a democracy, nor does it recognize that the AC is not a general means of governance. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., [[User_talk:UninvitedCompany|Inc.]] 19:30, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>Comment</i>: Nor is Wikipedia a despotic regime (perhaps an enlightened one?): if the ArbComm is not a general means of governance (analogous to a jurisdiction's judicial branch) – one of last resort – then Wp users should not utilise it or respect it to arbitrate on matters of multiparty concern. Different jurisdictions dually elect and appoint judges. Mine is not a position asserting user freedom <i>per se</i>: an elected vote has as much to do with accountability, legitimacy, and propriety. And nothing precludes a melange of systems: a vote whose results are later approved by Jimbo or the board seems reasonable, or vice versa.

And experts (ArbCom members) will have a say, as will community. 3) <i>followed by confirmation votes from the community requiring some supermajority.</i> - so there will be a vote, allowing for a democratic way to block an appointment.

<li>I think Mr. Wales is the appropriate person to choose the members of the Arbitration Committee. He brings a point of view solely in the best interests of Wikipedia and its contributors. As Chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation Inc., when the media or other institutions wish to discuss Wikipedia process, content or any other relative topic, it is Mr. Wales that they will ask to respond. In addition to such questioners, as a fellow of the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkman_Center_for_Internet_and_Society_cdcd.html" title="Berkman Center for Internet and Society">Berkman Center for Internet and Society</a> at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_School_e417.html" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School</a>, he undoubtedly could be questioned as to the Arbitration process and how the conduct of Arbitration Committee members affects Wikipedia all-important content. Mr. Wales must not be put in the uncomfortable position of having to respond to the media etc. by saying: "The community voted for them so I can do nothing," or then being placed in the position of having to remove an "elected" member of the Committee. Because it is the editors of Wikipedia who now bear the costs for keeping the project going, then Mr. Wales suggestion of a radification vote makes sense because that then provides the community with a way to consider the fitness of any appointment they are not comfortable with. - <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">Ted Wilkes</a> 20:29, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My own 2-cents-worth plan: A large "arbitration pool", consisting of admins who are willing to be part of the process. (The only reason I'm specifying admins is to have some minimal qualification). When a case is accepted for arbitration (and that should be a a totally separate body, perhaps voted in by the arb pool members), arbitrators are randomly picked from the pool (recusing themselves if necessary) until a minyan is achieved; we can add niceties like "all parties to an arbitration can pre-emptively challenge a set number of choices". If the pool is large enough, no single arbitrator will do more than a few cases; "arbitration" will just be something you sometimes do, as opposed to a long-term obligation; there can be no "cabal", because there's no guarantee anyone will ever get to arbitrate any particular case. In other words: it's kinda like being picked for jury duty. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 22:37, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I get the need to have community input, but this is not a democracy, never has been. I suppose I tend toward Jimbo's side when he says: <i>One problem is best highlighted, in my view, by the non-election of JamesF, despite being to my knowledge universally acknowledged as an excellent arbitrator, tending to the thoughtful and helpful middle ground on matters of importance, and hard working. The reason for him not being elected was not, as far as I can see, any dissatisfaction with his work in the arbcom, but rather a <b>lack of political fame</b> due in part to his quiet way of <b>getting the job done in arbcom</b> while (mostly, and perhaps unfortunately) giving up most editing. <b>Arbcom is a judicial position, not a popularity contest</b>, and so elections are only a very rough stab at trying to get the right qualities and broad community support. Useful, of course, but by no means dispositive.</i>(emphasis added) I know it's bad to make policy on one example, but the overall idea is correct. We would have the same people being Admins, BCrats, MedCom, ArbCom, etc. with a small cabal easily forming. I would like to see <i>some</i> community input, but overall, what would be the purpose of another popularity contest? --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 19:36, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It seems to me that there's a bigger issue here. There is a call for elections, in a format unknown, with no certainty that the election will actually happen, and no certainty that the results will be honored (or ignored). The ambiguity is caused by a bigger issue -- which can be summed up as <i>who's running this</i>? As a relative outsider looking in, this does appear to be a symptom of a meta-issue. As Jimbo Wales, and the people who helped start Wikipedia and the Foundation, are inexorably moving further away from the day-to-day operations of a rapidly-growing organization, the question of who actually should be in charge of operations grows larger. If this is Jimbo Wales' personal "turf" (for lack of a better term at the moment), then an election is spurious. If this is under the control of the Foundation, then Jimbo is out of order in dictating terms of the election (and I realize that sounds a bit shocking but that's what logic dictates). And if this is neither controlled by Jimbo nor the Foundation, then who's got the right to set the rules of this election? I would strongly recommend figuring out the bigger issue first. There may or may not be a Cabal, but someone has to decide who's running this show before you can vote (or not vote) for any level of officer. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobster2001_8b3b.html" title="User:Robster2001">Robster2001</a> 23:30, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is no point in gauging what people think if they haven't <i>thought</i> yet. That is why polls are evil. They stifle discussion, by encouraging us to sign our name next to a number, quarantined in its own little section with identically-minded signatures. There is no incentive to discuss, no accountability. My well reasoned argument makes the tally go up one, just like someone else's "~~~~" does, and we're even. Why should anyone challenge me? Why should I respond? What's the difference if nothing I say affects the <i>vote</i> tally?

<dd>The idea here is consensus. Always (by here I mean Wikipedia). So, sure, people may have thoughts, but more broadly, Wikipedia hasn't thought about it. There has been no consensus attempt, no discussion with the goal of consensus in mind at all. Polls are absolutely antithetical to consensus-gathering (and the whole idea of them is after you have a rough consensus proposal, if at all). If a poll like this did lead to guiding policy, it would be unfortunate, as anyone who thinks <i>this</i> is a good way to achieve discussion and consensus has serious misconceptions about what those two things are. We should not be limited to two choices, and have our discussion curtailed. Almost nothing on Wikipedia is a boolean decision. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:23, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>While I also agree in not necessarily being limited by two choices, we otherwise agree to disagree. The fact that Wp, Jimbo, the Board, etc., have had to periodically address or (propose) intervening in ArbComm member selection implies that Wikipedians (up-top <i>and</i> down below) need to think <i>more</i> about this and that before arriving at a decision or identifying a consensus.

<li>Polls are not evil. Discussion and attempts to build consensus are helpful, but having a poll is also a helpful way to get a <i>sense</i> of how different opinions are represented, numberwise. For example, if five vocal users support an idea, and 18 less vocal users oppose it, the fact that one side has a clear majority is more obvious with a poll than with trying to sort out lines upon lines of discussion. A poll is simply an easy way of saying "Ok, so who and how many people support this idea, and who is opposed to it?". Ideally, we can have both polls and quality discussion to go with them. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 05:44, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
