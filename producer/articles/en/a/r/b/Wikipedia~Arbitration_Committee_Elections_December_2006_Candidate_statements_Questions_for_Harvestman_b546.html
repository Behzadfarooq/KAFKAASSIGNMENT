<p>1. Express in a short paragraph, using any particular issue/incident that you feel strongly about (or lack thereof) in the past, on why editors must understand the importance of the ArbCom elections and making wise, informed decisions when they vote.</p>
<p>2. Imagine. Say Jimbo grants you the authority to make, or abolish one policy with immediate and permanent effect, assuming no other limitations, no questions asked. What would that be?</p>
<p>3. It is expected that some successful candidates will receive <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7ECheckuser_1b24.html" title="Wikipedia:Checkuser">checkuser</a> and <a href="../../../o/v/e/Wikipedia%7EOversight_b3cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Oversight">oversight</a> privileges. Have you read and understood foundation policies regulating these privileges, and able to help out fellow Wikipedians on avenues (e.g. <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>) in a timely manner should you be granted either or both of them?</p>
<p>4. What is integrity, accountability and transparency to you on the ArbCom?</p>
<p>5. Humour, a tradition of Wikipedian culture, has seen through several controversies in recent history. This is including but not limited to <a href="../../../%29/_/_/WP%7E%29_085b.html" title="WP:)">bad jokes and other deleted nonsense</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> policies/essays, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fools%27_Day_4e24.html" title="April Fools' Day">April Fools' Day</a>, <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">whole userpages</a>, <a href="../../../u/b/x/WP%7EUBX_b286.html" title="WP:UBX">userboxes</a>... Do you think that they are all just harmless fun, or that they are all nonsense that must go?</p>

<p>Hello! I'm glad to receive your questions. I shall answer thoroughly and expect that the process won't seem too long to you all. Welcome and go on asking! Harvestman&#160;: -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

I shall not pretend that I’m a newcomer, but some issues I missed. I’ve been involved in Afd because such cases spring at random pages&#160;; I ignored the Mediation and Arbitration methods here until I saw a post the day before. I’ll state my interest in ArbCom at the end.</p>

<p>This is quite normal. The umpire has rights to enforce the rules. I’ve been a boy scout and I liked it&#160;: just play the game. Now a probation period for newly appointed ones, why not&#160;?</p>

<p>They shall if and when they perceive that our organisation needs an ArbCom. The newcomer ignores everything and information is too much sparse, this is my own experience. Those wo encountered real problems know that they need strong support.</p>

<p>As an IT consultant, my job includes software testing. I proposed a <i>six months ban on new policies</i> (<a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">WP:VPP</a>, Oct. 27): you only can verify what’s clearly stated&#160;; too much policies equals too much mistakes from everyone and advantages for trolls.</p>

<p>No. Policies are made by people. Disputes about policies are now seen by the ArbCom&#160;: what else&#160;? But I'll say more below.</p>

<p>I’m glad to meet that question, Diablo. Look what happens here vs. what happened when the first encyclopedia was published. Did not Diderot and d’Alembert ... have fun ... allow their anti power, anti clerical, pro science and freedom POV&#160;? But this is not the point here in WP.</p>
<p>I am sure that WP is childlike, not only young, but dedicated to&#160;: "TV series, music, films, sports, ..." every kind of fandom for which a subtler touch should be largely enough in a plain good old ‘pedia&#160;?</p>
<p>I shall stick to the point "no original research, no POV" as long as I stay here. But people need first to express themselves even when they believe that they are talking serious subjects belonging a ‘pedia. Where do they go&#160;: Village pump straight, discussing policies&#160;; and Ref Desk - which I tried also&#160;: there you have plenty of original research and fun.</p>
<p>The concerns about humour are true. I think that humour is necessary. Children learn better where they play and laugh. Teaching, learning to teach, delivering knowledge to the world won’t stop those needs. As usual, too much implies regulation.</p>

<p>I learned this, John Read, on a page that you recommended&#160;:"The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to commercial sites collecting personal information from children under 13 years of age." Why did lawyers think about that one and elected guys choose to enforce it&#160;: one could imagine that it is to protect commercial sites from complaints, while telling that children are better protected. I’m not far because I saw such laws that tell one thing only.</p>
<p>So does WP need to enforce a similar, but inner law&#160;? It should be more to protect itself against lawyers, and I hope that the foundation knows better about that. I’m not telling here that there may not be problems for children&#160;; I expect that their parents and the state do their job.</p>
<p>Yes, WP looks like real life and children play on the Internet as much as they can. WP is also a mirror of our visions of ourselves, our world, our desires.</p>
<p>The problem arises when WP gains visibility&#160;: imprudent children’s visibility grows too. Is this your concern&#160;? I wonder what do academics say about that and I think that it would be the first step. Cite sources, statistics. Go ahead and tell, then any proposition should be welcome. Did nobody tell you that&#160;?</p>
<p>If Wpians create too much policies, a considerable amount of energy shall be wasted trying to enforce them. And this shall bring more trolls and wars. Something other than an ArbCom shall be created to rule about policies conflicts and so on&#160;: that’s a current process amongst communities. As a Wpian, I’m for less policies and stricter rules&#160;; as an ArbCom candidate, I make a prayer. -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

<p>Hi! All your rhetorical and standard questions give me an occasion to expose what I understood about WP goals. I am not always 100% okay but as long as I’m here I’ll stick to them.</p>
<p>"Write what you know and what you want but without your own point of view." - But scientific views are a point of view by themselves&#160;?</p>
<p>There are no rules&#160;: there is no truth. But "Cite sources". Scientific man number one writes this there. Scientific man number two writes another thing elsewhere. Most of times they are in perfect scientific harmony. Sciman three writes quite another thing&#160;: all that belongs here in WP, together with academic or journalist critique. Now bad considered man four tells things that most of the community - or law - supports less. This belongs in its own place here, but does not need to be spread everywhere.</p>
<p>One can imagine a world where Einstein’s views and discoveries have withered, and La Rouche’s ones made the whole context for our lives. Why not&#160;? But this is definitely not the case in the real world&#160;; and WP is not a place for persuasion, rather for flat observations of the state of our commonly accepted knowledge. It is a really poor point of view, but it is honest and helps others to start and refine theirs.</p>
<p>Historians have their word to&#160;: but who makes history&#160;? Only time, not any government’s, less any saddened man’s POV. One of the hardest goals of WP is trying to reflect the world as it changes. Wars exist in the real world, they have to stop first thing here. How to deal with that&#160;? A bad considered government or organization, even a terrorist one, sees its world that way. It must be told here&#160;; with citations&#160;; and surrounded by other points of view, with citations&#160;; and only once, not in every page related by any feeble link.</p>
<p>Is it too hard to tell that the Adriatic coast is beloved for its scenery and fishing possibilities without resorting to Balkan wars&#160;?</p>

<p>I hate the average science discourse because it uses perfectly its own jargon (the same thing for WP jargon, by the way) and makes it perfectly unscrutinizable by the average reader. There is a difference between what I learned, discovered and use in mathematics and what’s written now - even here. Ask the editors some clearliness&#160;: - No sir, its perfectly clear as it is&#160;; it is standard and approved by the community.</p>
<p>This is just an example (our <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition.html" title="Addition">addition</a> article is not so bad) where, without resorting to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_english.html" title="Simple english">simple english</a>, I’d like to see levels defined and used here&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>This page or section is talking about sums and differences and plain man recipes to catch them, their meaning and common use.</li>
<li>That page or section discusses sums and differences in the higher plane which is useful for maths seekers - people that I do respect.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no POV in advanced knowledge, other than the true and unbiased POV of the alpinist "Oh! I see the Eiffel tower from there!" where we only see billboards and streets and cars. I’d say that both belong here, as it is good to know that, with practise and time, you may succeed in seeing something else than trivial perspectives.</p>

<p>Science is not everything ... There are other fields of human knowledge. Science and religion sometimes meet to conclude that their domains differ.</p>
<p>Science derived towards the quest for reproducible results. History (of human society, of man, of living cells) is not so easily reproducible, and still follows laws that we are able to discover.</p>
<p>The presents that religion brought to humanity have kept some value. There are no proofs and no reproducible results either. There is life growing and dying, which science won’t try to explain. What to say about that in an encyclopedia without resorting to dogma or losing friends&#160;? Just cite sources. Some great thinkers did say or write very interesting things about questions that existed long time ago and shall exist, and be viewed differently, in ten or a thousand years. A good question is by itself more interesting that a trivial, today's fashioned answer.</p>
<p>Now when the answer is "just kill your enemies", we won’t have that in our policies and the article telling about that shall be properly guarded. -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

<p>Thank you for volunteering to take on this task, and for putting yourself through having to answer these questions. For what it's worth, these particular questions are going to all the candidates.</p>
<p>1. I've noticed that a total of thriteen people have resigned from the committee, and that there is currently one vacancy open in one of the tranches. Having members of the committee resign sometime during their term could create problems somewhere down the road. What do you think are the odds that you yourself might consider resigning during the course of your term, and what if any circumstances can you envision that might cause you to resign? Also, do you think that possibly negative feelings from others arising as a result of a decision you made could ever be likely to be cause for your own resignation?</p>
<p>2. There may well arise cases where a dispute based on the inclusion of information whose accuracy is currently a point of seemingly reasonable controversy, possibly even bitter controversy, in that field of study. Should you encounter a case dealing with such information, and few if any of your colleagues on the committee were knowledgeable enough in the field for them to be people whose judgement in this matter could be completely relied upon, how do you think you would handle it?</p>

<p>Warning: Most of these are intended to be <b>tough</b>. Answering them properly will be hard. I don't expect anyone to actually withdraw themselves from nomination rather than answer these, but I do expect at least some to seriously think about it!</p>
<p>The one consolation is that your competitors for the positions will be asked them too. Notice that there are about one thousand admins, and about a dozen arbcom members, so the process to become an arbcom member may be expected to be <i>one hundred times</i> harder. <small>(Bonus question - do you think I hit that difficulty standard?)&#160;:-)</small></p>
<ol>
<li>A current Arbcom case, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Protecting_children%27s_privacy_df78.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy</a> is concerned with the decision of whether or not a proposed policy has consensus or not, and therefore whether or not it should be a policy/guideline. Whether or not the Arbcom has or should have the power of making this decision is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Protecting_children%27s_privacy_Workshop_9e7d.html#Role_of_Arbitration_Committee" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy/Workshop">hotly disputed</a>. Does Arbcom have this power? Should it have this power? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Similarly, a recently closed Arbcom case <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano</a> barely dodged the possibly similar issue of whether the Arbcom can, or should, determine whether Bureaucrats properly made someone an administrator. (Discussed, for example, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_Workshop_2a0c.html#Bureaucrat_decision_in_WP:RFA.2FCarnildo_3_overturned" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano/Workshop">here</a>). The current arbcom dodged the question (didn't reach agreement one way or the other, and ended up leaving it alone by omission), but you don't get to.&#160;:-) Does the arbcom have this power? Should it?</li>
<li>Various arbcom decisions <small>(can't find a link right now - bonus points for finding a link to an arbcom decision saying this!)</small> have taken into account a user's service to the Wikipedia. Several times they have written that an otherwise good user that has a rare instance of misbehaviour can be treated differently than a user whose similar misbehaviour is their main or sole contribution to the Wikipedia. Do you agree or not, and why?</li>
<li>If you agree with the above point, which service to the encyclopedia is <i>more</i> valuable - administration, or writing very good articles? For example, what happens when two editors, an administrator and a good article writer, come into conflict and/or commit a similar infraction - how should they be treated? Note that there are relatively the same number of current administrators and featured articles on the Wikipedia - about 1000 - however, while relatively few administrators have been de-adminned, many former featured articles have been de-featured, so there have been noticeably more featured articles written than administrators made. This is a really tough one to answer without offending at least one important group of people, and I will understand if you weasel your way out of answering it, but it was one of the issues brought up in the recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano</a>, so you can imagine it may come up again.</li>
<li>While some Arbcom decisions pass unanimously, many pass with some disagreement. I don't know of any Arbcom member who hasn't been in the minority on some decisions. Find an Arbcom decision that passed, was actually made that you disagree with. Link to it, then explain why you disagree. (If you don't have time or inclination to do the research to find one - are you sure you will have time or inclination to do the research when elected? If you can't find any passed decisions you disagree with, realize you are leaving yourself open to accusations of running as a <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubber_stamp_%28politics%29.html" title="Rubber stamp (politics)">rubber stamp</a> candidate, one who doesn't have any opinions that might disagree with anyone.)</li>
<li>It has been noted that the diligent <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a> writes most of the initial Arbcom decisions -- especially principles, and findings of fact, but even a fair number of the remedies. (Then a fair number get opposed, and refined or don't pass, but he does do most of the initial work.) Do you believe this is: right; neither right nor wrong but acceptable; or wrong? When you get elected, what do you plan to do about it?</li>
<li>For those who are administrators only - how do you feel about non-administrators on the arbcom? Note that while "sure, let them on if they get elected" is an easy answer, there are issues with not having the ability to view deleted articles, and either not earning the community trust enough to become an admin, or not wanting the commensurate duties. Or do you believe that non-administrators are a group that need representation on the arbcom?</li>

<p>I loved this one&#160;: "it seems unlikely to me that some of the parties accept the jurisdiction of the Committee", this one&#160;: "substantial evidence that violations will not be repeated" and that one too&#160;: “Criticism of administrative, arbitration, and bureaucratic decisions is welcome."

<p>Conflicts should be treated with regards primarily to content that is widely broadcast to a public that wants to find information and loves WP.

<p>Each one brings help with his capacities. Some bring useful and raw information, some refine it, some reject it by judging its value ... and administration is really necessary as WP is so huge today&#160;: it should be enriched, but respecting a separation of powers.</p>

<p>Do you remember Louis Epstein … who was asked to put spaces after punctuation, as is normal. His response was “By now you should realize that NOT typing spaces after punctuation marks is a habit I have had for decades,and stick to fiercely."</p>
<p>The Arbcom decision states that "Louis Epstein … may be briefly blocked if he neglects use of conventional punctuation (gradations of penalties follow.)</p>
<p>The remedies of this decision are not to be enforced so long as Babajobu is fixing Louis Epstein's punctuation habits as per his voluntary offer [11]. If the Arbitration Committee later, through a request for clarification, decides that this is no longer being done, the remedies in this decision will come into full effect, unless an approved arrangement has been made for another user to clean up after Louis Epstein." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Louis_Epstein" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Louis_Epstein" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Open-mindedness and the ability to revise one's own position in response to new evidence seems to me to be an important factor in considering ArbCom cases.

<dd>Hi JzG. Children sometimes consider that their parents did wrong; soon, or long after, they see that they did what they could. As I experienced it, I only hope it won't take too long to change my mind if it happens in an ArbCom case. -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

<p>I'm asking these questions all applicants:</p>
<p>1) How would you handle a situation where an error of judgment has occured, especially if evidence is provided to confirm that the position is incorrect?</p>
<p>2) If a decision of yours, while technically a correct one, would <i>knowingly</i> be unpopular <i>en masse</i>, how would you present your decision?</p>
<p>3) Place each of these policies/guidelines listed in order of precedence (to you) starting with highest priority. There is really no right or wrong answer. I'm interested in seeing what you would normally look at <i>first</i> when assessing an article.</p>

<dd>I'm so sorry that Torinir didn't ask this lovely question directly to all candidates. For you, John Read, I'll give a hint&#160;: It is hypothetical and cranky.

<p>WP says that it is not a democracy. In such a state, three independent powers are required. Here, it looks as if it was a little similar, as anyone proposes policies and vote for them&#160;; various empowered users try to protect articles and users&#160;; arbitrators give decisions (those should not use any more superpowers than requiring sensible information.)</p>
<p>The activities of each category of Wpian is clear and distinct. Arbs are allowed to know nothing of encyclopedia subjects, the same for admins. Editors may ignore all rules, except when it protects them or they lack respect to others. WP is fine.</p>
<p>Problems arise with people's temper, as they put their heart in what they write. This may be treated quite easily.</p>
<p>Problems arise with visibility. Google any word and ask why the WP's article is not n°1 by now. WP is no more fine with such a situation, as more and more energy is directed towards good order and taken off good editing.</p>
<p>Problems are sometimes linked with fandom and creed (political or else). These subjects are, or are not, encyclopedical. Fandom about notable memes (TV series, music or film heroes, games, the glory of the place you were haphazard born in) may be understood.</p>
<p>Creeds are a part of human experience and are welcome too. The first French encyclopedia dealt with powers and creeds in a perfect POV manner, according to its own agenda. There may not be any agenda, even a politically correct one, here&#160;: go and create your own 'pedia elsewhere.</p>
<p>May editors remember what they used to search for, find and like in an old style encyclopedia. WP is not that, but its contents must respect the reader searching anything in it. -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

2. I have read on several websites (they even gave links to block logs) of Wikipedia admins who do things like indefinitely blocking accounts who have not edited for months, there was no CheckUser anything, no reports, and the admin didn't give any reason, just put personal attacks as the block reason (e.g. saying "troll"). Basically such cases seem done beyond punative, but just out of bullying. I saw at least ten of these, but so far I can only find one here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Rhobite&amp;page=User%3AThodin" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Rhobite&amp;page=User%3AThodin" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<p>3. What is your view on the current policy often called "kicking them while they're down" of deleting the user and talk pages of people who are blocked? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:01, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>4. What is your view on the practice on Wikipedia where a person blanks out text on talk pages because the text mentioned something wrong the person did or defeated them in an argument? The text blanked usually has no reason given. When there is a reason given, it's only a fake reason. In rare cases, the text is not blanked, but the entire talk page is archived including discussions hours old, blanking it out. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:01, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Dfrg.msc, in one word it should be better, I'm bringing here what I'm trying to live&#160;: <i>coherence</i> within life, meaning coherence with recognised goals and acceptation of the chaos of life (if this was useful for you, let me know.) -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

<p>Hello, the ArbCom elections are coming up very soon and I was wondering if you would give your public assurance not to vote or comment on other candidates. I think this will help keep friction to a minimum. Imagine how ugly it would be if two people who vehemently publicly attacked and opposed each other both ended up sitting on the ArbCom together. I think, in the best interests of decorum, these kind of conflict of interest issues should be avoided. Do you agree? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 20:22, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Cyde Weys, the risk that you mention must exist but is it frequent, is it avoidable with your suggestion&#160;? Political people get elected and disagree and tell things about others before TV guys - and go to the nearest pub together.</dd>
<dd>You are allowed to propose a new policy&#160;; I say that we have enough, if not too much policies here and I won't support.

<p>1. Based on your background, any prior conflicts, etc., are there any areas or topics where you anticipate receiving requests for recusal or would consider self-recusal? If so, what are those areas or topics and how would you resolve the issue of recusal in those cases? Thanks, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 08:51, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello TheronJ, and sorry for that late answer. I think that everywhere in life you must expect difficulties, or your occupation is useless. Arbitrators are not pure justice neither pure knowledge of truth. To a request I'd say - recuse me if you want, but mind that your arguments must be strong enough. The fact that I live my own faith must not impede talking about other faiths or other's faith. Now if I was the guy who ties arms to the chair, would I discuss death penalty&#160;? Even if I take extreme cases, my answer stays quite formal as I was not involved in conflicts here. -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

<p>1. As concisely as possible, please explain how you would continue with your stated commitment to the ArbCom process as an ordinary editor, should you NOT be "elected". Please be as concise as possible, preferably in 100 words or less.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My reasons for this question are three-fold.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that <i>anyone can edit</i>. It's a powerful statement that has many meanings. It means that, among other things, any user has the power to do pretty much <i>anything</i>, should they wish it. I submit my own user contributions as evidence.</dd>
<dd>Second, one thing that's a constant is Wikipedia's GNU License. As an <i>online-encyclopedia</i>, the history of everything, every edit, every comment, every misdeed, every injury, and every achievement are readily available to anyone who wish to look at it. All they need is a computer, frankly, and they can dig away.</dd>
<dd>The third is merely a perception. Power is great, but when the entire history of your actions are utterly transparent, and anyone can do virtually anything on their first day here, it's really just a big illusion. I further submit that the more "power" you think you have, the more you have to "lose". You also have to more "work" and have less "fun".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. What do you think about this "election"? What do you think about your fellow "candidates"? What do you think about "campaign banners" on an <i>online, open-source encyclopedia</i>? What do you think about your own "campaign"? Please answer as concisely as possible, preferably in 100 words or less. For reference, please see this: [WP:Wikipedia is not a Democracy]]?</p>
<p>3. What, specifically have you done wrong in the past as an editor, community member, administrator, and human being trying to create a world-wide online open source <i>encyclopedia</i> on Wikipedia? For reference, see my own user contributions. Please be as concise as possible, preferably in 100 words or less.</p>
<p>4. Do you <i>apologize for your actions</i>, and who are you apologising to, specifically? Please be as concise as possible, preferably in 100 words or less.</p>
<p>5. Hypothetically, how would you deal with an explosion of editors and users behaving very badly because Wikipedia has just aquired a bigger "stick". For reference please see <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_Power_9641.html" title="Soft Power">Soft Power</a>.</p>
<p>6. What, exactly do you want do on Wikipedia? Why did you come here, and why did you stay for more than a minute? What's fun for you here? What makes you happy here? Please be as concise as possible, preferably in 100 words or less.</p>

<p>1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello, NinaEliza, thank you for your questions. My statement told what I understood about "what is WP" and more, what I would not like it to become. This I can contribute a a plain editor. Regarding your contributions, you have the courage to apologize, what shall I say&#160;?</li>
</ul>
<p>2.</p>
<ul>
<li>I recognize that plenty of fellows already did good job and knew what it was all about. A campaign banner made me see that there was more work to do than just writing information, my own statements tell that I ignored it before. It was for me time to think about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am glad that, whatever I did wrong, no one was personnally angry, and WPians calmly explained to me what was the point. You may be young and want to break things sometimes, you may be old and worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.</p>
<ul>
<li>I apologize to people that are dear to me when I understand that I have to.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.</p>
<ul>
<li>WP is here for people to find knowledge. If the goal is impaired, there are things to do. One has to create an account to create an article, it was not so in the beginning. Some like Larry Sanger want to employ only a bunch of editors (this is not exactly exact, I know), we do not want that here.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Feeling like at school ...) I came for fun and to see what I could do. I'm still trying. It's fun because related with openness and knowledge&#160;; I'm happy because of people like you. -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..

<dd>ArbCom decisions are decisions that you may, or may not, agree with but everyone should respect and a straw poll about them is not a good idea. What do you think, Zoe&#160;? For myself, I might comment about the case which is quite old, not so awful in itself ... I'll just say good luck to Mongo if he needs to get sysop rights again. -- <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestman_e6aa.html" title="User:Harvestman"><font color="blue">DLL</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarvestman_c21c.html" title="User talk:Harvestman"><font color="green">..
