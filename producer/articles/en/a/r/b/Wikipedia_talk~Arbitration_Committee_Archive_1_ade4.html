<dd>this is <b>so</b> typical. ant</dd>
</dl>
<p>What is so typical? That women don't campaign for leadership roles? That more women than men prefer to hide their gender? That women are in the minority on Wikipedia? That unfortunate inequities exist? To whom may we direct your complaint, ant?<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 22:25, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think most women on en: are not hidden now; they still are in minority, but that minority is not so low, and I think many of them have a quite proeminent role and influence here. So...all in all, I guess the influence of women in the english wikipedia is quite satisfactory actually&#160;:-) However, yes, I think it is quite typical that men find themselves, just as in real life, in the decision making. Why is it so&#160;? Hmmm, in this case, I suppose no women even considered having such a role. The other option is that one asked but was not chosen by Jimbo. Actually, before I made that comment, I really had a big laugh, because before Alex mentionned it, I had not even realised it&#160;:-) So, yeah, that was not a complaint, rather a amused reaction&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>this said, I can't help wondering upon which arguments Jimbo decided to put a person here rather than there, and vice versa. I personally think a couple of choices were not so wise. Btw, I regret that you did not propose yourself for mediation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't believe the gender of Gutza, The Cunctator, or UninvitedCompany is publically known, though I could be wrong. I suppose possible concerns might be that this could cause a perceived blind spot in our ability to handle disputes involving accusations of sexism or sexual harrassment, or that it makes us unrepresentative of the larger Wikipedia community. As Anthere notes, it is certainly an interesting example of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_role.html" title="Gender role">gender roles</a> in action. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 00:34, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, everyone who requested a role got it, so if there are no women on the arbitration committee (which I don't know to be a fact, since I don't know everyone's gender), it's simply because no women asked to be on the arbitration committee. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 05:14, Jan 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I volunteered for either committee (but expressed a preference for mediation). I don't know about Angela and Anthere but it's possible that they also said either was OK. So there was at least one woman available, possibly three.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transparency question</span></h2>
<p>Since arbitration is final and binding should members know who exactly all the arbitrators are, i.e. their personal biographies and what qualifies them to arbitrate disputes in a final and binding fashion? It only seems fair that someone who is being banned from Wikipedia should know who has the authority to do that to them. I am not certain that all the members of the arbitration committee are forthcoming about who they are outside the Wikipedia world. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756</a> 13:33, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is that the sort of thing you were after from us? Regards qualifications, the blunt truth is that we qualified by volunteering when Jimbo Wales asked, and he accepted us as volunteers.

<dd>Alex, I volunteered for the job out of concern for Wikipedia and out of a sense of duty since I was one of those clamoring for better ways to resolve disagreements. Wikipedia does not have a <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?UseRealNames" class="extiw" title="meatball:UseRealNames">MeatBall:UseRealNames</a> policy for users or sysops, and many users -- including you and many other prominent Wikipedians -- choose not to share many biographical details.

<dl>
<dd>The system as current set up is... not perfect, and perhaps so much not so that people will have a problem with it, in that all of us who have been appointed to the board were done so at the personal discretion of Jimbo, whereas any and all future appointments (including our own re-appointments; mine is at Gregorian year-end) are intended to be based on a vote of some kind, at which point I have no doubt that people will expect those standing to offer a personal manifesto et al.; however, as of now, one does not know that information provided on my vanity domain as linked to from my user page is anything other than a fabrication, and, certainly, if I were so minded, I have little doubt that I could invent such a character background in such a way as to be pretty-much 'fool-proof', so that one would have a very great difficulty in verifying its veracity, and yet being partially or wholly false, and as such I feel that the only reliable (and, indeed, in any way sensible) basis of evidence is the way in which people have comported themselves whilst on the Wikipedia (and, I suppose, on the miscellaneous related mailing lists) - evidence which is, if not terribly easy to sift through, certainly available in all of its forms to anyone who wishes to look for it.

<p>I don't think it's necessary to give biographies, or even real names. We're on the committee because Jimbo appointed us there, and that's what gives us the authority, since currently Jimbo has final say on all Wikimedia decision making. In the future we will be elected based on our actions both on the committee and on Wikipedia in general; for those voting to decide whether they like our actions, it's sufficient to identify us by our Wikipedia usernames. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 05:15, Jan 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to be an arbitrator should be subject to scrutiny because they will be wielding real power against other Wikimedia members that we do not know. Personally, I care about the other members and their rights; they should be treated fairly be individuals who are qualified to judge their behaviors because of their training, their personal background and their history as part of this community. I do not know of any democracy where the judges/arbitrators are anonymous or pseudonymous.</p>
<p>Regarding my user name I wouold like to state that anyone who has taken the time to read my user page knows that I use a pseudonym not to hide my identity or information about my personal biography (which can be discovered with a minimum of research) but because using a pseudonym shortens the duration of copyright protection before works enter the public domain. See <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap3.html#302" class="external text" title="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap3.html#302" rel="nofollow">Title 17 USC § 302(c)</a>. It is for this reason alone that I adopted a pseudonym to make contributions here.</p>
<p>Thank you Martin for your forthrightness; it is an excellent example for the rest of the group. And thank you to the rest of you in advance for your disclosures on this page so other members are aware of the idenitities of those who have taken it upon themselves to judge others and pass sentence upon them if you have not already done so on your user pages. Remember that I declined to be part of this process because I felt it important that someone remain available to look over the shoulders of the power possessors to protect the rights of those who have not been given such power to effect the course of other people's lives; being a court arbitrator I know that it is a very serious role that can have very serious consequences. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756</a> 05:18, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with that. I think the only relevant qualification is track record in Wikipedia. Track record in real life is irrelevant--there are plenty of esteemed, well-regarded, and tenured professors who have behaved less than excellently on Wikipedia, and vice versa. In fact I personally don't bother to read any of this blog-style personal rambling about what people do in real life, and would object strongly to it being taken into account for any purpose whatsoever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are making the whole thing a bit too formal as well. This is not some sort of legal system. We're doing the exact same thing Jimbo has been doing informally for years now, only now it's a group of people instead of just Jimbo doing it. We're the dispute resolution committee of our little club, not some sort of government. Jimbo didn't do it formalistically, and I don't think we should either. The checks and balances are consensus, and voting of people onto the arbitration committee (which <i>does</i> have to be done somewhat more formally to make sure the elections are meaningful in some way). --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 06:21, Jan 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, as I've said above, it is surely difficult for one to verify what Martin (no allegation of lying intended, of course) or I have written - what's the point in people posting unverifiable information in a sop effort to garner trust?</dd>
<dd>Surely the only trust metric that you can use is that provided by the community sense of a Wikipedian's interactions with it? For example:

<p>I have a comment. I think that some of the decisions you may gonna take involve tough decisions, such as rejecting some people from the community. This is a heavy decision. And one arbitrators must feel ready to take responsability for in case of a subsequent issue. For this reason, I feel that Alex is right in suggesting that one gives his real identity. Jimbo plainly assume every decision he takes with his real name.<br />
Now, it is true that participating to wikipedia requires not to give one's real identity, but arbitrator is not a role we would agree any wikipedian should hold. It is a step above, in the trust scale.<br />
I do not think that it "should" be a requirement that a real name and personal information is known by all of us, but if people accept to give information, so much the best. If they do not, no big deal. Or if they feel like staying in the middle, they can offer that information to one trusted person, who will keep it private. The three options are ok to me.</p>
<p>Jdforrester, I lived on Broadway Rd, Mac Clintock corner, in Tempe. I liked the place very much&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Part of the issue is accountability. If you don't want to disclose who you are why should a judge recognize your decisionmaking as final? If you want arbitration to be binding and final then it has to be betweeen people, not imaginary characters made up to "keep private" the identity of the author of those characters. Imagine if all these people are really just one person who has developed the ability to create and run multiple user accounts on Wikipedia:</p>
<p>User A: I agree with you, User B. User B; You are right User A.</p>
<p>Now if User A and User B are the same person, there is no agreement, is there? Why does someone who want to take on the responsibility to effect users lives not want to disclose who they are? Yes, they don't want anyone to know who they are so they cannot be confronted with their decision. Anonymity is great for people who don't want anyone to know who they are. Accountability requires verifiable identities. I don't buy the argument that everyone who puts themselves in the spotlight deserves absolute privacy, especially arbitrators. Judges have to disclose their relationships between the parties, their interests in corporations, and their professional qualifications; in a democracy judges are subject to a high degree of scrutiny in their public lives. Why should it be any different for arbitrators? I am asking for verifiability, not an invasion of privacy and not self serving "biographies" that could be just as much fiction as a novel. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756</a> 13:49, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, I'm evidently not saying what I mean coherently enough, as we seem to each be reiterating the same points to each other; let me try again:
<ul>
<li>I'm happy to give a biography about myself, and have indeed done so.</li>
<li>I'm aware of the privacy that I otherwise enjoy, but am happy to give up said freedom if it pleases others.</li>
<li>I'm aware that I and the other arbitrators have been entrusted with a lot of power, and that we must be seen to be fair, and to some extent accountable to the overall community.</li>
<li>My (main) point is that the information we have been asked to provide is unverifiable, and as such is no more than a diversion, making people believe that they can have trust in 'us', but not actually providing anything 'real' or tangible.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>... and thus we arbitrators are giving up our privacy for no real point other than a falsely assumed sense of security.</dd>

<dd>If you gave a phone number, Jimbo could call you at a random date and time. If you've paid somebody to pose as you at that number, perhaps you won't have paid them enough to memorize all your postings to Wikipedia, some obscure questions about which Jim could pose to you. Or since he runs a business you could probably put a 3 cent refundable deposit down with his company, and if the charge went through he would know have a credit identity that could be traced (or a $10,000 deposit to be refunded only upon retiring from a term of office during which you live up to the highest standards!). Or he could send registered letters to addresses 1 digit higher and 1 digit lower than the one you provide and ask your neighbors if you really live there (or would one to you work? Do post office people ask for ID?). I dunno.

<p>I guess I don't see why there should be "personal" accountability, or why any of this is even relevant. The <i>accountability</i> ought to be based on the <i>decisions</i> of the committee: not who they are, but whether they make good decisions. If a particular committee member is consistently voting in odd ways that are out of sync with the wishes of the wider Wikipedia community, then that user should not be voted onto the committee again. If, on the other hand, the committee is making decisions that the rest of the community sees as reasonable, then there's no problem. I don't really care who is behind all these handles; I only care what sorts of decisions they make. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 01:25, Jan 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's my view too. Knowing who everybody is in real life is all very nice, and if people want to tell people who they are, that's fine, but I don't see why it should be required.

<p>I agree with Alex that the arbitration committee needs to have some transparency if they are going to be making binding decisions. For example, I think it would be a wise policy that the committee should have to admit to what usernames they are using. It seems highly unfair that someone would be editing, and possibly getting into conflicts with others under one username, and then making arbitration decisions under another. I'm not demanding to know their names in real life, but their usernames on Wikipedia really ought to be a minimum requirement. Are the arbitration committee themselves even aware of this information? If so, should the rest of the community not be told, or at least told that the committee are aware of it and have decided for whatever reason that they wish to withhold this information. If it is withheld, you risk the information leaking out anyway and rumours about which users other users might be will seriously reduce the amount of faith people have in the committee. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 17:33, Jan 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I completely agree - if anybody uses a second (or third, fourth...) username, they should declare it (I tend to think the same about all users, but I think it's even more important in the case of arbitrators).

<dd>After lengthy consideration I have concluded that the direction the committee has taken no longer matches the activity for which I volunteered. At the time I expressed my interest in the committee to Jimbo, I had hoped that arbitration could serve as a way of resolving disputes early, at the stage before the <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ForestFires" class="extiw" title="meatball:ForestFires">MeatBall:ForestFires</a> started, and the civility-destroying effects of peoples' frustration ran their course. I also saw it as an extension of <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity" class="extiw" title="meatball:SoftSecurity">MeatBall:SoftSecurity</a>, where we would be able to resolve editorial disagreements, and that our means of implementation would be the respect of the "disputants" and the community for our actions.</dd>

Your typical admin isn't endowed with the right to ban users, only to block them.

<p>I've been thinking about confidentiality with regards to mediation. Some of the issues touch on arbitration - in particular on whether anything said during mediation can be used in future arbitrations. Have you discussed this at all?

<p>At the same time, it could be possible to discuss communications between advocates and their clients; e.g., if a client sends an e-mail to his attorney, perhaps outlining his views towards other users, is that e-mail admissible (including in future trials where the attorney might be on the opposite side), or is it privileged? -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 22:22, Apr 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We have discussed it, and I think the opinion seemed to be that mediation stuff wouldn't be admissable, but it never made it into <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">wikipedia:arbitration policy</a> in time for the vote. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 22:44, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I understand it, mediation is meant to be in private so that involved parties feel they can talk freely. For this reason, things said in mediation are not admissible in arbitration unless all involved parties agree to it. As Martin says, I think we all agree on that, though it's not formalised anywhere. I'd consider emails between parties to arbitration and their advocates in a similar way. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>Paul Vogel appeared here today at the above IP in violation of the ban. Initial blocks did not work, although unblocking and reblocking seemed to be effective. There was some confusion (on my part, at least) concerning why this IP was not already blocked. I've blocked him for 4 days (99 hours, specifically) because I wanted to wait to see what was up. Is this IP not going to be blocked? If so, how are we blocking Vogel? Also, on a related issue, if he's able to get here and edit, must those reverting his edits operate under the 3 revert rule or no? Today, everyone limited themselves to 3 edits in reverting Vogel's edits. Thank you for your prompt attention.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 19:39, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, we've banned Vogel, but the rest, as they say, is up to you. I don't think the details of how the ban works in practice are up to us. Personally, I don't see any need for the three revert rule to apply here, but others may feel it's better not to make any exceptions - it shouldn't really be an issue, since he can just be blocked anyway (that assumes the blocks work, of course, which, as we've seen, they don't always...).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We didn't block all the IP addresses associated with Vogel when we banned him, so that explains that one. As far as I know it's not established whether the IP addresses Vogel has edited from can only possibly be used by him, or are liable to be used by others. If they can only be used by him, there's nothing wrong with blocking them all for a year, but if they might be used by others we probably don't want to do that, since we'd get innocent people get caught up in the ban. If that's the case, the only way to handle this is to just ban him for a few days at a time. But again, that's only my opinion.</dd>

<li>The members are appointed by Jimbo and do not reflect the will of the Wikipedia community.</li>
<li>The AC does not issue judgements in a timely manner.</li>
<li>The weakness of the AC has encouraged trolls, vandals, and other degenerates.</li>

As for your specific points: it's true that Jimbo appointed the original members to the arbitration committee (in fact, anybody who asked to was put on either the arbitration or mediation committees), but he indicated that in future there would be likely be votes to appoint arbitrators (maybe somebody else will provide a link to the relevant email--I'm too lazy to look it up just now); it is true that in some cases, the AC has been rather slow in dealing with cases, and this is something which we need to work on, but I do think that in the most egregious cases, we have moved reasonably quickly--on the whole it is the relatively trivial or "difficult" cases which have taken longer; and in my opinion, the AC has not "encouraged degenerates", either through its "weakness" or anything else, but that is just my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Share the pain, disagree with the solution</span></h2>
<p>I share H. Cheney's pain, but do not agree with his solution.</p>
<p>The arbitration committee adopted a legalistic, court-like operating framework early in its history. I believe this was the fundamental mistake that made an otherwise excellent idea unworkable.</p>
<p>The present arbitration mechanism has evidentiary standards and operating principles comparable to those of an institution empowered to deprive people of life, liberty, or property. In such institutions (i.e. criminal courts of law) such safeguards are necessary and desirable, as history has shown all too well.</p>
<p>Depriving people of the ability to edit Wikipedia is a far less weighty matter, and the same evidentiary standards and protections really aren't appropriate. Rather than disband the committee, leaving a vacuum, we are better off working as a community to give clearer guidance to the committee.</p>
<p>The arbitration committe had, originally, a weak mandate. Without betraying any confidences, I believe that I can say that the arbitration committee, while I participated, operated with considerable concern that it might inadvertently act in a way that the community would see as a usurping of ungranted authority. I would speculate that this continues to be prominent in the group's decisionmaking to this day.</p>
<p>The arbitration committee's mandate should be strengthened by the community. H.Cheney and others in the community who share his concern would do well to enumerate policies that the AC should follow with the hope of bringing together a community consensus.</p>

<dd>I agree with this, especially its sense of perspective. I think any Arb Committee should be relaxed about its position, not take itself or the consequences of its decrees too seriously, and work fairly quickly. It should also view its purpose, not as a final arbiter of Justice or smackdowns, but as a safety mechanism to protect our most productive and community-minded editors from frustration and departure. I would be glad to see arbitration decisions of the form "we're not sure who is in the right and who is in the wrong, but this is what we've decided is most productive for the editing community: {suggestions, declarations}." <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a><a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 21:53, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Like UninvitedCompany, I think Hcheney has identified problems, but do not support dissolving the Arbitration Committee as a solution.</p>
<p>Yes, the committee was originally appointed by Jimbo, but he planned for annual elections thereafter. Also, the committee was supposed to have 12 members, meaning that at least two positions are now vacant that were scheduled for an election around December. I think we should move up the timetable for that election, since the Board election demonstrated that we have a workable election system. Having 2 additional elected members would reduce concerns about legitimacy, and also make the committee more effective. We would get quicker decisions on accepting or rejecting cases, and the committee could also build a quorum of votes more quickly to issue judgments in a timely manner.</p>
<p>I also wonder if some of the existing arbitrators might not be glad to step down, if they could feel that someone else was taking over the work instead of them just abandoning it. If so, we could also have elections for additional seats being vacated.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in proposing this election, I add that if it happens, I will not be a candidate in it myself. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:44, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>And to think I never imagined the wikipedia AC to be so full of angst. Personally I've admired your low profile and reluctance to act. I think it takes great strength to do little! (to remove any doubt, yes I mean that) Anyway, just in case y'all have not noticed a couple of ideas (<a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia%7EDealing_with_disruptive_or_antisocial_editors_c12c.html" title="Wikipedia:Dealing with disruptive or antisocial editors">1</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_supervised_editing_proposal_4d86.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines/supervised editing proposal">2</a>) I've been pedalling, I post them here. The ideas, particularly the first one, obviously have an impact on the AC, and could make you more of a court of appeal when the admins are being too harsh or can't reach the necessary votes to act.

<dd>I agree with what UninvitedCompany said. In many ways, the Arbitration Committee has been a step in the right direction. It has allowed numerous cases to be dealt with that would either have been left to fester, or had to be dealt with by Jimbo. But it's also become clear to me, and I know I'm not the only one, that it has some fairly major problems. UninvitedCompany is spot on, in that the AC needs a stronger mandate, and needs to be less legalistic. However, I'd also add to that that I believe the whole process, on top of being legalistic, is just outright slow. When dealing with nuisance users, it shouldn't be taking weeks to get a response. And on that note, I agree with Michael Snow, about the election for those places. How about setting a date?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's also one point which I believe could be addressed by the arbitration committee as it stands. In the last week, I've seen two cases referred to mediation that were patently unsuitable for it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In many cases, mediation is a great idea, and in the case of disputes over article content, it <i>is</i> very useful. However, in cases where you have a nuisance user who is being a nuisance across a wide number of articles, there's not much there to have a mediation about.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While the AC has chosen to put off doing anything, one of these people has had to be temp-banned (twice, now), and I've heard complaints about the other user from at least eight different people. In my opinion, trying to send these cases to mediation is a waste of time, and just ensures that they'll fester, and drive good editors mad. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbivalenthysteria_aa78.html" title="User:Ambivalenthysteria">Ambivalenthysteria</a> 09:36, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Level of arbitrator participation</span></h2>
<p>The arbitrators have haphazardly noted here whether a particular arbitrator is "Inactive" or "Away". I think it would be useful to take a closer look at just how much (or how little) some of the arbitrators have participated over the past year.</p>
<p>To do this it is unfortunately necessary to single some people out. I do this not to criticize anyone; being an arbitrator is a thankless and time-consuming responsibility, this is a volunteer project where people do work because they want to do it, and certainly when most of the arbitrators volunteered for the task they cannot have fully anticipated what they were getting into. Nevertheless, as we will soon have another election for the Arbitration Committee, I think we need to consider whether it is necessary to replace a number of the current arbitrators.</p>
<p>I have summarized here the extent to which several arbitrators have participated in arbitration cases over recent months. I think that given the current caseload of the Arbitration Committee, it is clear that these levels of participation are inadequate for the task.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camembert's most recent participation was a single edit on August 29, at which time he also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee&amp;diff=5561573&amp;oldid=5529643" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee&amp;diff=5561573&amp;oldid=5529643" rel="nofollow">put himself back on the "Active" list</a> after having been "Away". When he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee&amp;diff=4811563&amp;oldid=4811241" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee&amp;diff=4811563&amp;oldid=4811241" rel="nofollow">initially marked himself "Away"</a> on July 23, Camembert indicated it was "for reasons of sanity. If there is a mechanism to replace me permanently, then feel free to do so. If there is not, I will probably make a return in a month or two". Before this, his most recent edit to an arbitration case was on July 8.</li>
<li>Delirium's pattern of editing arbitration cases has been:
<ul>
<li>February: 30 edits</li>
<li>March 7-11: 8 edits</li>
<li>April 4: 1 edit</li>
<li>May 6-7: 7 edits</li>
<li>June: 7 edits</li>
<li>July 28-29: 5 edits</li>
<li>August 16: 1 edit</li>
<li>October 15: 2 edits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gutza made 3 edits to arbitration cases in March before experiencing an internet outage. Since then, he has made 1 edit on June 25 and 8 edits on July 31.</li>
<li>Maveric149 has not participated in an arbitration case since August 26, when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee&amp;diff=5449833&amp;oldid=5449823" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee&amp;diff=5449833&amp;oldid=5449823" rel="nofollow">changed his status to "Away"</a>. Before that, he was a reasonably regular participant.</li>
<li>Nohat's history of editing arbitration cases has been 3 edits in February, 5 edits in March, 2 edits in April, and a flurry of 15 edits in early May. Then nothing until 1 edit on August 31. Finally, 5 additional edits scattered in September, the most recent on September 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each no doubt has reasons for focusing on other activities. Mav, for example, is now functioning as Wikimedia CFO and has had to devote considerable attention to financial matters. The choices they have made are not "wrong" in any sense; it merely means that they have been unable to serve effectively as arbitrators.</p>
<p>I have great respect for the many contributions each of these users has made to Wikipedia. I do not question whether they have the ability or judgment to be good arbitrators - when they <i>have</i> participated in cases, each has had something valuable to contribute. But unless they want to demonstrate a renewed commitment in the coming weeks to dealing with the problems before the Arbitration Committee, each of these users should be replaced as part of the coming election. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 06:00, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm being hypersensitive, but I wonder if the above picking apart of arbitrators' activity was really necessary. If the idea was to find out whether we'd be continuing as arbitrators beyond this year, why not just ask on our talk pages? As it is, although this apparently wasn't meant to be criticism, it <i>feels</i> like I'm being told off for not putting real life aside to do something which I only agreed to do on a voluntary basis in the first place (and which, incidentally, I did quite a lot in the first months of the committee's existence). But, as I say, I'm perhaps being too sensitive, so I'll shut up about it.</p>
<p>Enough whining. To get to the point: yes, I've been inactive for the past few months (not just in arbitration, but on the Wikipedia in general); yes, I intend to return to arbitration in a few days time; no, I don't intend to continue as an arbitrator beyond this year. My initial break from the committee ("for reasons of sanity") had to be extended unexpectedly (for personal reasons). I thought I was still on the "away" list during that extended break (in which case my absence would have had less of an impact, since only a majority of <i>active</i> arbitrators are needed for a vote to pass), forgetting that I had put myself back on the "active" list. My apologies for that. I'm back on the "away" list now, and, as I say, intend to return shortly. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dd>Michael - I'm afraid I do need to resign, simply because I am going to be out of time to be an effective arbitrator. I am writing this at 5am local time, which is clearly not a healthy long-term state!&#160;:) Once I've resigned, I'm going to see how the next year pans out - both for me personally, and for the arbitration committee. Depending on that, I <i>may</i> consider standing for arbitrator again in the future. I am also looking forward to being able to work on Wikipedia as an editor, and trying to write some fantastic new articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Under the existing system, arbitrators who take an extended leave of absence hinder only in that they don't make proposals - their lack of votes is not a problem. This could change further (eg, mav's ideas), so that it need not matter if some arbitrators are less active than others. Thus, rather than <i>replacing</i> comparatively inactive arbitrators, it may make more sense to add new arbitrators <i>in addition</i> to them. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 05:12, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Martin I would say that there is very much a need for more active arbitrators, and I felt there needed to be some relatively prompt action due to the impending election. The hindrance is not only in lack of proposals (itself a burden that definitely needs to be shared), but the lack of votes <i>is</i> a problem when it comes to accepting and closing, as the numbers required do not change with activity levels. I think a significant concern for many people has been the number of cases that languish at times in the request stage, without so much as a decision to accept or reject.</dd>

<dd>For Camembert: I did anticipate that this might be a sensitive subject, and tried to "pull the sting" from my comments as much as possible. Part of my reasons for addressing it publicly was because I saw it as a systemic problem; it wasn't the inactivity of any one arbitrator that was causing problems, it was the collective inactivity of so many. Also, because the method for replacing arbitrators is now by election, this is somewhat inevitably a public issue. Nevertheless, I apologize for any hurt feelings - I know that the task of arbitration is already painful enough, and have heard precious little "whining" from any of you over the course of the year. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 00:21, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I note with a certain amount of disappointment that the entire list of arbitrators, with one inactive exception, are also admins. While I realize that all too often assemblies will elevate the same people to all positions, I wonder if it is a good thing for the admin presence in the arbitration process to be so striking. It would also certainly seem to make any arbitration involving a user and an admin a lopsided exercise in pessimism. - [[User:KeithTyler|<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>The two are statistically associated (in other words, it's not a coincidence). Arbitrators should be long term wikipedia users whose conduct is above reproach; because these are the same criteria used for adminship, this automatically implies a selection bias in favor of admins. Put simply, good admins make good arbitrators. Saying that there should be exceptions for exception's sake is patently absurd. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 18:58, Nov 24, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I don't believe I said anything about making exceptions, but perhaps some realization of this tendency in the process of choosing arbitrators, and encouraging some expansion of non-admin representation in the arb pool. If all judges were police officers, I think societies would generally consider that a problem.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the recent introduction of admin elections will have this effect anyway. I simply hadn't seen it noted, and it seems clear that it is not entirely an absurd or obscure concern. At least, that is, among those who are not or have not been admins or arbitrators.</dd>

<dd>And to reiterate - your statement is patently absurd.

<dd>Admins aren't a monolithic group by any means; there's plenty of dissent and difference among them, and I very much doubt that an arbitrator who carries a sysop flag on his account is going to give a favorable ruling to the user who shares that flag, just because they both have it.

<dd>I would say that anecdotal evidence is only so meaningful, because there are probably those cases where some feel admin ganging-up occured. Regardless, I'm not saying it's a foregone conclusion that there is always going to be that conflict, but it does seem to be a potential conflict of interest, and trying to assuage it before the fact would be better then trying to fix it afterwards if it does become a perceived imbalance in case outcomes. Already it seems some are presuming that I am suggesting that admins should never be arbitrators, and that's not what I said. Perhaps, though, the fact that an arbitrator, or even arbitrator candidate, is an admin, should be noted. - [[User:KeithTyler|<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<p>I was an arbitrator at a time when I was not an admin, and found it to make no difference. As Raul points out, most long-time contributors to Wikipedia who have gained the trust of the community are administrators. And since arbitrators are all long-time contributors who have gained the trust of the community, it should be no surprise that they are, for the most part, administrators. I don't think this matters. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 19:38, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think it is a surprise that arbitrators are chosen from among those who were also willing to serve as administrators. I do wonder why so many arbitrators have kept their sysop privileges, it would seem natural to give them up while one serves on the committee. After all the committee can rely upon administrators to implement their decisions, and there is no shortage of administrators. There is no need for arbitrators to have to serve in two roles at once. Retention of the sysop powers by arbitrators gives the impression that one may be more motivated by accumulating powers as in Pokemon than in serving the community.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 00:12, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For example, suppose there was a dispute over the article for <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a>.

<dd>One would have to know the arbitrator's views on his head of state, which might be positive, negative, or apathetic—so I don't think it's possible to say definitively one way or another.

<p>Are new users automatically blocked from voting (ie cannot access the voting page) or are they simply disqualified? If the latter than your signature creates a make work project for the election administrators.</p>
<p>As for motivations, it's fallacious reasoning to criticise an argument by attacking the motivations of the person making it; that's just a form of ad hominem. One should look at the facts of the situation, ie that you are a candidate and that you are posting messages on the pages of people you do not know encouraging them to vote - the facts are the same regardless of my motivations. As for the US election that analogy would be of relevance if Wikipedia were running the US election and/or if lst were a candidate. I don't think your signature would be a problem if you weren't a candidate but you are and so it looks like campaigning even if you are telling people to "vote" instead of to vote for you.</p>

<p>Well, at some level (with regards to article content) the majority does not decide what is true and false and right and wrong. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> is not subject to majority rule. But the Arbitration Committee is not primarily concerned with article content matters, it's generally involved with user behaviour disputes. And when it comes to these sorts of disputes, a large community vote is suboptimal. Tell me, why should I as an average Wikipedia user have to worry about the details of Johnny Q Foobar's fight with User:Swik? Why should I have to spend time reviewing evidence against both sides? I really don't think the average citizen is that interested in going over the specifics with a fine tooth comb. Therefore, if we leave the matter open to a community-wide vote, we run two risks: first, that the average Wikipedian is too busy doing Important Things (like editing articles) to participate in this dispute, in which case it comes down to a popularity contest of whoever can muster the most friends to vote on the matter... and if ordinary, neutral people vote, they're unlikely to be able to make an informed decision, and the process becomes "whoever has the best rhetoric wins". This is suboptimal, at best. It also is more likely to polarize the community, breeding division and enmity. And in controversial cases, there will <b>never</b> be a sufficient majority to meet our standard rules for a "consensus", and you can be assured that people will add fifty dozen options to the choices about what to do to a user, and it's vulnerable to sock puppets, and suffers from all sorts of problems. A proper judicial system is not vulnerable to these sorts of abuse, is able to produce a clear yes-or-no decision, and helps ensure that the people making the decision will be making an <i>informed</i> decision. To bring an analogy: You don't see any democratic nation making their criminal justice a matter for the popular vote, do you?

<p>Er, OK. What should I read up on between now and Jan 1st? - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 23:33, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest that all new arbitrators choose several decided cases -- perhaps a couple of cases where severe consequences were imposed and a couple of cases where little was done -- and take the time to read the evidence pages, the discussions, and the ultimate decisions (along with arbitrator comments). In this way I think you will get a sense of what precedents have been set, and also (I do hope) you will determine what changes you hope to make to the way the AC does business. I would encourage anyone taking my advice to look at some of the most difficult cases we've had, in order to consider what other options might have been wiser -- the LaRouche case and the Rex case stick in my mind as most difficult and the ones most given to being second-guessed, but I'm sure there are many others. Learn from the (possible) mistakes of the past.&#160;:-) Or else discover that we all were a lot brighter and better than we were given credit for being.&#160;;-) Hopefully that's of some help, David.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 21:32, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Code of conduct for administrators</span></h2>
<p>I am interested in a code of conduct for administrators in their use of sysop powers. I draw a distinction between administrators making mistakes about facts or interpretation, and those who abused their powers for personal reasons, for themselves or people or positions they favored. Are there any arbitration decisions which set a precedent for delineating distinctions such as this? If it isn't already, I hope to work for a policy of zero tolerance based on this distinction.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 00:32, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Off the top of my head, the only case I can recall where the arbcom dealt with specific abuse-of-powers accuastions was in the RickK/Guanaco case. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 00:56, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanx for the cases. In the course of reviewing them I found that 172 has been desysopped before<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Possible_misuses_of_admin_privileges" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Possible_misuses_of_admin_privileges" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but it was temporary. So there definitely is not zero tolerance, for personal use of sysop powers. I am also concerned about Jimbo's role. His insistence on being consulted before desysopping (assuming this policy is still in place), seems to me to be treating sysop powers as a right rather than a privilege in service of a community of equals. If admins and users truly are equals, then desysoping is not nearly as severe as blocking a user from edit, i.e., kicking them out of the community, yet Jimbo does not insist on involvement in this. This inconvenience to the rest of us community members could possibly had been avoided it 172 had been "permanently" desysoped, not allowed to reapply for admin status for a period of time, and then required to disclose his previous desysopping when he reapplied. I think the community would have been fair to him, if he had shown a change in attitude.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 01:53, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Asked <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> to help me out, he told me to follow various ways. It is imposible to discuss things when you are accused of , hidden agendas, being a troll, being a revisionsist, being <i>type here</i>. User is ignoring the "No Personal Attacks" policy. My discussion with him is clear in <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmenian_Genocide_0a21.html" title="Talk:Armenian Genocide">Talk:Armenian Genocide</a> as well as in archives. User did not vandalise my user page or anything but it is stull quite irritating. At this point I am not sure what else I can do aside from showing up here. Just as I was typing this I was asked on my user page: "Mr. Coolcat, for the interest of the entire Wikipedian community, why have you lied about you." --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">Cool Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECoolcat_c966.html" title="User talk:Coolcat"><sup>My Talk</sup></a> 00:12, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Coolcat was not accused of hidden agenda by only me, but as well, by various other members and he knows it. He got involved himself in every articles directly or indirectly involving Turkey, editing them with his POV by claiming to neutralize them. He came in with the Armenian Genocide entry and did the same thing. I have proposed everything and he has refused any propositions. I have proposed to present the Western version, the Turkish government version etc. and the critics for each according to the Academia and researchers in the field. He has refused, he wanted to dump every versions and merge them, edit etc. and get the entire article as the Turkish government version. I asked mediation, I made many concessions, but he has ignored. He has edited the World War I entry reference to the Armenian cases, a Holocaust entry because it got the Armenian cases, Genocide history entry, editing the Armenian cases. He got involved in many such articles, and now he is proposing himself to mediate Karabagh entry. A historian has told him to stop in the Greek Turkish relation entry... and many other people in other entries. I have tried everything, nothing worked. I have enough of this anti-elitist position. I wanted to participate in the genocide entry, because I know a lot about it, while Coolcat is trying to color with his nationalist aim, any entries directly or indirectly involving Turkey. I have enough of making concessions, and his ignoring of those concessions... I just want him officialy out of the Armenian genocide entry, as others want him out from other enteries. I advances the cases, that for one to be respected, that person must respect you, Coolcat has only harmed Wikipedia, and I admit that I just can't smell him anymore and that he does not worth my respect. And I believe that many will come here after being warned of Coolcat new attempt, and support my position. Fadix 00:29, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What drastic changes are you talking about? I haven't posted anything since this. Are you afraid to be trapped on this [what you consider as] game yourself? The bad faith article in Wikipedia says that it does not include obvious bad faith, and saying such about you, is not against any Wikipedia rules. You have even deleted in the genocide talk entry important posts,(evidences) and now that your realise that you are the one having everything to lose in such a cases, you just drop it. But sorry, I will not on the other hand drop it. Fadix 13:49, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
