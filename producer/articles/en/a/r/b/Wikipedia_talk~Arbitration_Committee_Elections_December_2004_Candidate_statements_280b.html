<p>I do not know if this decision is of much interest or note to many, but given the already excellent slate of candidates (combined with the likely additions of David Gerard, Ambi, Michael Snow -- yes, all of you should run, in my opinion -- and probably several other good candidates I haven't envisioned), I think I should announce my intentions and this seemed as good a place as any. I do not choose to run for reelection. I have spent many a frustrating (but, I hope, productive) hour on arbitration -- I am moderately proud of my accomplishments (and humbled by the mistakes I have made). I am positive I don't want to spend the next 2 or 3 years doing this -- besides, given my apparent penchant for jumping into disputes in an attempt to settle them (and as my efforts normally fail to resolve the argument), I have to recuse myself too often to be as useful as I should be. I will likely endorse several candidates once this thing is under way, but not yet. I apologize for this long note, and I wish the current candidates well. They are taking on a noble and vital role in this wonderful project, of which no praise can be too effusive, in my opinion. Happy editing and arbitrating to all, <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 02:11, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for all you've done, Jw. In your short term on the committee, you've been fair, just, and helped keep the process moving. Furthermore, you clearly deserve the credit for the burst of activity in the last week which has seen several long-running cases closed. I had hoped you'd run for re-election, but alas, it looks like it's not to be. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:36, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I regret your decision not to run again as well. A division of labor has emerged on Wikipedia leaving a new bureaucratic hierarchy of users involved in the Foundation, the mailing list, and IRC discussions increasingly detached from the users writing our articles. Yet, you remained an active editor while still managing to emerge as one of the most accessible arbitrators. Your membership in the Arbitration Committee has been an invaluable bridge between the purpose of this project, i.e. producing a credible encyclopedia, and the governance of this project... If you're considering endorsements, I recommend users who are similarly active writers/editors and who are scholars of similar caliber (e.g., <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">User:Mirv</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">User:Neutrality</a>)...

<p>The idea was recently pitched on IRC as to having a debate between the candidates running (if we can think of questions).

<dl>
<dd>Given the number of candidates, and the fact that some people are good at IRC while others might be wholly new to it, I think it's a recipe for chaos and unfairness, personally. The concept is neat, but I don't see that a real time debate has any advantages over asking a question of candidates here and waiting for their responses. I know we have editors here who have medical conditions that affect how quickly they can type, etc. -- while of course I don't know if any of the candidates are in that position, I think it's being a little too intrusive if we force a candidate to reveal that they have a disability which would make IRC unfeasible. Maybe I'm being over sensitive, but I think it's an important consideration. That's just my two cents, <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 03:53, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mmm... if others think I should, I'll do this. My only concern is that I won't be allowed to participate in Arbitration cases if I become part of the ArcCom.

<dd>Several current members of the AC, myself included, are parties to cases presently in arbitration. In some cases, it is clear that the arbiter is not one of the parties at fault -- they're involved in bringing someone to justice. In some cases, it is perhaps less clear. Regardless, though, I don't think it should prevent anyone from running. I think, in the interests of fairness and honesty, a candidate involved in arbitration (or in past arbitration requests) should make it known, if not also provide links to the cases in question. I don't think it should be demanded of anyone, though. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 20:49, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>UC has fixed the problem, as far as I can see. I just want to note that, as an arbitrator and a non-candidate (so perhaps I am freer to speak than Raul), it is very clear to me that our injunction against Reithy prohibits his editing on this page -- an injunction is only used in the more extreme cases (or ought to be, at least), and it is therefore important that it be followed to the letter. If Reithy adds his statement back as a candidate, I believe very strongly that anyone removing it is acting in accordance with the AC's ruling (although I certainly understand why candidates might feel it a little improper to do the removing themselves). <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 01:04, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My two cents: The injunction...</p>
<ul>
<li>says he can't edit anywhere but (his arbcom case, his user talk page, his user page).</li>
<li>says that edits in the main space should be reverted on sight</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the wording there, I think that means he is not allowed to edit here, but if he does anyway, that does <b>not</b> <i>necessarily</i> merit a revert on sight. That said, his candidacy is misguided and will not succeed. -<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFennec_d10b.html" title="User:Fennec">Fennec</a> <a href="../../../f/e/n/User_talk%7EFennec_2b32.html" title="User talk:Fennec">(はさばくのきつね)</a> 03:49, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The injunction is a <i>temporary</i> injunction. In general, it's reasonable for the ArbCom to decide to deal with an immediate problem by issuing a temporary injunction even before all the evidence has been received and considered. (If all evidence had been received and considered, the committee could issue its permanent decision.) In fact, the ArbCom should, to borrow a phrase, be bold in doing so. Nevertheless, such a temporary measure is more likely to be erroneous, because it hasn't received full consideration. Therefore, it shouldn't be given effect beyond what's necessary to achieve its purpose. An election for ArbCom shouldn't be affected by the mere coincidence that a temporary injunction happens to overlap with the election period. The ArbCom should modify its injunction to allow Reithy's candidacy. I have no opinon about the merits of this specific arbitration proceeding, but I'll suggest that change at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Reithy_b074.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Reithy">Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Reithy</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 18:49, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it should stand, as it would advise voters whether or not to vote for this candidate. Additionally, it's not a personal attack, but rather a general attack, as it deals with a nation rather than a specific person. Although, I can't imagine anyone would support the candidate based on his very election premise. However, on principle, I don't think the attack should be removed. The candidate's arbitration ban on editing pages that aren't talk or relating to his case, however, is another matter. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 15:54, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, my comment. Candidates should be free to state whatever they like (subject to making libellous statements), but they must accept that if elected they would be open to scrutiny. It is only reasonable to expect them to maintain professional standards at all times. The statement that is being referred to would therefore naturally mean that, if elected, that candidate would have to remove himself from any case where one of the parties is French as that candidate would not otherwise have the appearance of being independent and objective. No doubt voters will, amongst other considerations, consider whether that is an undue impediment to that candidate being an Arbitor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the interests of balance, it is only fair to give another example. Grunt himself has stated on his own talk page that he is "anti-American". If elected, Grunt would have to remove himself from any case where one of the parties is American, as he would not be able to have the appearance of being independent and objective. No doubt voters will also consider whether that is an undue impediment to Grunt being an Arbitor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am sure voters will have many reasons for voting the way they do, and no doubt whether any Candidate can assess cases independently and objectively will be amongst the considerations of many voters. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 20:17, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly I didn't mean to make an example of you, you just happen to be near the top, and so the one I counted. I would like you to trim it to within the limits, or move it to your talk page, for one reason. The voters likely (hopefully!) want to be informed, and I don't want them feeling overwhelmed. I think 250 words is reasonable, and still alot to expect if they are going to review each and every one of us. I feel that if we are well over the guideline, many voters will failr to thoroughly review each of our platforms, which wou;ld be to the disadvantage of all. Nothing personal of course, and I do recommend moving anything important to your talk page, with a link from your platform here.

<p>According to the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">Arbitration policy</a> - "<i>Arbitrators with multiple accounts on Wikipedia will disclose the usernames of those accounts to the rest of the Committee, and to Jimbo Wales, but are not required to disclose them publicly.</i>"</p>
<p>Shouldn't this requirement be fulfilled before the election begins? If someone has additional accounts, I would think they should not run without declaring those first to the current ArbCom and Jimbo. Otherwise, the community might naively vote for someone that is involved with current or past Arbitration cases. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 23:41, 2004 Nov 17 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder how the Arbitrators running for re-election can seek to vote against the aforementioned temporary injunction, which attempts to lift restrictions and allow two users (Chuck F. and Reithy) to campaign. I beg to make the point that, any Arbitrator running for re-election has a conflict of interest, for his position must be theoretically improved by the exclusion of such candidates. Thus, would it not be more appropriate for the said Arbitrators to recuse themselves in this matter, to avoid even the <i>appearance</i> of improprieties? -- 02:24, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

Getting out the vote will help to diversify the number of viewpoints that are represented during this election, and insure that candidates who are equally qualified, though perhaps not always a part of the "in crowd", can have a fair chance of winning.</p>
<p>Don't let the insiders control this election. Please vote! --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 03:09, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The so-called <i>disendorsements</i> are now deprecated, but I believe one aspect of the page was useful. Exactly as Organizers say - it was as a handy index of candidate's past conflicts. Arbitration is the last step in dispute resolution, and I want to know how candidates themselves resolved disputes in which they were personaly involved. Because locating such examples in thousands of edits may be time consuming, I'd like to ask candidates, if they wish, to include here sample reference to past conflict/dispute/complain/... they had and resolved in a good way.</p>
<p>I allready know this info about many candidates, but because it may be useful also for other voters with different experience, I list all candidates. If you don't want to paticipate in this disclosure, please leave a short note.</p>
<p>Thank you. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimol_736e.html" title="User:Wikimol">Wikimol</a> 09:26, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've had conflicts with Nelson Ricardo over VfD, but I talked to him a lot through other channels, and eventually resolved to try to work with him on other conflicts he had with other users (e.g. on Portugal-related articles) and on projects he was interested in. I think it's important to reach out to people you have conflict with in other contexts, especiall when they have useful things to contribute and it's mostly politics you disagree on.</li>
<li>I also have conflicted with Chuck F on libertarian-related issues, partly because his versions of the articles are designed to look down on certain groups of people, and despite my efforts to talk productively with him on IRC, we were never able to work together. In fact, he went on to avoid bans that the Arbcom put on him, getting into further trouble. This difference makes clear that there are two kinds of people we disagree with on Wikipedia -- the people who have a honest and potentially serious difference in perspective, but are still civil and willing to communicate and work with you, and the people who, when they disagree, refuse any efforts at a greater understanding, and will do anything to get their way. It is crucial that we all learn to tell the difference, and do our best, regardless of circumstance, to reach out to the first type after conflict, win or lose. A lot of great people would otherwise be lost, or hurt feelings would linger. There are so many useful things to do on wikipedia that it's a great opportunity to mend bridges to reach out to people you've had conflict with. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 01:35, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why was this method of voting chosen? I'd prefer to rank the candidates myself. Where was the decision taken, when and by whom? How could it be changed for next time? <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 20:38, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know who made the decision, but it's built-in into the voting software we use. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 21:00, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mediawiki? But that's open source. It can be changed. So I can just rewrite it? Would it then be used? Where would that be decided? <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 09:50, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There was discussion about rewriting the software somewhere before. I think on <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_bef0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004">Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004</a>. But generally the voting method (if I'm not mistaken) is decided by those in charge of the election. This time, it's Danny, Elian and one more person (I think it's UninvitedCompany). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:00, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the end, there was apparently a lack of interest in making a dramatic change to the voting method so close to the election. I, too, would prefer some kind of ranked method, so I think we should continue to pursue this topic with regard to the next Wikimedia Foundation and Arbitration Committee elections. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 12:28, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
