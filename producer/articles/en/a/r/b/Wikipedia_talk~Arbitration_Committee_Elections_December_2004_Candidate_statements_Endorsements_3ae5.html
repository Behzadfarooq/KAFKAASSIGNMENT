<p>Can someone clarify whether this page is even meant to exist? I think it's a fine idea, but I don't want to go endorsing anyone unless it's supposed to be part of the process. Who can endorse people, for example? Only people running? Can people run a negative campaign here where the specifically disendorse other candidates? I hope not on the last one! Or are we to make up the procedure as we go along and set a precident? Arg, too many questions, I think I'll err on the side of conservatism and wait. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 10:38, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some people made public endorsements as part of the last election. Certainly if we have endorsements, then anyone can make them, not just the candidates. I would just point out that there are at least six positions open (actually seven now, because Camembert has indicated that he will not continue after the end of the year), so even if some people only endorse three or four candidates, they need to think hard about who else they are willing to support. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:33, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't like the section—I'd prefer to see this run entirely by secret ballot—but since there was support for it, I tried to mitigate its effects. Whoever our anonymous friend is (and his style is familiar), I'm not happy with the way he dragged up Sam's political views, and I don't think a user's political views should have any bearing on their candidacy. Those arbitrators with strong and unpopular opinions have not shown any faults in their arbitration. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 23:57, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>When I saw his/her posting, I did not see it as dragging up Sam Spade's political views but rather highlighting his trollish behavioral patters. (The link added <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESpleeman_Sam_Spade_08bb.html" title="User:Spleeman/Sam Spade">User:Spleeman/Sam Spade</a> which focuses on behavior as opposed to politics.)

<dd>Well, the better part of that page is about biases, with only a few notes on behavior. It's fair to express concerns about a candidate's behavior, yes, but linking to a page that goes on at length about a user's political and religious biases isn't the best way to do that I think. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 00:55, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I personally was ambivalent about endorsements in August, but I've made my peace with them. In a field of so many candidates (and considering how many positions we have to fill), I think it's very reasonable that a user would want guidance on which of these names truly have the respect of the community. While this endorsements page is perhaps not an ideal way of handling that problem, I can't think of a better one. It is difficult, of course, to endorse without feeling as though you are slighting the other candidates. I'm simply relying on the fact that, with a very few exceptions, I respect and like all of these candidates and would not be upset to think that they were a part of the AC -- I hope and trust that the users I do not endorse are aware of my respect for them, and that they will not take my silence on their behalf as an intended slight. I try to endorse only where I feel there are significant reasons why a user is particularly well-suited to the AC, and I hope I offend no one by doing so....if I do, please tell me. As far as "oppose" votes, I would prefer that they not appear (I hate all forms of negative campaigning) -- they create too much friction, and I don't think they're necessary. But I don't see any reason to remove them unless they take the form of a personal attack. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 00:58, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm very surprised you'd not be upset were someone who <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_231f.html#Sam_Spade" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements">claims</a> "Civility is vital" yet less than 3 weeks ago used the Wikipedia email system/function to send me the following email (edited, original was explicit): <i>"F*** off, you ignorant rat bastard"</i> would be part of the AC. I can understand you personally excusing that sort of behavior from an editor who is a friend, but for a position of trust and responsibility such as a seat on the AC, I'd think any ethicly-inclined person would insist on only seating AC members who lack even a <i>hint</i> of trollishness, much less established histories. --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:40, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Two comments -- one, I did note there were "a very few exceptions", so please don't pretend that I have blanket-endorsed every candidate in this field (nor that it is obvious who I feel the exceptions are). Secondly, I don't think this is the right forum to reopen that conversation and issue with me -- you've already made your comments on the endorsements page, and I'm getting tired of being badgered by you over who I do and don't like here, and over which misbehaviors you wish me to attend to. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 20:46, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree. Only allowing positive comments would only benefit those few who count on knowledge of their troublesome histories not being commonplace. An open, free market of knowledge of every candidates history is the only fair and responsible way to consider each candidate. That some candidates find their history burdensome or their alliances to be albatrosses about their necks is proof enough that candidate histories are relevant and should be available to all interested parties on the endorsement page. As in real politics, candidates with skeletons in their closets should be prepared to face and account for their past actions; it's only reasonable. And also like real politics, it's generally those with the ugliest pasts or most embarrassing alliances that cry the loudest for censorship.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 02:48, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that these so called skeletons in people's closets can just be figments of other people's imaginations. I encourage you to take any candidate that you feel has a skeleton in their closet through the arbitration process itself, so the presence or lack of such skeletons can be decided in a fair and impartial venue. Until someone is taken through arbitration, any such allegations about misbehaviour are really just FUD in my book.</dd>

<dd>As far as "alliances" go, I hope that's not in reference to myself, but as I'm the one listed at the top of this section, I guess there's a strong posibility that it is. I strongly reject the idea I have anything to hide. I could have very easily not endorsed Sam, and nobody would be any the wiser. It's quite possible some of the candidates running have chosen not to endorse people on the basis that doing so would harm their candidacy, I don't know. All I know is that I knew it would likely harm my candidacy, but I decided to do so anyway, because I believed (and still believe) it's unethical to not do so. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 03:06, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have little to say about specific candidates that I have not already said on the endorsements page. Considering the state of the arbitration process and the low esteem a good number of wikipedians have for it, that a candidate has so far not been through arbitration is not a good indication of the quality or desirability of that candidate. But their history is. Learning about a user's history at wikipedia is a difficult, time consuming and risky process, and not all editors are capable enough to perform a comprehensive discovery. Add to that the intentional efforts of some to bury or disguise their past and mislead newbies with false pretenses. That is one simple reason why censorship in the form you proposed in any relevant discussion on wikipedia is a poor idea.</dd>

As there are no rules layed out, I obviously have to agree that anything goes for this election. Hence my confusion as to why I was considered to be pro-censorship, because I don't think I am.

If Camembert is going to have the time, that's fine - but I don't believe an "umm...wait and see..." answer is acceptable - at least unless the answer is given before the elections take place. It's been our biggest problem so far - if he doesn't have the time to do the job - or isn't sure he'll have time - then perhaps it's time he stood aside in favour of someone else. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:26, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Camembert was appointed by Jimbo for a two or three year period (I can't recall which). Accordingly, he does not need to seek re-election, and he can resign if and when he pleases.

<p>I now suggest that we change the name of this page to Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Endorsements AND PERSONAL ATTACKS.

<p>Why would someone vote for a nominee whom they have never heard of and don't know anything about? People who are going to vote will do so for the candidates who they are familiar with, who they have a good history with.

<dd>As I stated above, by only allowing positive comments you would only benefit those few who count on knowledge of their troublesome histories not being commonplace. An open forum of information that includes discussion of a candidate's history, even when it is negative, is certainly fair and balanced if editors are being allowed provide their endorsement and justification thereof. That some candidates find their history burdensome or their alliances to be albatrosses about their necks is proof enough that candidate histories are relevant and should be available to all interested parties on the endorsement page. Candidates with skeletons in their closets should be prepared to face and account for their past actions; their own candidacy makes discussions of relevant facts a matter of good netizenship, not ad hominem.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 05:43, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shorne's arrival here lays bare the very real possibility that this page could simply become a trolls' playground.

<p>Since the level of dialogue and civility here is getting dangerously low, I suggest we address it by moving all statements on this page to the user namespaces of the people who have posted on it, and reduce the page to a list of users who have such "endorsement pages".

<dd>Amazing.

Again I'm profoundly disappointed at the level of censorship and cynical manipulation here. I'm for removing the redirect and restoring the discussion; it was a valuable source of independent information on the candidates, that is not available anywhere else.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:22, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. The system now is confusing, although the discussions page wasn't much better, as people may have thought it was where people voted for a candidate. There has to be a central discussion area specifically for the ArbCom elections and about the candidates. This is an election, is it not?

<p>There's already a "central clearinghouse" of endorsements, and if you want to add to the information you can add more endorsements of your own, and if you want to have discussion prompted by those endorsements, each of those endorsement pages has (or can have) a talk page. Nothing has been censored, and if you think centralization is necessary for freedom of information and discussion, I think you are seriously misunderstanding the way Wikipedia works at all. We do not have one central place for anything, really. By this kind of logic, we would prohibit everybody from discussing the election anywhere but on the one "authorized" discussion page, because that's the "proper" place where such discussions "belong". Not exactly what I would call freedom. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 17:35, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It hasn't been prohibited. What I've done is distribute the material that was simply endorsements (or anti-endorsements) of candidates.

<dd>Do you really think it's an improvement that users now have to click and visit 35 pages to get the same information they previously did on just one? Do you think that users will have the patience to make all those clicks to reach all those separate pages in the user namespaces? No. It now ambiguates the information, not disambiguates. Breaking it out in a manner done nowhere else on wikipedia that I've seen is censorship, pure and simple. It's prevents interaction and discussion. It's a cynical attempt at marginalizing discussions that some people do not want to take place. And no one has said that discussion could not take place elsewhere, that's a straw man.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:49, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Felonious. Spreading discussion over many namespaces is an attempt at censorship, it is a needless hindrance for voters to go through and is totally counter-intuitive. Each candidate having a page of discussion within the ArbCom process is not limiting other discussions from taking place, and to suggest that it is is laughable. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 19:37, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the definitions of censorship being thrown about here are what's laughable.

Several people above agreed that the page was being problematic. As I've repeatedly said, if you want to have real discussion, you can try that approach on an appropriate page, but the endorsements need to be better organized and this will actually be <b>more</b> helpful to voters who don't have the inclination to wade through a laundry list of all endorsements on one page. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:52, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This isn't about "disambiguation", and I fail to see how there's anything ambiguous about putting the endorsements on linked pages. It's about having a manageable page (already approaching 32 KB and just wait when more endorsements come in). The distributed version keeps the playing field level and makes it easier for interested readers to select the information they consider relevant, instead of having to slog through all of it. It's also far more conducive to a civil atmosphere. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:11, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When endorsements were initially posted, they were grouped by the endorser. It was also done this way in the last election. Only later was the listing grouped by candidates added. The point of having a list by endorser is that many people will be just as interested in seeing all of the candidates endorsed by X as they are in seeing how many people endorse candidate Y. After all, we are electing at least six and quite possibly more people here, and it can be helpful to get an idea of the slate of candidates an endorser would recommend. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:26, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

The original format of the endorsements page was the proper venue to present endorsements and justifications for granting or withholding them. It's current format creates ambiguation prevents discussion.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>stifles discussion</b> - moving any potential discussion to remote pages inhibits the free exchange of ideas</li>
<li><b>obfuscates</b> - users now must click on <u><b>49</b></u> links and visit <b>49</b> pages, each time returning here (<b>98</b> clicks in all), just to get the same information they previously did on just one page.</li>
<li><b>censors</b> - removing formatting from the comments left by users is nothing more than vandalism conducted under a false pretense. Each of us has the right to speak our mind regarding candidates and their competency (or incompetency) in whatever voice or tone we choose within the terms of the policies. If someone feels strongly either way, they should be able to convey that, either by words or by formatting.</li>

And not one of your comments here address the numerous and quite specific objections to the obvious flaws of your version of the page; hence I too could say with even more authority <i>"that kind of reactionary insistence on flawed ideas is not a good way to reach consensus."</i></dd>

<dd>If you don't see the other users that oppose the original format, then you haven't read this talk page very carefully. If you go back and re-read it, perhaps you'll also see where we have pointed out the original version's flaws. No, I'm not claiming any official authority, but neither do you have any right to dismiss our concerns. I have tried to address the problems by offering and suggesting several compromises. You have not. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 01:29, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding compromise: Since you've held yourself out as an example and standard of compromise here, and considering your own actions here today- one revert war, vandalism of other editor's comments, forcing your unique formatting on the discussion and hence, thereby effectively killing all discussion, then no, by that measure, I do not compromise in any way like you do. I only seek to have the page remain in it's original, standard format, not your highly unusual format. I ask for nothing more than the page being left as it was originally intended. It is you who seek a special exemption from the norm, and so it is you who need to compromise instead of the trollish inflexibility and intractability that you've demonstrated today.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 06:06, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Snow also admitted, at "Talk:Discussions", that he had been aware of the discussion in this forum. Yet he just unilaterally deleted "Discussions" without even mentioning his action here, let alone discussing it and seeking anything like consensus. FeloniousMonk is absolutely right in pointing to Snow's transparent attempts to stifle discussion and censor comments that may be inimical to the personal interests of certain members of the cabal. Snow's attempts to look democratic here ring hollow in view of his unilateralism. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 19:37, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't appreciate the unilateral decision to bury my endorsements and opposition on an obscure subpage under my user page, where no one will ever read them, especially before asking me if it was OK. What was the motivation for wanting to hide my comments about the candidates?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If this election is to be free and fair, then in the "public square" that the candidate discussion page represents, everyone should be allowed to make their opinions known. Please restore my comments to the public discussion page where potential voters can read them without having to click on dozens of links before a potential voter can see what I have to say.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the comment someone made about how clicking on subpages only requires a click on one link. This comment is demonstrably dishonest - potential voters will have to click on dozens of links above mine, or below mine, (depending on the order they are going through the other user's endorsements) before they get to mine. Most users will become impatient and stop clicking long before they get to my endorsements. Hence why I posted on the central discussion in the first place - so my comments would be read!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Excerpts from other pages get read much more frequently than links. (Many popular news sites and blogs illustrate this every day, by excerpting what they link to in order to entice the reader to bother clicking on the link.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I made endorsements of Neutrality and blankfaze, and they do not appear on the candidate subpages that were recently created. Since the person doing this move wasn't super careful about moving this material around without losing some of it, those two candidates lost some endorsements that they would otherwise have.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "consensus" on redistributing comments on a single page into many subpages seems weak. And who appointed Michael Snow the "boss" of the candidate endorsements discussion page in the first place? His statements that he would continue his actions despite the wishes of others doesn't seem very wiki-like. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 00:28, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Michael Snow suggested that I "pipe" my endorsements into my link on his centralized link page of endorsements. I disagree with his assessment of linking vs. a central page (for the reasons I gave above), but if this is as far as he is willing to compromise, so be it. (I still vote to return to the original centralized format.) --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 00:43, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well Michael Snow also saw fit to create and edit pages in our personal name spaces without our permission, an act I consider highly inappropriate and trollish at best and vandalism at worst. Taken with his his revert war earlier today and repeated refusal to compromise or take seriously anyone's concerns that do not align with his plan, and you can see a pattern that establishes what sort of reasonableness you can expect from him. I'm trying to determine if he is acting in some sort of official capacity and therefore just enforcing mandate, or just his personal notions.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 01:24, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>stifles discussion</b> - moving any potential discussion to remote pages inhibits the free exchange of ideas</li>
<li><b>obfuscates</b> - users now must click on <u><b>49</b></u> links and visit <b>49</b> pages, each time returning here (<b>98</b> clicks in all), just to get the same information they previously did on just one page.</li>
<li><b>censors</b> - removing formatting from the comments left by users is nothing more than vandalism conducted under a false pretense. Each of us has the right to speak our mind regarding candidates and their competency (or incompetency) in whatever voice or tone we choose within the terms of the policies. If someone feels strongly either way, they should be able to convey that, either by words or by formatting.</li>

<p>I'd support any solution where identical contents is at <b>one place</b>. I´m little upset my addition is now spread to several pages, and if I want to add something I have to find where it have gone and edit several copies. And due to redirs and reverts to "one big page" new instances may occur.</p>
<p>IMO the endorsements and discussion are different enough to allow existence of distinct pages. Endorsement lists should be located in user namespaces. And in election space I'd like <i>discussion</i> pages, possibly structured similarly to RfC pages. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimol_736e.html" title="User:Wikimol">Wikimol</a> 00:55, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any election is contentious, because an election represents a clash of points of view. An election is not the same activity as writing an article.</dd>
<dd>If we didn't want any contention, why not just ask Jimbo to appoint a few good buddies of his to the committee, and avoid the hassle altogether? (Personally, I would have no problem with that, because he's the one paying for the site!)</dd>
<dd>Short of dispensing with the election and appointing folks, the election should be run fairly for both the candidates AND the voters.</dd>
<dd>I'm hoping this campaign has room for the opinions of the voters to be expressed freely, openly, and without repression. And if those opinions can be expressed in a "public square" for all to see, all the better. If we are to keep our opinions to ourselves, what's the point of campaigning for election? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 06:23, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm uncomfortable with this page, but I am not going to argue about it. But, my main concern is that it should not appear to the casual viewer to be a votes page. Not only will mean that the page becomes a pre-vote-vote but it may mean that some legitimate votes will be put here instead of made using Special:Boardvote. I would not like to think that some contributors might not get their say in the election because of this potential confusion. If at any time, this page looks too much like the request for adminship page - then this could be the result.

<dd>Indeed, there <i>is</i> nothing preventing anyone on my side from seeking out their own like-minded support- other than behaving ethically. Isn't that what you meant? That you fail to recognize that your behavior is ethically challenged is not surprising considering your past actions today here, the liberties you've taken in our personal user name spaces, as well as your censorship in editing endorsements other than your own. Your arrogation of other's positions is as galling as your assuming that no one here would object. The abject unethical of nature of your POV lobbying suffices to rebut your arrogation of support, and heavily discounts any that may respond to your overtures.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 07:20, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Basic ethics and fair play dictate at a minimum full disclosure from candidates for the Arbitration Committee who vote in this survey. Giving ethical concerns their full due would require the candidates to abstain from voting in the survey, as it is a clear conflict of interest. Since one already has, and I'm dithering whether the ethical requirement for avoiding conflicts of interest actually trumps the need to avoid the perception of censorship, I've placed a disclosure and potential conflict of interest footnote for that vote, and suggest all other Arbcom candidates who may yet vote in the survey receive similar footnotes.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 18:47, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC) ä</p>

<p>VeryVerily, please do not unilaterally revert other user's contributions without discussion on the talk page.</p>
<p>Michael Snow suggested that I "pipe" my endorsements into my link on his centralized link page of endorsements. I disagree with his assessment of linking vs. a central page of endorsements (for the reasons I gave above), but if this is as far as he is willing to compromise, so be it.</p>
<p>If you delete my posting on the endorsements page again, without first gaining a consensus to do so, you are only further illustrating why it is a good idea to oppose your candidacy for the Arbitration Committee. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 05:36, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, at the time there was only one user (DV) who had done this, which made it rather one-sided: all other users had their endorsements on a separate linked page, but a single one featured with great prominence. This was obviously not a very equitable arrangement.

<dd>I'm well aware of all this; the thing is that I've also endorsed Theresa knott, and she's wished me luck (but not given a full endorsement). So in my endorsement of other users section, I added a Theresa knott subsection (just cut and pasting from the original page). I know that other users' endorsements of me are now succesfully merged, because I did it myself.

<dd>I oppose any such attempts to allow candidates to get away with controlling how other people choose to organise their comments. This is a public page, and people should be free to organise their endorsements based on how they (the community) want and not the person they're endorsing wants. While this is almost certainly not censorship, it certainly smacks of it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 15:08, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a suggestion. I propose that the "Endorsements listed by candidate" section only include endorsements – not anti-endorsements, long comments, rebuttals, etc. But the "Listing of individuals making endorsements" section may include anything. This seems like a happy medium to me, and solves the Sam Spade problem too.

<dl>
<dd>I think to get around this whole issue, we just rename this as "Comments on the candidates" or something like that, because I think including "anti-endorsements" on a page titled "Endorsements" is just weird and quite non-descriptive. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 15:11, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Concur with Johnleemk -- it's helpful to have a place to leave any kind of comment on those running, positive, negative, or other. Life is messy, but it's important to be able to face one's critics, fair or not, in an open forum. When we're running for office of some kind, we should expect people to talk about us. This is a better spot than any other for that conversation to take place. The bottom section is too split up for conversation to occur. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 20:49, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This idea seems weighed in favour of the candidate, only positive endorsements? You will be sanctioning a huge rewrite of this page. Free discussion of a candidate must occur in the ArbCom election space, and be free of a candidates desire for "blanking". A candidate can enter a debate at will, that is a free exchange of opinions. Ambiguation of informatiom about a candidate is not something I support. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 15:16, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the idea, Quadell.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If a candidate only wants endorsements on their own user page, that is quite fair.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that both sections on the common endorsements page are tentatively free for any user to post their opinions on, either for or against.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The exceptional case of Sam Spade wanting to delete all declarations of opposition from the shared candidate endorsement listing only reflects poorly on his candidacy. Somehow all of the other candidates have a thick enough skin that they can take a little criticism, but not Sam Spade. So, I don't see why some users are upset and want to prevent Sam from doing this to himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For my own part, I'm unsure why Sam Spade thinks it's to his benefit to appear to want to censor what people have to say about him, but if he wants to do so, why not let him? We aren't really being censored by this, because we can still offer our endorsement or opposition under our own name, <i>on the same page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the users who object are intractable on this issue, I suspect this entire page is doomed, as a power user will shortly come in and delete the thing, refactoring everyone's opinions back into subpage oblivion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I like your motivation of trying to address this issue creatively, Quadell, but changing the entire page format just to suit Sam Spade shooting himself in the foot seems to be a bit much.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please, do you have another idea in that bag of ideas you have sitting there?</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it isn't just for Sam. That's more of a happy side-effect for me. The problem, as I see it, is that people are treating this as a vote or a strawpoll. It's neither. An endorsement page is useful -- it shows what people or groups support a candidate. But a pre-vote? An open declaration of how people will vote? I'm not sure that's useful.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps a separate page is warranted? Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Attack_ads or Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/dirt or something. But "comments on the candidates" is looking like a "support" vs. "oppose" straw poll, and it's hard to see how that serves the voter or the candidate. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"></a> – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"><b>Q</b>uadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_Request_for_assistance_8d8c.html" title="User:Quadell/Request for assistance">help</a>)</sup>[[]] 21:10, Nov 22, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No fair-minded or constructive suggestions along these lines will be acceptable to users Shorne or FeloniousMonk. This is a wiki, and as such, there will always be disruptive elements to content with. There are some users who will take any oppertunity to yell their venom at others. You will notice that user Lir, who is not one of the better liked users among us, is also running, yet no one is placing a thousand "opposing endorsements" under his section. To do so would just be silly and trollish, a waste of everyone's time.

<dd>Sam, it's rather clever of you to "want to be left out of this obscene troll war" when it hinges entirely upon your demand that nothing appear under your name (no other candidate has demanded this), and some other users equally intractable demand that they must be allowed to post in that spot.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Sam is asking that nobody <i>endorses</i> him. This is because 172 and shorne both opposed ShaneKings adminship because he endorsed Sam. Now it's quite possible that Sam would rather not see negative comments either, but that's not actually what he said. Consider the following senario - happyuser sees this page and decides to endorse Sam. Sam cannot put "This user is a troll obscenly warring with other trolls" under the endorsement because happyuser is just a geniune straight up user who is unaware of the danger he is putting himself in (I'm exageratting for dramatic effect here, please humour me). Some time later, happy user is nominated for adminship and is opposed because of his endorsement of Sam. This is what sam is saying he is trying to prevent. (Well that's my interpretation of it). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 15:57, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Without anti-endorsements all of wikipedia may be hurt. Just because you might act politely to some people doesn't mean that you always act civily.

What matters isn't the number of good vs bad comments or if their from some big name user or from someone who rarely edits, but the type of information given, and how it relates to a candidate's ability to serve the community. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 20:41, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Your concerns are why I suggested that the endorsements or anti-endorsements be by IP address. If those people want extra security they could use a computer that they usually don't use for wikipedia. But you dismiss IP addresses as unworthy of any respect. I want to know if there's anything about a candidate that I don't already know, that <i>is</i> important, and I don't care who says it. Some people think that pointing out the history of a canidate for whatever position on other users pages is spamming, but electoriial propaganda isn't? <i>Come on.</i> Well then, we need somewhere to voice our concerns, without such a <i>public</i> forum this election would be a fraud.

A reasonable election process requires checks and balances. The combination of countenance and opposition within discussion create balance. Censorship of that discussion in favor of only endorsement is detrimental to the election process since such a behavior creates an imbalance through the removal of opposition, a check. If you are a candidate, you are a "public figure" and you are subject to public scrutiny. There is no escaping that. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 10:57, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>...hence my opposition to this page altogether; however, the oxymoronic state is dependent on the definition of "endorsements." If, for instance, "endorsements" means "signatures that validate something" then any signed opinion of a candidate counts a signature that validates a candidate... as a candidate. If "endorsements" means "promotional statements" regarding candidates, then that is simply contrary to Wikipedia's NPOV policy. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 11:27, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia's NPOV policy is for <i>articles</i>. I don't see how it's relavent here, the whole point of having a page like this is for people to express thier POV. The title of this page is certainly a problem. Note that some users have recieved no endorsements at all yet. Take Lir for example. I could write under Lir's heading - oppose - candidate is not serious.But that isn't to my mind an endorsement, so i wouldn't do it. Some other people may have no endorsements because they are simply not well known. If we go for a ranking system then I would rank an unknown but serious candidate over a well known but joke candidate, but I wonder how a user who doesn't know lir would vote? They have nothing on this page to go on. Perhaps if we moved the page to "Wikipedian's discussion of the candidates" or some such thing we would reflect how the page is actually beoing used rather than how it was intended to be used when initially set up? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 11:50, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, Theresa, NPOV policy dictates that Wikipedia editors present information in a manner befitting an encyclopedia. That is, the display of the major opinions concerning candidates must be allowed in order for readers to construct informed ideas about candidates.

<li>My Lord there is a lot of opposition here! I suppose other people must see a very different side of Sam than me, but in my dealings with him I've gone from thinking of him as a right twat (Sorry Sam, that was my first impression) to respect. It's true that he has some negative qualities, but he has some positive ones too. He is brave, is not intimidated by anyone, and stands up for what he believes in. Always going up for election? What are you talking about? Oh do you mean admin? If that's the case then you should no that he was nominated by someone else. Questionable tactics? He put Vote Sam for Arbiter in his signature - I suppose you could argue that anything anyone questions is questionable, but it should at least be clearly stated here what he did. (Otherwise casual visitors might think it was something much worse). I honestly don't know if Sam would make a good arbitrator or not. I suspect he probably would but I'm not sure enough to endorse him. I just wanted to point out to anyone reading this page that he is not hated by everyone, and to wish him best of luck. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 18:07, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>Oh yeah - one more thing, Sam is right about "mailing lists". There were certain people who tried to rally opposition against him for adminship.

See this vote on VFA "<i>Support - I wasn't going to vote here because from the time I first saw the vote it has been clear that consensus isn't going to be reached this time round (and I very rarely vote here anyway). But with the recent posts to various talk pages - something I can only describe as a smear campaign - I have decided to belatedly add my support for Sam.

<dd><b>1</b>True, I was simply pointing out that <i>he</i> didn't instigate it. Also since he came 8th in the last AC election and there are possibly 9 places up for grabs is it so unreasonable to run again?

<dd><b>2</b>I am not suggesting that your opinions should not be aired (and if I gave that impression then I apologise). I was merely trying to make sure a casual reader was clear about what he had actually done.</dd>
<dd><b>3</b> He doesn't need proof for a comment he made on a persons talk page. It's not as if he was making a formal complaint - he was just chatting.

<p>I support the "endorsement" and "disendorsement" dual-page edit, creating a separate page for each set of opinions. (Although I'm not so sure about the word "disendorsement" - my dictionary doesn't have that word - perhaps it would be better to rename "disendorsement" to "opposition"?)</p>
<p>For my part in authoring this page, I will admit that it was starting to creak under its own weight.</p>
<p>Now that I can see the unified opposition on the "disendorsements" page, without a bunch of "support" entries interleaved that dilutes their overall effect, I think the opposition would do well to leave this new organization as is.</p>
<p>The original problem I had with Michael Snow's subpage organization onto many user pages was that one would conceivably have to click through dozens of links to read everyone's comments.</p>
<p>This edit has only added one additional link, so it's still possible to read everyone's comments without getting out a compass to navigate your way around.</p>

<dd>I don't give a flying crap either way, because I'm quite annoyed by all this endorsement and disendorsement business. However, I've reverted Gzornenplatz's edit that reinstated the disendorsements, as consensus appears to be to put this stuff on a separate page — even Jimbo and the organising committee have stepped in, so I suppose that's good enough reason to revert. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:51, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May I highly recommend, however, that at the very least the "Endorsements" page should have a direct link to the "Disendorsements" page? It would actually be preferable to have a link at the head of <i>each</i> candidate's section to the corresponding section on the opposing page. I realize that many people are not happy that we <i>have</i> such 'disendorsements' at all but I am afraid that trying to discourage people's expressions of misgivings or distrust, treat them as inherently less valuable, et cetera, leaves at best a bad taste of shady dealing in people's mouths (and could there be a situation where that is more important to be avoided than the <b>ArbCom</b> election??) And at worst it is shooting the messenger, ignoring warnings about people who truly shouldn't be on the ArbCom.</dd>

<dd>The only ones I know of are you and Xed. The election organisers and Jimbo have made official statements on that page, implicitly indicating they prefer its usage than this one for disendorsements, although they also made it clear they'd rather not have any disendorsements at all. At least two users on this page have explicitly stated they prefer this format. Two plus one plus plus three equals six. One plus one equals two. I'm rolling back your edit, in particular because of the loss of quite a bit of discussion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 18:35, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, but that still doesn't mean there's a consensus. This wasn't even discussed long enough to possibly come to that conclusion. I'm sure there are people who will object to it and haven't even <i>seen</i> the removal of the material. This is an attempt at a <i>fait accompli</i>, especially since you seem to think those who want to revert it are responsible for merging in the changes made after your nonconsensual removal. I dispute this; it was wrong to do such a change without properly discussing and waiting for consensus, so it's up to you to repair it. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 19:19, Nov 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that we're even discussing this shows how hopelessly oppressive Wikipedia has become. It should be obvious that open discussion—positive, negative, and neutral—is essential if the election is to be meaningful. Yet efforts by fair-minded people like me to provide a single forum (I called it "Discussion") have been crushed, and now the ghetto called "Disendorsements" is prefaced with all sorts of nasty commentary that practically likens dissenters to axe murderers. Very Orwellian. Sadly, also very typical of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 04:44, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jimbo made it known that he disapproves of what is happening on these two pages several days ago, and yet an amazing number of contributors have chosen to ignore him completely. I'm still getting the hang of the Wiki way, and I guess part of the Wiki way is that anyone should feel comfortable ignoring Jimbo.</p>
<p>But while you go on ignoring Jimbo's advice, please consider these points for a moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several experienced users have surprised and disappointed me, by managing to embarass themselves on these pages. I wish I hadn't seen some of it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The original, utopian possibility that these pages could serve as a forum for the free and fair exchange of ideas, about the candidates and their views, centered around questions that would help to reveal the inner character and thought processes of the candidates, is now in shambles. It was naive to expect a thoughtful, public examination of the candidates, in such a large Wiki.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If I didn't know better from editing the articles I have participated in, and from looking at so many other article edit histories, these pages would mistakenly lead me to think that this community is rife with back-stabbing dirty tricks, paranoia, hypocrisy, and all manner of acrimony and bitterness. But the truth is that the vast majority of editors respect and admire each other.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>These pages are being archived on many mirrors and forks for posterity, and for many other purposes you may not be aware of. Do you really want the archives of this site, far into the future, to reflect that your name was attached to some petty alliance, grievance, or perceived slight? Do you realize how easily anyone on the internet can find these pages using Google?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I will continue discussions in other forums, about other ways to reform this site, I have come around to respect Jimbo's judgment that these pages are doomed to failure, and will not improve the site.</p>
<p>I don't expect that anyone who is still reading these pages will change their minds, but I sign my name below under the following statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Good grief. Life is too short for this argument. Please delete both pages.</i></dd>

<p>This is a rather simple decision, and it shouldn't be too hard to come to an agreement on. We're supposed to be the creme-of-the-crop here, conflict-wise.

<dd>If enough people think Jimbo isn't sufficiently benevolent, they'll fork wikipedia with success. I don't think there's anything to worry about, any problems are self correcting. The fact that there's currently no forks that have anywhere near the popularity of wikipedia suggests Jimbo doesn't overstep the bounds of benevolence in the minds of most users. Since you asked for my view, I think that Jimbo probably errs too far on the side of benevolence and not far enough on the side of dictator at times. Even here, he hasn't forced the disendorsements to stop, he's only asked people not make them. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 07:33, Nov 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

You seem to be terribly harsh on Theresa simply because she said she respects Sam Spade). We all have our weaknesses, and people view them differently, while some may not even have viewed them yet. Theresa may respect Sam because she has not come across his uncivil side yet like I (and some others) have (at least, that's the perception I get, since she's stated before that she hasn't come across his rudeness yet). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:29, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

My opinion of him, is based on my experience of him. Clearly you have a very different opinion, probably because you have had a different experience of him.

<dd>Consider the following fictional senario. The whole AC are a bunch of powergrabbing corrupt idioctic morons, who are in cahoots with the board of trustees - who are also morons and corrupt. The ordinary wikipedians are very unhappy about this and want to get rid of the lot of them. Several users put themselves up for election. The AC decrees that all those candidates are disqualified for being POV pushers. (The AC decides on people's behaviour, if they decide someone has a history of POV pushing then that's it) Everyone except the current members of the AC is disqualified by them so the ordinary voters have no choice but to vote the old AC back in.</dd>

<p>People have callled me a troll a time or two myself, particularly when I first came here (now only the least agreeabl;e of users do it, which tells me more about them than it does about myself). The term is almost never used as defined @ <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">internet troll</a>, but when I do use it, I try very hard to use it according to that definition. Maybe thats because I never heard the word in that usage before coming here. The message boards and so forth I have used promptly banned anyone making trouble, something we could learn from, they didn't need to make up words to describe them. All this talk of "censorship" and "freedom of speech" is a joke, nobody is stopping you (those invoking those terms) from making your own "troll-o-pedia", but we ought to do something about removing you from our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, so that we can go back to trying to make an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>.

<dd>Sam Spade reminds me of the outspoken fanatic Christian snakecharming preachers in the Deep South. He'll probably start challenging people to a duel soon if he doesn't get his way. Instead of being more capable of abusing power, which he's already shown intent to do, perhaps he should be president of the United States? After all, it is a position worthy of his imagination. What we ought to do with Wikipedia is ban POV Warriors, like Sam Spade, or at least prohibit them from editing articles. Personal mediation, public mediation and arbitration hasn't worked thus far with Sam Spade and is unlikely to work in the future. The cure to his illness is to not satiate his desires.

<p>My philosophy on use of the word Troll is that I would always avoid using it.

<p>Judging by your recent deletion of all comments related to your candidacy, apparently Sam you don't consider it vandalism to remove the comments of others from a Talk page. But vandalism it is. People have just as much a right express why they do not support a candidate as they have the right why support a candidate; indeed such freedom of speech is a necessary adjunct to a fair and competitive <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">election</a>. That you do not care for the public scrutiny of your behavior that comes with a public election is no justification for deleting the comments of others regarding your competency for the office for which you run. Your removing yourself as a candidate would be the only justification for such an action.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:04, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I wrote earlier in response to Jimbo's opinion at the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_Disendorsements_0591.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Disendorsements">Candidate statements/Disendorsements page</a>, I strongly believe in the free exchange of information and ideas, and was under the impression that such a free market was a wiki ideal.</p>
<p>In order for democratic <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">elections</a> to be fair and competitive, opposition must enjoy the right to freedom of speech as necessary to voice their criticisms of the candidates openly and to bring relevant information to the voters. If this freedom is not granted or is in any way restricted, the election will not reflect the legitimate views of the voters. In other words, voters must has free access to <i>all</i> relevant candidate information, even that which is negative, in order to make informed decisions and place an informed vote. Thus, for any voter to cast an informed vote, access to all relevant candidate information, even negative, is not a luxury, but a necessity. Indeed, how else are uninformed voters to learn of hypocritical candidates who claim a high level of dedication to the policies and ideals yet who repeatedly fail to (using Jimbo's words) <i>"reach for a higher standard than the Internet usually encourages, a standard of rational benevolence and love ...in their editing, in their mailing list posts, in their irc chats, and in their private emails"</i>?</p>
<p>If seating an Arbitration Committee by informed voters casting informed votes is a goal of this process, then the information found in the opposition statements is beyond useful, it is required reading. The opposition statements should not be deleted.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:04, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see why you call it a failure. Naturally, we all should be making our own choices, digging through the user pages, contributions, and recalling all of our interactions with each candicate, to determine character and suitability for office, when we're voting. The endorsement/disendorsement ability can provide handy pointers for other angles and ways to get started, and I don't see the problem with that. Those of us who have acted childish, provided leadership, or similarly with regards to the endorsement handling have actually participated in a handy microcosm of Wikipedia society/governance, and I see no reason to freeze this process. For completeness' sake, we even have some guidance from above on the conflict. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 20:53, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd object strongly to its deletion. I don't know what "its designers had envisioned," but such is the nature of collaborative media: The community wields each tool differently, often in ways unimagined by their creators. The page does contain unfortunate attacks, but it also contains useful information and insightful discussion. Moreover, it will become moot and (presumably) subject to deletion on December 18 anyway, along with all other election material. I see absolutely no reason to hurry the process. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECribcage_bfde.html" title="User:Cribcage">Cribcage</a> 21:06, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I say it's definitely been a failure. First of all we had people putting up criticisms or downright attacks of people on a page designated for <b>endorsements</b>. ( To <b>endorse</b> is: To give <b>approval</b> of or <b>support</b> to, especially by public statement; sanction. ) Second of all the page is a complete mess. Third of all, this page serves little purpose anymore other than to provide a battleground for flame wars. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><small>BLANKFAZE</small></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">(что??)</a> 21:14, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Blankfaze has a point. Given the method of voting being used-- the approval vote software used in the last arbitration race-- we are not going to be voting "against" anyone but rather "for" as many candidates as we choose. So not stating an endorsement for a particular candidate says everything that needs to be said. Disendorsements seem pretty irrelevant. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 21:23, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's not valid reasoning. <i>Every</i> election requires voting "for" a candidate. The more salient point not addressed is the role wikipedia itself plays as a medium for the election. Is it fair and conducive to creating informed voters for wikipedia to only allow the candidate's own statements and those of supporters? Or is an open forum for the free, unhindered exchange of information about candidates more informative and fair? If wikipedia acts as a filter that only lets preordained views be heard by the public by excluding opposing and alternative viewpoints will create a structural bias in the election. Simply permitting those opposing certain candidates access to the ballot is not enough. Elections in which opposing viewpoints are not given access to the medium of discussion create biases. It seems like some here were asleep during Poli Sci.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 22:54, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To reply to your first point, I don't see any problem with redesignating it for a new purpose. It's useful information we would have. Would you have been happier if someone had moved the page from endorsements to comments? On the second point, it looks pretty well organized to me. Sections for each person's name, and presently, separate sections for different types of commentary. Third, it's useful discussion, both because it's relevant to each person to see different pictures different people paint of them with their discussion, and because the conduct of the people on the page itself says something about how they perform under stress and public scrutiny. Useful stuff. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 21:28, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd add to the above that the best way for a candidate to perform well under the stress and public scrutiny offered by the "disendorsements" comment is to ignore them. The method of voting being used only considers the sum positive support; so it makes more sense for a candidate to build brides with potential supporters, listening to their concerns about the role and the efficacy of the arbitration process rather than letting the hecklers get to him/her. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 21:38, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kim, I don't think you'll find much support for the sort of censorship you suggest here. By curtailing free speech you'll seal the fate that this election would be a sad farce; it would not be fair and competitive. By allowing candidate statements to stand but denying voters a central venue to voice criticisms of the candidates openly and to bring relevant information regarding the candidates is censorship of the highest order. Ending any centralized venue for candidates competency, both pro and con, only benefits those few candidates who dishonestly claim a high level of dedication to wikipedia's policies and ideals yet constantly abuse them, hoping that refractory voters will remain unaware of their history of transgressions. Once freedom of speech is denied or in any way restricted, the election will only reflect the will of an uninformed constituency. It will be a sham.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest anyone that thinks denying voters a centralized forum to present their opinions pro and con with relevant facts about the candidates profoundly misunderstands what a free and fair election is. They should start by reading wikipedia's own <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">Election</a> article, then continue by reading about what constitutes a free and fair election.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, nobody has established that the ability of voters to discuss both the pros and cons of candidates here is indeed an experiment as you claim. If this election is to be as fair and competitive as it's claimed, then a forum for the free exchange of candidate information other than than the sales pitches from the candidates themselves is a necessary part of reaching the goal of a and competitive election.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 22:37, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to point out that the ability to edit Wikipedia is a privilege that has been extended to you, it's not a right. If at any point there are edits which are not in line with wikipedias' goals, they can, will be, and in fact are removed (via for instance VfD, which happens to be what I'm proposing here). I think it's a bit funny to be talking about censorship in such a situation.</p>
<p>I've not seen any actual arguments why this endorsements page is useful to wikipedia so far, so I'll stay with my position for now. I will certainly listen to overriding arguments. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 23:14, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find several "actual arguments" above, made by several people. The bottom line seems to be that the endorsements may help inform people's votes. If you disagree, that's fine.

That'd destroy wikipedia if you do that!"). Or comments to the effect of "Well, it'd be great if you could take along considerations x,y, and z".

Putting this page up for VfD after you have read the arguments for it and seen the support for it, may be bold, but would be an act of bad faith. Look how many users have posted on the page. Why is that not justification enough for its existence in the context of an election? I will say again, this page needs stability. A consensus was reached, yet the attempts to delete it continue. Sigh. Ok then. If this is the way it has to be. Funny how the first comment section on this talk page has a strange symmetry with this section.

In this thread, your opinion is outnumbered by those who disagree, whether or not you like their reasons. That's to say nothing of the many people who, by posting (dis)endorsements, evidently consider the page valuable. Your answer seems to be, "I don't care. I'm deleting them anyway; and if you don't like it, you can leave." You hardly seem concerned with being polite -- or participating in a community, for that matter. <i>"That's all there is to it."</i> Indeed. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECribcage_bfde.html" title="User:Cribcage">Cribcage</a> 03:59, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo Wales and the organisers of the arbcom election have spoken out, and there are 3 different problems with the current page wrt wikipedia policy (which has been decided on by *all* of us, not just the couple of people who are replying here). So I'm weighing input from several sources, not just this thread alone. My intent is to convert whatever consensus I can determine into action on Nov 30th, and that will be the end of it, one way or the other. I welcome input on exactly what that action should be. Currently I'm defaulting to banner+protect+delete. Hopefully this slightly unpleasent default will add enough urgency for people to gain a consensus well and proper on how to fix the page. (As opposed to chatting about chatting about chatting and making a mess of it). This is often how VfD gets (ab)used on its own, but there's a bit more urgency here, hence the additional protection and banner. You can get all mad at me, and risk me succeeding, or you can try to fix the page. Sorry about this, but we're getting kinda low on time, and the page really isn't too great, I think you'll agree. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 04:15, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most here think the page is acceptable. More have spoken out in favor of maintaining the endorsements page as is, as a forum available for presenting both pro and con regarding the candidates, than against it. And Jimbo's suggestion was just that, a suggestion. Though he is the founder, his vote still only counts as one vote. So I do not recognize your urgency or see why we should accept your ultimatum. Without an official mandate no one here is compelled to recognize it. Do you have some form of special mandate to reform the Endorsement page? Are you operating in an official capacity allows you to dictate terms to us here, Kim? If so, what is it, and who appointed you and by what process? You are implying that a secretive cabal has decided the fate of the Endorsements page, against popular consensus.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 07:04, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kim, if you are unable to see why having voters educated and informed by their peers is useful to wikipedia, then perhaps you should reconsider your advocating the deletion of the page. That you and a few others find no benefit in having a forum for voters to express both their pro and con opinions and to present relevant facts does not mean that others share your opinion. Clearly many do not.</p>
<p>That informed votes are the only valid votes is the reason why wikipedia should not restrict information about the candidates. It is a point I've made repeatedly <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_Endorsements_3ae5.html#Why_A_Fair_and_Competitive_Election_Demands_Airing_of_Opposition_Statements" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Endorsements">here</a>.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 23:44, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh no no, there's absolutely no problem with people making informed votes. It's just that this particular form or way of doing it definately <i>isn't it</i>. It's the first time this particular way of doing things has been tried, and it has caused rather more heat than light. No worries, back to the drawing board and all that. If you have suggestions for alternate ways of going about informing voters, I'd love to hear them. If you have overriding reasons why this method is the One True Way, I'd love to hear them too. Please answer the questions I'm asking, not the ones you think I'm asking. I'm kind of busy this week, so I don't have as much time to explain several times over that no, I really meant literally what I said, and not a letter more or less. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 00:03, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To continue with your metaphor, heat and light are two aspects of the same thing; you're not likely to get one without the other in any election. Anyone who thinks that they can conduct a competitive and fair election without having the ugly histories of candidates brought up and discussed is living in a fantasy. To your questions, the current format is likely the best solution as possible here for a forum that allows voters post their opinions, both pro and con, learn the opinions of other voters and their justifications for holding them. It's certainly better then previous attempts and iterations. There likely is no way to make positive the necessary presentation of negative information regarding candidates considering the nature of the activities in some candidates histories. Discussing trolling, insults or dishonesty is perforce a negative activity. I see no way to make it any more palatable than it is now on the endorsements page. None the less, it is still useful and necessary despite being negative in tone; such is the nature of politics and elections.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 01:08, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Feloniousmonk, thank you for your excellent answer. It's clear, thoughtful and to the point. (there, that has to be said too sometimes&#160;:-) ).

<dd>I'd oppose in the strongest possible terms any attempt to delete or alter the present Endorsements page, as would many others here I'm sure. I pointed out below that the flaws of relying on candidate histories are all too obvious. That voters will recognize candidates behavioral patterns from a history alone is reduced to a very low order of probability considering the difficulties and the dishonesty of some candidate statements. Relying on "official" histories to judge candidates is a fatally flawed system that fails to provide for the introduction of additional insight and evidence that comes from free discourse.</dd>

<li><i>it allows personal attacks</i>: Personal attacks occur and are dealt with throughout wikipedia daily. There's no reason why genuine personal attacks are to be tolerated on the Endorsements page. Further, this is a <i>political election</i>; when someone stands for office, they can and should expect personal attacks, any claim that personal attacks on the Endorsements page are justification for deletion of the page is a specious attempt at censorship or indicates a truly naive understanding of what goes on in politics.</li>

<dd>Censorship and restricting the ability to freely discuss relevant topics are also considered anathema to wikipedia, even more so than contentious discussions over political candidacies. To argue otherwise is to ignore the myriad ongoing heated debates occuring right now across hundreds of article Talk pages on wikipedia. The Endorsement page and the opinions and information found on it, both pro and con, positive and negative, serve a useful purpose: they inform voters. No other proposed or attempted solution has matched it's ability to do so. I for one will resist any attempt to delete it or to stifle the free exchange of information of candidates.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 02:45, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any thinking that holding a semi-public election can be anything but political in nature indicates a flawed understanding of the process and naive, unrealistic expectations. Your efforts are misguided here. You may indeed like to restrict the dissemination for whatever personal reason, but I'm not finding your invocation of the founders for restricting what you've decided is undesirable speech compelling. Politicization, spillover, and personal attacks are all perforce negative activities, as are nearly all politics. Concerns over them do not trump concerns over a fair and competitive election. If the powers that be want the process of seating an arbcom to be <i>functional</i> and so wish to avoid the mess of the political campaigns that come with elections, then they should drop the pretense of holding fair elections altogether and just appoint their friends and cronies.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 06:46, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it sounds like we agree on something: appointing people would be less messy, although we disagree whether it would be a good thing. I think wikipedia would be better served by Jimbo appointing the AC (or even better, performing their function himself) than this election. I think there's a very good reason why judges are appointed rather than elected. I don't want the AC making decisions on the basis of "what will help me get re-elected", but I fear that scenario is likely to come to pass. What we need right now is an AC willing to make tough decisions in a timely manner, not one that tries to be populist. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 06:56, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not all voters have the knowledge or the time to engage in such tedious form of discovery, which conducted as you suggest would be lengthy and incomplete. A candidate's edit history leaves big gaps- it does not reflect activity in any additional accounts/sock puppets or their activities in their mailing list posts, irc chats, and in their emails. Without reading each individual post, literally thousands, and the context in which it is made, there's no easy way to tell if they are cagey trolls masquerading as legitimate users. It's easier for readers to glean useful information from the endorsements page while discerning and discounting the personal attacks (which are obvious enough on their face) than reading and understanding a candidates edit history.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 01:08, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So allow people to do the same thing as I wish the Arb Comm was changed to: post links to diffs displaying the user's behaviour, but without any editorialising allowed. My point is that people's actions should speak for themselves, and that's not actually happening. In an open community (which is hopefully what wikipedia is supposed to be), there's no need for muck raking because there's no way for people to hide things such that muck raking is required.</dd>

<dd>Besides, even if what you suggest is true, and this page does help us to get a better election result (whatever better might be), that's not enough for it to exist. The benefit has to be worth the cost. I don't think the displays of bad faith that have gone on here are worth whatever informing of the wikipedia populace it has provided. Not to mention it seems to have deeply politicised what should in theory be an apolitical position: the AC needs to not be involved in politics if it is to be (and appear to be) fair and just. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 01:18, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, well, welcome to the world of politics. I'd think an open community would support and protect open discussion on matters as critical as electing it's officers. Voters must be free to determine for themselves what constitutes muckraking and what is useful information. Each individual's idea of what is useful information and what is muckraking are likely very different. What you call "editorializing" others call stating their case, and I did not see you complaining about "editorializing" early on when the comments were all positive.</dd>

<dd>I'm not a member of any posse, thank you very much!&#160;:-P In fact I've removed my participation from the endorsements page proper to make sure that it is seen that I am not endorsing or opposing <i>any</i> candidate. That seemed to be the right thing to do. Hmm, It is quite possible to counterbalance other people's spin using the means already available to you I think. The endorsements page is really nice for what you want, but there's some downsides, unfortunately, and they outweigh the upsides. Especially since people have changed it to a format that's even less good than before comments had been made on this page. *sigh* See above for what's wrong with the current endorsements process, and why I think it needs to be terminated as quickly as possible. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 02:51, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[inserted a day after the comments directly above/bellow were issued] It certainly inspires little confidence in the impartiality of Kim Bruning with respect to this 'experiment' and its alleged failure/success. Since he is in such an overwhelming minority here, I don't see how his proposal fares a viable chance without extra- judicial powers. The question, then, perhaps should be phrased as whether wikipedians acting in an official capacity have more of a say (not the weight of their words, that is subject to interpertation – but real power) over the processes underwhich this election will be carried out <i>vis-à-vis</i> ordinary, non-official wikipedians. I am very strongly against ShaneKing's appeals for Jimbo Wales to take control as a <i>dues ex machina</i>. Perhaps I am mistaken (I hope so) and mis-interperting, but SK's approach here throughout, for that matter, strikes me as highly sycophantic. No offence. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:18, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That would have to be the first time in my life I've been called sycophantic. Generally I'm considered to be quite the opposite.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll make it clear that I think these elections only exist because Jimbo is shirking his responsibilities as a benevolent dictator. I'm sure handing the selection of the AC off to an election is easier for him, but I do not feel that it's the best thing for wikipedia. In fact, I think it shows poor judgement in this case. So I wasn't trying to suck up to Jimbo, I was criticising his actions. Sorry if that was not clear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's really a side issue anyway. My biggest complaint is that too many people are priviledging the process above the result. Democracy isn't something sacred, it's a tool. It's only useful if it gets useful results. In many scenarios it doesn't, but we've been brought up to believe "the system works" and not to question it. It's become the end rather than the means, twisted into some stupid ideology. If challenging that notion makes me a sycophant, then I'm a sycophant with a capital S. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 23:36, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say anything in the early stages? Why do I have first comment on this page asking about what the ground rules are then? When things were all positive, no damage was being done, so there wasn't any harm in having the page, even if there wasn't much benefit. Now I've seen there is harm (in both having endorsements and disendorsements), so I've changed my position somewhat. I think that's a reasonable thing to do. I'm not going to cling to some ideological position if I find it doesn't work in practice how I thought it would in theory. Throughout the process I've spoken my mind, so I reject the idea I didn't speak up.</dd>

<p>It really is that simple. If anything, these must be the cardinal rules. All the confusion and diversions aside, the rest is largely procedural. There needs to be a page, a central page, for discussions involving criticisms/oppositions and their refutations. Whether it is combined in the endorsement page or not, notwithstanding my vote on the matter, is relatively unimportant. That the 'disendorsement' page, if it is to exist on its own, needs to be accorded the same prominance as the endorsement one, is. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 06:20, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my opinion, this page should not be frozen and submitted to <a href="../../../v/f/d/VfD_4d7f.html" title="VfD">VfD</a> because doing so would violate the spirit and letter of <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_Endorsements_7c39.html#Why_I_hope_this_page_.28Disendorsements.29_will_not_be_used" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Endorsements">"Our Founder's" intent</a> which says: "The only way we can coordinate our efforts in an efficient manner to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves, is to love our work and to love each other, even when we disagree. . . . If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level." If we think that trolls have taken over this page, then it is our job, I would say, to figure out how to accomplish our goals without letting the trolls block us. Does this page do its job? When I look at this page's history and current version from <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a>'s viewpoint above, I must say that it does. This page 1) informs us well--maybe too well--of the duties and candidates for the Arbitration Committee, 2) demonstrates in a "handy microcosm" exactly the dysfunctions with which the Arbitration Committee must deal, 3) gives us, as <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> implies, the opportunity to see how each candidate deals with the kind of stress and public scrutiny that being on the Arbitration Committee would invite, and, as <a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">User:Mrfixter</a> suggests, this page 4) provides an important learning function for the voters because so many voters devoted so much time to scrutinizing and reacting to Arbitration Committee issues on this page. I also definitely agree with <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim</a>'s observation that this page has too much 1) politicization, 2) spilling over to affect other activities, and 3) allowing personal attacks. I very much wish that would not happen here or on the Wikipedia pages. But it does 8(( --here and on the Wikipedia pages where the politicization, spilling over, and personal attacks are very destructive, in my opinion. However, I see my job and our job to be finding some way to "love our work and to love each other, even when we disagree. . . . If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level." If we would freeze this page and delete it despite this page supporting incredibly the live demonstration of the candidates' abilities to do the job of the Arbitration Committee, then we would be sinking to their level of letting the trolls stop us from our job--our job of selecting and supporting a strong and effective Arbitration Committee. We may think of a better way to do that job in the future. But for now, let's not let the trolls stop us. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 07:09, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here's what I think. I know it will be unpopular, because this is a very touchy issue (I got two disendorsements based on one edit alone to this page, one from an arbitrator, and one from another user who IMO has violated the rule of civility a few times based purely on looking at his user and user talk pages), but I'll say it anyway. I believe that if we are to keep endorsements and disendorsements on the same page, we should make it a point to demand evidence (or at least a reference to the basis for one's opposition) from those who make disendorsements. Not providing evidence (i.e. just saying "Strongly oppose" or "Fox in the henhouse") is tantamount to a personal attack, because it is an attack on the character of the person being disendorsed. It is saying, "This person is not trustworthy or responsible enough to hold the job of an arbitrator". Not providing evidence or even a reference for this lack of trust is a slap to the candidate's honour. I believe that disendorsers should either provide evidence or retract what I view as a personal attack. Oh, and FWIW, I think this page should be renamed "Discussion". Even "Disendorsements" is a better title — there's about 70+ kilobytes worth of disendorsements (subtract 10kb if you believe the various statements from Jimbo, et. al should not be counted) and only 50kb+ worth of endorsements. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 09:02, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Expanding on this, I also think that merely alluding to the candidate's actions and not providing a <i>specific instance</i> should also count as a personal attack. How do you expect a candidate to respond to statements like "Oppose. POV warrior" when there's no diff, not even a mention of a specific incident? If the candidate is irresponsible enough not to be trusted with the position, digging up evidence should be no problem. One or two instances is enough, as many others will have their own bones to pick if there is real dissatisfaction with the candidate. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 09:06, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I rather like the Rule: "If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level." Why wouldn't the application of the Rule here be: Ignore the attack party, not respond to the attack party, and expect me, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a>, and the others to have the intelligence to notice that it was an attack party and apply the Rule?

<dd>The problem here is that these aren't <i>any</i> personal attacks. These are attacks which could influence the outcome of an election. With so many good candidates running, it's going to be close. Let's not forget those of us actively involved in this election represent a very small minority of the actual voters. Over 500 users voted in the July elections. I think it's likely there are going to be quite a bit more voters this time around. If these voters merely glance around the page (which is almost guaranteed — most of them are definitely not as interested in politicking as the average troll/cabalist), they might vote based purely on the number of "support" or "oppose" "votes". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:30, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. You are right. Many of the "500 users" will find it difficult to apply the Rule: "If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level." That is true. I agree. But I hate to see anybody "sink to their level" just because we know that some of the "500 users" will "sink to their level." &#160;:)) That is how I read the rule. And that is why I say that freezing this page and submitting it to <a href="../../../v/f/d/VfD_4d7f.html" title="VfD">VfD</a> is a violation of the Rule. "If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level." The mere freezing of this page and submitting it to <a href="../../../v/f/d/VfD_4d7f.html" title="VfD">VfD</a> is "sinking to their level"--in my opinion. But in this case I am looking in from the "outside." I know that, when I am "inside," it is much more difficult to follow the Rule.&#160;:) ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 17:54, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I consider that an extreme sort of action, and I wouldn't condone it. However, I wouldn't condemn it either. I'm actually pretty much a fencesitter on this; I don't care about the specifics too much, but I've been thoroughly pissed off by the personal attacks I've seen. Still, I wouldn't throw a tantrum if nobody listened to me. I don't mind it very much. So although I consider Kim's approach a little too extreme, I don't feel strongly enough on this issue to either support or oppose it. And by the way, I think the correct way to refer to "the rule" is "the guideline", because Jimbo specifically did not issue this as a command — "Thou shalt not post disendorsements" — instead, he merely strongly recommended people avoid doing so. That doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't disobey him. However, I think that some people have taken this whole disendorsing thing too far, as if the right were sacred. Lest anyone forget, this whole election is going on solely because Jimbo permits it. This is not democracy — this is Jimbocracy. Sure, it's a dictatorship, but Jimbo runs the Foundation. He can do whatever he likes, whether it's fair or not. I personally agree with Shane that things would work a lot smoother if Jimbo was the arbcom or Jimbo appointed the arbcom. However, like him, I understand why we need these elections. What I don't understand is why people insist on turning this into a race for Congress or something. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/factionalism" class="extiw" title="m:factionalism">Factionalism</a> is bad. Disendorsements, in particular those which don't contain any rationale for the disendorsement, create bad blood. If we're going to permit them (I believe there's a reason we didn't have disendorsements in the July election), the least we could do is to forbid obvious personal attacks. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:11, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not disagreeing with you, in my opinion.&#160;:) We are discussing. I am learning my way through this with your help. &#160;;) <b>Rule.</b> I guess I was thinking of <i>Rule</i> in the sense of <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_thumb.html" title="Rule of thumb">Rule of thumb</a>, a very practical generality--a much more practical form of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turn_the_other_cheek.html" title="Turn the other cheek">Turn the other cheek</a> and the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_rule.html" title="Golden rule">Golden rule</a>. Clearly, what I would like to call "the Rule"-- <i>If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level.</i> --is not policy. It is even better than policy because it is not a "Thou shalt not." Therefore, it is useable.&#160;:)) <b>Factionalism is bad.</b> Yep. But apparently God and evolution made us wrong. Since I take the evolutionism prong, I would say that unfortunately we human males inherited from the ancestors of the chimpanzees the 1) politicization by factionalism, 2) spilling over of important politics to interrupt necessary routine destructively, and 3) personal attacks--all three behaviors as the instinctive means of accomplishment. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> So it is difficult to love this part of ourselves--especially when it manifests in our opponent &#160;:)) --and we easily get sucked back into the cesspool of our primordial instincts. It is difficult to love that part of us. It takes incredible amounts of 1) intelligence and 2) discipline to resist the primordial hungers we inherited from the ancestors of the chimpanzees. The challenge for any enlightened human male is thus stated succinctly by what, in the last few days, I have come to like calling "the Rule." "If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them. But let's not sink to their level." This is just what I see at the moment.

<p>'It is saying, "This person is not trustworthy or responsible enough to hold the job of an arbitrator" Indeed it is, after years of experience in dealing with them one can come to such a conclusion. Why people like 172 or VeryVerily, having been before the arbitration committee as defendants, think they ought to be elected to the Committee in order to further their war on Wikipedia policies is obvious enough. Diffs are nice, but hardly necessary in the case of notorious POV warriors.

<dd>If you think I was singling you out in particular (or that incident), you are mistaken. I merely mentioned the incident to provide context for my statement that any change to the structure of this page will be highly disputed (incidentally, I'm curious as to why/how Anthere escaped criticism from the general community, and only ended up being criticised by trolls when she removed all disendorsements). <i>Indeed it is, after years of experience in dealing with them one can come to such a conclusion.

Diffs are nice, but hardly necessary in the case of notorious POV warriors.</i> Of course it's obvious. However, you could have given the reason, "VeryVerily has been involved in constant revert warring, and has appeared in many arbitration cases for this very crime", because that provides enough context for someone to go out and easily locate more information on this. <i>I will leave it to you to try to provide some rationale for trying to stifle debate; you had the option of leaving it alone.</i> Uh... I was the one who put the effort into merging the two pages after the strawpoll closed yesterday. I'm not sure what you're talking about, unless you're referring to the incident of me reverting you, which I have already responded to in two different places on the main endorsements page. Was it a mistake? Even I remain unsure. However, the fact that the strawpoll had not yet closed (leaving room for more votes to prevent a consensus) I believe created enough ambiguity to prevent outright condemnation. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:30, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are some issues that will prevent you from doing what you intend to do here, Kim:
<ol>
<li>There is a clear majority consensus here that page is acceptable, useful and necessary as it stands.</li>
<li>As far as we can tell, you are not acting in any official capacity here, and so have no authority or mandate to act unilaterally to delete the page or even to move for it's deletion through VfD. There is even a clear majority consensus that even nominating the page for VfD goes against the policies and spirit of wikipedia.</li>
<li>Mrfixter pointed out yesterday that policy indicates you have a conflict of interest that precludes you from taking unilateral action that would protect/freeze the page as you threaten: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy" rel="nofollow">From the Wikipedia Protection Policy</a>: <i>Admins should not protect pages which they have been involved with (involvement includes making substantive edits to the page or expressing opinions about the article on the talk page).</i> By carrying out your threatened action, you'd be violating policy many here feel.</li>
<li>That Endorsements page current format is actually flawed has not been sufficiently established for many here to accept what you claim at face value. It has not even been established that there is a better alternative; indeed, you've offered no alternative. Complete loss of a free fair forum in which the electorate can voice support or concern over candidate qualifications is completely unacceptable.</li>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Many here do not agree with your opinion of the Endorsements page, recognize your urgency or see why we should accept your ultimatums. Without an official mandate no one here is compelled to recognize your attempts at unilateral action in the face of a clear community majority consensus. Unless you produce some form of special authority that allows you to unilaterally reform the Endorsement page as you see fit and exempts you from the policy violation that doing so would likely entail, you should just abide by community consensus just like anyone else here.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:54, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not a "The Emperor has no clothes" comment. This is a "We are all naked under our clothes" comment.</p>
<p>Here we four are--on the field of battle--again--each of the four of us defending what we think is "Wikipedia Quality" against the onslaughts of the "Destroyers of quality."</p>
<p>And I say again that we inherited this instinctive behavior pattern from the ancestors of the chimpanzees. And given our intelligence, in five more moves we could all have nuclear missiles aimed to where it would hurt; we think they are just deterrents against the "Destroyers of Wikipedia quality." Even our language--at least our English--makes it almost impossible to make the kind of observation statement I am trying to make here without implying "I am right. See I won. You are wrong."</p>
<p>I agree with Kim that the pattern on the "Endorsement?" page is despicable. But I notice that this is a very human pattern that takes incredible amounts of 1) love and 2) discipline to keep from joining. "Have we hereby joined this despicable pattern?" I ask. I would suggest that all of us would benefit from what I have come to like to call "the Rule"--<i>If the trolls want to have an attack party here, let them.

<p>Are <i>some</i> comments left in opposition personal attacks? Likely. Are <i>some</i> of those despicable? Maybe. Some may even be <i>dastardly</i>. Are there informative, useful facts for voters found in the oppose comments on the Endorsements page? Certainly. Is that information available grouped together elsewhere for voters? No. Should genuine personal attacks be allowed to stand? No.</p>
<p>That there are despicable personal attacks on the page is no reason to unilaterally delete <i>all</i> opposing comments, particularly those that are factually informative and <i>not</i> personal attacks.</p>
<p>So I propose the following simple compromise: Let's fix those comments that are personal attacks while leaving informative opposing comments that are not personal attacks as they are. Comments that do not characterize candidates using pejorative terms and comments that present verifiable relevant information and that do not use pejorative terms can stand and continue to be made in the future. Comments that characterize candidates using pejorative terms or present unverifiable evidence should have the pejorative terms and dubious evidence removed by their originating editor, or failing that, reduced to a simple "<b>Oppose.</b>" by one of us after giving that editor the opportunity to correct it themselves.</p>
<p>I feel this is a fair solution that addresses the concerns of both camps here.</p>

<dd>I support your proposal, FeloniousMonk (I am also a fan of your music!). All personal attacks should be removed, these serves no productive purpose whatsoever.

<dd>Defining what is "pejorative" and a genuine personal attack is something we will all have to work on together and reach some consensus on as a group, I hope. I'm against anyone one person or group dictating what is and is not an inexcusable insult. I anticipate that there will be plenty of gray areas that need discussion. For example, "candidate X is a jerk" is a statement that is little more than personal opinion and difficult to defend as not being a personal attack. But "candidate X has acted like a jerk" may indeed be a statement of fact that is backed up by the candidates record and thus could easily remain with a little moderating of the language. At least that's my line of thinking. It will take some discussion and contacting of the various editors and allowing them sufficient time to respond, of course.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 01:36, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't regard "Person X is a jerk" or "Person X is a troll" as pejorative or personal attacks since both refer to Person X's behavior. The labels we give each other are subjective interpretations. While those interpretations often produce negative results through miscommunication (or misunderstanding), they remain useful <i>if</i> evidence is provided to demonstrate how Person X behaved in a jerkish or trollish manner. Of course, absolutes are logical impossibilities; therefore, if a critic argues that Person X behaved in a jerkish or trollish manner with supporting evidence, and readers are not convinced, then readers are left alone to decide their interpretation of Person X's behavior given the alternative opinions of Person X. In <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Semantics_6eba.html" title="General Semantics">General Semantics</a>, I would say, "I am anything that behaves in an Adraeus-ish way." Being that perception is infinite yet singular, there will always be interpretations which claim that something or another behaves in an Adraeus-ish way and is then Adraeus. With that in mind, I disregard the entire concept of a "personal attack" as a mere product of the meek (or weak) unless, of course, that attack is accompanied by some form of weaponry. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 04:27, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never said anyone's opinion didn't matter. Clearly they do matter: hence my suggestion that if you want to change the "no personal attacks" policy, you attempt to do so on the talk page for the policy. If opinions didn't matter, there'd be no way to change policy. I'm merely suggesting that policy applies until it is changed, whether you, I or anyone else likes it or not. You're not meant to be scared by that, because there's no threat intended. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 05:46, Dec 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said, "It doesn't matter whether you think personal attacks are a product of the weak or meek..." Simplified, you said, "Your opinion on personal attacks doesn't matter."</dd>
<dd>You also issued an ultimatum: "If you don't like it, take it up on the policy talk page. Until you get the policy changed, you're going to have to live with it." I don't care much for "pejorative" terminology. What is most detrimental to communication is <i>how</i> things are said rather than <i>what</i>. For instance, a black woman is passing by a church with her baby son in her arms when a white Irish priest walks up to her and says, "They are so cute when they're little." Fine, right? Instead of speaking to the mother, perhaps instead he turned around to another person after conversing with the woman and said, "<i>They</i> are so cute when they're little." The implications are far worse. Context over content. How information is presented is often more important than the information itself. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 06:41, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see what any of that had to do with Shane's original comment. That "ultimatum" is exactly how policy is decided on. It's factually correct. And that "Your opinion doesn't matter" is extremely tenuous. Have you considered taking your own advice and looking at the context? I quote: "It doesn't matter whether you think personal attacks are a product of the weak or meek, it's <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">wikipedia policy</a> to disallow them." His statement clearly meant that <i>current</i> policy cannot be altered by your opinion. Shane then went on to say that <i>future</i> policy can be altered by your opinion. But for now, personal attacks are banned, regardless of what any of us think about it. Sheesh, pedants these days. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:32, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Elections are by their very nature ugly business. If candidates can't stand the intense scrutiny and unfavorable comments that are only natural to an election, then they should withdraw. I totally agree with your points Adraeus, particularly your point that the concept of personal attack is a sham. Unfortunately wikipedia policy doesn't see it that way. As it is, the existing policy unfairly allows those with an agenda to cynically misuse claims of personal attacks as a bludgeon against anyone who speaks out the slightest bit critically of them, much the same way the NPOV policy is misused by POV warriors to leverage a bigger and better seat at the table. I still insist that opposing comments must remain, and will continue to see that they do. But to maintain the page in light of Kim Bruning's threat of unilateral action, I'm comfortable working with the group we have here to define which comments are indeed "personal attacks" per policy and working to get those comments to align with the policy. That is only if there is community consensus here to adopt my solution. If you oppose it, I respect that.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 05:22, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do have to say I fully agree with you here. And I've only seen coming from the other side specious reasoning to support deletion and no alternative being offered to accommodate commentary on candidates; in other words, full censorship. While you were writing this I was quoting Jefferson to Rednblu: <i>""Information is the currency of democracy."</i> Funny. I thought we'd still be able to discuss a candidates history fully without the name calling, that's all.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 06:02, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would not regard removal of this page as censorship. Free speach only means accepting people's right to say things, it doesn't mean they have to be given a vehicle to say it. A person's own user space is their castle as far as I'm concerned, you can write anything you like there. When people start telling you that you can't endorse or disendorse people in your user space, then I'll be behind you 100% on the censorship issue.</p>
<p>Anyway, removal isn't something I really support at this point, nor is restriction. The rules should have been made before the fact, not after them. What I do support is a policy to be put in place about what can and can't be done for any future elections, and that the state of this page isn't used as precident in them. I have already said this explicitly, maybe my mistake is to assume that people realise I'm talking about the future because of this.</p>
<p>I also don't care either way what impact it has on democracy. I've said several times that I don't believe democracy is the end we're aiming for here, an effective AC is.

<p>We do have a policy to lean back on called <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_policy_7667.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV policy">Wikipedia:NPOV policy</a>. NPOV policy is applicable to how information on candidates is presented. Allowing only endorsements creates a promotional vehicle, not an informational resource. A smart voter will read the supporting and opposing statements regarding a candidate, do a little research to verify claims and vote (or not vote) based on their decision. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 10:43, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ROFL! This is such a stacked argument, I'm beginning to wonder if Shane and I are just feeding a troll. Wikipedia convention defines an article as a page in the main namespace. Something encompassing all pages regardless of namespace is the word "page". This has been a dispute on RFAr before — in a temporary injunction for Gzornenplatz, it was found that his revert parole only applied to <b>articles</b> and not pages in general (as a result, the final decision was amended to encompass all pages).

<dd>I agree with this (as anyone can see above). What pissed me off about disendorsements is that people were using them as an official sanction to make personal attacks or bringing personal feuds into play. If the feud has basis in policy, you shouldn't have to be afraid to present a link to a page summarising the dispute (RFC, RFAr) or even just a diff or two.

<dd><b>False.</b> <i>You</i> <b>misunderstand</b> how NPOV policy applies to <b>how</b> <i>information</i> on candidates is presented.

<dl>
<dd>In order to fairly represent all sides of a dispute — in this case, support of and opposition to a candidate since a candidate is the object of dispute — all viewpoints regarding a candidate must be presented in an easily considerable fashion. We've made the case for this presentation and, I think, you support it (or so you claim) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Elections/Endorsements_poll" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Elections/Endorsements_poll" rel="nofollow">"only as long as personal attacks are forbidden,"</a> which is a strange, apparently highly political, position considering your tendency to call me names...

<dd>Nice strawman there bub. I support free speech on the condition that it helps build a free encyclopedia. You haven't responded at all to the quote you took from me. Very nice. If I fill my user page with accusations against you, does that mean it must be NPOVed? After all, NPOV policy applies to pages outside the main namespace. What if I fill it with a list of articles I've found that are substubs? Isn't that original research? Well, I've had enough of feeding trolls for now.

<p>Hey, I tried to edit a section of the endorsements page, but the resulting edit changed another page, not the main endorsements page but a candidates endorsement subpage.

<dd>That was supposed to happen. The endorsements are written up on subpages and transcluded onto this page; when you click the section edit link on this page you edit that section on the subpage. Take a look at <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">VFD</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">RFA</a> for other examples of this system. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 20:56, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>They do, but you may need to clear the wikipedia cache to see them. One issue I've noted on VfD is that changes to template inclusions is that they don't refresh the wikipedia cache of the main page until/unless the main page itself is edited by someone. We should perhaps have a prominent link to purge the cache on the top of the page. Even if, however, we were to stop using subpages, DO NOT simply revert back to the last version that was done that way. Instead, copy the entire page source into a text editor, replace all the template inclusion with template substitution inclusion, and replace back into the edit window that way. Submitting that will de-templatize the page while substituting the template content back in. It's the best technical solution, were we to want to go that way, as no comments would be lost. I'm a Unixhead, and would do it in vim as shown below. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 21:30, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd suggest just turning off the page caching setting in the misc section of your preferences.

<p>I won't be surprised if some people say in the future that a particular successful candidate is not suitable to be on the arbcom committee. As the election had some problems as discussed at great length above. They didn't plan the rules of the election before they started it. Most importantly: there was no announcement on the main page and so it wasn't made known properly to the "electorate". We were told that only a link on the "community portal" page was needed to make the election fair.</p>
<p>Also the "election managers", Danny etc. didn't monitor the election and user "Neutrality", and others, see above, went about removing comments posted against them. (Mirv had to do the tasks for the "election managers".) They didn't stop people like Michael Snow taking control of the election. Again, other users had to work to stop him. The candidates were given an unfair advantage for a while at the start with only pro comments allowed in the "election". Even afterwords the page was still called "candidate endorsements" and some people going to the candidate page from the link we were told was all that was needed - will have only seen "Endorsements can be added at /Endorsements." and maybe not moved on. This is clear as anybody who knows the wikipedia knows how hard it is to find/find out about things on it. (It was changed after two weeks.)</p>
<p>Also the candidates are allowed to "choose the length of their term after the election," - funny election. "The election will last from December 4 to December 18." - but they only say when it closes on a detail page. Also the voting page doesn't say whether you can come back and vote for more candidates later. "Show your disapproval at the ballot, and offer the good faith belief that everyone who is running has the best interests of Wikipedia at heart," This is from the election <i>organisers</i>. They shouldn't be running it if they're expressing biased views like that. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 21:40, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think you misunderstand the "choose their terms after the election" thing. It's because ArbCom terms are staggered (some are one year, some two, some three, I believe). Not all of the open seats are for the same term length. So the idea is to let the winners pick which of the seats they want to hold in order of finishing. It's not like we're letting the winners just arbitrarily pick some length of time for which to serve.
