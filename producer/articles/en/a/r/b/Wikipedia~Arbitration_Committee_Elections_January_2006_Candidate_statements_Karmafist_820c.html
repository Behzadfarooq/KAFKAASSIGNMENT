<p>The last thing I wanted to do is run for arbcom, but from my dealings with the system at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pigsonthewing_50bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pigsonthewing">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pigsonthewing</a>, I feel that it's necessary to enact some change.</p>
<p>My running is basically a protest against the arbitration process as it is, not against any particular member of the arbcom itself since I deeply respect all of them i've talked to individually. My goal will be a drastic reform of the entire arbitration system.</p>
<p>Although my hope is that this won't be the case, I would consider this entire election to be invalid if <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> interfered in any way, unless he truly does <i>look down upon</i> other Wikipedians, thus destroying the idea that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarian.html" title="Egalitarian">Egalitarian</a>, which I am beginning to believe is not the case.</p>
<p><b>My Ideas</b> For the election, my ideas for reform seem to be in two areas. Policy Creation, Policy Education and Policy Enforcement/Interpretation</p>

<ul>
<li>Your arbitration committee ideas aren't even half bad, deploying 3 (wo)man flying teams to rfcs might solve scaling issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The policy idea is seriously suboptimal for use on wikis.&#160;:-) People do regularly propose similar systems, but they're not a good idea. (that and the proposal can't be linked to arbcom nominations, of course)</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>The reason democratic review is suboptimal on wikis, is because wikis have a revert button and the real world does not. If someone were to (accidentally) blow up Queen Elizabeth, you're in big trouble, so you're going to need a complete system of laws and checks and balances to prevent that from happening. If you accidentally blank <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_e43e.html" title="Queen Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</a> on the other hand, you can just revert. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 19:14, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your question Kim! I think we miscommunicated somewhere there, that analogy doesn't quite fit, but even if it was, I think Queen Elizabeth would get sick of being reverted all the time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the <b>sociocratic</b> (not democratic) body i'm talking about is about policy creation, not about policy enforcement. Right now the process seems to be some kind of arcane anarchic process that doesn't really seem to hold that much weight anyway since they can be whittled and dittled almost at will as long as you don't cross the "invisible line" of changing them if they don't work they're intended to, which will happen over time. I think everything regarding the internal workings of Wikipedia should be clear and fairly generalized instead of gaining flexibility at the expense of sturdyness. Let the rfcs and this new "arbcom system" refine the generalities through new precedents, which the policy making body can change later on if needed.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 02:53, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you familiar with the <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a> story? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 05:36, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also don't see how Nupedia relates to the "Wiki-Legislature" either, anybody could propose new policies or fixing policies, the only difference is it would be along lines similiar to afd at the first level, and a mix of the arbcom and afd at the second level, better than the edit wars/talk page free for alls regarding policy reforms we seem to have now. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 06:15, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed two instances of you (Karmafist) using blocking as a means to punish (and hence take revenge) or threaten users who have upset you. I'm talking about events surrounding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APigsonthewing&amp;diff=29156305&amp;oldid=29155949" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APigsonthewing&amp;diff=29156305&amp;oldid=29155949" rel="nofollow">diff 1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=29666371&amp;oldid=29662668" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=29666371&amp;oldid=29662668" rel="nofollow">diff 2</a>. Is this how you will approach the arbcom? This is not meant as an attack on you, it's just the vibe I have recieved and I'd like you to clarify. Even as I write this I fear you will block me for my comment, which is not a comfortable/neccessary postion for any Wikipedian to be in.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 18:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Commander Keane, thank you for your question, and don't worry, you don't have anything to fear from me. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Pigsonthewing</a> had been harrassing me (mainly on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>) and numerous other users, in particular <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonig_Mig_2d3d.html" title="User:Leonig Mig">Leonig Mig</a>, who had to create a new user account to avoid harrassment. Yet, the arbcom did nothing, despite the fact POTW ignored his rfc and his rfar.</p>

<p>You see, this is a perfect example. POTW, and many others like him don't seem to understand the finer points of policy or twist policy to serve their own needs by believing something is something or not something regardless of if that's true. POTW does this several times a week in regards to many users at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> or on their talk pages or through revert wars or what have you. And I could give examples up the yazoo, but POTW will just be back here whining and complaining via the "Ostrich Method" (If I stick my head in the sand, it doesn't exist) or the "Megaphone Method"(If I yell loud enough, others will hear me, but I won't be able to hear them.)</p>
<p>People like POTW(those who don't wish to work with others when needed) are far more disruptive than any petty vandal, and the arbcom should be far more proactive in rehabilitating and reprimanding disruptive editors such as POTW.</p>

<p>I think you already said that, POTW. <i>Or was the megaphone too loud for you to hear if anybody else was listening? POTW is symptomatic of another problem we're having on Wikipedia</i>, often people feel like they can't get anything done unless they use the Megaphone Method or some kind of shady Cabalism.

If the Arbcom could have stepped in months ago as a bulwark against such behavior, this could have been nipped in the bud and POTW could continue with his productive edits. Unfortunately, it seems like he's too set in his way to change now, and he's likely to continue to be blocked over and over again until one day the block is indefinate. Right now, the arbcom is too time and resource strapped to do this, but this can be changed if we get more arbitrators and more <i>proactive</i> arbitrators willing to backup admins on the front lines. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 07:33, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Proto, thank you for the question, and quite frankly, it's one of the reasons why I felt it was necessary to run. What Proto doesn't understand is that <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> often told me during the POTW case that "You don't have to save Wikipedia all by yourself, Wikipedia does not revolve around you." However, on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_bureaucratship_Johnleemk_1b47.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Johnleemk">Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Johnleemk</a>, she basically opposed for the same reason -- Johnleemk had not entered her orbit of acknowledgement, which is an absurdly poor reason to oppose since there are hundreds of thousands of Wikipedians she does not know who do great things for this project, as Johnleemk had. That's behavior unbecoming of any Wikipedian, let alone an arbcom member, and such behavior sabotages our fragile sociocratic consensus system.</p>
<p>However, Proto didn't know this, because the arbcom and associated bodies are currently too over stretched to disseminate such information, and as a result, most Wikipedians go with their knee jerk reaction to situations that are multi layered and complex, like Proto's second comment.</p>
<p>At <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_WikiFanatic_f0a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/WikiFanatic">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/WikiFanatic</a>, I attempted to calm the nerves of the candidate, who has basically talked about nothing other than adminship for the past few months on the Wikipedia IRC Channel. He was incredibly anxious, and needed something to calm his nerves so he wouldn't mae a <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faux_pas.html" title="Faux pas">faux pas</a>. I took the now urban legend rfa <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violator <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a>, and made a joke about it, calming Wikifanatic down and making a whole bunch of people laugh in the process. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> and me had disagreements over this, but like the above, it was largely due to miscommunication. Me and Ral <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html#Re:_Boothy_on_RFA" title="User talk:Ral315">talked it over</a>, and eventually learned to respect each others' shortcomings, even if we did not entirely agree on philosophies regarding Wikipedia itself. I'd like to offer that same olive branch to Proto right here since Proto has followed a path similiar to Ral's recently in regards to this, and similiar to Ral, is a damn fine contributor to this project from what I've known.</p>
<p>However, in the future, the arbcom and related boards must be far more pro-active in preventing these kinds of potential powderkegs, and in order to do this, I think drastic changes that most of the "entrenched" candidates are not willing to take, despite their otherwise vast abilities, are necessary. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 16:16, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Do you hold any strong political or religious opinions (e.g. concerning George Bush, Islam, or on which end you should break a boiled egg)? If so, would you recuse yourself from cases centred on these?</i></p>
<ul>
<li>First off, thanks for the question -Ril-/victim of signature fascism(which title do you prefer?), I appreciate your participation in this process. I do have somewhat strong political opinions which have been reduced by the Wikipedian mindset. For example, me and <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> were involved in an edit war at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> around a year ago, something I regretted so much that I only edited that page once afterwards (don't ask me to find the diff). My regret apparently was mutual in Mongo's opinion as he said at my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Karmafist_f9a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Karmafist">rfa</a>, and I returned his kindness by supporting him by <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_MONGO_a4bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/MONGO">nominating him for adminship</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>How willing are you to contest the decisions of other arbitrators rather than just "go with the flow"?</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a strong admirer of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Wellstone_f264.html" title="Paul Wellstone">Paul Wellstone</a>, and it was once said that he'd be the 1 in a 99-1 vote if that's what he truly believed in. I'll try to follow in his footsteps.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely not, each case is unique. However, they'd be redressed by a separate arbcom to reduce case load.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them. Do you support this decision? [if current arbitrator] Does your visible behaviour on recent cases reflect this decision?</i></p>

<p>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system?

<p>I don't think such a change is necessary, although I do believe that our current approach that a scattered approach is appropriate either since there should be some uniformity in how we resolve disputes so we don't get any double standards or misconceptions among how things work on the arbcom. Rulings should be based on interpretation of precedent rather than perception whenever possible. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 22:57, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: I assume 20-30, but that's with an expanded arbcom system. I won't be able to tell until I get there, since I've never had to be an arbcom member before, and my methodology may differ in time requirements from other arbcom members.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles.

<p>Thanks for your question, I can see how you could see that as difficult to interpret, and I think I understand why since I focused more on <b>it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate</b> whereas I assume you focused on <b>the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them</b>. Before I go on, I'd like to recommend to you getting an account, you just click on where it says "Sign In/Create Account" at the top right hand side of your screen, it takes two seconds and doesn't require any money or e-mail address.<br />
<br />
Nine times out of ten, there is likely to be nothing out of order with the initiator to the extent that something actually will need to be done, even though arbitrators should check to make sure. If there is something, I'd suggest an approach similiar to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_FuelWagon_v._Ed_Poor_25f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/FuelWagon v. Ed Poor">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/FuelWagon v. Ed Poor</a>, renaming and clarifying the rfar to identify that both sides are now "defendants" in regards to the rfar.<br />
<br />
In the diffs you are pointing out, a user believing that I was acting out of bad faith, was attempting to make the proceedings about me rather than about the topic, and I offered to move aside if I was getting in the way of the proceedings, since the discussion on the user which the rfar was based upon was the focus there, and I assumed that some may have seen my zeal getting the discussion off topic. The only response I got was from Fred Bauder, who said "Just don't get carried away, you're not hearding cattle here."<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 22:45, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think I can see your point. It's the duty of arbitrators to investigate the initiator(s), and, perhaps initially, not of those providing the evidence. Personally, I would expect "evidence" to provide a well rounded picture of the situation, regardless whether the situation concerns just one "Involved party" or more, defendant or arbitration initiator or even plain user. I believe the evidence provided regarding you, did have some bearing to the case. Perhaps thanks to your zeal. I thank you for your reply and your recommendation. I'll consider creating that account, but for the moment I'm comfortable with just my IP address. Best of luck with the elections. You're very brave for applying for this. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.155.229.224_3a56.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.155.229.224">131.155.229.224</a> 02:14, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the "user" in question I'll just repeat that this claim that I 'was attempting to make the proceedings about you' is untrue. The ArbCom needs to consider background and reasons for behaviour, and in that case some of your actions were highly relevant to these issues. I included only a fraction of that evidence (what I felt was needed to prove the issue), did not bring in any information about you <b>not</b> related to the Pigsonthewing arbitration, and (most notably) did not propose or even support any 'principles', 'findings', 'remedies', or 'enforcement' actions directed at you... indeed, I actually argued <b>against</b> such. I <b>did</b> suggest that a temporary injunction should be applied, but that seemed a given under the circumstances. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 22:06, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Karmafist, the problem with 'agree to disagree' here is that we are talking about <b>my thoughts</b>. You have said I was "trying to" or "attempting to" do something. I <b>know</b> that is untrue and have said so. You have <i>chosen</i> to ignore <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to essentially claim that I am lying. So allow me a small demonstration of what "making it about you" would have <i>actually</i> looked like;</dd>

<dd>I could go on, but I think you get the idea. I was TRYING only to show that some of your actions and behaviour played a direct part in causing some of the things Pigsonthewing was being criticized for. Had I been TRYING to 'make it about you' my approach would have been very different... and I'd hazard that most of those motions would have <b>passed</b>. I didn't DO that because I didn't want you to be 'punished' or to leave Wikipedia.

<p>Well, we could be constructive, but I guess we can still go on this avenue if you'd like CBD. You still don't seem to understand what happened there.</p>
<ul>
<li>You've forgotten the first letter of AGF, <i>assume</i>. Assumptions are only necessary at first glance. Once you know or understand a situation, assumptions are no longer appropriate. People misconstrue this often about <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.</li>
<li>What you said above is misguided and would have failed because quite frankly, I didn't care about a certain version, my involvement at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleshill%2C_Warwickshire_f364.html" title="Coleshill, Warwickshire">Coleshill, Warwickshire</a> was <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Metapedianism" class="extiw" title="m:Metapedianism">Metapedian</a>, not <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Exopedianism" class="extiw" title="m:Exopedianism">Exopedian</a> (I cared about the dispute between the users, not the content). So, I created a synthesis edit of the two users, with the majority of it being POTW's content. That wasn't enough for him, and his behavior continued. Apparently, my mistake was <b>Doing Something</b>. A mistake i've paid for in aggrevation to the point where i'm not going to do it again in our current system of things (see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Freestylefrappe" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR#User:Freestylefrappe</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#User:Freestylefrappe" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#User:Freestylefrappe</a>, and <a href="../../../1/6/5/User_talk%7E165.247.82.173.html" title="User talk:165.247.82.173">User talk:165.247.82.173</a>.)</li>
<li>I unblocked myself because ultimately I thought this was the end, that the POTWs of the world had won and there was no place for me here anymore, and as soon as this happened, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Evilphoenix</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Titoxd</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, Locke Cole, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanes_f250.html" title="User:Banes">Banes</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride">TanalumTelluride</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> <b>begged</b> me to stay.

<p>Given that this position involves the interpretation and carrying out of policy, why should someone who ignores policy be on the arbitration committee? I'm refering to your continued creation of new stub types without following the policy of first proposing them and giving them names that are in violation of the stub sorting naming guidelines.

<p>Thanks for your question, Caerwine. Ignoring policy is in itself policy when a user believes that they have no other option -- <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. Right now anything regarding stubs (<a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSS</a>, <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>, etc.) is basically in the hands of a few instruction creep fans, such as Caerwine above. After seeing a several month long debate with the now {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENew-Hampshire-State-Highway-Stub_e349.html" title="Template:New-Hampshire-State-Highway-Stub">New-Hampshire-State-Highway-Stub</a>}}, I lost most of my faith in the stub system. The rest of which was eroded to nothing by a series of low level <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> vios (closer to arrogant remarks than actual personal attacks) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=30649077&amp;oldid=30577349" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=30649077&amp;oldid=30577349" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=30871615&amp;oldid=30869875" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=30871615&amp;oldid=30869875" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStub_types_for_deletion&amp;diff=30871316&amp;oldid=30821167" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStub_types_for_deletion&amp;diff=30871316&amp;oldid=30821167" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Stub_types_for_deletion&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=30871316" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Stub_types_for_deletion&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=30871316" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, among more that I may have missed. (<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> needs to be fixed too, it's become the Wikipedia version of jaywalking, but one step at a time.) To me, <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_NG_c1c6.html" title="WP:WSS/NG">WP:WSS/NG</a> won't be acceptable until it's no longer than a section long since it should be intuitive, and <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> won't be acceptable until consenseii there can be trusted, which apparently isn't the case since <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a> opened a new proposal for deletion on December 10th {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENew_Hampshire-stub_953a.html" title="Template:New Hampshire-stub">New Hampshire-stub</a>}} <i>a day</i> after the same stub was proposed for deletion, and he saw that he wasn't going to be able to get consensus like he's gotten so many times before since most SFDs aren't opposed. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 18:27, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> itself is not policy, and in my view is highly illegitamate when applied to administrative actions, as opposed to editing issues.

<p>As you noted, the second SFD you refer to was for a separate redirect discovered the day after after the initial SFD. In order to ensure the full seven days, it couldn't simply be folded into the original, and it would be quite possible and has been the case in the past that votes for a template and a redirect to the same will be different. It would have been nice if Grutness had noticed the redirect at the same time and been a bit more civil about it.</p>
<p>In any case, that's not what I referring to. The stub I was referring to in my question was the one for real estate you created on the 9th and nothing to do with the mess in either the state stubs or the highway stubs which have engendered controversy. The only reasons I can see why you chose to not propose it were either haste, or a desire for a prefered name that didn't following the naming conventions, since the stub type itself is not proving at all controversial.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that the SFD for the various state highway stubs was not well managed, mainly because it tried to tackle too many issues at once. ("&#160;" vs. "-"; -Stub vs. -stub; -State-Highway- vs. -state-highway-; and -State-Highway- vs. -road-) That's one reason I stayed clear of that particular mess.</p>
<p>You've complained that the naming guidelines are unclear, perhaps you would care to propose an alternative? The core guidelines are given in a simple seven sentence section at the start, the rest of the <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_NG_c1c6.html" title="WP:WSS/NG">naming guidelines</a> page explains the reasoning behind them and details the known exceptions, which are mainly stubs that predate the naming guidelines. The exceptions section has gotten much shorter over time as execeptions have been taken to SfD. Hopefully, we won't need an exceptions section in a few months, either because the exceptions will have been made to follow the guidelines or the guidelines adapted to fit the exceptions that have been kept. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred;">Caerwhine</small></a> 22:25, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd love to give an alternative, and i'm only sorry that it takes this much whining (no offense to your sig there) to get it listened to it seems. Ultimately, that was one of the biggest reasons why I ran for this position, I'd like to spearhead a place where policy can be proposed and worked upon without it blowing into the wind like what we have now at the Village Pump, and usually "Pulling an Ed Poor"(deleting such a well tread page) doesn't work. If I tried to propose policy regarding this at the Village Pump or one of the stub areas, it'd more than likely be swiftly ignored.</p>
<p>Here's my idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every word except "stub" is always capitalized.</li>
<li>No abbreviations, except for when the category is better known as an acronym(even then, if an alternative exists, it's preferable)</li>
<li>Hyphens are used at every level and before "stub"</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's it. Period.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe that any overcomplicated policy in regards to things that may act as a "gateway drug" for further involvement in Wikipedia (such as stubs or <a href="../../../c/o/t/WP%7ECOTW_227d.html" title="WP:COTW">Collaborations</a>) is a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> country.</p>
<p>That was ultimately my impetus to making the redirects. A newcomer or non-regular stub adder should not have to deal with the organization of stubs, that's <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSSes</a> job. Their jobs should be to <i>put the stubs on the articles</i>. If they want to go further from there, fine. But they shouldn't have to learn an arcane set of guidelines and precedents in order to help Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 01:00, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to think that you'd have gotten a fair hearing without making a ruckus, but we'll never know now. Your ideas aren't all that radical, tho I agree with only some of them. The last section of <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a> is set aside for proposals concerning stubs to do something more ambitious than creating a new stub or the deletion or removal of an existing one.

<li>It's very important, although it also must be remembered that at times there may be lapses of civility due to misunderstandings from personal perceptions, making the ability to respect other viewpoints from others, whether in disputes or not, is more important than generalized civility.</li>
<li>I suppose so, I don't remember any issues with civility with my professors, but you can e-mail one of them at lwelkowi@keene.edu if you'd like a more thorough answer.</li>

<li>Transparency is incredibly important. No discussion should be made on e-mail or IRC without an outside <a href="../../../o/m/b/Ombudsman.html" title="Ombudsman">ombudsman</a> recording the discussion for outside sources.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>No, not at all. A common misunderstanding of AGF is the "A", something that needs to be rectified by updating <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to also correspond to user actions. If they are critical at first glance, then yes, thea would be an AGF vio, but as long as their criticism is fairly civil given the circumstances(arbcom cases can be traumatic for many), they have the right not to be censored.</li>
<li>I wouldn't. Recusal in those cases should be automatic for all arbitrators. To paraphrase what i've said about adminship, you can be an arbitrator and an editor, but not both at once.</li>
<li>Via a checks and balances system through a legislature(mentioned above) and succinct rules. There should be a limit to review, and it would be very rare, but arbitrators are human, and that should be remembered. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 00:18, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>1.

What happend there?</p>
<p>Certainly! Thanks for your question, this is a perfect example of why a stronger, larger arbcom is needed as well as clearer policies. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> (<a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowspinner_228b.html" title="User talk:Snowspinner">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snowspinner_7c96.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snowspinner">contribs</a>) deleted the shortcut to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Kelly_Martin_c312.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin</a> to stifle further opinion there, claiming that it was attracting "trolls", afterwards protecting it. However, under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, there's no justification for deleting that, and nothing was put to <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a>, where deletions of Redirects are made when they cannot be speedied.</p>
<p>Basically, he saw that, he didn't like it, and since he felt he was above policy that he could IAR instantly. I made sure he understood that this was not acceptable, first at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html#User:Snowspinner" title="WP:AN/3RR">AN/3RR</a>, and then afterwards when nobody else would confront him on this, directly going against this subjective use of admin powers.</p>
<p>SCZenz blocked both of us to try and solve the problem since nobody was stepping in, I applauded him for it, but Snowspinner blocked him as retribution.</p>
<p>What I want is not block wars or edit wars or what have you, but to know that the process is equal and clear for everyone, and until that time, i'll stand up against those who wish to subvert the structure of Wikipedia for their whims. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 00:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your statement seems, to me, to criticise the committee as-is, and as has-been, somewhat. Arbitrators burn out, face daily opposition to their actions, and are slandered on a daily basis.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks Rob, and don't worry, unless you seek confrontation, you won't find it with me. I can't do better. Nobody can. Like i've said above, the key is a systematic reform of the process, starting with more arbitrators. The system as it is now is guaranteed to burn out arbitrators and overload the system to the point where no cases will be heard, regardless of their merit. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 00:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>More than likely, when you get deeply involved in a dispute, it's very easy to lose focus towards what's important.</li>
<li>Absolutely. Per Section 4 of <b>Key Policies</b> at <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>, acceptance of constructive criticism is mandatory for any Wikipedian.</li>
<li>Absolutlely again, unfortunately, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is often too vague or unrealistic for many editors to take seriously, it reminds me of a speed limit on a highway -- it takes a gross violation of it, usually on many occasions, for anything to happen. We're discussing ways to reform <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> right now at <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_NPA_Reform_47fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/NPA Reform">Wikipedia:Esperanza/NPA Reform</a> so instances like POTW's view of that policy don't occur again.</li>
<li>Not particularly.</li>
<li>Heh, perhaps. At this point, Wikipedia is a natural haven for Google Bombing, when researching for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bountyheads_in_Cowboy_Bebop_0fea.html" title="List of Bountyheads in Cowboy Bebop">List of Bountyheads in Cowboy Bebop</a> most of the examples in the first 2 or 3 searches were either from Wikipedia or a mirror of the article I was trying to research for. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 00:28, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>I am concerned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" rel="nofollow">templates</a> surviving AfD that appear to contrast with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">established policy</a>. In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
