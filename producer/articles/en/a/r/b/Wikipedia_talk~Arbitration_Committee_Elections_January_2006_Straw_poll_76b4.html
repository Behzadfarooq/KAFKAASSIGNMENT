<dl>
<dd>In theory it is accountable to the community. This is rather critical at present because at present arbcom is the only method the community has of holding admins to account.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 21:35, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how being accountable to the community helps the ArbCom hold admins properly to account -- indeed, I would prefer an ArbCom that focuses more on policy and less on the wishes of the community in dealing with administrator actions. ArbCom shouldn't just be an arm of the community acting at the community's whim, otherwise we'd get rid of it entirely and just have community votes. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 23:34, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We tried pure community votes it didn't work. There are significant differences between representertive democracy and atheian style democracy. Representertive democracy in theory at least provides a useful balance between giving the comunity with control while preventing mob rule. Being accountable to the community gives arbcom legitimacty. Giving the community an arbcom that is accountable to them means that they can see that ultimately they have the power to deal with cliques that form. An elected arbcom is the spanner in the works for those who wish to become wikipedia's aristocrats. You take that away and what do you have? A situation akin to a medeval court with courters sceaming to gain the kings favor.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 01:49, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

</dd>
<dd>As I see it, we shouldn't rely on a group of people to be the "spanner in the works for those who wish to become wikipedia's aristocrats." What serves that role should be our policies and our fundamental norms -- in this case, the policy of NPOV, and our norms surrounding consensus, the freedom of anyone to edit, and the general equality of individuals. Unlike the "will of the community," which as we've seen can turn rather wild and angry in the short term, those policies and norms have been formulated in the long run and serve us well -- they are a more measured and carefully thought out reflection of the long-term desires of our community.</dd>
<dd>More generally, the main pitfall I see for the ArbCom is that it will become too exclusionary, too quick to reject views that don't fall into the Wikipedia mainstream -- and having them accountable to that mainstream wouldn't solve this problem. The problem you see, the creation of some cliquely aristocracy, seems virtually impossible to me on a project as diverse and distributed as Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 06:39, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A difficulty is that the appointments would be made by Jimbo, who is not really accountable to anyone. I don't think there's any reason we should automatically trust him to not establish an aristocratic clique, <i>especially when he's known to make dictatorial announcements</i>. If the community elects its arbitrators, we have a stronger guarantee that the diversity of Wikipedia will be reflected in the outcome. <a href="../../../e/e/q/User%7EEequor_b13d.html" title="User:Eequor">‣<font size="+1">ᓛᖁ</font></a><span class="venus"><a href="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" class="image" title="♀"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/1b/Venus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif" alt="♀" width="9" height="12" longdesc="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" /></a></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" rel="nofollow"><font size="+1">ᑐ</font></a> 06:55, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't really see why we would have that guarantee at all, in fact I'd say it's just the opposite. The community is going to elect the same people it elects at RFA, RFB, etc., which is frankly a pretty UN-diverse group. I expect an elected ArbCom to reflect our diversity in the same way the elected U.S. Senate (100 members, 86 men, 97 whites) reflects America's diversity.</dd>
<dd>Also, as I said at the top, I think that appointments and elections are both likely to result in a perfectly good panel, and the main reason then to choose appointment is efficiencty. My main concern, actually, would be some greater consideration in whatever method is chosen for selecting people who are likely to serve out their term and devote substantial time to the committee; it would be nice to get it functioning a little more smoothly. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 18:32, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is no point in gauging what people think if they haven't <i>thought</i> yet. That is why polls are evil. They stifle discussion, by encouraging us to sign our name next to a number, quarantined in its own little section with identically-minded signatures. There is no incentive to discuss, no accountability. My well reasoned argument makes the tally go up one, just like someone else's "~~~~" does, and we're even. Why should anyone challenge me? Why should I respond? What's the difference if nothing I say affects the <i>vote</i> tally? A poll is in every way inferior to real discussion. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 23:25, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The real question, then, is what constitutes <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought.html" title="Thought">thought</a>? This coming from someone who is intimately familiar with what a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarantine.html" title="Quarantine">quarantine</a> is (ask me privately). If anything positive can come out of this, either through the exchange of ideas or by potentially guiding policy, all the better. E Pluribus Anthony 07:07, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The idea here is consensus. Always (by here I mean Wikipedia). So, sure, people may have thoughts, but more broadly, Wikipedia hasn't thought about it. There has been no consensus attempt, no discussion with the goal of consensus in mind at all. Polls are absolutely antithetical to consensus-gathering (and the whole idea of them is after you have a rough consensus proposal, if at all). If a poll like this did lead to guiding policy, it would be unfortunate, as anyone who thinks <i>this</i> is a good way to achieve discussion and consensus has serious misconceptions about what those two things are. We should not be limited to two choices, and have our discussion curtailed. Almost nothing on Wikipedia is a boolean decision. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:23, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While I also agree in not necessarily being limited by two choices, we otherwise agree to disagree. The fact that Wp, Jimbo, the Board, etc., have had to periodically address or (propose) intervening in ArbComm member selection implies that Wikipedians (up-top <i>and</i> down below) need to think <i>more</i> about this and that before arriving at a decision or identifying a consensus. Polls, discussions, and any other forums should function as the tools they are intended to be; nothing more, but nothing less. And no stress.&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony 07:36, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, precisely, we <i>do</i> need to think more about it. We need to discuss it. <i>Not</i> poll on it. Polls stifle thought.

<p>Jimbo: Hello! I applaud you for making efforts to clarify this ArbComm issue and process and look forward to working with you.</p>
<p>However, is it at all prudent to <i>delete</i> the prior poll instead of placing/forking it on another page: i.e., creating another page for this purpose and archiving it? It is, after all, a straw poll, that – regardless of perceptions of relevance or perfection – garnered much input and compelled you to act. Perception is reality. As well, many users may not know how or where to accesss it from the history and may find the discussions therein helpful in participating here.</p>
<p>If you won't do this, perhaps I should? Thanks! E Pluribus Anthony 06:04, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quote: "Hybrid approach: Jimbo can put forward candidates for community approval, 50% majority is enough. And also the community can put forward candidates for Jimbo's approval, with the same 50% majority being enough." What on earth does this mean? If half of Jimbo approves, then that's enough? Or that half the community supports a candidate? So there will be an election? For half the places? What if there is a 50/50 split vote for a candidate (i.e., half the community supports, half opposes)? <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 11:17, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>think</i> this means candidates must receive over 50% approving votes to be accepted by the community, and both the approval of the community and Jimbo are required to appoint a candidate. My first reaction to this was the same as yours, though, but hopefully Jimbo isn't making decisions he has only 50% confidence in. <a href="../../../e/e/q/User%7EEequor_b13d.html" title="User:Eequor">‣<font size="+1">ᓛᖁ</font></a><span class="venus"><a href="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" class="image" title="♀"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/1b/Venus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif" alt="♀" width="9" height="12" longdesc="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" /></a></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" rel="nofollow"><font size="+1">ᑐ</font></a> 11:31, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But how would this work, exactly? I mean, how will the community propose these candidates in the first place?

<dd>The community would propose candidates by electing them, I believe. If I understand the proposal correctly, Jimbo would nominate a slate for us to vote on, and these people would all be given, in the current rhetoric of US judicial nominations, "an up-or-down vote". Meanwhile, there would also be a vote on any other candidates who choose to run from the community at large, but these candidates would require Jimbo's approval after the election. As far as the mechanics, I'm guessing that we would vote on all of the candidates in a single poll, although the details of that can be worked out later. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 17:19, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes this is my guess as to what Jimbo's second proposal means. but it should be made more clear. What this essentially does is let Jimbo appoint/elect candidates, subject to a veto by the community, and the community appoint/elect candidates, subject to a veto by Jimbo (one he has stated he will use only rarely). This seems fairly reasonable to me. But I will now make my vote contingent on this interpretation. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 17:46, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Reason demands your interpretation. In order for candidates that the community proposes to proceed to Jimbo's consideration, these candidates must be approved by the "the same 50% majority" of the community that approved Jimbo's personal candidates. That being said, <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a>'s statement below does describe a real danger.

<dd>Perhaps an expansion of the pool by selecting candidates who garnered near-parity in a vote (e.g., a vote of 49% yes) – which may be statistically insignificant – for subsequent runoff elections; however, this may be untenable to some (as it defies a majority, et al.).

<p><i>The previous poll claimed, for example, that "This year, Jimbo has announced that he will appoint candidates directly." This is either false or misleading.

And this formulation suggests (particularly as it was misleadingly contrasted with "a public election") that I intend to do so without any community approval or vote, which is simply false.</i></p>
<p>I find this comment misleading as while it's true, it's also true that all legislation in the UK becomes legislation only after it's signed by the Queen. Theoretically, the Queen could refuse, but it would be a constitutional crisis. I could imagine a (much lesser) crisis arising if one of the top candidates voted in by the community if we go by the same process as last year, and Jimbo vetoed the appointment. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 12:17, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but this is overly simplistic and, essentialy, wrong. The Arbitration Committee have the authority to judge because Jimbo has decided to delegate his powers to us, and has continuous input (albeit generally <i>in camera</i>) into the process. To pretend that Jimbo is merely some figurehead character as Her Majesty has effectively become is highly misleading.</dd>

<dd>I thought that the statement at the top of the original poll was clear as day. Jimbo's announcement said that "the most likely process will be direct appointment by Jimbo...followed by confirmation votes from the community." Jimbo will, with consultation, <i>appoint candidates</i> for community confirmation. The first link below the TOC is to Jimbo's original announcement. That being said, the current poll is much more informative and has more appropriate choices. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 23:15, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, let's stop <i>commending</i> Jimbo for a second. No doubt that Jimbo is technically the "<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">monarch</a>" of Wikipedia, and should be treated that way, but I think we should see him as a constitutional monarch(particular in the UK style) rather than an absolute one, because, quite frankly, Wikipedia would not have grown to the point it didn't evolve from the individual viewpoints of its users. If Jimbo disagrees with us, tough, because the only reason he has become a psuedo-celebrity is because of us, because we love this project of his and his vision has become <b>our</b> vision.</p>
<p>From the one conversation i've had him, I think he's cognisant of this and wants to work with the community in any way possible, but we should set guidelines for him and for us, because quite frankly, only having "approved" candidates is basically a message saying "I, Jimbo, don't trust the general community to make the right decision." Right now as I see it, the arbcom is in a very fragile state (see <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeetoowah_9fe0.html" title="User:Keetoowah">Keetoowah</a>), and saying such a thing would only embolden the users so don't respect the legitimacy of the arbcom already.</p>
<p>This can be solved by viewing Jimbo with the rights given in theory to the modern British Monarchs -- the right to advise, the right to warn, and the right to be told. And in return, he's used as a human figurehead and spokesman for Wikipedia via his position in the Wikimedia Foundation. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 01:23, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I (and others) should commend him because he didn't have to respond here <i>at all</i>: this is a straw poll whose validity may be questioned. And, after all, to err is human: <i>noone</i> (present company included) is a paragon of virtue or ideology. While Wikipedians can agree or disagree on this and that, let's accord courtesy and respect – and guidance – where it's due ... just as I would accord it to you or to any other Wikipedian.

<dd>Commending him and giving him authoritarian rule are two different things, Anthony. I give Jimbo the same respect as any other Wikipedian when it comes to his opinion, and if he broke a policy that I saw that was worthy of a block, I'd block him just like any other Wikipedian because if we make it seem like some people are above the rules, then people will stop trusting in the rules and they'll collapse. As a symbol, a figurehead(what I think you and I are snagging on here), I do see him, or at least his persona, as something higher than that since it's a personification of who we are as a nation, much like the monarch in the UK or <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> to baseball in the 1920s or even <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Mouse_6607.html" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> when it comes to Disney.

<dd>Yes: I think we're snagging on what you cite.

As a founder and primary focal point for Wikipedia, Jimbo commented and proposed here when he didn't need to (due to time or what have you) and has proposed hybrid approaches with a possible <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus in mind</a>. He hasn't broken any rules, so evincing that line of reasoning is incorrect.

<li>I don't really feel a need to be involved, except insofar as I want to encourage us to recognize that this is not a democracy, this is not a social experiment in anarchy, this is a project to build an encyclopedia. There are pros and cons to different methods of selection/election, and these all need to be carefully considered. We should never fixate on a single way of doing things and become beholden to a particular <b>process</b> potentially at the expense of the <b>encyclopedia</b>.</li>
<li>Nothing enables me to choose potential candidates better than the community. I see no reason to think that in general, I can. At the same time, there seems to be widespread support at least for the idea that the ArbCom should not be limited just to users who are 'famous'... this was one of the grave flaws with last year's procedure that the current voting method will overcome (to a degree at least).</li>
<li>I propose that in the event I am unable to assist with decisions (due to ill health or death or whatever) that the Board of Directors decide how to move forward.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 17:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Jimbo's first arbcom was great. Unfortunately they got burned out from applying their discerning insight on too many obvious cases. Their sense of fairplay made arbcom cases longer than they needed to be.</p>
<p>Today we have the opposite. Mailing list cronies and frightening partisans have become a real Cabal. Recent cases have been judged according to political positioning, nepotism, and well known bad blood. No one should be judged by someone they have had a history of conflict with, and yet that has become the norm, despite ongoing requests for recusal.</p>
<p>I support anything that takes Jimbo out of the loop. No offense, Jimbo is a great guy, and his 1st ArbCom was awesome. Unfortunately, he is too busy doing things other than editing (which is also great!) to be any good at appointing our judges. Jimbo doesn't scale.</p>

<p>Ok, ok, hold on a second here, I think we're getting off topic. Meritocracy is a noble goal, but looking at <a href="../../../1/0/0/WP%7E1000_95fc.html" title="WP:1000">WP:1000</a> doesn't help convince me into thinking that "more edits = more qualified" as a causal relationship. Theoretically, by this theory, most of our arbcom would be robots who would do nothing but correct the grammar of the parties in arbcom cases 200 times a day.</p>
<p>However, it may be on the right track. I'd have no problem if we replaced the "edits" factor in the theory above with "conflicts successfully solved", and by that I mean conflicts that end in a resolution that a consensus would see as constructive or at least avoiding future conflicts. No doubt that would be hard to measure, if not next to impossible, but it's the only way pure meritocracy would work in this case. The vast majority of edits have nothing to do what the arbcom is there for IMO -- interpreting and enforcing policies and guidelines on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 01:41, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I obviously would want an ArbCom with the likes of 172 and Secretlondon, I realize that will not happen. Nonetheless, I feel the democratic choice of Wikipedia in December 2004 was even-handed and good - while I don't always agree with someone like Raul654's decisions, I realize he does not have an agenda that he comes to the table with. On the other hand, Jimbo, whose view of Wikipedia is of a "von Mises" model, has made horrible choices such as Fred Bauder and more lately JayJG. If JayJG is so terrific, how come he had no votes when elections were held months before he was appointed? JayJG's claim to fame is maintaining an ardent Zionist stance on pertaining pages for Wikipedia. Why does Jimbo want to stack ArbCom with far right arbitrators like this? It's fairly obvious to me, and it's quite clear why Jimbo wants to dispose of the sensible democratic choices, and stick in people with a certain agenda. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 19:30, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recently I've read in Signpost that Russian Wikipedia got it's own ArbCom elected. That came as a surprise to me because I sometimes edit here and I never saw any announcements... But that's not the point. Why is English Wikipedia is so different that Jimbo must intervene the usual ArbCom election process? Sure, English Wikipedia is larger and has better media coverage, but still, it's one of the many Wikipedias out there, and Jimbo wouldn't like to pick arbitrators for every language! He doesn't even know the users who edit these. So we need some German Jimbo, French Jimbo (Anthere?) and so on, so ArbComs "elections" would be standartised across different editions. That concludes my crazy rant for today. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 18:03, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For one thing, English is a language that Jimbo speaks fluently.

<dd>It is a very good point. Jimbo really needs to address this one. Sure, each Wikipedia is given a good amount of freedom to do things its own way, but in this case it isn't the en. version deciding to do things its own way—it's Jimbo deciding that for us. Our community has not been given the right to determine its own process, just because our founder happens to speak our language. Sigh.</dd>

<dd>Another thing: the new ArbCom is supposed to be in on Jan. 1, right? Well, aren't we kinda running out of time now? I mean, if we were going to do a standard election like last year, we'd still be OK, but with Jimbo's complex procedure, which hasn't even been fully determined yet, we haven't got a chance. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:09, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I think it could still be done if there was serious movement on it like you're talking about. But even then I think it would be tough, and unfortunately the whole thing seems to have stalled to me. At this rate I don't even know if we'll have picked a process by the new year, much less actually got the process moving. Hopefully we will see something happen soon, though. Since Jimbo is the one who aborted the old process, we can't do anything without his input and agreement. Jimbo has been devoting his time to the Seigenthaler issue, apparently, so we'd need to get him to refocus on this. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:28, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Not exactly. The main problem with last year's election was the "endorsements and disendorsements" section, which turned out to be very poisonous. It is quite easy to address this problem and still hold an election similar to last year's (by not having such a page, and indeed one was deleted some time last month). This could well be a matter of babies and bathwater.</li>
<li>The other problem is that in an election, some candidates that were considered suitable (e.g. by Jimbo) would not be elected because they weren't liked enough by the community - but this argument is also a problem in reverse: what if Jimbo appoints somebody who is controversial in the community? There is not an easy answer to this two-edged knife, but it does seem that community <i>faith</i> in the ArbCom would be improved by the former, rather than the latter. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:17, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>And thinking about the remark I just made on the main page (regarding how to select an arbcom if more than twelve people have support from both Jimbo and the community, as seems likely) the first answer that came to mind is to simply put them all on the ArbCom. Why must the ArbCom be restricted to twelve people? They tend to get overworked. Surely having 15 or 18 arbiters wouldn't hurt? It seems to make more sense to limit the ArbCom by the amount of suitable candidates, rather than by the arbitrary number of twelve. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:25, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But an arbitrary point must be drawn <i>somewhere</i>. I'm not saying that 12's the ideal number, but if the size was increased to 15 or 18, why not 20 or 23? The point is that an arbitrary cut-off point must be made somewhere, and it appears that Jimbo chose that point to be at 12. Personally, I don't think a few extra (i.e. 13 or 15) would hurt, but having too many could be a detriment to operations and inhibit some efficiency.

<dd>One major advantage of the new procedure is that we are likely to generate a pool of community-approved arbiters which is higher than the number of seats, which will mean that if we decide that the number of arbiters is too small, it will be straightforward to increase it quickly by simply opening up new seats for the people who are approved. I am highly inclined to do this, provided of course the ArbCom procedures are suitably adjusted to make sure that more arbiters means more decisions on more cases, rather than just meaning a general slowdown as more and more people have to be involved in each case. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 17:10, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Exactly. The arbitrary point should be drawn at the amount of suitable candidates we find. If we must have twelve, then it can happen that there are eleven people with 80% support, and one with 50% support (extreme example, but still). In that case we should arguably have the heavily-supported 11-people arbcom, rather than enforcing the (arbitrary) number of twelve. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:45, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Those were proposals to change the arbitrary limit of twelve to another arbitrary limit of, say, eighteen. Clearly that's not very useful to state in advance. My point is that we should not have an arbitrary limit at all. Just like we aren't limited to 500 admins, neither should we be limited to 12 arbiters. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:32, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We need to distinguish between what we want to happen and what will likely happen (which is still uncertain). All of this hinges on what Jimbo decides, so he should be compelled to decide, and then organisation can occur on whatever option. And whatever that is, we should support it and implement it without question (i.e., an impartial s/election body) once the details are finalised.</dd>

<dd>Since last year's option has significant support, a decision (by J. or organisers) needs to be made about whether endorsements are appropriate ... if that's the chosen method. This is currently unclear.</dd>

<dd>As for quantity, I don't see there being a reason to not have a pool of more arbitrators than currently. If a limit is necessary, I'd set a manageable number and choose individuals who garner <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermajority.html" title="Supermajority">supermajorities</a> downward to basic <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority.html" title="Majority">majorities</a> based on mere Y/N approval (i.e., 100% &gt; 50% + 1). However, a small, odd (but consistent) number drawn from the pool would be conducive to deciding <i>specific</i> cases at random (e.g., 5, 7, 9, or 11 as per various superior courts/panels): 5 for this one, the same or another 5 for that one, etc.</dd>

<dd>We do not need a set limit, nor do we need a competive election. The ArbCom backlog problem seems very serious. We have about 35 people who have expressed an interest in serving as arbitrators. This number does not seem excessive at all. In fact it may not be sufficient. I am not advocating self-selection. There is a need to assure that those serving will be suited to the task. Perhaps an up or down vote requiring a modest vote of confidence (say 30%) could be used to vet each applicant. Liberal rules of recusal (the process of removing individual arbitrators from specific disputes) could be used as an additional safeguard.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 22:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that a larger pool is a desirable outcome; I don't think it's clear that either methods "JW1" and "JW2" will necessarily achieve this: it depends entirely on how free JW himself is with his support, and what tactical or other considerations come into play when people vote under the "approval" system. "Bullet voting" will tend to push down the approval rate, and "veto voting" to increase it, independently of people's actual overall preferences/feelings of (dis)approval. (In both cases, come to that.) And if the dually-approved pool is indeed larger, the method of resolving the initial selection has been left unspecified. Does JW have a given list of acceptable and unacceptable candidates, and those on the latter are voted in in order of community popularity. Does JW "cherry pick" among those with 50%+ approval. Or some emergent compromise between the two? For both of these reasons, I'd much rather have some form of preference voting, with candidates elected in decreasing preference order (on an on-going basis in the case of expansion or replenishment of the committee). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 04:13, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We can't hold an election before the first week of january. For that election to be posible we would pretty much have to decide on the system now.</p>
<p>Since that isn't going to happen and this lot will pretty much shut down of christmass the earyist we could be looking at is the second week even then we would be pushing it. If we start in the second week at best new arbcom doesn't appear untill febuary.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be an assumption that the arbcom should comprise people who have put <i>themselves</i> forward. Because membership of the arbcom confers power on people, those who put themselves forward are likely to be less suitable than people who don't, because the desire for power is not an admirable quality in this context and doesn't operate toward the objective of what the Arbcom is for. My proposal is that anyone who puts themself forward should by definition be disqualified from being on the Arbcom. The appointment process should involve persuading people who don't want to be on it that they should. There are plenty of people who contribute to wikipedia, who would see the resposibility of being an effective Arbcom member as something onerous that they wouldn't volunteer for, but who might nevertheless be persuaded that they would do a good job and who would therefore be prepared to take it on if invited. There are plenty more people in wikipedia who might have some idea who would make good arbitrators because of their fairness and absence of selfish ambition. The process of appointing an effective arbcom should recognise this, the more so since the existing arbcom has obtained a poor reputation. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 13:42, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are in turn assuming that people who have put themselves forward haven't been persuaded by others to put their name forwards. For example, a number of people appointed to the ArbCom (e.g. Kelly Martin, mindspillage) were appointed by Jimbo. You of course are welcome to persuade people to stand in the upcoming elections. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 13:49, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
