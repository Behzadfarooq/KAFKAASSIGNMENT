<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: 39. I am a high school teacher, rocknroll ukulele player, and wikipedian.</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: Sad to say, initially it may be 50 per month. But once procedures get into place, I think it would be upwards of 25 hours per month.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: er...my edits probably speak for themselves. I do not have any specific examples.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>
<p>A: No others.</p>

</dl>
<p><i>Do you hold any strong political or religious opinions (e.g. concerning George Bush, Islam, or on which end you should break a boiled egg)? If so, would you recuse yourself from cases centred on these?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly hold strong political and religious opinions. However, I guard the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> article from vandalism just as much as I guard the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

</dl>
<p><i>How willing are you to contest the decisions of other arbitrators rather than just "go with the flow"?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I am fully capable of going against the grain when necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I am open to reviewing and re-evaluating cases.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them. Do you support this decision? [if current arbitrator] Does your visible behaviour on recent cases reflect this decision?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I feel an arbiter is bound to examine what has been presented, and should shy away from expanding a case beyond its original breadth. The duty of an arbiter is not to investigate, but to arbitrate.</dd>

<p>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system? Do you think that the spirit of cooperation in Wikipedia would survive such a change? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 15:52, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are 1,000s of wikipedians and plenty of different experiences. It is difficult to build a community in a faceless, formless realm like the Internet. The main focus of the project is to build a trustworthy, comprehensive encyclopedia. I hope that this can be done through consensus, partnerships, cooperation, dignity and humility. Wikipedians need to keep open minds; they need to see other POVs. In the end, rather than polarizing issues, Wikipedia would be best served by providing space and coverage of many POVs, through exposition. Jimmy Wales is a benevolent dictator. It’s always been that way. If I am part of the ArbCom, my goals and actions will similarly have benevolence as its foundation.</dd>

<p>I'll probably end up posing this question to all whose views I don't already know:</p>
<p>What is, in your opinion, the proper use of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>?

<dd>If used properly, common sense is best. Most users use common sense. I don’t want a wikipedia-world in which arbitration is the norm. I want a wikipedia-world in which people work together, try, make mistakes, forgive mistakes, and work harder. I am opposed to using rules to justify actions.</dd>

<dd>Civility is key to the survival of wikipedia. We must all be willing to turn the other cheek, bite our tongues, commend others, help others, not take the bait of a troll, and lead by example. Trying and forgiving are of utmost importance.</dd>

<p><i>As a corollory:Do you believe, regardless of Jimbo Wales' view on the matter, that a large number of signatories (e.g. 150 requesting censure against 50 supporting the arbitrator) to an RFC against an arbitrator is enough that the arbitrator should be judged as having been rejected by the community in light of their actions, and consequently for them to be forcibly stripped of their post?</i></p>

<li>Penalty for what? i can imagine such a penalty for cheating or fraud, but certainly not for making an unpopular decision. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 03:48, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Admins need to make judgment calls on the fly - but they mustn't abuse their powers. there is less bureaucracy when admins are given the freedom to act boldly. i do not think it is wrong for an admin without warning to give a 30 minute block to an IP address, for example. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 03:48, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>I am concerned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" rel="nofollow">templates</a> surviving AfD that appear to contrast with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">established policy</a>. In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
