If this page is meant for ArbCom members only, I'll remove this comment, but about the section "<i>The Committee has jurisdiction over the official mailing list "WikiEN-l"</i>", how are you going to guarantee that an email user that identifies themself as an editor is, in fact, that Wikipedia user? -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 03:59, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No no, "normal" users are of course welcome. :-)</dd>
<dd>As for that, well, the same way that we "guarantee" that particular users are sockpuppets of one another - we don't, really, just make sure that we are satisified that it is highly unlikely to be the case.</dd>

<p>I've got some comments -</p>
<p>Firstly, the proposals under "Jurisdiction". I'm not sure about the first one. Referring cases to the mediation committee when mediation clearly wasn't likely to work was a patently stupid practice, and one that thankfully seems to have stopped. However, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the idea of simply rejecting cases, and leaving disputes raging.</p>
<p>While I agree that the second point re: IRC and private email needs to be clarified, I also have some misgivings about this. It seems that "IRC is not part of our jurisdiction" has been the general position of the AC lately. However, in the Lir case, the "Lir is a repeated liar" finding of fact was carried, citing three piece of evidence, two of which came from IRC. As this case was only decided pretty recently, the contradiction concerns me.</p>
<p>As far as the third proposal there, I strongly disagree - it's very unlikely that this would ever happen, but a board member, should they screw up, should be able to be dragged before the AC just as much as everyone else, IMHO.</p>
<p>I agree with the changes under "Requests", "Hearing" and "Judgment" - they all seem to be quite sensible moves to bring the policy into line with current procedure. I dislike the "Amendment" section, however - why should amending the arbitration policy be different to any other? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:13, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All of the changes to the "Jurisdiction" section are to make it better reflect the current situation - the <i>realpolitik</i>, as it were. We have rejected cases out of hand beforehand (and if we weren't able to, then what on Earth is the point of voting to accept them in the first place?) If a Board member screws up, that is a matter for the Board to decide - it's out of our jurisdiction. This is in the same way as that, were the (British) Queen to commit some criminal act, she could not be prosecuted, as the prosecution acts in her name, and for her to prosecute herself makes no sense. Indeed, it would probably precipitate somewhat of a constitutional crisis, but at least if we make it clear in the policy that this is a potential point.</dd>
<dd>As for the amendment, it should be pointed out, I feel, that the "Arbitration policy" is meta-Wikipedia policy: it's policy about policy (specifically, about how it is interpretted, and so on), and so it has been suggested that it should in some way be afforded a more explicit enumeration of the manner of it being changed. I'm not entirely in favour of such a policy, I'm just tabling these suggestions that I've picked up from others as well as invented myself.</dd>

<p>I would suggest that, "As a body reporting to the Wikimedia Foundation Board, with the ability to direct the Committee to reach a verdict or otherwise act in a particular way, the Committee has no jurisdiction over the members of the Board" is slightly unclear. As it currently stands, it reads that the Committee has the ability to direct the Committee... How about changing "with the ability" to "which has the ability"? --<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.11.216.59.html" title="User:195.11.216.59">195.11.216.59</a> 09:45, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe it is best if the arbitration committee accepts jurisdiction over all Wikipedia related activities that Wikipedia users engage in.

<p>I would propose that <i>Jimmy Wales, who retains the power to veto Committee decisions, shall not be subject to a case heard by this Committee, without his consent.</i> As other individual board members do not have individual veto power over the committee, I believe they should not be excluded from arbitration. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 12:46, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would reiterate my stance that Jimbo Wales may be the founder of this site, but <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a> is a user of this site who is to abide by its rules. I see no reason to exclude that user from our jurisdiction. Frankly, I think Jimbo would prefer to avoid such preferential treatment, and I think it would be good not to give the impression that anyone here is "above the law". I know if Jimbo did something awful to a contributor at this site (highly unlikely, in my opinion), I would not want to believe that we had no power to censure those actions. I would argue that, unless Jimbo himself requests this special treatment, there is no reason for us to offer it. If Jimmy has a reason for requesting it, I'll gladly hear it, but my interactions with him suggest strongly to me that he would feel much as I do about this. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 13:48, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As Jimbo has veto power over the committee, he <i>is</i> above its jurisdiction. If <i>he</i> wishes to avoid this impression (and only <i>he</i> is in a position to do this), he can waive his right to veto the committee in cases where he is involved and he can consent to the jurisdiction of the committee in any and all cases which may arise. Personally, I think he should do this, but until he does the arbitration committee should not waste its time deciding cases concerning a user with veto power over it. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 14:35, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would argue that Jimbo's veto power does not restrict our ability to censure or restrict his behavior as a user of the site. He is not exempt from AC jurisdiction -- rather, he is the one person who is in a position to make our decisions void. That does not, however, justify us in saying we have no ability to investigate his actions as a user of this site. It simply puts him in an unusual position -- of course, if Jimbo ever misbehaved badly enough as a user to warrant censure and then vetoed the consequences, I think we'd have ourselves <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">a little problem</a>. I like Jimbo a great deal, and I'm arguing for this purely out of principle. No user is exempt from policies here. No user has the right to "do whatever they want". That includes Jimbo. Even if he does have a veto (which he's not yet used, as I recall, and which I would be surprised to see anytime soon), that doesn't alter his agreement to use this site appropriately and obey its restrictions. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 21:22, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I largely agree with you. And this is mainly an argument about something which is never going to happen. But I think it would be best if Jimbo explicitly consents to the jurisdiction of the committee. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 00:34, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't see how you can jurisdiction over the mailing lists since there are no written policies for the lists. Breaking of the unwritten policies of wikien-l should be entirely for the list admins to decide. Perhaps the arbcom could take cases where someone wants arbitration against the list admins, but I think they need to retain jurisdiction over their list. It shouldn't be up to the arbcom to decide who is banned from wikien-l when it has always been the list admins who decide this. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 14:39, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I think Angela has a good point. I also think what James was aiming for is to say that during arbitration, evidence from the mailing list can be (and in the past has been) introduced. As a counterexample, evidence from IRC is generally not admissible. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 17:48, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think jurisdiction in that respect is fairly well established -- the mailing list is administered by the list admins, and IRC is administered by the IRC admins. It's not our job to enforce wikipedia protocols there, but we do accept evidence introducted from the mailing list (but not IRC, because no definitive account is available). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 20:30, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree entirely with the position of Angela, Fred Bauder, and Jwrosenzweig. In their individual capacities on Wikipedia, members of the Board must be subject to the same policies as apply to other users, not given immunity to do anything they feel like doing without regard to community consensus. To the extent that the Board wants to change the application of policies, it would need to do so as a body, collectively and not individually. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:24, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree with the right of evidence gathering and publication from private e-mails. In the word "private", there is a notion that should suggest that this is not a good thing to do. I am aware that some people will just not care, and use/publish these data, but making it our policy is just a bad idea. I think that some editors rights should be respected, and privacy in private mails is one of these. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">SweetLittleFluffyThing</a> 22:53, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that this might not be a very good idea, as it could allow team of 4 arbitrators within the first minutes of case starting, just to plain close a case. The case would be closed before any of the other members have possibility to give their opinion on the case. Perhaps a minimal time is best ?

<dd>The committee reports to the community, and informs the board as a courtesy, if at all - has it habitually informed the board so far? The Wikimedia Foundation is the hosting provider, not the communities being hosted. The community sets the policies the committee must enforce and could choose to have a policy that this committee may not enforce policy, or that a different committee should enforce them. The committee has authority over both board members and community members for their actions within the community. The Foundation does not have the authority to direct the committee. If the Wikimedia Foundation board decides that it dislikes the decisions, it's at liberty to request that the community seek hosting elsewhere if it is unable to persuade the community. If the Foundation chose to use executive power contray to the wishes of the community, that invites the community to seek hosting elsewhere or to tolerate the conflict until it has done so. The board members have authority within the Foundation, not the communities. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 23:18, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mr Bauder states, "I believe it is best if the arbitration committee accepts jurisdiction over all Wikipedia related activities that Wikipedia users engage in." I find myself absolutely opposed to such a philosophy for a number of reasons. I feel that the Committee should have jurisdiction over whatever an individual does in his or her capacity as a <i>user</i>, which is to say, through edits to the encyclopedia. Anything done as a private person (for example, suggesting on his or her own website that Wikipedia is filled with errors and is completely useless) should not be punishable by the Committee. To allow censure of "all Wikipedia related activities" is too expansive of the Committee's jurisdiction and restricts too much the personal liberties of the users. Only that which the whole Community of the Wikipedia controls—that is to say, the encyclopedia, the mailing list, etc.—should be within, and anything that is not controlled by the Community—private websites, private e-mails, etc.—must be without, the jurisdiction of this Committee.</p>
<p>A proposed rule states, "IRC evidence and evidence gathered from private e-mails may, however, be used to support a claim being made about actions on Wikipedia itself." I don't have any problem with IRC evidence, but I do have a problem with e-mail exchange. Firstly, to introduce an offensive e-mail could inflame and prejudice the Arbitrators, and lead the Committee to punish the e-mail (over which I believe it ought to have no jurisdiction at all), instead of punishing the actual offence originally alleged. Secondly, e-mails from third parties should not be introduced, as they constitute hearsay—the third parties will not be able to be examined or challenged in any way, especially if they are not active Wikipedia users. But thirdly, and most crucially, there appears to be no way to authenticate this so-called "evidence." Parties could merely invent e-mails and introduce them as evidence; there would be no way to determine whether such an e-mail was actually sent, except perhaps by an admission of the other party.</p>

<dl>
<dd>In the absence of the other party saying "I never sent that e-mail," however, I think this falls under the heading of assuming good faith. If the third party does say they never sent the e-mail, then the arbitrators can use their judgment. If they think the e-mail is dodgy or unbelievable, they're more than capable of ignoring that evidence. Since arbitration is all about trusting their judgment, this seems very sensible to me. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:34, Sep 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose limiting deliberations in arbitration cases to issues included in the complaint, excluding countercharges and other matters which may come up in the course of arbitration. If a person complained against comes up with a scattering of countercharges it is very tedious to go through them and requires a great deal of energy for very little return in most cases. Also the reaction of complaining witnesses when they find themselves in the dock for personal attacks or other infractions thus subject to mild sanctions is quite negative and creates a great deal more heat than light. While some disputes may be one on one, many concern an issue which has passed through the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> procedure. In those cases where three or more users have certified the basis for the dispute the focus needs to be on the issues in the Request for comment. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:56, Sep 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>If <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy</a> is consulted it will be noted that it is silent on this issue. While it is implicit in two person dispute that both will have issues, it is not necessarily so in the type of complaint where a group of users are distressed by a users behavior. They may have sinned themselves but the focus is better placed on the main problem. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:56, Sep 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree with the above proposition. Counter-complaints may be made appropriately in inter-personal disputes. But in disputes betwen a user and a significant portion of the community, it seems unfair to penalise those who represent the community. Essentially, the current policy allows the defendant to complain against the prosecutor.</dd>
<dd>So, I think that the following rule may be created: in personal disputes (for instance, A charges B of personally attacking him, and <i>vice versa</i>), counter-charges are to be allowed, but in general community disputes (for instance, A charges B of vandalism, of using an inappropriate user name, of personally attacking a third party, of incorrectly using Administrative powers against a third party, etc.) counter-charges should not be suffered. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 19:31, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think counterclaims should be allowed but with a more formal process. Not allowing counterclaims would force someone to make a completely independent arbitration request which could well result in two ArbComm panels dealing with the same individuals and overlapping facts at the same time, perhaps reaching different conclusions. Clearly, it would be more efficient for the same panel dealing with all complaints coming out of a dispute. Perhaps to avoid frivolous counterclaims there should be a requirement that a) the counterclaim is clearly laid out and b) the counterclaim cannot proceed without the agreement of at least five of the arbitrators hearing the original complaint.
