<p>I got an idea. How about when we figure out a way to elect some people, they can appoint say 3-5 people from a list of users who want to help. These volunteers/electees are randomly put into a group, then take a case and vote on it, majority rules. The only problem I see with this is that it could be easily rigged/exploites (but this implies that we would nominate wikijerks, not trusted members to appoint individual commitees). We could keep the election process the same while hopefully killing off the backlogs. If a volunteer member of the committe is slow, it is put forth to another individual arbcom for consideration of punishment/banishment/exile/flogging/removal of that user from the program. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerzog_e7e1.html" title="User:Herzog">Herzog</a> 07:47, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is called an election repeatedly, but when you read the fine print of the article, it says the election is meaningless, and what will probably happen is Jimbo will decide who will be appointed and then appoint them. So why is it called an election? It is not an election, or at least it is a completely pointless and meaningless election.</p>
<p>If I edited articles regarding socialist governments run by Communist parties that have elections more democratic than the method here, I would be reverted and be accused of having extreme POV. Yet on Wikipedia this non-election is called an election. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 22:25, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ruy Lopez, I've reverted your changes. The previous name is consistant with all the links and past elections and there is no reason to change it to a new name. Just because the election will be under a different format does not neccessitate a move to a different name. In either case, your assertion that is not an election or is a meaningless election is disputed; that is no reason to move the page.

<p><i>I wouldn't want to be a member of any club that would have me.</i></p>
<p>There's an important voice missing in the world of arbitration: those who have not proposed themselves for membership.</p>
<p>Shouldn't there be some effort to recruit simply by offering the job to random people and seeing who's game? Say, "you can have this job, without politicking and without risk other than your time. Will you do it?"</p>
<p>Because otherwise the bureaucracy is full of, well, bureaucrats. Which is precisely the problem this part of it is meant to fight... <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.237.179.238.html" title="User:216.237.179.238">216.237.179.238</a> 23:58, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is the great difficulty of selecting leaders - finding leaders who are not attracted by power but yet have the skills and time to do the job. Self nomination is one of the alternatives that works. Personally, I would prefer that Arbitrators be nominated by someone else (or a committee of people that identify people with the required skills) and then the nominated person can accept or reject the nomination. Unfortunately, in practice this ends up being exposed to charges of "playing politics" and "establishing an oligarchy". <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 14:34, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Arbitors are not jurors. The roles are not even very similar -- they're closer to being judges. Jurors typically need instruction as to what the law is so they can apply it, serve only for a single case, and are making relatively simple judgements. Note also that the American system is not the only system in the world - I doubt there is anything radically novel about the way things work here. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 22:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What will be the time period of the processs now approved by Jimbo? -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 15:26, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I left this message on Jimbo's talk page, repeated here for more eyeballs:</p>
<p>I think deciding the election procedure based on a straw poll, which is designed to get people's feedbacks on a range of available options, with around 40-50 people participating in total (which isn't significantly larger than the number of people standing for the Arbitration Committee) is a inherently bad idea. It's not like there was a significant majority in favour of any one of the proposals, either.</p>
<p>The result of a straw poll is not to use the procedure with the most support, it is to find out why other people didn't like that proposal, and work on improving it so that people who didn't support the original idea will support an improved version (or at least, not oppose as much). <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 15:29, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Jimbo's annoucement says that the community should begin the process, patterned as closely to RfA as possible, immediately. <i>Someone's</i> got to take the initiative and get the ball rolling. Thoughts on that page? It's basically copied and pasted from RfA. Also, does anyone have any comments regarding elections date and voter eligibity? All the past elections have lasted two weeks and have only been open to people who have been a registered user for 90 days or more. Thoughts on that?

<dd>Well, all registered users are welcome to vote on RfAs, but a new user's vote will most likely be discounted. The past elections all have used 90 days as a cut-off point, and the Board election, if I remember correctly, required both 90 days and a minimum number of edits. RfAs run for one week, but I feel that this should last longer, simply because of its importance.

<dd>Even though the vote is to be "patterned as closely as is reasonable after the RfA process", are we going to permit explanations of votes (pro and con) or simply require the voters limit their votes to <b>Support</b> and <b>Oppose</b>? I would prefer the latter since this voting process is characterized as "approval" rather than "consensus". Otherwise, it seems that we will be back in the infamous disendorsement situation. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 17:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry if I wasn't clear; I'm in general agreement with you both. There seems tbe some dissent above, particularly from those advocating merely for a vote, about how to proceed. My request of Jimbo was to indicate that we indeed have a clear mandate to act (or to specify who can, since he noted the Board of Directors too) without succumbing to procedural gridlock or wrangling.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since it seems Jimbo has endowed us with a mandate to act – and I think we can – we need to: plan ... reiterate and <i>clearly detail</i> the chosen process (<b>Jimbo 2</b>) here, strike a neutral polling body/administrator, refine any points of process contention, establish a timeframe/review period, define candidate eligibility (if applicable), devise marketing (e.g., posting notices on appropriate pages), implementation the plan, and candidate selection/'certification'.</dd>

<dd>Details (only basic):
<ul>
<li>suffrage requirements: loose – any Wikipedian in good standing, except perhaps for those adminstrating the vote until the very end, if at all</li>
<li>timeframe: given the need for perfunctories, we should try to initiate a vote Sun. 18 Dec. and have it proceed until year's end or shortly into 2006?</li>

<dd>I somewhat agree with Jpg: alot of Wikipedians will die between now and new year's ... that's no reason to not get underway now (or soon). On the other end, more people may be home during the holidays and with more time to edit Wp and participate. As well, the vote can last until the 2nd week of January: the terms of the current arbitrators expire at year's end. (By analogy, a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2006">Canadian federal election was recently called</a> and will take place in late January.) Thus, we need to equitably deal with the transition: any new cases will be dealt with by the new ArbComm and current cases under their charge can be grandfathered until they are concluded. This will ensure continuity and stability. E Pluribus Anthony 07:57, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I will be (with measure) and others worldwide, who may not celebrate during this period, may or may not be. I would think, then, that it be prudent for us to get your input before your respite, potentially initiate a vote, and let it continue into (early/late) Jan. You can 'campaign' before the 23rd and after the 3rd. While I'm not resistant to initiating a vote after the holidays, this isn't preferred: I'm more concerned with ArbComm continuity. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</dd>

<li>I would prefer not to stretch the vote for longer than two weeks. It feels unnecessary to stretch it like that.

<dd>I somewhat disagree with that: more time will allow more input. For the prior HDI vote I administered, for instance, the period of voting/commentary was almost a month (and many captive users commented), and we garnered somewhat sizeable vote tallies (50 or so) that determined the course of action. It continues to garner votes (but at a very low pace)! What sort of feedback have we garnered on RfCs (like this iissue) over two weeks? Do you think it a sufficient amount of time to garner a significant number of votes? If so, OK; but, in any even, I'd suggest a compromise 3 weeks, or even 4. I'm easy!&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony 13:13, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based on experience with older polls, anything running for more than two weeks doesn't work too well. The vast majority of votes come in during the first week, and by the end of the third week, many people have forgotten about the poll.

I advocate three precisely because we/Wikipedians need more information, not less. If a groundswell prefers two, I'll support it, but I don't see it yet. So, I propose 10–31 January.

<li>Yes, I object, per the above. A wikiwide vote gets most attention in the first five days or thereabouts, and later input wanes and does not to significantly alter the results. Look over the result of earlier major votes (e.g. 2004 election, boardvote or even the CSD vote) and you'll see that <i>one</i> week is in fact long enough a period to "garner sufficient vote numbers". Extending it to two weeks would be reasonable to allow latecomers to catch up, but there really isn't any need for three. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 15:37, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>For rules disputes and common sense issues I'd be willing to trust a newbie as much as anyone.

<li>Though I think any comments, if we must have them (as I think we will), should be on the same page as the votes, I would like to see them separated from the actual vote in a distinct "comments" section, for two reasons. First, on RFA the large majority of "comments" seem to reflect a simple feeling that some comment is necessary. Even RFAs that are being approved 30/0/0 or 40/0/0 are full of repetitive comments like "good editor". Let's take off the pressure to explain votes. Second, many explanations contained in "oppose" votes on RFA have elements of pros and cons on the candidate but are nuanced by the fact that they set out are in the "oppose" section. In the spirit of dispensing with the disfavored "disendorsements" of last year, grouping all comments in one section would allow the comment to be interpreted free of an influencing label. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 15:28, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Not to mention that with a significant amount of votes, the help that voting for yourself gives you is quite insignificant. Worst case scenario, I believe it could be coded in, or vote organizers could manually discount all votes by candidates for themselves, but I think this is unnecessary. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 15:11, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good. But since voting for oneself in RfAdmin is discouraged, there's no reason to make an exception here. One can <i>infer</i> support for oneself without voting to do so. (It would be interesting if a candidate would vote <i>against</i> oneself!) Whether this is an automatic or manual intervention (deletion), I think it should be laid out ... we should assume nothing.&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony 15:22, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One problem with the ArbComVote thing that I didn't immediately think about is that by abstaining from voting for a candidate, you are in fact voting against them. This would eliminate nearly every possibility for a candidate to gain 50%. I support public voting, then, unless the ArbComVote software is rewritten to include "Yes", "No", and "Abstain". <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 15:14, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. If only the software could interpret an abstention as we do, i.e., ambivalent. E Pluribus Anthony 15:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, one supposes that Jimbo's 50% is of those voting. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm reading between the lines, perhaps, but I think 50% approval does mean 50% of those voting, however they vote. Personally, I interpret a "neutral" vote as a vote that is not in favor and would count it in the total votes in determining whether 50% approval was obtained. On the hand, the word "abstain" connotes to me not registering a vote at all. If its not a vote, it should not be counted. The issue is one of semantics. The key will be to make it absolutely clear how those "neutral" or "abstain" votes will (or will not) be counted. If we allow comments, there is no particular reason why someone who doesn't want their vote to be counted should feel compelled to register a "neutral" vote -- they could merely leave a comment and not vote. We just need to decide how the "neutral" or "abstain" entries are treated and make it <i>very</i> clear. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 18:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I generally agree, DS. To me, though: an abstention is analogous (in this instance) to a spoiled ballot; neither positive nor negative and one of indifference or even protest. Of course there is the 'silent' abstention: to not vote at all. If a third category is included (and I'm not rigid about including one), I agree that we should clearly lay out how such votes should be counted, i.e., including 'neutral' votes in the total vote count as per DS' suggestion.

<ul>
<li>If one abstains to vote, one does not vote. An abstention is obviously not the same as a vote to oppose. Hence, abstentions should never be counted towards any kind of percentage. If people vote in a confused, ambiguous, or ill-understood way (e.g. "neutral") we should ask them if they actually mean that to be a vote to oppose, and if not, the vote should not be counted. Simply put, a candidate passes if the amount of 'support' votes exceeds the amount of 'oppose' votes. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 15:48, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Exclude it. What value does entering a vote as "I either don't care or am sufficiently ambivalent not to want a make a difference in this person's candidacy one way or the other" have, other than a typing exercise? If you want someone, vote yes. If you don't, vote no.

<li>That's not an appropriate comparison - last year's vote was to select the best people from a group, and this year's vote is to determine suitability of individuals.

<p>Hello! As a result of our ongoing discussions above, I've summarised a provisional rule set here. This is meant to serve as a concise guide for all of us and Wikipedians regarding the elections and process thereof. Please feel free to comment and edit; once this is done, I'll present to Anthere and Angela, get their support and I'll post it on the article page; then we can create, configure, and link to ArbCom candidate pages.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is contingent (somewhat) on whether <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthere</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> wants to act as the electoral officer; I've called this position the Wikipedia Electoral Officer; interested Wikipedians (e.g., me!) can function to help administrate the elections and are subordinate to the WEO. In any event, if we're OK with this summary, I'll approach A &amp; A and we can get cracking!</p>
<p>Whatyathink? Comments are invited. Thanks again! E Pluribus Anthony 12:35, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello again! Thanks again for your input on the ruleset.

<p>It looks like the rules have been generally agreed on. But I can't find anywhere to support/oppose specific candidates. Is there a page similar to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">WP:RfA</a> if not I would propose Wikipedia:Proposed Arbitrators with subpages of Wikipedia:Proposed Arbitrators/Username to indicate support. Although Arbitrators serve for specific terms, I think we will continue to have attrition because the job is so difficult, as that happens new arbitrators can be proposed elected/appointed thoughout the year, and maybe even have 2-3 alternate arbitrators who are available to be immediately put on the committee when someone resigns. <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 01:50, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the general approach outlined here. I am not sure if enough people are aware of the discussion to say there is broad consensus, but perhaps they are and choose not to comment? If something else has to be done to get broader consensus, it should be, I guess. On the topic of secret ballots, have there been other elections here that used them rather than public approval voting processes? The page about the board election didn't make it clear whether they used public or secret ballots, or else I missed it.++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 14:16, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed: I'd <i>love</i> for there to be more input on the proposed ruleset or anything else discussed herein with the goal of arriving at or IDing consensus. Anthere has been presented with the rules developed so far and has been asked to participate; we are awiting her feedback and, otherwise, some of us have decided to give it a rest for now. Another discussion is underway at the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">admin's noticeboard</a>, but more may be needed. And then there's the "silent" majority.

<p>Can someone update me on things? I haven't had time to follow for the last week or so. Will all us candidates get our own pages where people can support and oppose, like admin noms?

<dd>Voting and questions will be put on the questions-for-the-candidate page, which each candidate should already have. Format is nearly identical to admin noms. Voting is expected to start in the second week of january. There are two problems; the first is that several people object to open voting and prefer closed voting; the second is that Kelly objects to most of these suggestions on principle, if I understand correctly this is either because they were not created by the person she wishes to be in charge of elections (Raul Mark), or because there hasn't been enough response to them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:44, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi! Earlier, I asked Anthere to review the ruleset, et al. and she said she'll be getting back to us after her review. Additional discussions are also underway on the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">admin's noticeboard</a>. Until then, a few of us have agreed to wait for more feedback and to give it a rest; that doesn't preclude other efforts, though.

<p>Second week of Jan. sounds rather late to me...why not Jan. 1?

<dd>The vast majority of the voting and discussion of any poll takes place during the first week of the poll. If we start the election on January 1, then that first week of discussion occurs when most university classes are out for the holidays and students no longer have their always-on high-speed connections, and the election ends during the incredibly-hectic first week of class. Most of the people with the time to be involved in running Wikipedia are college students, so we'd be effectively locking them out of the election. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 00:16, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi! IMHO: it might be problematic to get underway quickly (i.e., on 1 Jan./06) without a process being hammered down yet or a consensus not yet within reach. The provisional set of rules that some of us have been working on accounts for this somewhat (startdate of 9 Jan./06). I think we should await feedback from Anthere or others before proceeding definitively? That's it for me. E Pluribus Anthony 00:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see that as a very important issue. If they want to participate, they will. What I think is really important is that we've now gone past the deadline, so we need to hold it as early as reasonably possible so that we don't go over the deadline any more than necessary. In the future we need to take the deadline more seriously. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:06, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's not put the cart before the horse. If there was a consensus to act, moving forward wouldn't be an issue; however, given the above, we might not have it just yet. A day or two now will allow valuable (and neutral) input from those who have been solicited for that input (e.g., Anthere, admins). Otherwise, it might be fool-hardy to proceed: the last thing that we need this year is for the process or results of any ArbComm vote questioned because it was administered without a general framework or agreement. And given this, IMHO, I do not believe the election can or should start on New Year's. Patience, even for precious days, might be a virtue. E Pluribus Anthony 01:18, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

What I don't like is waiting until the middle of the month and then having the new ArbCom not get in until Feb. How is arbitration going to be handled during this limbo period? Will terms expire as usual on Jan. 1 and arbitration will just cease to function for a while, or will the terms be extended? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:56, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really don't like all these solutions which just say "Ask Jimbo". We have to come up with some way to live without Jimbo. What happens if he dies in a <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoolander.html" title="Zoolander">freak gasoline fight accident</a>? <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 02:20, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then we would have started the election on the 1st of December. We had everthing set up to run without Jimbo but then he decided he needed to be involved. Fair enough short of a board vote we would have a hard time stopping him from being involved. The problem is he hasn't really told us what he wants. Therefore beyond a certian point everything is guesswork. Even at this stage the sensible thing would probably be to go back to last year's system (ie one that we know works to a degree) however that is unlikely at this stage.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 02:44, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I doubt that would work; Jimbo rarely responds to anything. Which is very bad, in my opinion, if he is determined to take on this kind of executive role. He needs to either be willing to devote the time to dealing with this stuff, or he needs to let the community do it itself (preferably the latter, but I'll take either one over this frustrating business of exercising control but procrastinating and hardly even responding to the community). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:27, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>No, that was just complaining. If he wants to control things, which I don't approve of, he needs to at least be actively involved. He can be a dictator and work hard at this, or a constitutional monarch and stay aloof from it, but he can't be a dictator who just lets the papers pile up on his desk. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think we're getting a bit off topic and revisiting (perhaps unnecesarily) old ground. Jimbo has already specified the way we should go – regardless of whether he's intimately involved – and that must be respected. (Perhaps involvement can be addressed again <i>after</i> this year's ArbComm elections.) As well, the rules that some of us have worked on already address some of the basics (when, how, etc.), so they should be approved, refined, or otherwise dealt with. (The start date in the draft rules is 9 Jan./06). To that end, we should wait to hear back from Anthere (on the Board), et al. before moving forward and determining the precise process: to do so without agreement or a clear mandate – and we're not there yet – is a recipe for trouble (methinks). My two cents ...&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony 03:19, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The proposal Jimbo put forth and people voted on in that straw poll read like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Jimbo can put forward candidates for community approval, 50% majority is enough. And also the community can put forward candidates for Jimbo's approval, with the same 50% majority being enough. Any dually approved candidates above the number of seats on the ArbCom go into a pool of reserves. Jimbo states a general intention to always appoint candidates approved by the community as a matter of convention, while reserving the right to refuse to seat any particularly problematic candidates.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I did not support this proposal but I didn't object to it either since it did not appear unreasonable to me. I assumed that he was talking about a closed vote performed with some technical solution like last year's approval vote. But now Jimbo has stated that what he meant was a process modelled on the RFA process. I strongly object to that and I think it is a recipe for disaster. I doubt most of the people who voted for this option thought they were supporting something like that. If we go forward with this it will mean, I predict, much more acrimony than we had last year. Negative campaigning will be rampant. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 11:41, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't think further petitions are going to get us anywhere. We need this election, and we need it soon. As stated above, starting around January 6th sounds about right. That is what, two and a half weeks? During which most of the wiki is low on activity. So if you wanted to contest Jimbo's decision, why didn't you do it the moment he <i>made</i> it in the first place? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:52, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't watch Jimbo's every move as he makes it. I just read in the Signpost that he'd made this decision and came here to protest it. The delay in the proceedings is not my fault. It is, to put it bluntly, Jimbo's fault. He decided he wanted to be involved, left us in the dark for weeks on <i>how</i> he wanted to be involved. Then he set up a poll which gave no consensus for anything and finally he's decided we should go with an option which was, in my opinion, not even specified in that poll. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 13:19, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Quite. And all of this was perfectly clear (to me at least) in the way the poll was conducted. Unfortunately, it is probably too late to turn back the clock. As a prospective candidate, I've tried to keep out of this discussion for a while now, but I'd like to put on record that I believe that an RfA-type poll is the worst possible option. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 13:25, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Let's return to what Jimbo has stated (in addition to the above):
<dl>
<dd><i>The community can and should begin a community approval process immediately, patterned as closely as is reasonable after the RfA process. The point of the process should be to generate a pool of acceptable candidates from whom I can make appointments.</i><br /></dd>
<dd><i>Notice that the way this is designed, all candidates must go through the approval process, so my role in putting forward candidates is essentially just a way for me to communicate pre-approval to the community. I don't plan to do that in this term unless it appears that we are overlooking someone particularly noteworthy.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If an open RFA-like vote is found to be unreasonable (and I don't think it is in Wp, nor does Jimbo infer that in his statements), one can argue that the converse is: as with RfA, public voting exposes candidates to scrutiny (good <i>and</i> bad) and may embolden voters who have not asserted a position either way. And this can be done with <i>or</i> without comments. Moreover, a neutral administrator can ensure everything is on track and conducted properly (including participation in discussions like this). I'm really neither here nor there (i.e., public or not, comments or not) but we should proceed as Jimbo has indicated ... within reason. E Pluribus Anthony 14:22, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I concur with R. – we need to move and soon, in a manner that's consistent with the letter and spirit of Jimbo's decision, and do so when there's general agreement or sufficient input on how. If someone wished to lead that charge and organise, IMHO, it should be a neutral third-party: an administrator or other interested party who is neither a current ArbComm member nor a current candidate. That's why, as suggested days ago, Anthere or even Angela (as Board members, <i>ergo</i> authority/legitimacy) might be ideal. Anyhow ... E Pluribus Anthony 13:13, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Since Filiocht has expressed an opinion, I will too: I am completely opposed to the notion of an open (RFA) style election. First, even if the rules (such as those suggested by E Pluribus Anthony) prohibit discussive voting, people will make discussive votes nonetheless, which will just repeat the disendorsement problem from last year's election. Second, public voting may tend to have a chilling effect on voters, as some voters may feel intimidated against voting against a candidate, especially if that candidate is a current Arbitrator. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 13:45, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There seem to be one or two candidates with a history and reputation of retaliating against others for past issues. While it may be chilling to vote against those, it should be obvious that such people have no business whatsoever being an Arbiter. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 14:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not the point, although it does illustrate why public voting is inappropriate: people will take the advantage to make unfair and slanderous digs at people they don't like. The problem is that voters may feel chilled (whether or not such feeling is justified; perhaps due to the result of a malicious slander campaign orchestrated by others opposed to that person's candidacy). In any case, a candidate who was prone to such behaviors would presumably prefer open voting, precisely because it would give that candidate the opportunity to make threats. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 14:54, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't planning on commenting on the proposals at all, but as Kelly and Filocht have, I shall. I am very very concerned about open voting. Unless there is a hard-and-fast rule that the only comment allowable is a signature (i.e. no "strong support", "weak oppose", or "extreme lesbian neutral" voting and no comments at all) it seems a very poor idea. I am concerned, however, that this could become an RFA-style pile-on, which is ugly and unconstructive. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 16:04, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Before we <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a> ourselves to death over this issue, I should point out again that it really isn't that big a deal. It's already been proposed that all comments attached to votes are to be summarily removed, thus leading to the hard-and-fast rule Sam Korn mentions. Regarding bully candidates and slander campaigns, I should point out that
<ul>
<li>The community is smart enough to identify candidates that bully or make threats, and they would not be elected regardless of how elections are done</li>
<li>Threats and retaliation have a strong tendency to backfire on the instigator</li>
<li>Malicious slander campaigns work equally well regardless of whether voting is open or closed</li>
<li>I haven't seen anything related to malicious slander campaigns relating to the Arb elections, leading me to doubt their existence</li>
<li>I've seen quite a number of MSCs on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and they have a strong tendency to backfire.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In other words we shouldn't worry about it overly much. Certainly the allegations of potential threats and slander are no real grounds for either an open or a closed election. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 16:59, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>True, but most people won't read through the entire history (because most of it will consist of "I, user:foo, vote for/against user:bar"). People will make snarky remarks no matter what we do, but this method will keep them to a minimum, and will get them ignored most of the time.

<li>I don't agree that the manner of voting is somehow an unimportant issue. It's of pretty high importance during an election, which this is (rare for Wiki, but it is). It strikes me as extremely unlikely that <i>anything</i> other than bad-blood will ensue from a public voting process. Yes, the community might filter bully candidates by whichever means we choose, but that does not lessen the problem in the first place. There is a damn good reason that most countries did away with public voting for powerful positions a long time ago: it doesn't do anybody any good. If there is to be public voting, I personally will either oppose all candidates since they are running through a process that is <i>inherently</i> unfit for the selection or because there are a number I would oppose, and to avoid chill winds I will have to oppose everyone else too. We have a functioningish secretish voting system. I can think of no good reason not to use it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:39, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As this vote is modelled on the public voting process of RfAdmin, there is little at this point to reasonably prevent a public ArbComm vote. IMO: if Wikipedians have issues with a public process (or with each other) any which way, they need to either reconcile their differences within the norms of behaviour and or refrain from participating (i.e., voting or running for the ArbComm).

<dl>
<dd>Just modelling it on some existing process doesn't make it right. I don't really need lectures on how to behave, either, thanks. I'm saying, with absolute certaintly, that a public vote will yield bad blood <i>because</i> people won't do as you pray. Given that we have an opportunity to avoid that problem, I can't see why we actively go seeking the problem out. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 16:18, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Noted. To each one's own – modelling it on something else or anew doesn't make it right (or wrong) either, nor is the process inconsistent with Jimbo's fiat. Besides: this opportunity to avoid a problem may create other unforeseen problems. And my comments are directed at anyone who can't or won't act (voting or otherwise) within the norms of behaviour ... things we should already be doing. Take it for what it's worth; that's it for me.

<p>If we do have open voting, would it perhaps be an idea to disqualify candidates from voting? If candidates are also eligible to cast publicly recorded votes, a number of problems arise. Apart from the obvious but probably less likely case of some of them being tempted to "exchange votes" with other candidates, or to vote for other candidates against their own inclination in order to get a reciprocal vote, candidates might be particularly unwilling to vote against other candidates, even if they thought they should. I'm not saying that any of these eventualities are likely to happen, just that they're possibilities. Also, if successful candidates feel hurt about other successful candidates not having voted for them - and it's surprisingly easy to feel hurt by what happens when you run for an election - it might militate against the development of a good atmosphere in the new Arbcom.</p>
<p>I would suggest that if the vote is to be open, it would be in the best interests of the candidates themselves and of the future Arbcom that candidates not be eligible to vote at all. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 01:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your reasoning is sound. The problem is that this would disenfranchise a substantial proportion of the people who care most about the election. In my opinion the problem of candidates voting is yet another reason not to have an open vote. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 01:38, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We discussed this earlier, with varying proposals to prohibit a candidate from voting for oneself but not for other candidates and (conversely) to allow candidates to vote freely to prevent disenfranchisement. Candidate self-voting is already discouraged in RfAdmin, upon which the ArbComm vote should be based, and IMO is not an unreasonable expectation here. The rules indicate, though: "any user that has registered an account on the English Wikipedia on or before 30 September 2005 may cast a vote for or against each individual candidate." Given discussion, I'm unsure if there's yet <i>carte blanche</i> agreement on this point, and perhaps it requires clarification. E Pluribus Anthony 06:00, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, obviously I haven't been reluctant to comment, but I'll also add to what I've already said that I think having comments on the vote pages is a perfectly good thing. We need to be able to manage an atmosphere of intelligent discussion about individual candidates that falls in between tip-toeing around or saying nothing, and thus doing nothing to advance the general understanding (or the candidate's understanding of him/herself), and being uncivil. That means being positive or negative as it is deserved, but without ever going into insults or anything rude. There's this fear of disendorsements, which I think is silly; I would be fine with having that back again. And I'm sure there are people who'd use such a page to flay me alive, but that's fine. When I put myself out there as a candidate, I deliberately expose myself to the flaying. I'm not perfect and I like to hear criticism; moreover I think it's necessary for interested individuals to be able to read the comments and get a better understanding of me and my candidacy. I think that gets you a better outcome, more reflective of the reality. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:17, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Radiant but would go one step (or perhaps one and one-half steps) further.

<p>How about this: An RFA style election page is created with links to each candidates vote page. These vote pages have spaces for support, oppose and neutral votes. No comments will be added along with the votes but if voters wish they can link the vote to a comment on the candidates statement talk page/candidate vote page or the voters own talk page.

Uninvolved Bureaucrats and other admins will administer the process and uninvolved Bureaucrats will validate voters. The process starts Jan 6th and runs for 2 weeks. Candidates with a simple majority are presented to Jimbo for his approval. It seems streamlined enough, allows for comments but won't let them get in the way of the voting space.

<li>Reasonable, except that (as explained above) there is no such thing as a "neutral" vote (there is such a thing as an "abstention", of course). And I really don't think people should be "linking" their votes anywhere, considering a vote should simply be a signature. I haven't seen anyone here yet who <i>wants</i> comments, people have just pointed out that some people <i>will</i> comment. Comments should be moved out of the voting section, at the least, and personally I'd prefer them removed entirely. And what do you mean by "validating voters"? If you meant sockchecking, let me point out that 'crats can't sockcheck. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 01:13, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By validating voters, I meant making sure they meet the sufferage requirements.</dd>
<dd>If people <i>will</i> make comments I meant to get them off the voting page, hoping that if there are long threads as a result of comments they won't interfere with the actual voting page, it's not uncommon in RFAs for comments to spawn long threads. I know that support or oppose votes are normally not linked anywhere but it might be better than having comments in-line. There have been several editors who have expressed interest in allowing comments, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#ArbCom_election" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#ArbCom_election" rel="nofollow">at least here</a>, but don't get me wrong, I've stated that I think comments would be a bad idea. I just included that part to satisfy those who would like to see them. I'd have no problem not allowing comments. I added the neutral mostly because of the RFA model, again they can go as well.</dd>
<dd>So, how about ammending this to not allow comments if others agree and no neutral votes? In the interest of settling on a process. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 02:34, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If people want to chat among themselves regarding various candidates in the ArbCom election, that's great. But there's no reason that the official aspect of the ArbCom election needs to concern itself with the chattering. That's why "neutral" as a vote has to go; that's why disendorsements need to go; that's why the RfA style election page is a bad idea (at least, as an official part of the election process). Keep it as simple as possible. If you support someone vote yes. If you oppose someone vote no. If you're not sure, don't vote. Or flip a coin, or whatever your conscience dictates. If people want to discuss the candidacies, as of course they will, fine, but such discussion should be seen as just that -- discussion, not in any way a formal part of the election process. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 03:14, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>So, is it fair to say (for now at least) that there's general agreement: An election page with links to each candidates vote page, supports/opposes only. The vote starts on Jan 6th and runs for 2 weeks. Uninvolved bureaucrats enforce suffrage though all the usual behavior rules apply. Candidates with a simple majority are passed over to Jimbo.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like there's much support for in-line comments, but maybe comments on the statement talk pages would satisfy those who do want them part of the process? Editors can comment on their selections without interfering with the actual vote page. Or maybe someone has another compromise? As people come in and out of the discussion over the holidays we'll get more input, but we should get the general framework nailed down if it's going to start on the 6th. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 07:46, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good to me. If there are no objections (or even little!), IMO you might want to head on over and incorporate whatever's agreeable here into the rules that some of us earlier worked on (and then perhaps copy them to a 'public' wikispace or what-have-you). Arguments notwithstanding, at least such a document could <i>possibly</i> serve as a concise frame of reference (given all the chat above!) for admins and voters alike without being ... excessive.

There's no allowance for commenting in it (on the vote pages themselves), but I know there's some people that would like to see them included. If people feel strongly about it maybe a middle ground would be to allow linking from a vote to a comment on the statement talk pages or elsewhere.

<p>I totally agree with this - we should have more arbitrators to spread out the work the current group is doing. We could use a random number generator to assign arbitrators to each request and a majority of those randomly assigned must accept to have a case. In addition to the advantages jpgordon points out, we the current arbitrators would have more time to write article.

<dd>However, I think we are getting off topic – let's first resolve the electoral process and get the election underway! After that, we can get a lay of the land. Besides: Jimbo has indicated he will pick Arbitrators (either his candidate nominations or self-nominations/community approvals) from the pool of those who've garnered majority support in the election (methinks). Perhaps the quorum requirement can be revisited after the election? My two cents. E Pluribus Anthony 17:02, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I, too, would be very happy with having lots and lots of arbitrators. What I am not excited about is the hypothetical case where lots and lots of candidates pass the 50% bar and Jimbo only picks a handful of those to serve.</p>
<p>As for interpreting Jimbo's words here is my go: The closest <i>reasonable</i> thing to an RFA-style vote is last-year's procedure. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 21:29, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Understood. As the hybrid voting approach selected by Jimbo, we have no choice but to run that potential gamut. As well, I think R and DS have arrived at a solution above (at least to me) that sufficiently and <i>reasonably</i> harks of the RfA process and Jimbo's fiat herein while maintaining openness, but addresses the potential "ugliness" – <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_of_the_Beholder_5ac2.html" title="Eye of the Beholder">or 'beauty', depending on who beholds it</a> – of commentary.

<p>Where are we supposed to comment on the candidates? The current candidate pages are for questions, and I see that in some cases people have phrased their comments as leading questions to put them there. But where are actual comments (as in, "here's why I think you should/shouldn't vote for candidate X") supposed to go? Also on that page? Some other page? The Village Pump? (that last one hopefully isn't the answer)</p>
<p>Also, if we're modeling this process on RfA (despite all common sense that votes should be anonymous), why shouldn't we be allowed to give comments in the votes, like RfA?

<dd>That sort of thing was one of the primary problems last year. Hopefully everyone has enough good sense as to prevent the production of a disendorsements (or endorsements) page.

<dd>Is it an attack to give an opinion that someone shouldn't be an arbitrator? Being an arbitrator seems to me to be a bigger deal than being an admin, and admin candidates have to grin and bear it when their every move is being scrutinized on RfA.

<dd>Maybe. But there's a huge slippery slope there. As a pure hypothetical, with no basis in reality: Sam Spade and I might think the other is a blatant "POV-pushers", and we also might think that being a "POV-pusher" is a disqualifying condition for abitrator candidates. Me, I think being called a "POV-pusher" is a personal attack. Sam, on the other hand, might think calling someone a "POV-pusher" is a simple statement of facts. Who is right? Further, I see very little in contemporary political discourse -- of which Wikipedia, for better or worse, is a microcosm -- that indicates that people are capable of distinguishing between political rhetoric and personal attacks. Just watching RfA on even slightly controversial candidates shows how nasty it can get. Still, I guess Sam Korn's solution -- using the talk page of the candidate statement -- would be the right place for such things, since they are going to happen. But the likelihood of any agreement regarding what constitutes a personal attack in this context is exceedingly low. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 22:26, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another problem with having a vote without a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_ballot.html" title="Secret ballot">secret ballot</a> is that people will largely fail to vote on many of the 44 candidates voting pages. That means that a complete unknown might recieve 100% approval... from only 2 or 3 votes! Its clearly unfair to vote against people we know nothing about, and yet who will go thru and research all 44 of these people? All of this can be solved by a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_ballot.html" title="Secret ballot">secret ballot</a> (similar to last years voting method). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 02:09, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This might be a problem to some, but not necessarily to others. A secret ballot doesn't necessarily guarantee fairness or completeness nor is it a panacea. Voters should do what they need to to make an informed decision, but they don't have to: any Wikipedian (as per suffrage) who registered in September or before can vote, and who's to say for example that a vote of omission is nothing but a conscious choice to <i>not</i> vote for a candidate (e.g., abstention), or that a vote either way is not a reasoned one? Irrelevant, I think. Further to that, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">we should refrain from making unnecessary assumptions</a>: Jimbo has indicated he will be selecting candidates based on overall support and (with that) an expectation to not advance a candidate with (say) just 1 positive vote.

<li>I agree with EPA. It is highly unlikely that any candidate would pass with three votes, and exceedingly unlikely that Jimbo would actually instate such.

<dd>Yes, F; this is getting rather circuitous. As Jimbo has sanctioned an open process modelled closely on RfAdmin, fit or unfit (which is subjective), our course of action is clear. E Pluribus Anthony 01:44, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Conversely, there's no reason to forego Jimbo's fiat and supplant it with something that's arguably more subjective or problematic. Again, we're treading old ground unnecessarily: dissent was expressed in the lead up to Jimbo's selection and he, nevertheless, has promulgated a conciliatory approach. So until he states otherwise, frankly, Wikipedians should respect his decision, set their differences aside, and do what's necessary to make it work. E Pluribus Anthony 02:01, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What is necessary to make it work is to change it. I might even be bold and write the correct proposal up. All the praying language used above about hearts of gold and how everyone is absolutely angelic is, frankly, naive. People remember, people forecast. People <i>will</i> reach different judgements about their personal votes if it is open process than if it is a secret one, and they <i>will</i> fail to oppose people they would otherwise oppose on those grounds. Thus, each candidates vote is not truly representative and has little validity.

<p>Well, please recall that extensive discussions concerning these 'problems' (arguably) has already occurred. As for forced usage of French et al.: Jimbo has already indicated a course of action, based on input to date, so arguably the reiteration of notions counter to his fiat – and in English – have been the true hindrance here. We need to move forward, and IMO this discussion thread is getting circuitous and counter-productive. Others can feel free to continue it, but unless there's something anew, I'm simply indicating that I've nothing more to say regarding this.</p>

<p>An open election here is not appropriate for all the usual reasons that open elections are not appropriate. They force voters to ask themselves questions like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I dare to vote against this influential member of the community? Will she hold a vendetta against me?</li>
<li>I want to run for admin in a couple of months. Which will better help my chances there - voting according to my conscience and opposing a lot of people who I don't think will do a good job or just supporting most everyone with some nice comments?</li>
<li>This influential member of the community sure would be a useful ally to have. I'm not sure how good he'll be for the ArbCom but shouldn't I just vote for him anyway?</li>
<li>This good friend of mine is running for the ArbCom. I really like her but I don't think she has the diplomatic skills for the job. Do I vote against her and risk our friendship?</li>
<li>etc. etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a closed vote people simply ask themselves the question: "Which people would I most like to see in office?" That's not a perfect question but it is generally considered superior to the ones above.</p>
<p>"But Haukur", you may say, "we routinely hold votes for admin candidates like this and it seems to work fine". Okay, maybe it works well enough there. But that's a completely different kind of election. People running for admin are not competing against each other as the number of admins isn't fixed. Voting against one admin candidate doesn't help another admin candidate one whit. This is very different from the ArbCom election.</p>
<p>But if there is absolutely no way we can avoid using this system by now I will still participate in the elections. I will do so politely, in good faith and with the goal of electing the best ArbCom we can get. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 12:59, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And <i>why</i> should we delay? Misgivings? When Jimbo edited the rules, he didn't touch the dates indicated, so (in effect) he's <i>already</i> set the timeframe.

<dd>I stood against this every inch of the way. However in order to oppose an edict from Jimbo you need numbers and people with serious reputations. I had very little of either to work with. The dabate for this year is over. The election will take place as Jimbo ruled. It would have started jan 1st if it wasn't for the uni holidays. To do things at the 11th hour is one thing. To do them when the 12th has passed is another. Our energy is best spent now on damage limitation and makeing sure there is an election (remember jimbo just wanted to apoint people without an election). You think you can change the system?

<dd>I think it would reflect poorly on an arbitrator if they picked on you purely because you voted oppose to them in the elections.

<dd>It certaintly would reflect poorly! But presumably the person voting against a candidate believes s/he is likely to behave poorly?

<dd>In fact a system you mention does exist, it was used for the Wikimedia Foundation board elections a few months ago.

Well, voting against a candidate because they would behave poorly is certainly one reason to vote in opposition, I am optimistic that any candidate who would have a vendetta against anyone who voted against them would not be elected to become an arbitrator, but of course there are other reasons to oppose also, for example, a percieved lack of experience. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 02:37, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was, I presume, far away from all Arbitration issues as I generally try to be. That was clearly a mistake on some counts and an excellent decision on others. I can edit the project page right now, if you like, but I don't suppose Jimbo is likely to respond on a Sunday to a last minute plea for a stay of execution. That doesn't mean that I can't carry on being pretty open about how wrong it is. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:57, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Kim. By having an open vote we're backsliding over a century. It's one of the few features of the nineteenth century electoral system that I won't even try to defend (and that's saying a lot). I think we've got to ban commenting on the voting pages.

I'm dropping my opposition for now. I was among several people standing by last autumn-ish, but we were not to interfere, or something. I'm confused.

<dd>I agree wholeheartedly, at the risk of reopening a wound. Not only was this voting process grueling (ballot fatigue, anyone?) but it completely backs off of the progress made in political science in the past, oh, century or so.</dd>

<dd>By the way, one must love ex-Arbitrator Martin's: "Jimbo wants an open vote. I think I understand why. Let us proceed." As Kim said I guess there's some X factor here.

<dd>You may be correct, but I think a lot of the opposition is because JImbo's logic isn't really known to more than a few people. If Jimbo came out and said "We're having open voting because of X, Y, and Z" that would probably be good enough for me. It's possible I wouldn't agree that X, Y, or Z were great reasons, but it would be better than having the appearance of an arbitrary decision. I trust that Jimbo has put considerable thought into the election, but it would still be nice for him to share his reasoning with the rest of the community. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:34, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They were added at the last minute with little discussion, they’ll be ineffective as it’ll be easy to rack 150 edits in a couple weeks if the first part of the rule has been met and there doesn’t really seem to be a real consensus for that sort of limit this year.

<p>As alluded to above, I've jiggered my bot into checking signatures against contributions histories and automatically checking them for suffrage. (It's read-only, so I paste the results in myself.) It should be pretty reliable, but it'll fail if either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone both includes a link to someone else's user page, and either doesn't sign or doesn't have a direct link to his own user page in his sig (ie, a sig like {{user|Cryptic}} or {{User:Cryptic/sig}} won't be recognized), or</li>
<li>Someone deliberately signs using someone else's name.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm perfectly willing to do the grunt work checking 'normal' cases for suffrage (and will probably do so twice a day or so, more often near the start of the election); if other folks could keep an eye open for the above two cases, I'd appreciate it. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 05:22, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If Wikipedia wants this to be a robust process, then participation needs to be as easy as possible. As best I can tell, around 1/3 of the candidates are easily rejected due to lack of experience, and yet a participant has to actively deal with them! It is even more ridiculous when the candidate does not even have sufferage. This is a serious position requiring significant experience in Wikipedia. 6 months and 1,000 edits is the absolute minimum that I would require. I suggested in the talk page for the voting 1 year and 1,000 edits, but right now I would prefer to call for 1 year and 2,500 edits.

<li>Well, it's a lot better to first look for solutions before even vaguely considering punishment, y'know?

<dl>
<dd>This is perhaps a point for clarity in the future. But what of now? OK, so what are the solutions?
<ul>
<li>I or anyone else can revert the changes and in fact cause additional disruption – I am reluctant to do this <i>only</i> because I'm not an Admin;</li>
<li>Bite our tongues and potentially allow disendorsements through indifferent votes;</li>
<li>As per prior discussions, (re)implement this change</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And it's not like we haven't discussed this already (despite user protestations to the contrary, who wasn't involved in these discussions) ... you noted this yourself, jpg. Moreover the vote-page links only provide for support/oppose votes, not neutral ones, so anything else is arguably superfluous.</dd>
<dd>I contend that such changes and reverts, and a wilingness to fly in the face of what we have discussed and invoking a lack of consensus in doing so (pot, meet kettle), should be dealt with somehow and quickly ... and the offending user too. And to that end, the rules should be edited consistently in both spots to reflect this.</dd>
<dd>I wouldn't hesitate to make these editions and in firming things up as per the consensus derived <i>here</i> and <i>elsewhere</i>, but the voting page is uneditable to non-Admins like me.</dd>
<dd>I regret if I seem like I'm going overboard and will withdraw if needed, but – as with ArbComm votes – this isn't the time to equivocate and this is a problem that I think needs to be resolved. Thanks. E Pluribus Anthony 17:40, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Neutral votes are informative, and hardly seem 'extensive' in and of themselves. A neutral vote informs others in the community that the voter has looked at the page in question and is neutral. That's a different piece of information than no vote at all, which might mean neutrality or might mean that the voter just hasn't seen it. I think they should stay on the page. They are a legitimate, peaceful, and positive part of the dialogue. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 19:07, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jimbo, thanks again for weighing in. I don't think the issue is whether they are important (they clearly are), but whether given our discussions they belonged on the vote page. If a significant number of people assert neutrality, whose to opine what those votes mean, with or without comments? Are they, effectively disendorsements? And can they not serve the same informational purpose by being moved to the talk page?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I for one would take them into account were I voting, and I will of course take them into account if it becomes the case that I have to select between multiple candidates from a pool approved by the community. I don't see how they could count as disendorsements, at least as compared to an 'oppose' vote. And I think if they are moved to the talk page, they won't be where most people will see them, thus eliminating most of the information they could convey.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 22:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand. I think we can have our cake and it eat it too, hence the initial proposal to move all neutral votes. A neutral vote is rare in a usual political vote and, as you see below, a neutral or non-vote can have any number of interpretations: abstention, protest, disendorsement, true neutrality, etc. As a result of these extended discussions, the rules and voting pages devised enabled Y/N votes only, and the intent (as per those rules) was to eliminate any real or perceived ambiguity by moving them and "extensive comments" to the vote-talk page. I know I frequently glance at talk pages before editing articles and would have an expectation of others (maybe unrealistic) to do so when providing feedback in this forum. And this would still allow for you and other Wikipedians to make an informed decision regarding candidates without wondering why. Anyhow ... E Pluribus Anthony 06:07, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After giving the matter much thought, I have come to the conclusion that the ill will that any votes I might make would generate will amount to more than any possible good that might come from "electing" a better candidate. I am going to boycott this election, as it is a failure of community process and upon its completion will one day serve as a textbook example of group decisionmaking gone wrong. It does not build community to encourage people to make a public, subjective evaluation of their peers based on murky criteria; and it compounds matters that the people thus chosen will be expected to be impartial judges of the actions of those who voted for and against them. One could not deliberately construct a more effective system for encouraging patronage abuses and cronyism; and as others have already pointed out to deaf ears, the perils of such voting have been well documented.</p>
<p>The fact that we are, as a group, embarking upon this spectacle testifies chiefly to the fact that our governance systems lack the maturity they need to fulfill the responsibility we now have for the 20th most popular web site in the world.</p>
<p>I encourage others to boycott this election as well, removing any votes they have already cast if necessary, and adding their names here.</p>

<p>We've seen several people who do not have suffrage attempt to vote; most of them are stricken out but still stay on the page. Would moving those votes to the talk page of the candidate be a good idea or not? Thoughts on that?

<dl>
<dd>I think they should stay, for a couple reasons:
<ul>
<li>It makes them less likely to say, "What happened to my vote?" and put it back (as Arkon actually did on Fred Bauder's and Kelly Martin's pages).</li>
<li>The suffrage rules have little direct effect on the overall percentages, as currently tagged; the greater effect is to make it clear that there <i>are</i> suffrage rules (for those who overlooked them on the main page), and that, yes, people <i>are</i> watching (for those who ignored it). Hiding them on the talk page will just cause more of these votes to be cast, making more work for those tagging them.</li>
<li>It's really up to Jimbo, not us, to decide how he wants to count things; the best we can do is tag these votes and let him decide what he wants to do with them. (This is also part of why I'm just tagging, not striking. The other part, which also applies to both striking and moving to talk, is that it'll be perceived as more rude than it needs to be.) —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 02:59, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If "suffrage" is supposed to be 90 days then why is September 30 chosen as the cut-off date? Should it not be October 9th?

<dd>I assume the date was chosen because it's a lot "cleaner" than October 9th. An arbitrary date had to be chosen, and there will be users who fall on both sides of the fence. Unfortunately, some good editors will be caught in this; I symphatize with you. (I, myself, felt this frustration when I couldn't vote in the last Board election a few months ago; I had easily surpassed the number of edits, but was a few days short.) However, no matter what date we choose, there will be legitimate users affected, and creating exceptions would throw the election into controversy. As such, my advice: continue your good work, and then wait until the next elections to vote (I'm sure there will be another election, either Board or ArbCom, before the conclusion of 2006).

<p>Seems the elections are going well, congratulations to all. However, for next time can we be more nuanced with the suffrage rules, publicize them ahead of time, and not change them at the last minute? Nothwithstanding the need to bar sock- and meatpuppets, there are Wikipedians who prefer to read and understand before making a smaller number of well thought-out edits. I'd argue we contribute as much to building an encyclopedia as some of those whose higher edit count is inflated by oodles of reverts or large numbers of tweaks to their own userpage. Since I joined in Sept 2005, I've made about 65 edits to new and existing articles, including RC and "random page" patrol. I spent a fair amount of time looking at candidate statements last week, since the then-current rules for suffrage as summarized on the <a href="../../../s/p/_/WP%7ESP_e9e9.html" title="WP:SP">signpost</a> led me to believe I could vote. But when I went to vote this morning, I discovered the rules have been changed to 150+ contributions only.

<p>Since ArbCom is supposed to be impartial, I propose the following selection technique: 1. disqualify anyone with &gt;25% negative votes (because of concerns about impartiality - anyone may have a few people who don't like them, but if they have a substantial minority of people who don't like them they are clearly not seen as impartial - you might say there is no <i>consensus</i> that they are suitable - therefore the number of supporters of their views does not matter) 2. of the rest, select the top N candidates ordered by Positive Votes minus Negative Votes (negative votes negate exactly one positive vote each). <a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObsidianOrder_2f88.html" title="User:ObsidianOrder">ObsidianOrder</a> 09:29, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>rather than the greatest margin, wouldn't it make more sense to just look at the ratio of positive to negative votes, the same as is done for RFA?

<dd>I think that 25% was too high, as that would probably take away more than what we want (we need 8 people) [although I haven't checked recently]. It may be a good thing to keep in mind, but in the end Jimbo probably decides based on merit. <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep">Ilyanep</a> 23:38, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was looking at the list of candidates and thinking that I haven't had much dealing with any of them except two. The only one I know and have a positive impression of has already pulled out. The only two I feel able to cast a vote on are candidates I don't support because of past bad experience with them: is this the nature of our dealings here (that you only know and remember people you've had conflict with) or is it just bad luck that none of the people I have positive impressions of are in the race? <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEnder3057_42a1.html" title="User:Ender3057">Ender</a> 07:30, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, Ender, I had to flag your votes because you don't meet the suffrage requirements. (Your first edit was November 28.) To reply to your question, the reason why you most likely didn't have interaction with a large number of candidates was probably because of the newness of a significant amount of the candidates, and also your relative newness (and I don't mean that in an insulting manner). Half of the candidates had extremely low amounts of edits (some with less than a 100); it is very doubtful that even our most experienced editors had interacted with them before. However, the other half consists of respected Wikipedians, ranging from people who gained adminship a week before the election started, to people who had gained adminship before our current system (<a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">WP:RfA</a>) was set up in July of 2003. Also among our candidates are bureaucrats, and the person with the most edits. The point is that the longer and more active the candidate (and yourself), the more likely you'll have had interactions with them. (I recognized the majority of the names.) I've had many experiences with a number of the candidates, both positive and negative. I hope that answers your question!
