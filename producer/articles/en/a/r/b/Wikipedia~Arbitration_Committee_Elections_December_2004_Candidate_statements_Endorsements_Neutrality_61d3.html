<dd>Comment: I am assuming you're including me as one of the flakes. Have you ever wondered why so many people have bad things to say about this fellow? He whines and complains as the perpetual victim on his user page about people doing this and saying that against him! People have bad things to say about this guy because of his bad behavior. But you can label us as flakes because we have different beliefs or opinions than you that's fine with me. If people don't think like you they are flakes or nuts or weird or crazy or sick or stupid or dumb right? Intolerance has been going on since the dawn of mankind. Pitchka 03:22, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC) Note: Neutrality reverted my comment immediately after I posted this! Look below people were allowed to make comments in the Oppose category!!! See what I mean Neutrality should never have been allowed to be an admin.

<dl>
<dd><i>ChrisO</i>: "...registered users appear to be mounting a campaign against Neutrality,..."-Campaigning in an election? How unreasonable. <i>Pitchka</i>: "Note: Neutrality reverted my comment immediately after I posted this!"- Pitchka is right. Supporters' comments can be replied to if opposers' comments can. And people have been doing so, for example in "Neutrality"'s opposers' section. People have a right to information about a candidate in an election, (If this is one), so they can then judge whether to vote for the candidate.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 19:42, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> After returing to this site for the first time since February, I came across this so-called "Neutrality" user and this project page through the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recent_changes.html" title="Recent changes">Recent changes</a> feature... Without bothering to state his reasoning, "Neutrality" reverted the addition of the funeral for a major African American cultural icon. (I am wondering if there is a racial motive for this; it seems as if Wikipedia users only post stories that concern its largely middle- to upper-class white American readership, as opposed to representing a variety of stories of interest to a diverse range of classes, national origins, racial backgrounds, etc.) <b>Revert warriors must not be given positions of authority on Wikipedia.</b> <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWenteng_08df.html" title="User:Wenteng">Wenteng</a> 04:20, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>Comment: This is about whether a notice about the rapper <a href="../../../o/l/27/Ol%27_Dirty_Bastard_fd73.html" title="Ol' Dirty Bastard">Ol' Dirty Bastard</a>'s funeral should be made the top item on the "In the News" template, three days after his death was already reported on the template. Numerous editors seem to have thought it was inappropriate but Wenteng keeps reverting it (as of this posting, Neutrality has reverted it a total of <i>one</i> time compared to Wenteng's <i>four</i> times).--<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:28, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Admins need 80% of the vote. Neutrality didn't get this.

Raul forged a number of 83%. In previous votes for adminship (I think he only got in the 2nd or 3rd time he was nominated), Neutrality repeatedly attempted to have opposing votes disbarred. Not really the kind of person suited to being an arbitrator - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 09:17, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just re-read the transcript at the link provided above, and it does not reflect poorly on Neutrality at all. If anyone's actions were questionable, it would have been the folks conducting the vote, because Neutrality was not yet an Admin at the time. In any case, the logistics of that vote is all water under the bridge, as Neutrality has repeatedly proven himself to be a worthy Administrator. But don't take my word for it - I encourage voters to look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Neutrality" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Neutrality" rel="nofollow">edit history of Neutrality</a> and compare it to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Xed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Xed" rel="nofollow">edit history of Xed</a>, and judge for yourself.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He blocked me on 13th Nov 04 for a month with no justification. He broke the Blocking Policy that says admins must put a warning on the user's talk page first and a notice telling them why they've been blocked after. He didn't do either. I just saw this as I edited:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Your user name or IP address has been blocked by Neutrality.</dd>
<dd>The reason given is this:Maliciously acting in bad faith to disrupt Wikipedia"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He's made this nonsense up and he had no grounds to block me. A few days later, when I asked ,another admin un-bocked me. The next day I edited for the first time, a couple of notes about arbcom election propsals, and he blocked me again. Broke the Blocking Policy again as above and this time it was:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"20:25, 26 Nov 2004 Neutrality blocked WikiUser (talk) (contributions) with an expiry time of infinite (Legal threats, see <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-November/032220.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-November/032220.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-November/032220.html</a>.) "</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Needless to say I made no legal threats and I doubt if the Wikipedia mailing list is covered by the site rules anyway. (Anyone can join and use a mailing list if they've hgot an e-mail address.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mirv un-blocked me: "20:50, 26 Nov 2004 Mirv unblocked WikiUser (that is not a legal threat, but a complaint. In any case, legal threats are not a valid reason for blocking).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Either he doesn't know the rules, isn't interested in learning them, or he's deliberately breaking them. Whichever, he shouldn't be an admin/arbcom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think he enjoys blocking people for the sake of it. The Wikipedia:Block log shows that he blocks people longer than others and for less "misconduct". He often blocks for "indefinite" and "infinite". The fact that he blocked me for so long, and for more than he does others, too, shows I think, the misuse/grudge I was on about above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He has some un-acceptable bad habits. Some I've seen are:</dd>
<dd>Deleting whole paragraphs by other people, including in contentious circumstances, and marking them minor edits.</dd>
<dd>Changing the meaning of a sentence and marking it a minor edit.</dd>
<dd>Deleting and moving other people's posts even when they're part of complaint procedures.</dd>
<dd>Taking control of people's talk pages using the same abusive methods.</dd>
<dd>Reverting without explanation ignoring the edits others have done in-between.</dd>
<dd>Reverting a page and marking it minor edit.</dd>
<dd>Calling perfectly reasonable people trolls when he doesn't like their views or them.</dd>
<dd>Lying: he's had on his user page for ages that Rex071404 vandalised that page. If you check</dd>
<dd>the history you'll see that all he did was make a polite request (28th July 04). And check out Neutrality's idea of reasonable discussion in the subsequent postings on his talk page at that time.</dd>
<dd>Often ignores people's enquiries complaints they put on his talk page. Also archives them straight away.</dd>
<dd>If something shows him in a bad light he deletes it while leaving everything else that was there on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>His candidate submission shows that he'll be too bureaucratic-can you understand what he's on about?. He's too keen on calling people vandals, trolls for no reason, deleting pushing around, and driving people away from the Wikipedia. His name will annoy and confuse, especially new readers who may have broken a rule without realising it. (From log-in page:"Avoid usernames that are ... confusing.")</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He's high handed, can't understand how to judge on the facts rather than his personal opinions, rough on people he's supposed to help, but obsequious to anyone "above" him -arbcom board etc. Do you want this as arbcom behaviour?:</dd>
<dd>"Congratulations, moron. You've just been infinitely blocked. Have a nice day. Neutrality (hopefully!) 02:43, Oct 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So? What's wrong with those posts then? Except that they tell people about your actions on the Wiki, posted in the interests of all users. You think they're wrong simply because they don't praise you. - "Neutrality" also called it vandalism and threatened to ban me immediately just for pointing out (to other users) links to his admin election page and the arbitration case he did against Rex071404. Why's he so ashamed of them?</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Strongly Oppose</b> I strongly oppose Neutrality for anymore advancement or "power" he thinks that he runs this place already. I was contributing a lot to two lists of peoples Pro-Choice and Pro-Life and it was getting a lot of contributions from like minded people who are interested in this subject matter. There are a lot of people who don't like the list pages in general and then there are the ones like Neutrality who don't like certain subject matters for political reasons. He didn't like the Pro-Life list and would change the whole article and list to a re-direct page even after many people contributed to it. He wouldn't leave it alone. He didn't touch the Pro-Choice page and list, just the Pro-Life page, we can all see where his bias lies.</p>
<p>I and others got into a revert war on this page and he would not talk it over or anything, it was his way or nothing. Literally nothing! After the page was split because the list became so big Neutrality didn't like it so he and his "buddies" voted to delete both the list of pro-life and pro-choice supporters! But everyone knew he wanted to get rid of the pro-life list at all cost. This was proved when the Pro-Choice list was restarted sometime later and there were just a few votes to erase it and Neutrality had no problem with that list and didn't even bother voting either way and neither did his buddies many of them can bee seen on the above Supporters list!</p>
<p>If you cross this Neutrality he will get even with you. He seems to have problems. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Pitchka</a> 02:18, Dec 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>
