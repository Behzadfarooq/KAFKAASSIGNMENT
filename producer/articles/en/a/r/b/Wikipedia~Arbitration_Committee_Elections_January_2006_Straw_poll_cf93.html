<p>I have removed the poll which was previously here in order to start a new poll, this one based a bit more on reality. (Of course you can see it all in the history and <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Straw_poll_Old_poll_3281.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Straw poll/Old poll">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The previous poll claimed, for example, that "This year, Jimbo has announced that he will appoint candidates directly." This is either false or misleading. I have always appointed people to the ArbCom directly, for one thing. And this formulation suggests (particularly as it was misleadingly contrasted with "a public election") that I intend to do so without any community approval or vote, which is simply false.</p>
<p>So we had a straw poll here with zero relevance to the actual question at hand. For the record, the final votes in the flawed poll were 51-17 and then a host of other sorts of votes for things like "prefer something else", "unsure", "polls are evil" and so on.</p>
<p>Most of the voters seemed to have been misled into thinking that the choice was between direct appointment by me without any community input versus democratic elections. That's really misleading. I apologize if I had anything to do with the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize very strongly that none of these deliberations has anything to do with me trusting or not trusting the community. I trust the community with my life. The issue is that voting mechanisms are inherently flawed in some ways. A lot of people are fond, as I am, of quoting Winston Churchill's famous line about democracy being the worst form of government except for all the others. He said this, of course, in defense of Great Britain -- a democracy, but also a monarchy and aristocracy. Like the British system, the Wikipedia system is a mixed system and should remain so for at least the present time.</p>
<p>I have tried, below, to outline the most prominent options, and to write as fair as I can about the strengths and weaknesses as I see them. I encourage those who are filling out this poll to also add their own brief views on the strengths and weaknesses, so that in another round of polling a week or so from now we can try to work on the details of whatever emerges.</p>

<p>Community vote followed by appointments of the highest vote-getters. Essential strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>somewhat democratic, open to all</li>
<li>candidates with the most community support get elected</li>
</ul>
<p>Essential weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>good candidates who happen to not be famous enough may not be elected</li>
<li>lots of ill-will in the community due to campaigning</li>
<li>possible encouragement of formation of wikipedia political parties</li>
<li>only 1 candidate received more than 50% vote, limiting sense of community mandate</li>
<li>dangerous to our community values, which reject voting except as a last resort</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>This is the way to go. We shouldn't be stepping backwards from this. The community can and should determine these issues without having to coordinate (to put it mildly) with a powerful individual at the top. Nobody has been able to put forward an argument against a plain vote except that they are wary of democracy, wary of letting the people who've written and maintained this thing control it. You let the people who write the encyclopedia decide, and you will get arbitrators who are better for the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:09, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Do we really reject voting except as a last resort? RfA, *fD, ArbCom... Voting is the most effective way to make the right decision and there is no need to tamper with it. It just works. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 08:23, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>To gain respect for its decisions, ArbCom needs to be answerable to, and be seen to be answerable to, the community. Voting on a policy or on which version of the facts should go in an article is not always the best way to go. Electing the ArbCom is an entirely different matter. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 08:40, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I find the statement "our community values reject voting except as a last resort" troubling, especially when it's being evinced as support for what are, after all, only a debate about how this particular vote will be conducted. We're voting; we're only haggling about how. And it's a good thing we're voting, too. The alternative to voting is rule by fiat. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:53, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Looking over the history, the elections produced good candidates like Raul654, whereas Jimbo appoints god-awful arbitrators like Fred Bauder and more recently JayJG. I will support whichever proposal that has the most consensus that removes power from Jimbo's hands. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 20:03, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Seeing as that's an impossible outcome, since he runs the site, I think your supported solution is "make a fork" <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:18, 4 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Did he say that? My interpretation of the comment is that Jimbo should not exercise direct power over the non-technical operation of the site. I agree with that. I really question the logic behind the idea that the decision will be better made by one person whose involvement has little to do with issues of day to day editing than by the collective wisdom of hundreds of people. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:11, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Democracy is always the best option. Systems that give particular people undue influence are not democratic. <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedars_695e.html" title="User:Cedars">Cedars</a> 09:20, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Arbitration is a serious issue, and having something a bit formal is then the best. The ArbCom represents the community, and if the community wants to put someone on the ArbCom, there should be nobody with the ability to "veto" it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:34, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think that having Jimbo appoint candidates will significantly cut down on acrimony in the community, especially because each appointment will be open to inevitable accusations of cronyism. Exposure to negative information is an important part of the democratic decision-making process, though I also hope that unnecessary mud-slinging can be avoided. If campaign spamming (people leaving unsolicited messages on user or article talk pages) has been or becomes a problem, I would support restricting campaign activities to certain pages.
<dl>
<dd>The community (especially administrators) are also charged with enforcing ArbCom decisions. It's better if the community feels that the arbiters are <i>their</i> representatives. I think being a top vote-getter does this; in an approval system, I don't think it's so important to get a 50% majority.</dd>
<dd>A major problem with ArbCom has been inability to decide cases due to vacancies. Community approval is going to be necessary whether or not Jimbo makes appointments. I favor skipping the additional step and speeding up the process. As for voting being "against our community values", it might be true that discussion and consensus is more productive for individual articles, where a few dozen people can have a conversation about a complex issue. This is simply not possible when hundreds or thousands of people are expected to participate. In this case, voting is the next logical alternative, especially since the decision is relatively simple - pick N of M. Unilateralism is certainly not higher up on the list of community values.</dd>
<dd>On this subject, it is important for our selection process to deal with chronic case overload, underattention, understaffing, and premature burnout. I think the thing the next election could do to best improve community relations would be to <b>enlarge ArbCom.</b> A significant number of reserve arbitrators would help prevent vacancies from causing delays, but this is only part of the problem. These are volunteer positions; and the workload needs to reflect that, in order to keep cases moving, and to prevent premature burnout. Eliminating the requirement that every arbitrator review every case would help a lot. I'm comfortable with allowing the arbiters to come up with a system on their own, with community input. It would be nice if the entire committee could hear appeals (subject to some high bar, to prevent them from being overused), but if not, I think that would be OK. (You could think of them not as judges, but as a jury pool.) It's more important to deal with abusive editors quickly than it is to worry about ensuring absolute consistency. (And giving the same group of people final authority won't guarantee that, anyway.) -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 00:53, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>This is the most open option and as such is my preference. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeithp_3c9a.html" title="User:Leithp">Leithp</a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeithp_0f76.html" title="User talk:Leithp">(talk)</a> 09:23, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If, somehow, Jimbo's hypothetical worst enemy, or a known vandal, managed to obtain sufficient support, the community could confront that problem post-election (and that result would give us lots of valuable information, too, unsettling as it would be.) That is very unlikely to happen, however, and is the only real weakness of the democratic option. Campaigning and acrimony can be reduced by keeping the election season short -- hard to do this year, with all the uncertainty, but easy in the future if the community firmly adopts this method now. The community shouldn't let vague fears about what might happen prevent us from pursuing the most open option. Any choice which relies on Jimbo's appointment power as an initial part of the process (rather than as a failsafe in the event of resignation or calamity) is likely to create its own forms of acrimony, worries of favoritism, and (gulp!) even some hostility toward Jimbo. Keep things as open as possible for as long as possible, unless and until that becomes wholly untenable. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:20, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is my preference. The "essential weaknesses" either aren't essential weaknesses or can easily be dealt with. I don't see "good candidates who happen to not be famous enough may not be elected" as a weakness as I don't mind who doesn't get elected, just that those who are elected are good. Campaigning and political parties on WP can just be banned. If no candidate enjoys more than 50% support, that will be true whatever the method (although the confusing voting system employed no doubt lowered the %ages). As far as, do we need a vote? - well I don't know, but how else do we decide? <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 11:34, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Voting is not the last resort; it's the stage that the community happily relies on before giving in and defering to the policy judgement of the <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Editor-in-Chief</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">User:Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 13:35, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>By no means perfect, but best option currently on the table. The list of "weaknesses" seems to me, too, to be highly skewed. JW's comments seem to foresee using his selections or nominations in essentially a veto role, whereas the actual mechanisms are at least compatible with effective "hand-picking" (though with the community having a veto). That being the case, surely better to make that more transparent, and for him to explicitly "line item" leading vote-getters that he has (hopefully specific) concerns over. Not a fan of last year's actual voting system, due to its strong <a href="../../../a/p/p/Approval_voting.html#Potential_for_tactical_voting" title="Approval voting">tactical voting</a> considerations -- which is also very possibly the cause of the low approval numbers of the winning candidates (unless that's simply inherent to split opinion in the community).

<li>With some hesitation I vote for this option as beeing the most representative. Actually, I could probably live reasonably well with Jimbo's second proposal, or Talrias' proposal. The important thing is that one person, however great, should not appoint <i>any</i> ArbCom member without the community having a chance to say what it thinks about the candidate. When some candidates have tens of thousands of edits then Jimbo (or any other single person) cannot possibly check <i>all</i> edits. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 08:00, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Jimbo selects in consultation with the community a list of candidates, and the community votes yes or no on the candidates. Essential strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>since Jimbo will attempt to appoint the least controversial candidates, possibly reduced ill-will and campaigning</li>
<li>all successful candidates will emerge with a 50% vote by definition, increasing the sense of community mandate</li>
</ul>
<p>Essential weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>scalability issues -- can Jimbo effectively appoint outside people he knows personally?</li>
<li>trust issue -- can Jimbo be trusted to balance community wishes against the fundamental purpose of Wikipedia (to create an encyclopedia, not to have an experiment in democracy)</li>
<li>not as open, especially to the sorts of people generally regarded as trolls</li>
</ul>

Simply put, I am unconvinced that our community scaled with the project, and that we remain capable of big community decisions. Articles remain good because they are the province of smaller teams of editors, but at this point policy decisions are a grotesque mess of too many cooks, and this seems indicative of a much larger problem to me.</li>
<li>Three reasons: it maintains judicial independence, avoids popularity contests, and better encourages the selection of people with the appropriate qualities. Wikipedia is not a democracy (thankfully!) and what I want is a system that best promotes making an effective encyclopedia. I think this does that.

<dd>Judicial independence? These arbcom members would be beholden to Jimbo.

<p>Hybrid approach: Jimbo can put forward candidates for community approval, 50% majority is enough. And also the community can put forward candidates for Jimbo's approval, with the same 50% majority being enough. Any dually approved candidates above the number of seats on the ArbCom go into a pool of reserves. Jimbo states a general intention to always appoint candidates approved by the community as a matter of convention, while reserving the right to refuse to seat any particularly problematic candidates.</p>

<ul>
<li>democratic, open to all</li>
</ul>
<p>Essential weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>elements of the weaknesses of the previous methods, but the whole point of this suggestion is to try to find a middle path that does everything we want it to do</li>

<li>I prefer this in terms of scaling, because Jimbo cannot be expected to know every good candidate well enough to approve them as arbitrators in advance. However, I think it might also be useful to allow Jimbo to reject community candidates he knows are unsuitable prior to the election, so that we're just helping him with the ones he doesn't already know. Also, developing a reserve pool is an important step toward the reforms that are necessary to make arbitration work better. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 07:13, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A Wikipedian wishing to become an arbitrator must first find 10 other Wikipedians who would support having him/her as an arbitrator. After the person has 10 supporters, a public page is created where discussion between the potential arbitrator and his supporters would be added, so people can see the positions of the potential arbitrator. The community has one week to ask the potential arbitrator, done by asking questions on the page. After one week, they are put forwards for "ratification" by the community, requiring a 50% approval vote.</p>
<p>I would suggest having a quorum on the 50% approval vote (e.g. a minimum of X votes); all voting Wikipedians must have a certain amount of edits/time here by the date the vote started. I also suggest the voting is done anonymously.</p>

<dd>Could make some rule that Arbitrators have to recuse themselves in any case involving their nominators. Or could make nomination anonymous. If nomination is made anonymous, might be a good idea to limit everybody to one nomination each.

<dd>When I was writing this out, I was thinking of emailing them through their talk page, leaving them a message asking for support, or asking them on IRC. Any large-scale campaigning (to get just 10 supporters!) is going to be very obvious and I would imagine that these people would fail on 'ratification'.

<dd>Might want to give Jimbo a chance to veto any candidate that makes it through the nomination process. Hopefully it wouldn't be used much, but I feel uncomfortable removing him completely from the process. Might also allow the existing ArbCom the same privilege at some suitably high super-majority. That last is just a suggestion - I don't support it myself. Is there currently an established number of seats on the ArbCom?

<li>The importance of the arbcom is overrated, and who sits in it even more so. I don't think the overall <i>article content</i> of wikipedia would have been notably different if last year's elections had given us a different arbcom. And I don't see this year's election (or whatever) as very crucial for how the wikipedia <i>articles</i> will look in a year from now either. We do need an arbcom, or at least something to make final decisions in the (relatively) few cases of trouble-users and heavy disputes. But compared to all the other users and edits who never make an arbcom-case, the edits influenced by arbcom rulings are so minute that I don't see it worthy of this much fuss. We are here to write an encyclopedia, not to build a court house. Whoever gets appointed/elected I'm sure will do a decent enough job. Though I am voried about good users being distracted, upset and even scared away because of arbcom cases, even those are really just a few drops in the edit and user ocean. As ignorant and anti-social that may sound. So, I don't much care.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Straw_poll_cf93.html" title="Edit section: Problem with Jimbo's proposals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Problem with Jimbo's proposals</span></h3>
<p>The system used last year was approval voting. Since most people select and vote for the candidates they consider the best, and given a large pool of candidates, it becomes increasingly unlikely that any candidate will reach 50% support.</p>
<p>However, Jimbo's two proposals use a different way of voting: voting for a candidate's suitability, rather than picking the best candidates out of a group. In such a system, it would be rather easier to get to 50% support, just like it's rather easy to get to 50% on a Request for Adminship.</p>
<p>This leads to two possible problems. The first is that it doesn't specify a tiebreaker. Looking at the candidates for this year it is plausible that more than twelve of them will be supported by at least half the community. Since there seems to be reluctance to increase the size of the committee, a selection will have to be made, either by taking the candidates with most support, or by taking the candidates picked by Jimbo.</p>
<p>The second potential problem is that a controversial candidate could easily have 50% support (by definition, any controversial candidate would have around 50% support; if it was substantially less, they wouldn't be controversial, but plainly unacceptable). Such candidates could be instated by Jimbo fiat. Arguably Jimbo knows better than that, but it goes to show that someone trusted by half the community may not actually be the most desirable choice as an arbiter.</p>
<p><i>So my point is this.</i> There are 31 candidates. Jimbo's proposal filters out those that are clearly distrusted or unsuitable (and so would any other decent proposal). But it should be apparent that most of the 31 candidates are clearly trusted and suitable. Jimbo's proposals do not specify a way of making a selection. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:11, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
