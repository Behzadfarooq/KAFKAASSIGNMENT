	    <p>My statement is reproduced here:</p>
<p>Yes, I realise that everyone else who is standing for election is filling their statement with abstract philosophical views, but I don't think that's the most effective and pragmatic approach. I intend to bring a (sorely needed) sense of humour and perspective to the proceedings of the committee. Perhaps then disputes could be handled more fairly and efficiently. Excessive seriousness and organisation can be counter-productive to any work. With work so important and serious as that of this committee, airs of seriousness or importance could be lethal!</p>
<p><b>Postscript:</b> I noticed that all the other candidates like to note how long they've been editing. For the record I've been on Wikipedia since rather late 2003.</p>
<p><b>Second Postscript:</b> In light of this advertising nonsense being pulled over the community's eyes in a sudden and unexpected flash, I'd like it be known that I am against it. This sort of thing goes completely against all the principles of Wikipedia. So many of us have worked so hard; I'm sure each and every one of you can think to how much you've put into Wikipedia. We can't let that be threatened at all. You can all be deadly certain of where exactly I stand on this issue, as a committee candidate. And, I suggest that unless you are glad to see the coming of this change, you don't stand around, but take real action.</p>
<p><b>Third Poscript</b>, or, Talking Points:</p>

<li><b>Humour</b></li>
<li><b>Pragmatism &amp; Effeciency</b></li>
<li><b>Down with advertising!</b></li>

<li><b>What is your stance on the affirmative action taxation of gay marriage in the crack-addicted aborted baby military occupying Eurasian prostitution embezzlement organized crime church tort schools, and how will this affect your ability to arbitrate as effectively and ineffectively as you can and cannot?</b> -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 06:36, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, naturally, I think we should see who can contribute more money to my campaign, gay crack-addicted aborted babies, or the Eurasian prostitution organised crime/schooling religious establishment. I think this will, unfortauntely, affect my ability to arbitrate extremely strongly. Namely it will increase it much, just as danger increases alertness. With the Eurasian tort threat always in my mind I will have my senses heightened to a level that I will become one with the cases I arbitrate and whir out verdicts like a mechanised verdict-rendering machine. Thus, I would be wary. Unscrupulous opponents of my campaign may try to destroy this Eurasian tort threat in order to sabotage my performance. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> <a href="../../../d/g/_/User_talk%7EDG_200a.html" title="User talk:DG">G.</a> 22:28, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I honestly don't think that if done right arbitration should really be an extremely time-consuming, extremely straining activity. It seems to me that if that's the case, something is being done wrong, something isn't being done effeciently, and something needs to be changed. I'm completely eager to change that, if it needs to be. And if not, then forget it. I think the answer to your question is "as long as it takes," whether it be four hours or ten hours or whatever it should eventually be, till the job gets done. If you rephrase the question in that way-- how much of the job am I willing to get done well? The answer is all of it, and then after that, that's it. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> <a href="../../../d/g/_/User_talk%7EDG_200a.html" title="User talk:DG">G.</a> 02:51, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If time proves you wrong on this, will you really be willing to spend a large time on this?

<dd>I'm actually very glad you asked me this. More than anything else, having gone through the new jersey public schooling system has necessarily made me a brilliant expert at both processing and generating bullshit of any and every classification. In fact, if I could name only one thing I'm terrific at, it's processing and generating bullshit. In a more wikipedian context, I am sure that if you just take a cursory look at my edits you will find yourself rolling in bullshit.

<dd><i>The following questions are for each candidate, and do not specifically target you</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Do you hold any strong political or religious opinions (e.g. concerning George Bush, Islam, or on which end you should break a boiled egg)? If so, would you recuse yourself from cases centred on these?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The only strong political opinion I hold is that the debate over abortion is overdramatised and wastes excessive political resources in the United States, resources that are not proportional to its relative importance. I don't expect it to come up, but if it does, and someone suggests or I find that it could be the case that it'd be less than expedient for me to arbitrate on the matter, I'd be happy to step aside for a bit. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> [[User_talk:DG|G.]] 09:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, but I certainly view the vast majority of them to be, unless there are new facts of which we were not previously aware of. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> [[User_talk:DG|G.]] 09:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them. Do you support this decision? [if current arbitrator] Does your visible behaviour on recent cases reflect this decision?</i></p>

How do you view editors who are normally correct in article namespace, but who may be perceived as rude – including to longtime, popular editors and admins – on Talk pages and the like?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Civility is one of the core pillars of Wikipedia. The most important thing to remember is that through it all, no matter how much we may disagree, we are all focussing on the same goal, that of creating a free encyclopaedia. As long as there is that bit of united strength, I think we can smooth over most any conflict. When that civility and reasonableness is no longer there, all bets are off. That said, that is why some of the POV trolls are so dangerous. They do not really believe in the project; they merely want to extoll their own ideology. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> [[User_talk:DG|G.]] 09:47, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Do you have an academic background of any kind, and if so, in what field?

<li>What are your views on the proposed policy <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Code_of_Conduct_4d1b.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Code of Conduct">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Code of Conduct</a>? Whether you think it should be a formal policy or not, do you believe you would generally act in accordance with it?

</ol>
<dl>
<dd>It makes sense to me, and I believe I'd generally act in accordance with it. I don't think it ought to be passed though. There's enough of a backlog already without binding arbitrators' hands and creating a process to investigate the investigators. Unless you hope the code will be self-policing, in which case whether or not it is real policy is entirely moot. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> [[User_talk:DG|G.]] 09:47, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Do you believe that regardless of Jimbo Wales' own views on the matter, the community should be able to strip arbitrators of their position under certain circumstances, and if so, what circumstances?</i></p>
<p><i>As a corollory:Do you believe, regardless of Jimbo Wales' view on the matter, that a large number of signatories (e.g. 150 requesting censure against 50 supporting the arbitrator) to an RFC against an arbitrator is enough that the arbitrator should be judged as having been rejected by the community in light of their actions, and consequently for them to be forcibly stripped of their post?</i></p>

<dd>What these questions seem to be asking me to do is take sides as to the sovereignty of Jimbo Wales. I'll eat that bait, thank you, and side well on whichever side it is that says that Jimmy is great. From the start, Jimmy Wales has acted as a terrific patron of the Wikipedia community, and has shown restraint and judgement. You want to tie his hands up and take away even the small token right to exercise his overarching good judgement in the case that it might be necessary for the good of the free encyclopaedia, a right he has rarely exercised and hardly abused.

In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
