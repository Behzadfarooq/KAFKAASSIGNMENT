<p>I'm quite interested in helping with Arbcom, but I have hesitated to put my name forward as I am reluctant to hand myself over to a selection process that doesn't yet seem to exist.</p>
<p>I've been a Wikipedians since December 2001 and have been an admin since December 2003 (which by extrapolation means that something good has to happen in December 2005). I currently have the distinction of being number one on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_8bec.html" title="Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits">List of Wikipedians by number of edits</a>. Sheer number of edits is a pretty meaningless statistic, but it does show that I have a fair amount of time to dedicate to the project.</p>
<p>I follow Arbcom fairly closely, but have only participated directly in only a couple of cases. I feel that in almost all cases the committee does its job admirably, though its speed is, as has often been noted, is sometimes far slower than ideal.</p>

<p>Many policies contradict and overlap with each other, and then <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> makes things even more complicated while making them paradoxically more flexible.

<dl>
<dd>Flexibility is important to Wikipedia. We have one supreme goal: to create a neutral, accurate, and high quality encyclopedia. Our policies are created to advance this end, but there are occasional circumstances when they might conflict with these goals. In this case rules can safely be ignored. Of course all policies were created with much thought and good intentions so, ignoring them should be rare and only done with much consideration. The same goes for when policies conflict, keep the ultimate goals in mind and follow the path that best helps us create an encyclopedia. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 02:46, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of those positions appear to contradict each other, a Bible Basher <b>is</b> someone who preaches Christianity (maybe that isn't clear to Americans - its a phrase originating as a joke (but not currently used as such) - compare the phrase <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">bashing the bishop</a></i>), nazis ("nationalist-socialists") claimed to be socialists, communism is viewed as a form of socialism even though stalin is viewed as fascist, socialism and fascism are not mutually exclusive.

<dd>I didn't realize that basher in Britain is a synonym for thumper.

<p><i>How willing are you to contest the decisions of other arbitrators rather than just "go with the flow"?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I feel the Arbcom generally does a good job, and I agree with most of their decisions. I thus don't think I would diverge from the group too often. Working toghether amicably is important, but as you pointed out in your first question I have never been afraid to challenge the prevailing wisdom. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 18:03, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, no class of complaints are "automatically without merit." Those who have been penalized are, hopefully, those who do have some problems working in a wiki environment, so it would not surprise me if a greater than average percentage of their cases were rejected. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 18:03, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them.

<dl>
<dd>Disruptive behaviour rarely occurs in isolation. We should never blame the victim, but sometimes even good users make incorrect decisions and end up escalating a situation. Also many of our worst problems occur when two users unable to properly work in a Wiki environment run into each other. The Arbcom should look into all the events surrounding a case, both to provide helpful advice for the future, and in rare cases handing out sanctions when another person involved clearly overstepped the bounds. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 18:03, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>One thing all arbitrators seem to agree on is that it takes a great deal of time, and as such I'm certain that if I were elected to ArbcomI would have less time to devote to editing. However, a considerable amount of my editing time is devoted to minor tweaking, such as categorization and moving templates. I would cut back these activities long before I reduced the amount of content I added or the amount I participated in policy debates. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:48, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many people have noted that Wikipedia's original communitarian structure is no longer functioning very well. One editor has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jpgordon" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that ArbCom is "about getting the trains to run on time," which is a reference to a fulfulled promise of Mussolini's fascist government. Do you agree that Wikipedia needs to become more orderly, and if so, do you think there are any options other than a move toward a more centrally controlled authoritarian system? Do you think that the spirit of cooperation in Wikipedia would survive such a change? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 16:03, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been here quite some time and in my view Wikipedia has long been growing less authoritarian as more and more power has moved from Jimbo to the community. It was not so long ago that only three people had the power to delete articles, that the mailing list decided admin appointments, and that permanent bans were meted out by Jimbo alone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To return to the railway metaphor, I strongly feel that it is not the Arbcom's job to control the community, such as by scheduling trains and setting schedules; rather I feel that the duty of the committee is to limit and reduce the number of derailments and crashes. The goal of the Arbcom is to halt any activities that cause unmitigated harm to the community, not to impose order and regulations. Wikipedia is a community of volunteers, and telling people what to do is never going to work. The Arbcom's task is to enforce certain red lines that cannot be crossed, such as no personal attacks and the ban on persistent revert warring. The vast majority of Wikipedians never even come close to these lines, and should be safely able to ignore the Arbcom as it will have no effect on them. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:48, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: I don't really think these questions are relevant. If you wish to know my abilities please look at some of my contributions. Most of my Featured Articles are listed on my user page, and they will also give you some idea of what I have studied. If you want to know if my life gives me enough free time to spend on Arbcom, then considerably quantity of my contributions should give you some idea.</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: I put a pretty vast amount of time into Wikipedia, I make an average of more than a hundred edits per day. Even if Arbcom took up four or five hours per day, I would still have plenty left over for editing.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: I've been here quite some time and have written quite a few articles. I have made some 80,000 edits, started 2000-3000 pages, and also have a number of featured articles. At one point or another I've been involved in almost every part of this project. I believe that I understand Wikipedia as well as anyone could. I know how it works, how editors behave, and I even know my way through our labyrinth of policy pages.</p>
<p><i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>
<p>A: None other than SimonP.</p>

<p>You have some fourteen times more edits than me. That's quite a large total. Several people have praised you for it. A cursory glance at your edit history shows that several edits are extremely minor fixes such as typos, etc. These sorts of edits are often used by less scrupulous individuals to artificially inflate their edit count. My question here is this: What percentage of your edits constitutes a substantial change to an article?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The vast majority of my edits are minor fixes, as are the vast majority of any of the users who manage to make several thousand edits per month on a consistent basis. Less then 10% of my edits are substantial changes. However, some 90% of my times is spent on creating content. Writing a featured article can be done in only a few edits, if one knows how to use the preview button, but takes many hours of work. Even smaller contributions such as my recent expansion of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marion_Dewar_4602.html" title="Marion Dewar">Marion Dewar</a>, involved several hours of work. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 23:28, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A large number of your edits that I am aware of consist of moving certain editorial templates to talk pages. There is currently an ongoing poll into whether this is appropriate behaviour, yet you still continue to move templates that other people have placed into articles. Why? Do you believe your opinion on the matter counts more than other editors?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This poll has essentially ended, and it quite convincingly upheld the long standing policy that templates directed solely at editors belong on the talk page. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 23:28, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Above, you refuse to be drawn on whether you support the principle of consensus and the will of the Wikipedia community. This in itself is odd, but regardless of the principle of consensus, and the community, do you at least support upholding Wikipedia policies and guidelines (such as, for example, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources</a>)?</p>

How do you view editors who are normally correct in article namespace, but who may be perceived as rude – including to longtime, popular editors and admins – on Talk pages and the like?
<dl>
<dd>Civility is of great importance. Wikipedia is about building a high quality encyclopedia, and this project requires a functional community. People who stray out of the bounds of acceptable behaviour, even admins, need to be questioned. That said much that is perceived as incivility is accidental curtness or an occasional break down in restraint. Any sort of Arbcom action should only come after a long running pattern of incivility, and a clear failure of earlier attempts at reform. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 14:22, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Considering those professors who have recently had you as a student, what would <i>they</i> tell me if I asked them the same question about you?

<dd>It seems reasonable, but there are a couple bits that I find somewhat problematic. I think that rigid uniformity is a bad idea. The worst trolls have the ability to drag other users into the muck with them, and a certain leniency should be shown to users who were in good standing prior to a conflict. I also question the no ex post facto rules section. Community consensus and many standard procedures are no where written down, and Wikipedia runs far more on these unwritten conventions than on the actual policy pages. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 14:22, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
