<p>While I understand people not wanting to be harsh, brief reasons with votes, especially oppose votes, would generally be helpful for other voters. Otherwise, the question one asks oneself when seeing an oppose is: "Was there something I missed, or is he voting oppose based on something that did not bother me?" With supports, one can at least assume that the voter has no major problems with the candidate. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:09, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apologies for the lack of update. I was asleep and it stalled. Working again now after 9 hours. I'm not sure why it doesn't work in IE... it does have the new sortable table feature, which is perhaps breaking in IE, I'll look into in.

<p>Actually, this seems to be a problem of the user's monobook.js (or .css, I don't know), having some kind of conflict with the sortable table thing. I have the same problem as Doug Bell (using Opera), and it vanishes when I look at the page while logged out. I don't have a clue what part of my monobook.js is causing this tho, as I'm too stupid to know much JavaScript. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 05:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A little question - why do you have to have 150 edits to vote? Surely a user's dedication and trustworthiness is based on quality, not quantity? It's ard to measure how 'good' a user is - even time isn't really important. Scenario: candidate registers new account before 1 October 2006, makes 150 minor edits, and votes. Is there a better way? Just wondering. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Santa_2973.html" title="User:Dr Santa">Dr Santa</a> 17:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's impractical, if not impossible, to judge each voter's dedication and trustworthiness. 150 edits is an arbitrary threshold, but it's also a low one. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperMachine_4dd5.html" title="User:SuperMachine">SuperMachine</a> 17:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It also helps to prevent sockpuppet voting. It's very easy for a user to register a bunch of new accounts and have them all vote the same way but it's much harder to have each one of them accumulate 150 edits before the vote starts. As for choosing a numerical measure, it's easier to just count a voter's edits than it is to look at each one and evaluate it for quality, plus this is subjective and people might disagree on whether the edits have sufficient quality to be able to vote. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 17:22, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look at the page 'Category:Rouge admins'. On that list are the ArbCom candidates Alex Bakharev, FloNight, Geogre, JzG, and Samuel Blanning. There are also the candidates Freakofnurture, Starblind, and Blnguyen, who associate with them. Also, look at the votes of the rouge admins JzG (signs as 'Guy'), Geogre, Crazyrussian (signs as 'crz'), AlexBakharev, Nightstallion, Glen_S, Jaranda, Duja, and KillerChihuahua, and known rouge admin associates Zscout370, Newyorkbrad, Khoikhoi, JoshuaZ, Starblind, Giano, Ghirlandajo, Irpen, and Bishonen. There are many of them, and they support their own, so much so that their votes constitute a significant portion of the support votes for their candidates. They even constitute about one-quarter of JzG's support votes.</p>
<p>I also noticed that the listed rouge admin Ral315, and his associates Coredesat and Chacor, mostly voted AGAINST the rouge admins. I wonder what the cause of that schism is.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that in the coming year, due to the overall growth of wikipedia, we are likely to see a big expansion of the arbcom. This is not certain, but entirely possible. Therefore, people should (a) not vote strategically based on good people being very close to the top N and (b) not withdraw from the race with good scores just because you might not be in the top N. Anyone who has recently withdrawn on that basis might reconsider.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 19:44, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Only one candidate with more than 70% support has withdrawn: I hope the expanded ArbCom won't comprise members with less than 2/3 community support. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 19:56, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Jimbo's input here is helpful. I certainly would suggest that no candidates enjoying majority support should withdraw. Voters might also bear in mind that there will be at least one ArbCom position to be filled beyond the five currently up for election, and I presume that, though I can't say for sure whether, that selection would be made from this crop of candidates. (I gather that a current ArbCom member, not in this year's tranche, is resigning from ArbCom to take a Board seat; there is also another member who is on a seemingly long-term break from en:wiki and has not responded to my query whether he will be returning, though I certainly hope he will.)</dd>
<dd>If there is to be a "big" expansion of the committee, I kind of wish that had been announced earlier; many people who decided not to run because they thought there were five candidates more qualified than they, might not have made the same decision if they'd know that (say) 10 or 12 candidates would be appointed.

<dd>Why would we expand ArbCom at a 50% threshhold, if we have a much higher threshhold for admins? Fifty percent seems awfully low - that means as many people oppose as support. &lt;confused&gt; Certainly would expect 2/3 consensus. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 02:43, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Arbitration Committee is selected by Jimbo, who himself gives due consideration of the candidates, after an advisory election, whereas an RfA that exceeds 80% rather automatically results in the candidate being made an administrator. Also, new admin candidates may be rather unknown and RfAs are no where near as well advertised and well known as the Arbcom elections; thus they require a surfeit of support to evaluate trustworthiness. With Arbcom, however, all remotely successful candidates are well-known established users, typically for years. There is probably not a candidate in the whole election who would intentionally try to mess up Wikipedia, and everyone who has a chance at Arbcom has a certain level of competence, though certain ones are more or less competent for this very high task. On RfA, however, there are regularly candidates who would be seriously dangerous to have as administrators, as well as candidates above 50% who have little clue about Wikipedia or administrative tasks. Arbcom elections are also more heated than the less important, less publicized RfAs with candidates who have not taken strong positions on anything; most RfAs pass with 95+% support —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 03:58, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The second discussion is about how many will be chosen. The current <i>tranche</i> needs four new ones, plus another slot was vacant. So everyone, or almost everyone, thought five would be chosen, and even with Jimbo's discretion, there were 4 - 8 who had way more support than the others. And three with positive support, but lagging the leaders, dropped out (plus a few others without 50% support).</dd>
<dd>But two things happened next. One ArbCom member resigned (or is in the process of). Looks like we will need 6. And Jimbo hints just above (and not for the first time), that he may be taking even more members. I'll guess: 9 new ArbCom members. Had the others known that there might be 9 instead of 5 slots, they might have stayed in. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 20:18, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing I'm confused about is that Jimbo says that anyone who withdrew might want to reconsider. (To be precise, he said "Anyone who has recently withdrawn on that basis might reconsider."). Does that mean that anyone who withdrew can re-enter? Would their vote counter have to be reset to zero or do you just reopen the voting page? Might this advantage the candidate in some way? I will note that the one withdrawn candidate "with more than 70% support" that Sandy mentions, mentioned other issues at <a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html#Withdrawing_from_ArbCom_elections" title="User talk:Voice of All">User_talk:Voice_of_All#Withdrawing from ArbCom elections</a>, and predicted that the support would go down to "60% or less probably". If a clear guideline isn't set here, we will probably have more of this "withdrawing" and "re-entering" in other elections. It needs to be made clear that this is an exception (if indeed it can be), and maybe discourage withdrawing as well (better to let the election run its course). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:03, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't agree with Geni above that it's a bit too late to talk about expansion. I also don't see a problem if some of the people who withdrew would put their name back in.

<dd>Though I doubt it'd make any difference, since Jimbo requests it, I believe I should "un-withdraw" for the election. I'm not sure how that would work, so I'd like comments from the "election officials" (by which I mean the neutral people looking over the process) on how to handle it; for instance, it may be a good idea to keep my page open a few extra days to compensate. I've asked Jimbo to comment as well. Also, I believe that since this is unprecedented so far, we could use a clear rule on this point for next year to prevent confusion. For what it's worth, if statistics are any guide, a candidate with more than 50% support would "miss" more support-votes than oppose-votes by being "inactive" for some time, thus it could only advantage a candidate that is already below the threshold and so doesn't have a chance anyway.

<p>I think this has messed up the election. Insofar as it does not matter, the election does not matter because Jimmy Wales will select appropriate people. Insofar as the election is supposed to be advisory, the advice produced by the vote is not an accurate reflection of the preferences of Wikipedia editors. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 00:47, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why would it not be an accurate reflection of the preferences of Wikipedia editors? The nice thing about open elections is that we can consider the entire context, including that people (mistakenly) tend to vote strategically even in cases where strategic voting makes no sense.&#160;:) In the case of those who withdrew and re-entered then clearly we can reflect on that and what it might have meant, etc. And finally, in terms of the numbers, I think it makes sense for me to take guidance from the breakdown of the votes, i.e. if the community has a list of 8 candidates with very strong approval, and then a big break in the percentages and then some approved candidates but not that high, then surely it would make sense for me to consider those 8 to be a natural breakpoint for expansion, etc. I think the best thing for people to do is simply consider: would I want this person to be on the arbcom, or not? Do I know this person well enough to have an opinion, or not? I don't intend to do anything shocking or controversial... the very ability of the arbcom to work with peace and love and firmness to guard our values of openness and quality editing depends on strong community support. We have some arbcom members with 90+% approval... that's wonderful because we know for sure these people can speak with a certain moral authority.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 01:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the point of the elections is more about a candidate's proportion of support to opposition, rather than who's got the biggest number of votes out of the total cast for all candidates, then surely withdrawing and re-entering wouldn't make that much of a difference - you'd expect the proportion of support to stay roughly the same. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:27, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If there is going to be a "big expansion" of ArbCom, does that mean that its processes are likely to change? At present, ArbCom votes are based on a majority of active, unrecused members (5/9, say). A larger ArbCom is likely to make this process slower (getting, say, 9/17 members to agree) unless we break the (larger) committee into smaller units - splitting the process into parallel workstreams (so, for example, we have "ArbCom A" and "ArbCom B", each of which decides half the cases) or by task (so, for example, a subcommittee decides on opening case, and another actually decides the cases). Or perhaps empanelling "benches" of, say, 5 or 7 Arcbom members to hear cases, chopping and changing the membership of the bench for each case on an ad hoc basis. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 13:43, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Approval voting isn't an accurate reflection of preference, quite simply in the first instance because it doesn't even <i>elicit</i> preferences, simply degree-of-preference-over-some-threshold. If one's preferences aren't simply binary (as most people's tend not to be), approval voting <i>forces</i> people to make a "strategic" choice about how many votes to cast, so it's not really fair to criticise people for doing so, or for doing so in a way one dislikes. (Or for doing so ineffectively, since tactical voting can be tricky at the best of times, never mind trying to strategise to a moving target, or perhaps to no target at all.) Imagine for example the dilemma of the person who feels that all of the candidates (or at least any of those in any danger of even being "approved", much less preferred) are perfectly acceptable (but nonetheless has an opinion as to which is the best), or the person who thinks none of them are unqualifiedly worthy of approval (but nonetheless has an opinion as to which is the 'least worst'). See the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Approval_voting.html" title="Approval voting">approval voting</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preferential_voting.html" title="Preferential voting">preferential voting</a> articles for the gory details (aren't online encyclopaedias handy?). If we persist with this method in future "elections" despite these... features, realize that we're making people's true preferences doubly ineffective. If the model is rather, RFA + JW as super-bureaucrat-with-copious-discretion, we could avoid avoid confusion of expectation by not using the term "election", with its connotations of "voting" and an electoral system by which people can be objectively seen to have "won" or "lost" (which terms people also persist in using, adding to said confusion). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:46, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Hi Thebainer. I've just come back from a wikibreak, and I was scrolling up and down <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006_Vote_2510.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2006/Vote">Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote</a> when I noticed an excessive amount of space between Daniel.Bryant's and Flcelloguy's candidate statements. I was going to go fix it, but the page was protected; you seem to have protected the page with the reason "main voting page for ArbCom election." Was someone disrupting it, or was this a pre-emptive protection? If it's the latter, would you consides semiprotecting? In addition to allowing copyedits from us non-admins, several candidates are non-admins, and if they want to withdraw, they should be able to edit the page.

<dd><i>This was a pre-emptive protection, as was applied to the equivalent page in the last elections, which was done in light of the importance of the page and the desire to keep it absolutely stable throughout the elections. There is not really any need to edit the page other than to move withdrawn candidates to the bottom section; with respect to the candidates, the statements have been copied directly from the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006_Candidate_statements_7f0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2006/Candidate statements">candidate statements</a> page and should really be complete and stable prior to the election.

<p>Anyways, I'd just like some other opinions on whether this page should remain full protected. Firstly, I count 9 out of 32 candidates as being non-sysops; if they withdraw, I think they should be able to move their statements from the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006_Vote_2510.html#Standing_candidates" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2006/Vote">Standing candidates</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006_Vote_2510.html#Withdrawn_candidates" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2006/Vote">Withdrawn candidates</a> sections of the page without having to wait for an admin to do it for them. Secondly, this is, after all, a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>; it seems rather unwiki to lock pages to the majority of users unless there is vandalism, post-xfd recreation, or edit warring that needs to be halted. I completely understand Thebainer's view, but {{<a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEditprotected_d7e4.html" title="Template:Editprotected">editprotected</a>}} it still seems an unnecessary hassle for the other <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">99.96%</a> of us (who might just have more important changes than clicking backspace twice!)

<dl>
<dd>I don't think there's anything so pressing to fix on the page that would require general editability. Disruption of any sort to the election process could cast doubt onto the results, which I believe is the last thing anyone wants. I will have to side with Thebainer on this one, though I do understand where you're coming from, too. High-risk pages occasionally get preemptive protection, and the last thing Wikipedia needs is a vandalized graphic on its voting page (for example). -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 17:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As there are only a few days left, I thought it was possible that some people who might be blocked for a week or a few days (or even for 24 hours close to the end of the election) would be unable to vote (if they have not done so already). Is this a problem, or is it a case like that of criminals being unable to vote? ie. If you are blocked, you can't vote until the block ends, and if your block runs until the end of the election and you haven't voted yet, tough. I would say that if a particular user seems reasonable and regrets the actions leading to a block, and wants to vote, and asks to be unblocked, it seems reasonable. ie. Treat on a case-by-case basis.

<p>Incidentially, while we are on the topic of campaigning, I wonder what is to stop extensive campaigning outside of Wikipedia. I'm thinking mainly of IRC (I've heard rumours that campaigning goes on there), but also other venues as well. People e-mailing "wiki-friends" for support, etc. There has also been more obvious campigning on the actual vote pages, and some discussions at individual talk pages. Is it a case of pretty much anything goes, or are some things frowned upon? Could this sort of thing explain the disparity in voting patterns (with some candidates getting more "single" votes than others) or is this purely down to some people only voting for a few people and ignoring the rest? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:23, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rumours, Carcharoth? Cite reliable sources! Silliness aside, campaigning doesn't seem to be a big deal around here.

<p>Geogre's vote page history shows an edit war developing.

On 11 December, Ben Aveling added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=93566143&amp;oldid=93561473" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=93566143&amp;oldid=93561473" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which Cyde on 14 December <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=94285106&amp;oldid=94273008" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=94285106&amp;oldid=94273008" rel="nofollow">removed to the talk page</a>.

My view is that something needs to be done when people feel moved to comment on a vote that they think is misleading, or distorting things. My personal view is that Cyde's initial comment was misleading, and this is particularly unfortunate in this sort of election where people reading the other votes do find themselves being swayed by what other people say. Quite what to do about it, I don't know. Simply forbid any comments at all next time and direct <i>all</i> discussion to the talk page? That would be simplest. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:00, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> suggested "Simply forbid any comments at all next time and direct <i>all</i> discussion to the talk page?" I think that is overkill. Most comments are informative, brief, and are clearly opinions. I agree that this comment (and from what I can tell, only this comment) falls in a different category. I think that the current situation (Ben's response sitting there) is fair and reasonable.</dd>
<dd>One problem with bringing <b>all</b> comments to a talk page would be that there would be fewer comments, most users would be discouraged from making them, but those who did would likely make their comments much longer and more complicated. Currently, I think the comments are useful and easy to read. We would lose that. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 16:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This is a symptom of trying to use an RFA-style poll while retaining almost none of its benefits. If we <i>must</i> continue to use an open, nonsecret poll, with the voters encouraged to comment with their vote, but threaded comments are impermissible, I suggest the following:
<ol>
<li>If threaded replies are moved to the talk page, always, <i>always</i> leave a note that replies are on the talk page.</li>
<li>If there's just one reply, leave it instead of moving it. It won't take up significantly more room than the "moved to talk page" text.</li>
</ol>

<p>This was a daft choice for a format in the first place. It effectively gives voters (for or against) a free opportunity to say whatever they like, however false or misleading (a half truth is a whole lie), with no effective right to comment or reply. Yes, the talk page: but why are we separating the initial comments from the responses?</p>
<p>Either no comments should be allowed in the voting section, with all comments and replies relegated to another section or the talk page, or a response to the comments made with the votes should be permitted. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 17:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is someone ready to protect them all? Do we protect the talk pages as an archive as well, or else let them run free even after the election has closed? Do we discount votes after the deadline (and rollback), or do what happens at RfA and leave them? Just a few questions, as it is getting "tight-at-the-top", so to speak. Even though Jimbo isn't proscribed to take the top candidates, tradition says he probably will (the only time he doesn't is to reappoint, and no outgoing ArbCom members ran this year). <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 23:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Last time, Jimbo appointed based on percentages, didn't he? So wouldn't the split support/oppose votes only not have an effect if the voting was 50/50? If the voting was, say 3 in favor and 2 against, the percentage is 60%. If User:Lorem Ipsum adds a support and an oppose, then it becomes 4 and 3, or 57%.

<dd>That would be absolutely true if there were just a handful of people voting, but with most of the candidates having had a total of 200-300 votes cast, the issue is not realistically going to matter as much.

<dd>Geogre's vote now is 182 - 106, or 63.19%. Had you snuck in an extra support and an extra oppose at the wire, his percentage would have fallen to 63.10%, hardly enough of a difference to make a difference.

<dd>I am dismayed to see that the method of calculating the final result has not been explicitly discussed <b>prior</b> to the election. I assumed that this was a simple arithmetic result: <b>Support</b> votes minus <b>Oppose</b> votes equals the candidate's score.

If there are more approvals than seats available, Jimbo will either expand the size of the committee or choose among the community approved candidates. Jimbo appointed candidates mostly in the order of the percentage of approval in the community."</i> Note particularly that last bit: <b>in the order of the percentage of approval in the community.</b> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>However, note that is an observation of what happened, not a statement made by Jimbo. One could similarly observe that Jimbo appointed candidates mostly in the order of greatest "support minus oppose" scores. If you do the math, that turns out to be the case.

<ul>
<li>No, Jimbo explicitly stated that he had used percentages: <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-January/037980.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-January/037980.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConscious_cf76.html" title="User:Conscious">Conscious</a> 22:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which is just a description of what he did do on that occasion, not a commitment to use that method again. (There was no such prior commitment on that occasion, either, though there were certainly (prior) requests for one.) Also note the "mostly": the <i>vacant</i> seats were appointed in percentage-ranked-approvedness order, then there were the "expansion reappointments", which did not follow that pattern. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:31, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
