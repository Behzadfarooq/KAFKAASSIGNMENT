<p>Greetings. I'm Merovingian. I've been a Wikipedian since November 2003 and an administrator since March 2004. That doesn't really matter, though. Wikipedia has changed immensely since I joined, and the key to its prosperity is only more change. As the community has grown and diversified, the need for binding solutions has grown, too. The Arbitration Committee is dedicated to finding and developing these solutions.</p>
<p>Certainly, the committee has been a mixed blessing. While it has solved many disputes, it has been plagued by a backlog of cases and too much unimportant arguing. Usually, a fairly simple disagreement escalates, and the committee spends too much time picking through longwinded rants. An enlargement of the Arbitration Committee of just three could very well move cases through much more quickly.</p>
<p>Banning is, obviously, a privilege. Only certain users have this ability. Banning should always be an option in an Arbitration Committee case when the behavior of one or more involved users warrants it. However, I disapprove of banning as a form of injunction, unless it is called for.</p>
<p>I believe that I can help. During my time at Wikipedia, I have tried my very best to adhere to the projects tenets of honesty, good faith, and neutrality. All three are important features to be found in an arbitrator. If elected, I will maintain a high level of participation; the committeeâ€™s progress has been hindered by inactive members and resignations. I care about this project too much to give up. If elected, I will act with fairness to all involved parties, and conduct my work with the other arbitrators in the open. If elected, I will keep my personal views out of all cases, as I have tried to do when writing articles.</p>
<p>I welcome questions, comments, or criticisms here, my talk page, or at either of my email addresses, which can be seen on my userpage.</p>

<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: I am nearly seventeen years old. In my junior year of high school, I am studying Geography, Pre-Calculus, Literature, Art, Microsoft Applications, and United States Government.</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: As I am on Wikipedia for a few hours a day, I can spend every minute of that time as an Arbitrator. I am willing to suspend editing in other areas in order to work on an arbitration case.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: I have tried my best to collaborate with other users over matters on specific articles. I worked with <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">User:Nunh-huh</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">User:RickK</a> on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rest_of_the_Story_f530.html" title="The Rest of the Story">The Rest of the Story</a>.

<p>I feel that I have enough experience to be an Arbitrator from discussions like these. They are listed chronologically, with the earliest being first. I hope that you can see how my style of interaction has evolved over time, as I learned the finer points of having intelligent discussions with others for the purpose of resolving conflicts over articles' content.</p>
<p><i>Q: Please list out what other Wikipedia usernames you have edited under.</i></p>
<p>A: On the English Wikipedia, I have only edited under this username. However, I do have accounts on the Sanskrit, Simple English, Latin, Malagasy, Spanish, and German language editions of Wikipedia. Their usernames are Mero, Mero, Meronicus, Mero, Merovingian, and Merovingian, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Now, more than ever, the committee needs expansion.</b></p>
<p>I am frustrated that it has not, in its two years, expanded by a single seat, even with numerous resignations and inactive Arbitrators. I fully support more seats. A larger pool of Arbitrators can lead to a better, more efficient group. Here are some other suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Arbitration Committe must deal with content disputes. They need a final decision, too. Too many times, arguments are limited to AfD or a talk page, and it becomes chaos. Sometimes, it peters out only to be revived by somebody a week later, and all of the dead horses are brought out to be beaten again. By not dealing with content disputes, the Arbitration Committee has set itself from Wikipedia's <i>very purpose</i>.</li>
<li>The current election system of arbitrators is awkward. That a user can vote for everybody does not relate to who is actually qualified to serve. I suggest that we elect arbitrators using the First-Past-the-Post system. If we have X number of vacancies, users ought to have X votes. In the last Arbitration committee election, every user who earned a seat had a <i>plurality</i>. The most popular candidate (for lack of a better term) was voted for by just <b>51%</b> of voters. Furthermore, the seventh and eighth places were separated by <b>one</b> vote. This is not good representation.</li>
<li>I was shocked to hear of a proposal to limit the seat of Arbitrators to administrators only. This is fundamentally "anti-wiki". I don't think we have ever had an arbitrator without sysop rights, but it shouldn't be impossible.</li>
<li>Vacancies must be filled soon after they occur. This would lead to smooth operation of the committee, especially if the vacant arbitrator was working on any number of cases. Elections should quickly set up and executed, instead of having Jimbo Wales appoint replacements because as <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">User:jguk</a> pointed out, Wikipedia cannot rely on him to make every decision forever. As much as I respect Mr. Wales, we must be able to fix our own problems.</li>
<li>There should be only one pool of Arbitrators, instead of a number of them to deal with different kinds of disputes. A single argument needs all the input it can get.</li>

<p>Being an arbitrator requires a finely tuned bullshit detector. What in your life has prepared you to detect bullshit with ease? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 21:23, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First thing's first: I freely admit that as 17 years old, I don't have a very good amount of <i>firsthand</i> experience in detecting BS, but I <i>have</i> been exposed to enough media (books, TV, Internet, etc.) to know when I'm being fed a line of crap.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my own mind, the determining factor is the difference between what a person <b>says</b> and what a person <b>does</b>. I've found this to be true of individuals and groups both in real life, and on the Internet. I do, in fact, judge people on whether they keep their word. Trust is one of the most important things civilised people can have among themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the course of my time on Wikipedia, I have only found this to be true. The Arbitration Committee does not deal with simple vandalism, the kind of nonsense that can be reversed with a quick execution of the revert button. I've dealt with what the Arbitration Committee does deal with: the trolls, the sneaky POV pushers. They all share the same thing: they don't do what they say (or vice versa). --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> 14:21, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many policies contradict and overlap with each other, and then <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> makes things even more complicated while making them paradoxically more flexible.

<dl>
<dd>The more preferable policy is the one that can set a better precedent when the Arbitration Comittee uses it as part of a case. In the case of IAR, this is <i>not</i> helpful when it comes to settling conflicts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a microcosm of Wikipedia, the Arbitration Committee cannot function with policies that favor anarchy. It should use policies that are solid and not vague. It is not anti-wiki to do this.

<p><i>Do you hold any strong political or religious opinions (e.g. concerning George Bush, Islam, or on which end you should break a boiled egg)? If so, would you recuse yourself from cases centred on these?</i></p>

<p><i>Do you view all requests to re-address cases, particularly requests made by those most penalised, as being automatically without merit?</i></p>
<p><i>In the case against Yuber, it was decided by the arbitration committee that it is the duty of arbitrators to investigate, and rule on the behaviour of not only one party involved, but all of them.

<dl>
<dd>I have clear political and religious opinions, but I sincerely try not to let those interfere with the reasoning of NPOV. Reporting facts is clear and good. Inferring from facts is clear and good. Making judgments based on facts (which is different from inferences) is not good.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would not recuse myself from cases based on content so much as the users involved in the dispute. If I've dealt with them before, or already have a bias toward or against one of them, I know that I could not fairly assess their case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would not have a second thought in contesting the actions of the committee. It is probable that each arbitrator has his or her thoughts about a given case. Incompetence or mistakes should not be tolerated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Affected parties of a case should have the right to appeal. Such a provision is a measure of good faith.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that the Arbitration Committee ought to review relevant actions of all involved parties of a case. In other words, yes, I support that decision. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> 04:56, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Economically, I'm moderate. I'm for capitalism, with certain provisions for safety (protection from crashes). As far as religion goes, I was born a Catholic, although I don't go to church much. Socially, I'm slightly right-ish; I'm pro-life, pro-gun, and I dislike the thought of gay marriage, <i>but I do not discriminate against gay people</i>. At-home politics: I am quite conservative, favoring a strong legislature, a strong executive, and a judicial system whose decisions don't create laws. Foreign politics: I dislike the international organisations, and I prefer that nations be free to deal with each other as they please. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> 15:56, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>As you probably are already aware, your age may be an issue to a lot of people. I am one of those people.</p>
<p>My particular concern is that, at your age, you are unlikely to have a broad grounding in the general background knowledge of (what passes for?) our culture. This potentially opens the door for others, possibly including fellow arbitrators, to foist their particular agendas upon you.</p>
<p>In light of my concerns about this, which I suspect others may share, how would you deal with conflicts that might be brought before you as an arbitrator on subjects about which you do not have good background knowledge? How would you keep yourself from just relying on the information supplied by another arbitrator or another person, information that might be biased?</p>

<dd>Rather than the subject matter, I believe that it is more important to analyse a case based on the involved parties' actions. It is the committee's preference to not deal with content disputes. Nevertheless, it is easy to tell bias from fact, regardless of subject. I can read and think for myself. I intend to review each case independently, bringing my suggestion(s) to the table only when I feel it is appropriate. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> 14:42, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your response. I think you take too lightly, however, telling bias from fact. Virtually everything reported in Wikipedia is based on sometimes distantly removed reporting of people's observations; if I were to look up on a map and travel to <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasper%2C_Missouri_979f.html" title="Jasper, Missouri">Jasper, Missouri</a>, for example, I could probably decide whether or not the Census Bureau information that Wikipedia reports for the town seems consistent with my observations. But I am very unlikely ever to do any such thing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is unlikely that anything about a small Missouri town would be misreported by the Census Bureau. But there are other matters about which there is nothing like an authoritative documentation, and of which the available information largely became reported only after the matter had become part of a dispute, with the interested parties in the dispute providing the information. And it is not atypical, in such situations, for the unreported facts of the situation to be overwhelmed by propaganda produced by an interested party.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> (ID) "debate" in the US is an example of this: proponents of ID can line up people with relevant academic degrees to declare how it is a legitimate alternative to the theory of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, and there is almost no response from the evolution-supporting committee. An uninformed glance at the "debate" might conclude that ID is better supported in the scientific community based on this, while the truth of the matter is that ID is such a fringe position, and not generally even considered to be science, that very few objective scientists want even to dignify it with a response.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Intelligent Design "debate" is a pretty clunky and obvious example of how an extreme minority position might posture as being significant to determining what is a neutral point of view: it is basically a difference in logical construction, and even someone who knows nothing about any of it might be able with some thought to figure out why ID is not part of mainstream science.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Other matters are more subtle. In particular, political differences are sometimes argued based on competing versions of history: these cannot generally be resolved through thought experiments.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>People knowledgeable about the background of such a dispute may legitimately regard one line of argument to be an extreme minority view that needn't be taken into account. But the historiography that such a person might present to an uninformed observor would be very hard to distinguish, generally, from the historiography that would be presented by an interested party hoping to stifle a reasonable line of argument. Similarly, a legitimate argument that a particular historiography should be acknowledged would be very hard to distinguish from an illegitimate attempt to elevate an extreme minority view into a debate over what would constitute a neutral perspective.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I don't think I've particularly written anything here that invites a further response from you, although of course you should make one if you'd like to. Consider it all food for your thought.</dd>

<dd>I understand the gist of what you're saying, that the line between truth and untruth can be very fine. In that case, a good solution for such a dispute is to make readers aware of what is truthful and objective (and what isn't), and evaluating users' actions based on that. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> 01:56, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I am concerned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;curid=895730&amp;diff=34790720&amp;oldid=34790144#Template:User_against_scientology|recent" rel="nofollow">templates</a> surviving AfD that appear to contrast with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">established policy</a>. In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:50, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Improv has taken things in a good direction. Templates such as the aforementioned may be viewed as disruptive, especially since they can hit somebody a lot harded than, say, a template disapproving of a musical group. I think that these particularly hostile things should be minimized because Wikipedia is NOT a soapbox, public or personal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the Arbitration Committee's role in all of this, there should certainly be some intervention if disputes arise over the use of these controversial templates. Personally, I think that the templates can be trivializing (making light of) something rather serious, and potentially sensitive. Despite my relatively liberal wiki-stance on self-expression, civility and diplomacy are virtues, and should be expected to some degree of all users. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a> 22:25, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

While the accusation, if it were substantiated, could be relevant to the candidacy, the questioning here is not serving any electoral purpose and the tone is verging on the abusive. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:43, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hold on just a minute! I found what Sam is talking about. I had moved <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29_8987.html" title="Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)">Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)</a> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_%28hoaxer%29_22e6.html" title="Brian Chase (hoaxer)">Brian Chase (hoaxer)</a>, because I thought it was too self-referential (there aren't that many Brian Chases who have pulled large-scale hoaxes like that). Anyway, it looks like Sam moved it back (or copy-pasted) it, so the question is moot now. I won't bother to pursue the issue further; somebody else can do that. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not moot because you also blanked the entire history page. If you look at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] as you have left it, it looks like the page was created a few days ago and there have been only two edits. Actually, the page was created in November and there have been more than one hundred edits, involving numerous different people. (Almost none were by me, incidentally.) The fact that you have erased the work product of one hundred different users shows that you do not respect the opinions of others. Several other users had suggested various name changes and one other user actually made the change you made only to have it reverted back. A heated debate and vote was taken and it was decided to keep the name. Then you came along and probably without even reading the history and familiarizing yourself with the issues, decided to blank the entire history. I am still waiting for you to restore the history page, which I assume that you have the power to do, so that everybody can see what happened. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Sloan_b1e5.html" title="User:Sam Sloan">Sam Sloan</a> 23:30, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, it does appear that the history of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29_8987.html" title="Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)">Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)</a> was moved over to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_%28hoaxer%29_22e6.html" title="Brian Chase (hoaxer)">Brian Chase (hoaxer)</a>.

<p>I'd be inclined to go ahead and turn that article into a redirect, if it weren't for the fact that I did it a couple times in weeks past and it was reverted.

I'm not planning on doing anything else with the article, unless there's something you can think of.
