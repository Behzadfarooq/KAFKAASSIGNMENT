<p>This vote is to ratify <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_Proposed_amendment_6347.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Proposed amendment">a set of proposed alterations</a> to the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">Arbitration policy</a> as guides the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a>; they were originally proposed in August 2004.</p>
<p>In essence, the point of the amendment is to stream-line the way in which the Committee works, making it faster and more responsive, and to alter the policy to more accurately reflect both how and when it is used, which differs slightly from how this was envisaged when the policy was initially drafted.</p>

<p>The vote will close exactly one fortnight after it opens. If at that time, at least 100 votes have been cast, and the percentage of all votes for "yes" exceeds 70 per cent, then the outcome of the vote is "Yes." If it does not exceed 70 per cent, the outcome of the vote is "No."</p>
<p><b>As of 03:19 28 Nov 2004, there were 50 votes cast (43 yes and 7 no); this does not meet the 100 vote restriction on determining an outcome. As such, a proposal is on the board to extend the vote another fortnight (to 03:19 12 Dec 2004). Please comment on the talk page</b> hereof and continue to cast your votes until it is determined when the vote will officially close with an outcome.</p>

<li><a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYelyos_5db4.html" title="User:Yelyos">Yelyos</a> 02:05, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC) In response to the arguments brought up by those below regarding Snowspinner's amendment, I believe that although private emails and IRC should be allowed as evidence, they should be treated (if they are unverifiable evidence, and I don't believe IRC is truly unverifiable, given the number of people keeping logs) as unverifiable evidence and given a corresponding amount of weight when it comes to proceedings. I trust in the ArbCom to make reasonable judgements when it comes to unverifiable evidence.

<li>The "Snowspinner" amendment is a recipe for disaster, since only the unscrupulous will likely make use of such "evidence".

<li>No, because of clause 8. The Arbitration Committee has been and should continue to be responsible to this community, not to the Wikimedia Foundation.

<li>Concur with Jamesday. Members of the Board must still be <i>individually</i> accountable for their actions as Wikipedia editors. However, the Board's <i>decisions</i> are not subject to arbitration; they are simply beyond arbitration's scope. Also concur with objections to the Snowspinner amendment. Private mail and IRC logs are too subject to forgery and manipulation. Moreover, it is not the job of the Arbitration Committee to review abuses in private e-mail that should be matters for the court system or for ISP acceptable-use policies. Simply because a private e-mail refers to Wikipedia does not make it anything over which Wikipedia community institutions have business sitting in judgment. Arbitration is for forums "owned" by Wikipedia only, not for private activity that refers to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 08:25, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The vote is solidly in favor of the proposal (80%+) even though only 70% was required. The goal of 100 votes was overly ambitious, probably due to the relatively high voting threshold. I'm not even sure whether or when or why a vote is necessary or valid or desirable for such things. But, since 80%+ have voted for it, and since I support it, and since these amendments do more accurately reflect our practical operations, I ratify this vote as having been completed successfully, and declare this to be a proper amendment to policy, but I don't necessarily ratify that this is the way policy amendments should be decided in the future.

<dd>Regrettably, this did not demonstrate broad community support, with less than 100 80 people from a community thousands strong supporting it. Further, there has been long-standing practice that the Committee enforces the policies of this community and at least one of the clauses may be taken as changing that. Finally, as Chairman of hte board of the Wikimedia Foundation, and a clear benificiary of this proposal, whcih makes you immune from the policies of this community, you should be recusing yourself from this matter, not declaring that a vote which did not reach it s targets passed anyway. For these reasons, I urge you to reconsider your decision.

<dd>I am not yet qualified to vote, therefore I may not be qualified to speak, but I have been a steady contributer to Wikipedia since the end of December, yet I had no idea that these amendments were being considered. In the future, it might be nice if Wikipedians were given advance notification. Furthermore, and with all due respect to Jimbo, (and I really do have the utmost respect for Mr. Wales) if you are going to set a minimum of 100 votes, then by God you should stick to it! Or else what is the point of having a vote at all? Given the <i>huge</i> number of people who contribute to Wikipedia, I don't think it would have taken all that long for 100 eligiable voters to show up and be counted. Jimbo may be the king, but when the king asks for an opinion, shouldn't he wait until his advisors shut their mouths? My apologies if I have spoken out of turn. <a href="../../../2A/k/a/User%7E_Kat__e754.html" title="User:*Kat*">*Kat*</a> 03:15, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo's the king, though. He gets to amend whatever policy he likes. This is very jolly though. It's rather like the 1640s. An absolute king devolved some of his powers to the people then. The only way Jimbo would get not to act like God is the community leaves him behind, as it did Charles.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 02:25, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One problem with changing the "rules", ex post facto, is that the rules affect how people vote. For example, I might have voted "No", but decided it wasn't necessary, since I assumed that the 100 vote "requirement" wasn't going to be met&#160;;-) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 11:10, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>No way!</b> It is completely unfair to change the rules <i>after</i> the voting has begun. I refuse to believe that anybody could consider this vote ratified without quorum having been reached. There are well over 100 users on the English Wikipedia capable of voting. In fact, aren't there about 400 admins, including myself? I suggest that the new page to hold a re-vote on these issues be frozen to voting until quorum has been reached here. <i>When</i> that happens, it should make all the sense in the world to hold the re-vote, although that smells quite fishy, if you ask me. These amendments should either pass or fail. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian"><font color="green"><big>R</big>yan!</font></a> | <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian"><font color="orange">Talk</font></a> 00:46, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect to Mr. Wales, this ratification sets an precedent that is not welcome. In particular as this ratification benefits directly the ratifier. Not a good example for consesus building IMO. In the future, you may consider a better information policy to increase the number of votes. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 02:29, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
