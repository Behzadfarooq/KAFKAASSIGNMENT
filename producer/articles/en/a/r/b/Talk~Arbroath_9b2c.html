<p>An inhabitant of Arbroath is called a "Red Lichtie". I am fairly sure that this is a reference to the Bell Rock light which flashed alternately red and white for many years.

<dd>Scots speakers say "Reid Lichtie" but we don't want that here do we? 84.135.242.133 10:21, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, <i>red</i> or <i>reid</i> - both good <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_language.html" title="Scots language">Scots</a> words but if there is a consensus I would be glad to know about it! Anyway, <i>red lichtie</i> has referred to a native or inhabitant of Arbroath since late 19th century; the use <i>Red Lichties</i> has been taken on by the football club since approx 1970s. Hopefully not <i>reid</i> meaning the fourth stomach of a ruminant. → <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriedfish_0ba2.html" title="User:Friedfish">friedfish</a> 12:07, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have several copyedits to bring this article in line with the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a>, some of which I had made previously, but had been reverted. Here is why I have made some of the them:</p>
<ul>
<li>per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Numbers_2" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Numbers_2</a>, "Whole numbers from zero to ten should be spelled out as words in the body of an article. Use numerals in tables and infoboxes."</li>
<li>per <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONTEXT_5f0d.html" title="WP:CONTEXT">WP:CONTEXT</a>, "In general, do not create links to plain English words." In this case, 'schools', 'college', 'pond', 'students' and 'population' are widely understood words that need no links.</li>
<li>"It's" = "it is". When you want the possessive form of "it", use "its".</li>
<li>"HND" is meaningless to readers outside of the UK, and <a href="../../../h/n/d/HND_74f4.html" title="HND">HND</a> is a redirect page. I have replaced it by "<a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_National_Diploma_3e01.html" title="Higher National Diploma">Higher National Diploma</a> (HND)".
<ul>
<li>The same goes for "GNER", which I have changed to "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_North_Eastern_Railway_05d3.html" title="Great North Eastern Railway">Great North Eastern Railway</a> (GNER)".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_Independence_b8be.html" title="Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> page is a list of declarations of independence around the world. I have changed the link to the one in question here.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_VI_fff6.html" title="King James VI">King James VI</a> redirects to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I of England</a>, so I have fixed the link to that, but kept "King James VI" in the text.</li>
<li>The article for Sir Walter Scott is found at <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Scott_51ea.html" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a>, so I have fixed the link accordingly.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth.html" title="Perth">Perth</a> is a list of articles about Perths around the world. I have changed the link to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Scotland_2b8a.html" title="Perth, Scotland">Perth, Scotland</a>.</li>
<li>I have removed one or two repeated links, e.g., to "secondary school" per <a href="../../../l/i/n/WP%7ELINK_488d.html" title="WP:LINK">WP:LINK</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I trust that these edits that are consistent with the Manual of Style will not be blindly reverted. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 13:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looks fine to me. These links were originally direct ones for the most part. It's just that the other articles have been moved since the links were made. The people who moved them should have fixed the redirects when they did the moves but that is too much trouble for a lot of people. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 15:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section says arbroath only has one team, maybe this should be changed to say one professional/part time team, or whatever there current position is, aswell as say there are many smaller teams like arbroath vics, the article is a bit murky.</p>
<p>Also, maybe a link to the aberdeen bon accord page, and let people know they were originally a cricket team, this would put things into context</p>

<p>It's possible to add a great deal on the local history of the areas in the map. In fact Arbroath public library has a couple of books published in the late 19th/early 20th century by the long-since gone <i>Arbroath Guide</i> which give more details than most people want to know. These are still part of the general lending stock and could certainly be used to bulk up he article. More recently a book was published by the local publisher (the Herald Press) on <i>Street Names in Arbroath</i> which gave dates and origins for most of the streets in the town and could likewise be used as a source book for the article.</p>
<p>As for the 1838 rail link, it's still alive and kicking, forming an indispensable part of the modern mainline east coast route linking Aberdeen to Edinburgh. Rumours of its demise are very much exaggerated. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 05:48, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
