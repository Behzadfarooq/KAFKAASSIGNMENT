<p>Before it's recent protection, I tried to add a section to this template to address Requests that have gone stale (not met the 4-vote threshold to open or reject). This version can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Template%3AArbCommOpenTasks&amp;diff=6766626&amp;oldid=6766510" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Template%3AArbCommOpenTasks&amp;diff=6766626&amp;oldid=6766510" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since this template is a tool for communicating status of arbitrations, this seems like a natural extension of the template. There, unfortunately, is no way in the Arbitration policy to handle stale requests, so using this tool to communicate that need seems natural and desirable. I suppose the exact presentation of this information is not important, but I think it's valuable to have it here. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 15:32, 2004 Oct 22 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently this template was edited to replace the /Evidence link with a /Workshop link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:ArbComOpenTasks&amp;diff=20922885&amp;oldid=20884582" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:ArbComOpenTasks&amp;diff=20922885&amp;oldid=20884582" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>However, this leaves no link to the /Evidence page from the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">RfAr</a> page (and the Workshop page itself has no link to /Evidence either). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 15:08, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm a little confused on the use of the /Workshop page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it for ArbCom use only or can any party edit it?</li>
<li>Is it meant to replace the /Evidence page or supplement it?</li>
<li>Should evidence be placed on both pages or just one?</li>

<p>I think the workshop is a good idea, I'd just like a little more info on how it should be used. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 15:17, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

We now have both Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/X and Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/X/Workshop.

<p>I made some minor style changes to the template. I indented the text for each header, then had each header get progressively darker for each stage of a case going through ArbCom (maybe that should be reversed, heh, sounds negative). Hopefully the indented text is OK even if the color changes aren't (something about text hugging a margin that closely just drives me nuts).

<dd>Took the very words. Is this working to a rough number of days (2-3?), a certain number of most recent cases (1-2?), or some combination thereof? Personally I'd suggest leaving more/them longer, given the timescale of many cases, which tends to make their subsequent disappearance somewhat sudden-seeming. Say a week, as a rule of thumb. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 21:15, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I generally just remove one case from the list for every newly closed case.

It varies a lot. For nearly two weeks this month there were no case closes, so the most recent closed case on the list at that time was really rather old. Now we're closing cases about one a day and so I'm happy just to list the most recent two cases. There is a link to the full list of closed cases in the "Recently closed" header. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:20, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cool. =) Looks like it still has issues in IE 7 unfortunately. It looks like it's not respecting the <code>white-space: nowrap</code> in the table definition, but if you set nowrap on each individual table cell (except for the one I explicitly set to <code>normal</code>) it works fine. I bet it'd work if we had a CSS class for this (and take less code in the template). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 22:00, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, here's the solution for IE that saves having a ton of code in the template itself. The following code would need to be copied into <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki%7ECommon.css_d42e.html" title="MediaWiki:Common.css">MediaWiki:Common.css</a> (putting it at the bottom should suffice):</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
.toccolours.arbcom,
.toccolours.arbcom TD {
  white-space: nowrap;
}

.toccolours.arbcom TD {
  vertical-align: top;
}
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And this template would need to be updated to the code in User:Locke Cole/Template:ArbComOpenTasks.</dd>
<dd>If you'd like to see the effect yourself in IE/Firefox/whatever, simply copy the CSS code above into your userspace CSS override and look at User:Locke Cole/Template:ArbComOpenTasks (make sure to refresh/reload so your CSS file is updated). The only alternative I can think of to get this working with Internet Explorer is to put <code>style="white-space: nowrap;"</code> on every table cell defined.. and that gets ugly fast.

<dd>I have been bold and added the "white-space:nowrap" directives and the template is now readable for me once again. My monitor is only a 15" LCD but I have to crank up the font-size to ridiculous levels to even get near to the effect that the original complainant describes. Maybe he could let us know what his settings are like to allow us to gauge whether this is likely to be a problem that other people will encounter?

<dd>The thing is, this is something that's edited (semi-)regularly so having all that code in there was something I was trying to avoid. =) Hence my suggestion of a CSS class that inherits from .toccolours. Then all we'd need is the single <code>white-space: normal;</code> to make the column with case names wrap as desired.</dd>

<p>OK, I've now been reverted for removing an element that forced this template to be wider than it needed to be except in pathological conditions (that is, browser window widths of 800px and font sizes above 14pt, from a brief fiddling with settings. This is ridiculous. We can't hang-string ourselves into such an unsuitable situation merely because people go out of their way to have difficult set-ups.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I propose, err, <i>not</i> having a forced-width item. Thoughts?</p>

<dd>Not forcing the width implies that for long names <i>either</i> in {{<a href="../../../a/r/b/Template%7EArbComOpenTasks_5ee1.html" title="Template:ArbComOpenTasks">ArbComOpenTasks</a>}} or in the table of contents will mangle the table of contents as the two compete for the same space. But I seem to be the only one complaining, so I won't mind the template going back to unrestricted settings. But no, I am not going out of the way screwing my monitor so that things look bad.&#160;:) <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 20:00, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FWIW, I preferred the fixed width version as well. Besides, without the fixed width, you may as well remove the <code>white-space: nowrap</code> styling since the browser will use the largest size it can get away with. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 20:13, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well... exactly. Having a fixed-width template is ugly as hell. Anyway, case names are meant to be short for ease of use (we've often called cases "... &amp; others" or "... et al." for this reason), partially to make this template more useful and less ugly (but also to avoid our poor fingers being hammered down into stumps.&#160;:-)).</dd>

<dd>Actually, the workshop is where the parties can offer motions. Motions proposed by arbitrators for actual voting go on the top section of /proposed decision. The point of the link is not to call attention to the parties' proposals (indeed, look at the voluminous motions section in the Barrett v. Rosenthal case) but rather to call attention to that which needs to be voted on. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:09, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I don't think so. ST47 proposed the motion to speedily restore Freakofnuture's access on the workshop page. UninvitedCompany agreed, posted it to the proposed decision page, and voted on it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Daniel_Brandt_deletion_wheel_war/Proposed_decision&amp;diff=111205717&amp;oldid=110453650" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Daniel_Brandt_deletion_wheel_war/Proposed_decision&amp;diff=111205717&amp;oldid=110453650" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The tag goes to the proposed decision page to indicate the need for further voting. (As it happens the motion was mostly ignored after being voted 2-2, and is now superceded by the voting in the main case, so maybe the motion note is not needed at all here, although it needs to stay in the template to indicate previously passed motions). Or am I not getting your point? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah. That's a proposed temporary injunction, not a motion or request by the parties, and me being a programmer, I didn't look past that one section pointed to by the link. It needs an "i" parameter, not an "m". No? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 18:45, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A proposed injunction is labeled with a single "i" and links to the proposed decison page and the tag is in italics. An injunction that has passed (it only takes 4 net votes to pass a preliminary injunction) gets 2 "i's" which makes a bolded link to the passed injunction on the main case page (which is the case with Armenia--its a passed injunction). A proposed motion is labeled with one "m" which makes an italic font link to the proposed decision page where the motion is voted on; a passed motion would be labeled "mm" which makes a bold-faced link to the "Preliminary decisions" section of the main case page which is where the passed motion would be recorded. This first came up because originally (i.e. pre my term as clerk) the template could only indicate an injunction. In the Konstable case, there was a motion to close without a decision since he was already desysopped. Fred listed the case in voting but left it also listed in Evidence, since the parties were still workshopping the case in chief, and various helpful people kept taking it out of the evidence section, thinking it was a mistake to be listed twice. So Fred asked me to work out a way to signal a motion as well as an injunction. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:32, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Thatcher. An injunction is an order that the parties to the case do or not do something (for example, the injunction adopted the other day in the Armenia-Azerbaijan case putting the parties on revert parole while the case is pending). In this case, the motion was to resysop an editor, which I suppose requires a bureaucrat to do something, but doesn't require the <i>parties</i> to do anything, so isn't an injunction in a technical sense. It gets listed under "temporary injunctions" on the case pages because the templates don't have anywhere else to put it, but it's not really an injunction, so the distinction being drawn is a valid one, though hardly indispensible. By the way, I also was thinking of taking the "motion" out of the template in this particular case because it's obviously is not going to be acted on one way or the other. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 19:37, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I've sussed it now. The problem is that the Freak motion in <i>Brandt wheel war</i> was listed as an injunction on /Proposed decision. I think this is because there was no predefined place for it in the case template.
