<dd>I've reverted Sam's attempt to vandalize the legitimate comments of others regarding his candidacy. His actions are highly suspicious. I'm sorry he's garnered so much negative attention, but that's no justification for a candidate to censor legitimate public commentary on his fitness for office. If he does not want to face public scrutiny, then he shouldn't run.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 16:35, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Eequor, you mistakenly claim in justifying your repeated deletions of other editor's comments that "there has been neither consensus nor a fair attempt to determine the community's wishes." Clearly you are unaware of 1) how much of a fair attempt to determine the community's wishes, and 2) on the majority who have enjoyed consensus for some time here: <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_Endorsements_3ae5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Endorsements">Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements</a>. Further, by deleting unfavorable comments for Sam Spade here and <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_Endorsements_3ae5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Endorsements">here</a>, your actions show a bias and a complete lack of balance. This is an election. It must be fair and balanced to be competitive and valid. Fairness dictates that either all candidates comments are censored or none are censored. That Sam finds uncomfortable and undesirable how he is viewed by others here on wikipedia is unfortunate but irrelevant. As a candidate, he needs to be subject to the same scrutiny as any other candidate. Your actions tonight have been biased unilateral censorship, plain and simple.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 07:51, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that, in fairness, either all comments must be removed or none must, and I have attempted to act accordingly. On the occasions that I blanked the comments, I did in fact remove every comment, both positive and negative. As we would seem to be in agreement on this point, I am confused by your allegation of bias.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please see the discussion on the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004_Candidate_statements_Endorsements_3ae5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2004/Candidate statements/Endorsements">talk page</a>, where there has been considerable debate on this issue. It is not at all clear whether consensus has been reached. There has been a four day straw poll to determine whether the <i>disendorsements</i> and <i>endorsements</i> pages should be merged, but that does not concern Sam's request, and it would be unfair to draw any conclusions from such a short poll.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If people were actually interested in paying more than lip service to ideas fo community consensus, then conducting a straw poll is miles better than unilateral deletion. People are free to build consensus, if they can. If the cannot, they should respect the community's decision. Saying that, however, this candidate subpage was NOT the subject of the straw poll. I find it a little odd that someone who would set up a poll, would then go and start unilateral deletion of a page without consensus. Consensus is not just for christmas, its for life. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 10:36, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've misunderstood me. When I said either all comments must be removed or none must, I meant for all candidates. It's not hard to see that for this to be fair and competitive election, parity in access to relevant candidate information must exist between all candidates. There is informative, highly relevant information that exists only here. Delete that as you have, and uninformed voters are left with only Sam's candidate statement, which only has the most tenuous of relationships with reality. Hardly fair, particularly considering Sam historically deletes uncomfortable questions and information not easily explained away from his Talk page (just as you did from yours tonight). So by necessity either all candidate comments must be removed or none must.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, that Sam finds it uncomfortable and undesirable how he is viewed by others here on wikipedia is unfortunate but irrelevant; he is a candidate in a public election. As a candidate, he is subject to the same scrutiny as any other candidate whether he cares for it or not. Candidates are, and must be, subjects open to public discussion. Deleting the comments of editors regarding his fitness for office is unethical and not acceptable. By deleting his comments, Sam gains an unfair advantage over the other candidates.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think you'll find you've underestimated the amount of community support there is for leaving opposing comments, particulary when you count on the Endorsements page itself the number of editors who leave them. There is a standing majority of editors who've spoken out over the last few weeks on the Endorsements Talk page against censoring any opposing comments. All that is left is to make the opposing comments conform to the civility policy and keep those bent on censorship, cronyism and voter manipulation from having their way. I'm not surprised that you are acting as Sam has himself on this page, considering your hasty deletion of polite and legitmate comments left on your Talk page; you and Sam seem to be cut from the same cloth.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 08:47, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
