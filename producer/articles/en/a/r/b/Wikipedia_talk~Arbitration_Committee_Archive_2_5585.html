<h2><span class="mw-headline">CULTURAL TERRORISM Ongoing on Portuguese section</span></h2>
<p>Please guys,</p>
<p>Brazillian activists have taken control over the Portuguese section. They revert anything that isn't written in their own 'version' of Brazillian Portuguese - that no one else in the world uses and is not officially accepted. They eliminate lots of Portuguese (from Portugal, Europe and world) content. They actively ban and persecute users, lie to the superior Wiki managers, and do all censorship possible to avoid contact from Portuguese (and other countries speaking Portuguese) with the rulers of Wiki. As of now they completely hijacked the Portuguese section of Wiki.</p>
<p>For some unexplainable reason instead of creating a BR section for their own special needs, they insist on hijacking, controlling, and reverting everything in the PT section to their own whims. Most non-Brazilian users have no stopped contributing, enjoying and using Wiki - because what's there, IS NOT Portuguese. It's as if Catalan speakers hijacked the Spanish zone and modified it to their own version claiming it was 'Spanish'.</p>
<p>It should be said, that Brazillian Portuguese is WILDLY different than Portuguese and not simple "minor" changes as they falsely claim!</p>
<p>I do not know if Brazilians are ashamed of being 'Brazilians' and thus insist on hiding behind the 'Portuguese' mask, i find no other explanation for this bizarre insistance.</p>
<p>Brazillian is totaly different from Portuguese. They use a totally different verb tense. Hundreds of words that mean nothing in Portuguese (nor have any linguistic basis) are used. Incorrect - you'd fail in any Portuguese class in any Portuguese speaking country BUT Brazil - Portuguese is used so frequently it makes most articles WIDLY unreadable.</p>
<p>It's not that they used different versions, i'll explain: They started slowly using wrong grammar versions because the people was very poor, and now, because their government has not control over the country, and educations is extremely lacking, they found it 'cheaper' to just maintain the wild grammar errors. Again, the errors are rampant, not minor, at all.</p>
<p>Sirs... this is totally affecting our ability to use the section dedicated to our own language...! THEY IMMIDEATELY REVERT, CANCEL, CENSOR any attempt to use Portuguese!</p>
<p>Entire changes and articles have been already wiped out by them simply because it wasn't in "their" version.</p>
<p>The whole editing section is in places UNREADABLE and completely ununderstandable to non-Brazillian Portuguese speakers - ie, all of them all over the world. They use words that mean nothing in Portuguese, in the Wiki UI, people reading it, from Africa, have no idea what it means!</p>
<p>This is NOT a 50\50 partnership. ALL main pages have now been reverted to Brazillian only, locked, and reverted no matter what minor change \ comment is done. Most Portuguese, or simply outside of Brazil, users have been coimpletely driven out of Wiki, this can't be right.</p>
<p>They've been feeding the impression that Brazillian and Portuguese are as equal as English in the UK and America, THIS IS UTTERLY FALSE! The differences are huge, to the point that ocasionally you can't even understand what they are trying to say \ talking about.</p>
<p>Most weird, is the fact that they seem driven by some internal frustration of the tragedies inside their own country, and are completely using this as some strange form of Nationalistic rabidly jingoistic movement to assert themselves. They are now publishing articles of political activism about Brazilian Nationalism as if they were Wiki definitions... 8O</p>
<p>I do not whish in any way that they don't use their own version. But right now they are stopping us from using ours. Heck, we are the ones which are Portuguese and i can't even understand some of the words in articles claiming to be "Portuguese" here in Wikipedia, because they are not Portuguese words at all - nevermind the constant verbal, pronoum differences that occur in _every_ single sentence...</p>
<p>No one seems to do anything about this.</p>
<p>Am i to believe what other Portuguese partners have told me, and to just give up on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Then it's truly sad, because it means Wiki is not a place for cultural exchange, but for cultural terrorism. Maybe they in south America are used to this, but i, absolutely am not.</p>
<p>Most of the threads from Portuguese and non-Brazillian members i checked were outside Wiki, because simply put people no longer ontribute here because they now the Brazillians will be banned, censor, rejected. This is wrong!</p>
<p>There is currently a thread on this subject on the PT section, the admins are all brazillian, the pages are all written in brazillian, the UI is all in brazillian, and every dissenting opinion\article is removed at once. What the heck?</p>
<p>--&gt; [<a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Discussão:Versões_da_língua_portuguesa" class="external autonumber" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Discussão:Versões_da_língua_portuguesa" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]</p>
<p>The title translated is, "versions of Portuguese language". What versions, if all we see is their own peculiar one? All others are shot down in flames. This truly is nationalistic fascism at play.</p>
<p>Should i just give up and forget the freedom to use and enjoy my language? I have to be honest as is, the brazillian content is totally useless, to me, to most Portuguese i know, and it surely isn't right for a child to get there and see words that to her mean nothing and negate the education she gets in school - not to mention the barrage of grammar errors the brazillian governement, like pretty much everything else, seems impotent to resolve, solve, and educate in its own anarchic country&#160;:(, and occur literally in every sentence. It's nearly unreadable and it sure isn't educational. Sad, sad, sad&#160;:(</p>
<p>At bare minumum: Seperate these totally different ways of using Portuguese, one is cannibalizing the other.</p>
<p><a name="Wait_a_moment" id="Wait_a_moment"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Wait a moment</span></h3>
<p>There are a couple of things that should be noted in this rant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brazilian Portuguese is not a wrong version of Portuguese. It is not the fruit of neglect due to poor and uneducated people influencing the language, but actually, the influence of the greater number of immigrants that came from nations other than Portugal, along with some dialects absorbed from indigenous inhabitants since colonial times.</li>
<li>While you may consider what is written to be grammatical errors, it is not that way for Brazilian Portuguese speakers. One could say your Portuguese is totally wrong because it derived from a completely wrong manner of writing latin. That would not be a fair thing to say.</li>
<li>It is unfair to mention the little portuguese children not being able to read the article, because the other way around the little brazilian children would not being able to read the article. While you can't favor one over another, out of the 220 million people that speak portuguese in the world, 180 are brazillian, or 81%. I guess as it is Wikipedia is able to appeal to the greatest number of people this way, democratically, as I would put it. Either way, as it is, it facilitates your prized cultural exchange more than the other way around.</li>
<li>The arguments were not presented with a neutral point of view. The tone is generally offensive, and there are unprecedent and unjustified claims, such as implying Brazilians are ashamed of themselves, that South America is used to cultural terrorism, that the brazilian government is impotent to resolve everything.</li>
<li>I wouldnt deny that the portuguese wiki is brazilian centered, and that there might be articles that sprouted from nationalism. Nevertheless, it is still Wikipedia and people strive to maintain a neutral point of view. While some might complain about it being brazilian centered, the portuguese language, contemporarily, IS brazilian centered. Also, that rant sounded somewhat nationalistic from the Portugal side, considering the way that Portugal's portuguese was considered "right" and that at every opportunity there was a subjective insult or attempt to diminish Brazil and Brazilian Portuguese. You also did not sign your comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would request for anyone reading this to be moderate on the subject, as the way it was originally presented was extremely radical, and perhaps unreasonable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">PHF</a> 15:49, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Note: for simplicity, I will use 'Portuguese' for Portuguese-from-Portugal and 'Brazilian' for Portuguese-from-Brazil. Portuguese and Brazilian, without quotes, will be taken to mean People-from-Portugal and People-from-Brazil)</dd>

<dd>I think that the problem User#1 perceives rests mostly on the URL: pt.wikipedia.org.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Online, just like you expect ".uk" sites to be in the Queen's English and ".aus" sites to favour Australian speech, you assume returns located at ".pt" URLs to be written in 'Portuguese', and those stationed at ".br" to be in 'Brazilian' - thus allowing you to make your choice of what to read.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>'Portuguese' and 'Brazilian' are, indeed, very different languages - not like UK-English and US-English are different, but rather like Strine differs from UK-English differ, or Ebonics differs from US-English. Neither is "better" or "superior" or "more correct": they simply have different grammatical rules and vocabularies - 'Brazilian' breaks many rules in the 'Portuguese' grammar and I assume that 'Portuguese', likewise, breaks many rules in the 'Brazilian' grammar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A 'Portuguese' speaker will look at an article written in 'Brazilian' and find spelling or verb-tense "mistakes" which, in 'Portuguese', are unacceptable at Primary School level, and attempt to "correct" them. The same will happen to a 'Brazilian' speaker reading a 'Portuguese' article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, where vocabulary is concerned, hundreds of 'Brazilian' words are unknown/unacceptable in 'Portuguese', and vice-versa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These facts, taken together, just lead to misunderstandings and to the feeling that you are reading a terribly badly-written article, if it's not in the version of the language you were taught.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, it would be good form to have pt.wikipedia for the 'Portuguese' language and br.wikipedia for the 'Brazilian' language, as is the norm in the great majority of websites in the language in general.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>(Im/Partiality: Though I'm a native Portuguese-English speaker, I never use the current pt.wikipedia, much less edit it. One of the reasons I always prefer the English article over the Portuguese article is the fact that, yes, it is very hard to read an article which is not in "my version" of the Portuguese language.) 83.132.98.35 16:22, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I would like to add that, although all users have the right to their opinion, the rules for the community state that "if an article is initially written in one version, unless major changes (50%) are made by someone speaking the other version, the original version must be kept". And, being Portuguese, I find Brazilian Portuguese "ugly", but one must remember the other way around. I refuse to write in Brazilian Portuguese (or should I say, I don't know how to!), but if I contribute to a Brazilian-Portuguese article, I'm counting that someone will change it for me. The same way I'll change Brazilian-&gt;European in a European Portuguese Article.</dd>
<dd>As for little children, it's a false issue. If they can read SMS-Portuguese language, they can perfectly read the alternate version of Portuguese. What we (grown-ups) are afraid to say, but really think, is that we are afraid our children will not learn the version we consider "correct... <a href="../../../m/u/u/User%7EMuukalainen_05bd.html" title="User:Muukalainen">Muukalainen</a> 12:46, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I decided to return to this matter<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Wareware/Evidence" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Wareware/Evidence" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> just to say how incredibly tacky and incompetent the Arb Com's handling of this matter has been. I found out that this matter had been dropped (who knows when) after inquiring about it on someone's talk page. I received absolutely no notice. And, to date, neither, apparently, has <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareware_de22.html" title="User:Wareware">User:Wareware</a>. This has been a colossal waste of my time and of the people who were kind and concerned enough to render assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, the Arb Com dropped the ball -- in more ways than one. At least you didn't require me to reformat the copious info presented in the RfC for this process. The singular good thing is Pharlap's wasted time and effort in compiling an utterly meaningless assemblage of completely unrelated and, again, out-of-context bullcrap -- as if my comments anywhere on this website have anything at all to do with the racist Wareware's Tourette's-like comportment.</p>

<p>Don't be presumptuous and patronizing -- especially when you don't know what you're talking about. I don't need to be schooled on the function of the Arb Com. The Arb Com voted, then served notice that it was considering the case and asked for submissions of evidence, <i>knowing full well</i> that Wareware was no longer around. When it suddenly reversed itself, <i>it notified no one</i>. The Arb Com in this matter was incompetent and inefficient and lacking in the most rudimentary common courtesy.

<dd>Frankly, I could care less. We're here to deal with users who continue to interfere with the writing of an encyclopedia. Wareware had ceased to do that by ceasing to edit Wikipedia, thus we have no reason to continue to intervene.

<p>Uh, I think you mean you <i>couldn't</i> care less?&#160;:p Well, my dear, that much is evident in the Arb Com's <b>tacky</b> mishandling of the matter -- which is precisely my point. LOL Incompent. Rude. Inefficient. Worthless. Further, calling the Arb Com on its gross mishandling of this matter is hardly on par with stalking someone around the web site, spewing vile, racist venom.

<p>Jimbo has always and will indefinitely be the person to appoint people to the ArbCom. The difference between a regular election and an interim appointment is that people he appoints based on a regular election serve for 3 years while those he appoints for interim posts serve until the next regular election. For these interim posts he asked the current ArbCom who we thought were good choices and he said that he will base his selection on the short list we gave him. He does not, nor ever has, had to go exactly by what either the community at large or the ArbCom says. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 23:41, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Queen of the United Kingdom has the power to dissolve Parliament, yet in practice only does so when asked by the Prime Minister, IIRC. Jimbo has yet to not follow the suggestions of others in that mold. My point is that the whole ArbCom process is an extension of his authority and exists at his consent. All we are talking about are several interim appointments; none of which will last beyond the next regular election. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 16:20, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Without wanting to stretch analogies too much, when MPs resign the Queen doesn't ask the remaining MPs who should fill the gaps... an election is held. Yes Jimbo is boss, but the ArbCom will lose credibility because of this. I think he went the wrong way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead it would've been highly appropriate to hold an election, learning from the experiences of last time, and re-jigging the future election calendar as needed. However it was not possible for me to even make this suggestion in a timely fashion because the "elections cause too many problems" argument (the same argument as that used in 1930s Germany btw&#160;:-), oops Mr Godwin do I lose?&#160;:-) ) was made behind closed doors. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 17:26, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ombudsman?</span></h2>
<p>Above it is said that being on the ArbCom is a thankless task. That there will always be complaints. But then this fact is used to seemingly say that all complaints are without merit. Just because some (or many) are without merit does not mean that all are. Yet the ArbCom seemingly never admits it is wrong or that it has made a mistake. It seems to be under the misaprehension that admitting a mistake is a sign of weakness. To the contrary. I think the ArbCom as often as not makes Wikipedia look silly. I also think that the existence of the ArbCom allows for some vexatious complaints. I am not sure what the solution is but a tentative suggestion is the appointment of an ombudsman who will be tasked with ensuring that the ArbCom is <b>seen</b> to act reasonably. Appearances count and it all looks a sorry mess right now. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 00:37, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New arbitrators</span></h2>
<p>Jimbo recently appointed three new arbitrators, of whom two are rather controversial. Jay's many battles and controversies, as well as his aggressive attitude (he's gotten into attacking me on about a weekly basis now) are presumably well-known by all of us reading here (forcing me to regrettably conclude that Jimbo knowingly did not make a fair judgment in promoting him, although I won't presume to guess exactly what his motive was). Right now I want to point out something about the new arbitrator Fennec. I think most of us would agree that an arbitrator should be an active editor and member of the community. A good way of evaluating this is by looking at one's user contributions. I went to Fennec's contributions just now to check out what he had been up to lately, and was surprised to find there was nothing for me evaluate: in the whole month of July so far, he has made only one edit. In previous months he has edited a little more, maybe 10-15 a month, although I would say this puts him only on the level of a sporadic, occasional contributor, not an active member of the community. (See his contributions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Fennec" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Fennec" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) Now, of course Fennec is active on IRC, which he rules as something like a fiefdom, banning people (or at least me—am I a special case?) perpetually for criticizing certain privileged (in his eyes) users. But does this count? In fact, for me this counts against him; it tells me that he probably owes his position to behind the scenes IRC communication rather than actual wiki-editing. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:27, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, please do a little research before you attack people. The main reason why Fennec's name was raised is because he came so close to being elected in December. He lost to Grunt by one vote - and that was because, IIRC, he voted for Grunt. This was the reason his name was raised - not because of IRC, where he rarely even talks. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:24, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I remember the election perfectly well. In fact, I myself was a candidate. If this is just about votes, why don't we have another vote? Or we should go straight down the line and appoint the next two, who were Mirv and Cecropia. I thought the idea was that uncontroversial people were supposed to be appointed as placeholders until the next election. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:08, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He has also, in the announcement, stated that his appointment of (temporary) arbitrators has more to do with his favouring of their judgements in preference to those that might be made by editors such as <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">User:Mirv</a> (the next in line in the prior election).</p>

<dd>The above is total conjecture from someone who has no facts to base it on, mixed with a total mischaracterization of Jimbo's statement. The arbitration committee made a short list of people we thought would make good arbitrators (based on our previous experiences with them), and Jimbo took our recommendation and appointed arbitrators from our short list. So no, he did not appoint them because he is friends with them; as Jimbo put it so succintly, he appointed them because we told him we think they would make good arbitrators (and he trust our judgement). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 22:44, August 4, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I am yet another user unhappy with the democratic process not being used here. Since Fennec was one vote away from being elected, and James F. was one of the top vote-getters as well, I don't have a problem with them being appointed - in fact, I think they're both fine contributors and that's why so many people voted for them. On the other hand Jayjg received no votes. As opposed to Fennec and James F., in Jayjg's case the elections were ignored. The reasons for his appointment are shrouded in mystification, as is the process by which it was decided, and people questioning it here are attacked.</p>
<p>For my own sanity I generally avoid pages having to do with Palestine/Israel, but on my occassional forays into that morass, I have become aware of Jayjg's POV-pushing on Palestine-related pages. It's obvious to me (and looking at the above comments, obviously others) that he is going to be a lousy arbitrator. A better wiki would have stuck to the democratic process. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 22:08, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>"Hm? Did he use any admin powers?"</b> Not this time, not <i>yet</i> anyhow, but just give him time: In the past he has blocked at least one person for no reason, referring to NCdave, whose edits were passionate but usually not POV and not inaccurate. Further, when an admin edits and makes questionable edits, the "intimidation" factor is present. That is why those in authority are generally held to a higher standard. Lastly, even if his abuses were merely "editor" abuses, and not of admin powers, that is inexcusable. For example, another editor has complained about his hit-and-run edits, in which he just comes in and -without concensus or discussion -edits. I don't have the diff handy, but I might be able to find it if I searched hours and hours. The point, however, is this: If he abuses editor powers, he would abuse admin powers too. I feel bad that I don't have Duckecho's diff handy, where he too complained about Neutrality, but Neutrality has been here long enough that we can see that he sometimes edits as a "Lone Ranger" and without concensus or discussion, so my point stands or falls on its own merits -not the merits of another diff, which I can't find at the moment.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonWattsDotCom_7788.html" title="User:GordonWattsDotCom">GordonWattsDotCom</a> 10:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suffrage</span></h2>
<p>I feel that suffrage in these elections are rather arbitrary, as a person could be both a long-term member and have substantial quantities of edits without being a good Wikipedian, while a rather new but obviously dedicated user is an upstanding Wikipedian who is being prevented from voting by qualifications that don't reflect their dedication to Wikipedia. As to edit-count, I would think a more proportional standard applied to their time registered would be appropriate. Additionally, a measurement of how often a person's edits are reverted could be a qualifier. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeggysmeg_7532.html" title="User:Smeggysmeg">Smeggysmeg</a> 05:01, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Musical Linguist's response to accusations against her</span></h3>
<p>This page is on my watchlist, and when I read the beginning of his post, I was actually going to offer to upload evidence for him, if he had browser problems. Then I saw that his post was about me!!!</p>
<p>The diff that EffK supplies show that I made two additions to the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_EffK_Evidence_309f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/EffK/Evidence">evidence</a> page of his RfAr. My edit summary says: <i>Is there a software bug? Last post "ate up" two previous ones! (That happened to me too recently.)</i></p>
<p>Occasionally a wikipedian, while making a post to a talk page, deletes something added by a previous contributor. The deleted post could be a personal attack, a rant, a strong piece of POV pushing, or a completely off-topic post. Such deletions are, in my opinion, sometimes warranted, sometimes not. Such removals often cause offense.</p>
<p>It can also happen that someone edits a talk page, and as well as the addition he has made, there is a deletion of a previous post from another contributor, or even from more than one. This happens completely against the intention of the editor, and there is no "edit conflict" warning. Sometimes the posts that get deleted were made several hours before. I have no idea why this happens, but have sometimes seen people getting very indignant because they think that another editor deleted their post <i>on purpose</i>.</p>
<p>In adding a comment to a talk page, <i>I</i> recently wiped out the post of the previous editor.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Ed_Poor&amp;diff=33649725&amp;oldid=33649468#Protected" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Ed_Poor&amp;diff=33649725&amp;oldid=33649468#Protected" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> I don't know how it happened. Luckily, the editor who came after me <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumed good faith</a> and just restored it without comment. More recently, Str1977 accidentally wiped out two posts while making his own. When it was drawn to his attention,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Str1977&amp;diff=34640784&amp;oldid=34516589" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Str1977&amp;diff=34640784&amp;oldid=34516589" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> he apologized and restored them.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abortion&amp;diff=34641698&amp;oldid=34640472" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abortion&amp;diff=34641698&amp;oldid=34640472" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<p>A <i>very</i> brief look will show immediately that Robert McClenon added the words: <i>This post and others also show that he was not "forced to abandon" Wikipedia</i> at 20:37 on 10 January; that EffK added evidence for 30 August 2005 at 10:18 on 11 January; that Str1977 added to his own 10 January 2006 evidence seventeen minutes later at 10:35; that the two previous edits got swallowed up at the same time; and that I restored those deleted edits at 10:49, <i><b>with no additions of my own</b></i> and with an edit summary commenting on the fact that they had probably been deleted through a software bug.</p>
<p>To reply to each of EffK's accusations:</p>
<ol>
<li>I did not use any administrator's powers in making that edit.</li>
<li>My edit was made in good faith, as I was trying to undo the result of a software glitch, and was also trying to spare Str1977 a possible accusation of having wiped out the posts on purpose.</li>
<li>I made no attempt to insert my own evidence, although to do so is not prohibited, and although I do have diffs that show EffK being less than civil to me, including one where, editing while not logged in, he seems to compare my promotion to adminship to Hitler's rise to power.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EffK&amp;diff=30003925&amp;oldid=30003558" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EffK&amp;diff=30003925&amp;oldid=30003558" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> I merely readded Robert McClenon's evidence <i><b>and EffK's own evidence</b></i> (which I think he should have noticed before making his latest accusation).</li>
<li>There is nothing dishonest in my edit summary. Perhaps I could have been a little clearer and stated that <i><b>I was restoring</b></i> these two edits. But I assumed that it was sufficient, while reinserting them, simply to state that they had been deleted.</li>
<li>I can't comment on the "cabal membership" statement, as I have no idea what he is talking about.</li>
<li>I do not have a "propensity for bad faith attack upon EffK". I have never made any kind of attack on him; nor have I felt any wish to do so. I have reverted some of his editing, though not frequently; and, at a time when I was extremely busy with college work, I have taken a lot of time to respond to his concerns, possibly adding to his frustration, which I regret. I am not involved in this case, other than that I was a witness some months ago to the way he filled up the Benedict XVI talk page with several extremely long posts which had nothing to do with editing the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>EffK, you have made utterly false accusations of abuse of administratorship and dishonest edit summary, among other things. You have also taken up over half an hour of my time in responding (and you may note from my user page and talk page that I am very busy at the moment and am trying to contribute less to Wikipedia until the end of the month). I will, nevertheless, accept your apology if you choose to make one, and continue to wish you well, regardless. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:42, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">EffK answer to Musical Linguist Protestations</span></h3>
<p>Yes indeed, you <i>should</i> have been more careful to show that you had not written that of McClenon's, but it appeared that you had. Your name was up as the editor of the diff. I can hardly be blamed for seeing your statement as your statement. And, Yes, you have shown bad faith by joining in attack on me at his earlier Rfc, another Straw man attack to deflect from the sourced truth. You were in bad faith in estimating that I have a personal grudge against this Church. And You remain in bad faith for never answering your reduction of 30 odd priests to one or was it zero in the Ferns Scandal, and you remain in bad faith in not accounting for your removal(as my POV/error) of the scandalous Irish government deal struck with the Church for 100 million(now 900 in costs to them), and you remain in bad faith for removing the <i>priestly rebellion</i>, after one priest went public.By demanding source after the entire was in the media, you are denying my good faith and provoking further identification of my whereabouts. You answered jesuitically concerning the papal secrecy clause, and distorted or removed NPOV I used to balance a disgusting Article. I also remind you that you came as close to blackmailing-setting a condition for <b>your</b> answering re that Sex Abuse as it was possible to approach. You made me apologise to a massive over-reaction in the example of Str1977 German forebear. I did not say that his forebear tried to kill mine, and succeeded, actually, I said he might have had some centre party Connection, as some motive for Str1977 protecting the Centre Article, and his over-reaction(typically Strawman) to contemporary widespread german political memory and shame. I do still believe that Str1977 must have a political connection to the early party, or to the present little new Centre party factions rearing their heads in Germany now. I <i>had</i> to accede to that pressure, but you didn't keep to your bargain, and complete your answer at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_sex_abuse_scandal_2830.html" title="Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal">Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal</a>.</p>
<p>I believe if I had to I could show several assumption of bad faith edits, aimed at Strawman demolition of verifiable source. You have consistently assumed my bad faith, and Str1977's veracity, and gone and chosen not to accept asny conditioning of this your this response through my sourced justifications at many nercessary discussions, therefore I do not accept your denial of knowledge of the <b>denialist clerical revisionism cabal</b>. You have voluntarily assisted the cabal many times despite my good faith verifiability, and this effort of yours in Evidence shows you are still partisan and willing to be so, <b>or you should have said in the diff-tag that you had been requested to assist</b>. If you are completely naive, then I truly am sorry, for you, for my assumption of intelligence, and for Wikipedia being so populated. I will show diffs here if you desire.</p>
<p>I will clearly accept that I jumped to a natural conclusion that you wrote that which you were visible as writing. I believe all the rest shows me your bias and poor faith,preceding your <i>Adminship</i>which I regret you and your friends displaying. I therefore make no personal attack in recognising bias through assumption of bad faith. As you know I asked repeatedly for you to account for your removals. You should not have joined with the others in the cabal, and you are wrong in so helping Str1977 at this trial and everywhere, and you should not say you know nothing of Hitler and then show otherwise by minutiae corrections and voting off clearly verifiable material from Wikipedia. You should not whitewash the sex Abuse page, and you should still explain what gives you the right to display bad faith to me in qualifying my contribution as no more than POV/unsourced ill-written error . Apart from all that- I do not and did not look for you to join in the bad faith attack made on my integrity, and I suggest to you that, if I remain here, which is dependant on a guilt being cast at your fellow catholic-biased editors, that you will be able to renew your un-biased capacities by distancing yourself from such faith-based editing policy. Go back and undo the damage you mischievously made at Sex Abuse, badly tagged, and never accounted for. <b>Do not abuse my intentions by stating even to me that I am an anti-catholic.</b> I assert that the papacy , as sourced, did what it did, and the logic is that it was hypocrisy. Logic is universal, not mine alone, actually. I source my contentions, and you and your friends rubbish this source against WP principles. As to your waste of half an hour- You have contributed to my waste of <i>more than half a year</i>, and against clear Wikipedia principle of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. In being so against this principle and the assumption of good faith, you have joined in cabal wrong. Apart from that I am sorry, and now I equally list this under your response at my Trial.</p>
<p>I note that you thus far do <b>not</b> wish to enter the Evidence pages- even though you know that I have now used up my permitted defensive diff-count, and therefor you have a virtual open-goal. Considering your previous eagerness to combine against me on all VfD's and RfC, and generally, this is inconsistant. I itemised my witness to your bias at your vote for Administrator, and it still holds several truths. I would say to all rational persons at Wikipedia that you Musical Linguist are a part of their faith revisionism problem, if Wikipedia is to become a respectable source.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Requesting assistance with a Wiki Admin</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I am requesting help with a particular admin here that has stated I could be banned for what my personal position is on discussing matters with other Wikipedians. For some background information and I also want to clearly state my problem. I joined Wikipedia in December of 2005 in response to the actions taken concerning the wiki article "wehatetech" or "we hate tech." The article has been pulled several times and I do understand that once it's voted on somehow, not exactly clear on that, it's removed from the encyclopedia. I am NOT here to fight for that particular article. i understand that there is a guideline for articles, BUT my observation and opinion is that the rules were not followed properly in the process of deletion. Why am I still here? Well, in a nutshell, I have seen people removed from the site or blocked for various reasons I also do not agree with, but it up to those individual people to address their removal. I decided to stay in order to provide constructive criticism of the deletion process and to add another viewpoint to the issue. I feel improperly judged, reading from responses to my post, a "one issue candidate" and have been threatened with removal from the site, being a sock-puppet for "we hate tech" and accused of "cluttering" talk pages.</p>
<p>My purpose is not to clutter the site or be on any type of mission to tear down Wikipedia. I wish to understand why certain things happen here and hope to add thoughtful insight and more information to topics in order to resolve an issue. I do feel like I am being pushed around and generally really upset with the whole process with a select group of individuals either working behind the scenes or posting on my talk page. Two Wikipedians have stood out in this whole situation, <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">User:Haikupoet</a> and admin <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>. I have had several exchanges with both, with Haikupoet moving one comment and then deleting my response to because I was under the impression that it was deleted. My response comment was then deleted, which resulted in the blocking User:Xerves. The block happened due to a supposed "legal threat" by "Zoe" which has now threatened me with the same. It's not MY forum I am promoting. I am a member of such forum and website <a href="http://www.wehatetech.com" class="external free" title="http://www.wehatetech.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wehatetech.com</a> and I am NOT trying to promote in the first place.</p>
<p>I AM promoting that fellow Wikipedians discuss issues and not stomp over other postings by others. I am being totally honest and upfront. I do not have a hidden agenda. Have I been totally innocent? No, there are two comments / edits on my behalf that broke regulation. i was dealt with in a proper manner by those admins and I am thankful for that. If further investigation yields that I be removed from Wikipedia then so be it, as long as I am adequately told as to such infractions. i only wish to resolve this issue. i have deleted none of my post and will not edit any of my post to make myself appear in a different light. Everything is available through my user history.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">e-mails on active list?</span></h2>
<p>Hello, Arbcom. What would you think, on the main arbcom page, of having, instead of or in addition to those (somewhat confusing) e-mail addresses (member at whatever.com), something like this: <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Chick_Bowen_e7cf.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Chick Bowen">e-mail this arbitrator</a>. It looks better, it's actually marginally <i>more</i> spam-proof, and in my view it would be easier to use. If you're interested, I'm happy to add or switch them myself.

<p>Kelly Martin resigned. A logged in user, and then an anon-IP, changed the text to say that Kelly Martin either was unelected or resigned "during an unsuccessful reelection bid".

<dd>Well, then, I would like to ask the ArbCom for CheckUser access, because I would like to get involved in the community at large rather than the relatively small area I contribute in now. I have had extensive experience as a board moderator, so I know the IP tracing and identification process, as well as what is valid as similar IP and what is not. Therefore, however slim the chance may be, I would like to be considered for CheckUser.
