<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Candidate_statements_Jayjg_5505.html" title="Edit section: Jayjg">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a></span></h2>
<p>I'm <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>. I joined Wikipedia on June 15, 2004, was made an administrator on September 13, 2004, and in July of 2005 Jimmy Wales appointed me to the Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee. I'm a pretty active Wikipedia editor, having made over 30,000 edits.</p>
<p>I believe the Arbitration Committee is an unfortunate, but necessary, last step in Wikipedia's dispute resolution process. In the past I've felt and raised concerns about the effectiveness of all of the formal dispute resolution mechanisms (including mediation, RfC, and RfAr). RfAr in particular has suffered from slowness (mostly related, I believe, to having far too many inactive members), and from decisions that tended to be too narrow to be effective (e.g. prescribing remedies on one specific article, when the issue is an editor's behaviour in general). I think it's important for Arbitrators to keep in mind that our primary and ultimate goal here is to create a great encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I have found the Arbitration process itself quite interesting, but extremely time consuming; reading through the evidence on a single case can take many hours. I've been actively involved in almost all cases started after my appointment to the committee; in addition to regular involvement in votes on whether to accept or reject case, and regular contributions to the Arbitration Committee mail-list, I've also worked on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Skyring_59ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Skyring">Skyring</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Alfrem_a348.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Alfrem">Alfrem</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gabrielsimon_4cc5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gabrielsimon">Gabrielsimon</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Ed_Poor_1936.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_AI_83d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AI">AI</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Coolcat%2C_Davenbelle_and_Stereotek_6f6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Coolcat, Davenbelle and Stereotek">Coolcat, Davenbelle and Stereotek</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rktect_7993.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rktect">Rktect</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rainbowwarrior1977_bc96.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rainbowwarrior1977">Rainbowwarrior1977</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_DotSix_7f62.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/DotSix">DotSix</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Keetoowah_adf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Keetoowah">Keetowah</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Onefortyone_2ebd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_BigDaddy777_3c45.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/BigDaddy777">BigDaddy777</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Everyking_3_84a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Everyking 3">Everyking 3</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Regarding_The_Bogdanov_Affair_d765.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Regarding The Bogdanov Affair">Regarding The Bogdanov Affair</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_jguk_2_e705.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/jguk 2">jguk 2</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Louis_Epstein_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Louis Epstein">Louis Epstein</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_REX_1206.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/REX">REX</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Polygamy_24f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Polygamy">Polygamy</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Stevertigo_95d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Stevertigo">Stevertigo</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Lightbringer_ca8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lightbringer">Lightbringer</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Maoririder_42e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Maoririder">Maoririder</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rex071404_4_a94b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rex071404 4">Rex071404 4</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Silverback_e316.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Silverback">Silverback</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Ultramarine_b82c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> cases.

<p>Jayjg, my compliments on your hard ArbCom work so far. I would like to hear your views on one matter in particular, in extension of MPerel's question above. I recently came accross <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_Raul%27s_laws_b426.html" title="User:Raul654/Raul's laws">Raul654's Laws of Wikipedia</a>. On this interesting page Mark makes some incisive observations about the dynamics of the Wikipedia community. Of particular interest is the first law:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Much of Wikipedia's content, and all of the day to day functions are overseen by a small core of the most dedicated contributors. These users are the most valuable resource Wikipedia has.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Corollary - Of these highly dedicated users who have left, the vast majority left as a result of trolls, vandals, and/or POV warriors - typically not as a result of any one particular user, but from the combined stress of dealing with many of them. Consequently, such problem users should be viewed as Wikipedia's biggest handicap.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe it is the view of many users that a well-functioning conflict resolution process on Wikipedia is still miles away. For example, there is no moderation of note on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">requests for comment</a>, allowing cases to sizzle for weeks until they die out without clear resolution or consensus.</p>
<p>Having worked on various controversial articles in my areas of expertise I can understand why some dedicated users burn out or depart in exasperation. What measures do you think should be taken to streamline dispute resolution? Do you think it is time for the ArbCom to pass verdicts on NPOV disagreements to stop disruptive edit wars? What role does the ArbCom have in protecting the "highly dedicated users" Raul654 describes? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:14, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said in my candidate statement, I see the weaknesses in Wikipedia's dispute resolution mechanisms as a serious issue, which is why I think it's so important to have a functioning Arbitration Committee. Raul654 is quite right: many "highly dedicated" (and I might add, highly contributing) editors have been driven away by trolls, vandals, and POV warriors. That said, I still don't think the correct solution is for the Arbitration Committee to get into content disputes, which often require expert knowledge to resolve properly. Rather, I think Wikipedia has a set of content policies (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) and guidelines (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>), and behaviour policies (<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>) and guidelines (<a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>) which, when adhered to, make it extremely difficult for disruptive editors to have their way. Nevertheless, for editors who refuse to abide by these policies and guidelines, yet are smart enough to avoid being pure vandals or so outrageously disruptive that they are banned by community consensus, there must be a highly functional Arbitration Committee, which can examine these issues and rapidly and accurately rule on them, in order to ensure that policy is respected. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:04, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you, Jay. Would you support ArbCom-appointed mediators with an expertise in debated subjects to provide mediation as an ArbCom proxy in situations of content dispute? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 01:33, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been intermittently involved in discussions about how one could go about ensuring accurate content. As it stands, I have concerns about this idea's practical usefulness. Wikipedia has hundreds of thousands of articles, certainly tens of thousands of areas of "expert knowledge" - how would one go about finding and appointing experts in each area? How would one ensure that they really were experts, and unbiased (experts can often be biased as well)? And, even if they weren't biased, how would you assess the inevitable complaints from holders of minority views that the experts were biased? Other encyclopedias deal with this issue by simply appointing an expert to write an article; given that we are not going to follow that route, I think it is more practical to simply insist on adherence to our content policies (e.g <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) and guidelines. It might be easier to create a committee which ensured adherence to those policies, and that committee would not necessarily need to be made up of experts in the specific subject areas. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:33, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my experience, the policies generally don't contradict one another; rather, they tend to support each other, and, as a whole, are an excellent foundation upon which a great encyclopedia can be built.

<p>Hi Jay, you edit some of the most contentious articles on Wikipedia: those about the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab-Israeli_conflict_ff03.html" title="Arab-Israeli conflict">Arab-Israeli conflict</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>, <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, and related areas. This means you’re used to dealing with conflict, because the nationalist, pro-Israeli editors feel their POV is under-represented, while the pro-Palestinian editors look at the same article but see the opposite, so neither "side" is ever happy and you’re stuck in the middle. Then there are the trolls and disruptive editors, who focus on you because you stand up to them.</p>
<p>Can you say something about whether your experiences have helped you understand how to handle conflict, and how that understanding would help the arbitration committee and the community if you were elected? Can you also say what it feels like to have to constantly fend off the trolls and the bad-faith users, because it’s clear that some of them target you, even to the extent of trying to turn this page into yet another platform for their attacks. We’ve had a spate of good editors leave recently because of the stress of dealing with disruptive editors, but you’re still here: do the attacks upset you, and if they do, what keeps you going? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:01, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In answer to your questions:</dd>
<dd>1) Have your experiences "helped you to understand how to handle conflict"?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely. What it has taught me more than anything is how important Wikipedia's policies are. I've never seen a dispute that didn't resolve itself when everyone started editing in accordance with the policies, or wouldn't have been resolved had everyone done so. That's why the work of the Arbitration Committee is so important, because it's there to uphold policy, and the policies are the only things that ensure that Wikipedia doesn't turn into a POV rant or personal blog. Sometimes, when there has been a lot of emotion on a page, and there always is when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict, there's a sense of relief all round when people start applying the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policies. The editors on each side start to respect each other, even if they’ve been fighting hard; they start to read and evaluate each other's sources instead of letting everything get personal, so the whole experience becomes more intellectual and more enjoyable. I've seen sworn enemies develop long-term mutual respect after editing experiences like that - it's actually quite moving. And then just as everything settles down, a new editor arrives on the page, and it all starts up again.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:15, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) "How that understanding would help the arbitration committee and the community if you were elected?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have a solid understanding of our policies. I would continue to enforce them rigorously and continue to be even-handed in doing so. People have asked whether I could do that fairly in disputes involving the Arab-Israeli conflict and the answer is definitely yes, because so long as the policies are applied, they almost always suggest their own answers. But having said that, one must use common sense as well. I'm not afraid to support stern remedies for bad-faith editors who are trolling and wikilawyering. I have made more edits than any other Arbitration Committee member, and I edit in areas of Wikipedia that attract passion and controversy. I feel I have the experience and maturity to be able to tell the difference between the editors who care about Wikipedia but might have been goaded into making an error, and the ones who are essentially troublemakers who contribute little or nothing to the project. I'd try to make sure that common sense always wins the day, and what that means in practical terms is that if you appear before the arbitration committee with good intentions, a history of good edits, and are open and honest, you'll find that I'm likely to give you the benefit of the doubt, even if you've made some mistakes. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:25, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia currently has sufficient resources and policies to deal with vandals and blatant trolls. However, there exists a population of users who may act uncivil and "trollish", but also contribute positively (to varying degrees) to Wikipedia. These users may obey the letter of policies, but excel at violating the spirit of them (i.e. "<i>If a policy doesn't specifically prohibit an action, I can do it.</i>") Often, these "semi-trolls" can take an immense amount of time and effort to deal with (by admins and other users). Without discussing any specific cases, how do you think the ArbCom should handle these users? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:33, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right; in fact, this is often what the Committee ends up having to deal with, "grey area" editors, who are not quite disruptive enough to get banned by community consensus, yet sufficiently disruptive that other editors eventually feel it is worth the effort (and risks) involved in taking them to Arbitration. In the past the Arbitration Committee's remedies have tended to be fairly restricted in their scope, focussing on a single article, or perhaps a single subject; subsequent to the ruling, the individuals have simply switched their attention to some other article or area, and it all starts again. Recognizing this, I have been working hard to ensure that the Committee focuses on general behaviour, and crafts broad enough remedies that the behaviour itself ceases, so that other editors are not constantly running into this problem, wasting more time, getting more frustrated, etc. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:36, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you believe that activities by editors outside of Wikipedia are relevant to a determination of whether a given user is a disruptive Wikiuser or "troll"? Should those activities be monitored, and if so by whom? Could you please comment on the banning of User:Amalekite in this context, and any infractions committed by that particular user within Wikipedia. Also, could you cite an example of where you have ever disagreed with your fellow candidate <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">User:Jpgordon</a> on what to do with a problem editor?<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 07:38, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bdell555, it appears from your questions that you might be labouring under the misapprehension that User:Amalekite was banned for disruption or trolling. In fact, as I understand it, he was banned based on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Personal_attacks_which_place_users_in_danger" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy#Personal attacks which place users in danger</a>, which specifically includes "actions outside the Wikipedia site".

<dl>
<dd>Just to look more closely at your interpretation and endorsement of the "Personal attacks which place users in danger" policy, it appears that this Amalekite person simply listed a number of persons, identified by their Wikiuser IDs, as being, in his opinion, biased. Could you elaborate on how that placed the identified users "in danger". In this context, I should confess that in the past I have identified some Wikiusers as being both Polish and biased (against those who make claims about Polish history that place that country in an unfavourable light).

<p><i>Q: How old are you and what do you do? (If student, please state what subjects you are studying.)</i></p>
<p>A: I'm in my forties and work in management.</p>
<p><i>Q: How many hours a month do you think you will need to be a good Arbitrator and are you really willing to put in the time?</i></p>
<p>A: I'd be willing to put in around 40 hours a month. There's a need for candidates able to put in the time to help craft the actual decisions, and I'd like to be part of that process, so I'd put in more time as the need arose.</p>
<p><i>Q: If chosen, you will need to arbitrate on disputes arising from the creation or revision of articles. Experience of creating and revising articles yourself, particularly where it has involved collaboration, is very valuable in understanding the mindset of disputants who come to arbitration. With reference to your own edits in the main article namespace, please demonstrate why you think you have the right experience to be a good arbitrator.</i></p>
<p>A: I edit in high-conflict areas, and as I've said above, having a thorough knowledge of policy is the best way to resolve conflict, and I have that. I've also developed a good sense of when an editor is acting in good faith and when not, and that experience has already helped my work with the Arbitration Committee.</p>

<li>Well, in some ways, as trusted and long-term editors, they are held to a higher standard. In other ways, if they have made significant contributions to the project, they are perhaps sometimes given more of the benefit of the doubt. I think it tends to even out.</li>

<ol>
<li>I think desysopping is an appropriate remedy (not penalty) when an administrator seriously abuses his or her administrative privileges. Of course, that editor can re-apply for administrator status, and can regain it if the community gives him or her their trust once again.</li>
<li>Admins should always be careful to follow policy, and should be able to justify their actions within policy. Of course, one longstanding philosophy on Wikipedia is "Ignore all rules", policies can be tricky to interpret in grey areas, and applying common sense is also critical, so there is some leeway. Ultimately it is up to the Arbitration Committee to distinguish between actions which are violations of policy and actions which are not.</li>

<p>Expanding on your second point, take the protection policy as an example. It states that protection is never supposed to favor any particular version, unless one is vandalism, and should never be used when the admin is involved in editing the page. If an admin thought that an addition to a page was patently ridiculous, removed it, and threatened to protect the page if it was restored, what would you say? —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 01:51, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I don't want to "try" a case here without knowing all the facts. In general an admin should never protect a page in which he or she is involved in a content dispute, nor threaten to do so. That said, there might be specific circumstances in which this action might be more reasonable; for example, if the material being included is blatant vandalism (e.g. "Mark eats poop"), or could damage Wikipedia in some way (perhaps by being libellous, or by placing undue demands on the physical infrastructure). The plain fact is, if policy was 100% clear to all readers, and could be applied blindly in all cases, then we wouldn't need an Arbitration Committee. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:51, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In particular, I feel that these templates are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> when it comes for how we treat our fellow wikipedians. There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:41, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am quite concerned about that. To begin with, any template which does, in fact, violate policy is an area for concern, and in particular I'm against anything which promotes bias, bigotry, or hatred. Divisiveness in general is bad, as it detracts from editing collaboratively and collegially, and we should try to avoid anything which factionalizes Wikipedians.</dd>
<dd>The issue of user pages is complex, because Wikipedia allows a lot of leeway in their contents. Nonetheless, they are Wikipedia content, and may even give the impression of being something official. While it's a nice idea to use your userpage to tell people a little about yourself (assuming you want to), userpages should not be platforms for attacking individuals or groups.</dd>
<dd>As for the Arbitration Committee's role, the answer is always pretty much the same; examine the incident(s) in question, review policy, and apply common sense. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:39, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
