<p>I've performed the following change (shown in bold):</p>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, no clerk should have anything to do with a case in which he or she is a participant, except to the extent that he or she participates as a participant. Clerks who wish to make a statement in a case, or provide evidence, must refrain from acting as a clerk with respect to that case. <b>This does not prejudice his right to perform cosmetic refactoring of evidence and workshop pages, as is the right of any editor.</b> In unclear situations, the head clerk or the Arbitration Committee should be consulted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Editors, whether participants or not, can reorganize evidence and workshop pages. An editor should not be forbidden to carry out such cosmetic tasks simply because he is both a participant in the case and a clerk. So if X is involved in a case and as a clerk cannot act as a clerk, this doesn't stop him, say, renumbering proposed findings of fact in the workshop, or changing links in an evidence page to correct diff links. Such editing should always be done with care, whoever does it. . --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:47, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The new template looks nice but since it seems to linebreak after each usage (can't be used directly next to a previous one) so it's screwing up the currentasks template, I'm sure there's an easy way to fix it so it allows one to be placed next to another so that it works correctly but I don't know how. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 23:40, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would certainly hope that any clerk would automatically recuse themselves in such a situation. Unfortunately it appears that Johnleemk is clerking a case in which he has presented evidence. I'd encourage The Mighty Clerks Office to find Another Clerk for that case. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hm. That is bad-looking. I passed up that case due to past conflicts with Ruy Lopez on the 2004 Election Controversy cesspools, so I assumed he would as well if he's presenting evidence.

<dd>He presented evidence before being named as a clerk. But again, why are we debating this point instead of taking the straightforward, good faith approach of asking him? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:41, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just asked him, but his userpage indicates a lack of internet at present. I'm inclined to think also that the presentation of fresh evidence is not part of a clerks job; they're not detectives after all. (They can present fresh evidence of course, but should then recuse as a clerk.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, the clarification of unclear evidence and spotty evidence seems an important part of the job. After all, the arbcom is not a game to be won by whoever is most adept at presenting evidence. If there's something massive that the evidence page is obscuring, part of the task of the clerks is to make it clear to the arbcom. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:48, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say if you're presenting evidence you're involved in (as I am in KDRgibby) you should recuse, but thats me.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 23:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. To my mind, our recusal standards are the same as the arbcom's, and certainly nobody would fault the arbcom for looking at something that wasn't on the evidence page. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:49, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You'd have to tread a little carefully. It seems different for an Arbitrator to go sleuthing after the Truth than for a clerk to do so: the clerk could finish up prosecuting the case when they weren't actually involved in the first place, as well as trying to clerk it. That doesn't apply to an Arbitrator in the same way. That said, if a clerk is patching up the evidence a little "oh, and look, there's this editor apologising over here", that'd be different. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:54, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see any reasons for clerks to be concerned about presenting new evidence in a case they are clerking as long as they have no conflict of interest. It's part of our job. Of course, some users will always complain that it appears to be a conflict, but there's nothing we can do about that, and we shouldn't let the users with the biggest tinfoil hats dictate policy to us. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 09:21, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think I'm inclined to agree. We shouldn't unnecessarily restrict our powers of evidence-gathering and presentation, and thus risk a bad arbitration decision, where there is no conflict of interest. If we are in doubt we should consult the head clerk and the arbitrators. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think a clerk who gathers evidence is by definition wrong, but if his gathering evidence casts doubt on his neutrality in the mind of an involved party, he should recuse and be replaced by another clerk. Remember that involved parties have nothing to gain and everything to lose from being a vexlit, so if someone vexlits away all possible clerks he's only shooting himself in the foot. Or hand, depending on what he types with. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The arbitrators or the head clerk can direct a clerk to recuse, so if there is a complaint and a request to recuse it shouldn't normally be a matter for the clerk at all. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 09:12, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aaargghhh, I'm <i>really</i> sorry I couldn't attend to this earlier. I noticed Tznkai recused himself from cases where he had presented evidence just before I lost internet access for good, but I was very rushed and only managed to tackle a limited number of tasks. Anyway, long story short, I think Radiant has got it right. The guidelines indicate that an ex-arbitrator does not have a conflict of interest in cases where (s)he has voted in, so I naturally assumed presenting evidence or proposing stuff on the workshop would be no different. If there's an obvious conflict of interest (for instance, if Everyking was hauled in front of the arbcom again), I would naturally recuse myself, and present evidence in a non-clerking capacity. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've twice asked for clarification from the Arbitrators as to the namespace and revert restrictions I was placed under. I'd like someone to take on the task of adding the Arbitrator's comments onto my Arb page at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Netoholic_2_dbb6.html#Update" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Netoholic 2">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Netoholic 2#Update</a>. I think doing this will help me avoid blocks due to <i>literal</i> reading of my sanctions, since the Arbitrators that commented tend to agree that I should be able to work without the literal sanctions, so long as I am not "disruptive". Here are diff links from when the clarifications were de-listed - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=37142036&amp;oldid=37141755" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=37142036&amp;oldid=37141755" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=39333299&amp;oldid=39333200" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=39333299&amp;oldid=39333200" rel="nofollow">2</a>.

<dd>I really don't believe this would be appropriate: 1) Only a few arbitrators actually commented on it, and nothing was formalized with a vote. 2) I believe it would be wise to allow for a period of discussion followed by a vote (basically another RFAr) before making any clarifications to your existing remedies. 3) In the case of the first diff link, significant changes have occurred making those comments out of date; (<a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> is no longer policy (at least not developer-mandated policy), and is currently being rejected in the straw poll being conducted there. It would be best to open a new RFAr I think. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 03:01, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I recall, some ArbCom members said that if his changes were clearly beneficial and not disruptive then a "common sense" exception could be made to not block him. That doesn't really seem like a 'change' to me... such exceptions are always made. The mystery is why it keeps getting brought up as a 'defense' of his clearly harmful and disruptive edits. He has repeatedly run bots which haven't been approved (or even discussed), at rates faster than is supposed to be allowed, to make changes to templates on dozens of pages... which have caused many of them to break and massive disruption as people then try to change things back or use the rewritten template the old way and find it no longer works. Yet he has never been blocked for this... despite it being a blockable offense even without the ArbCom ruling preventing him from working in template space <b>at all</b>. He keeps fighting to preserve the 'hiddenStructure' method of handling conditional text despite the fact that it provides no real benefit over other methods and simply <i>does not work</i> for users in a number of different minority situations (blind users, text browsers, non-English Wikipedias, et cetera). Yet whenever he gets blocked for that it is quickly overturned by one of a handful of admins who seem (by their statements) to be affronted at having been over-ruled on the <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> issue. We shouldn't be going out of our way to make Wikipedia harder for people to use just because some people are upset to find that they were wrong about a developer/server issue.</dd>
<dd>The use of these vague 'do not block him if he is being helpful' statements as cover for actions which would normally be blockable even without an ArbCom ruling is a 'bad thing' &lt;tm&gt;. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:05, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not familiar with this case, but if any of that is true, you shouldn't need an Arbcom ruling to justify a block anyway. Just block him as disruptive and be done with it.

<dd>Of course the original ArbCom included a mentorship period in which he was <i>not</i> to be blocked for regular disruptions, and he likes to twist things around so that the blocking admin is acting outside of policy, only acting out of bias, etc. etc. It would be good to have an official word on what, exactly, he can be blocked for. (Although ideally, his ban against editing templates at all would be put fully back in place, as being disruptive about templates seems to be the only thing he does here.) — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 15:25, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
