<p>I discovered your tournament page through the Song of Ice and Fire messageboard and was duly impressed. I am the proprietor of the Encyclopedia of Ice and Fire <a href="http://www.alefgard.com/~iceandfire/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alefgard.com/~iceandfire/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and I would love to integrate this page into my site, with your permission, of course. I would place the material intact and unaltered (other than hyperlinking and any copyediting or formatting that may be required) on a page entitled "tournaments" and hyperlink to that page when appropriate from other pages on the site. I would give you full credit on the acknowledgement page for putting this resource together. Leave me a message on my talk page to let me know what you think. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 02:38, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am aware of the thread you are speaking of, and I had given some thought as to whether to use my site as the basis for a wiki. I do not want to do so at this time because of the loss of copyright. I may change my mind in the future. I will happily hold off on using your material on tournaments for a while if you feel it needs more work. You are correct that I could just take the page into my own since it is on wikipedia, but I still believe in getting the blessing of the author before using the material on my site. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 05:54, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)

<p>if you wanna revert <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Martell_8227.html" title="House Martell">House Martell</a> that's fine by me (and i think i wrote the content i deleted, but on the Oberyn Martell page). the consensus seemed to be that the plot summaries needed to go and that there was too much in the way of plot summary. it didnt seem to really gel, either, as he's the only martell there's anything to say about (except maybe nymeria) until <i>feast for crows</i> comes out.</p>
<p>i wasnt aware of the fancruft debate when i did most of the work i did on asoiaf. the term fancruft might not have even been in use yet, i dont know, but removing things like the oberyn plot synopsis will help us avoid treading (or leaping) that line.</p>

<p>Hey Arbor, thanks for your great work on the R&amp;I article. I am concerned that ZM's actions have had a disruptive effect on the page for the last couple of weeks, and it's clear that work on the article has essentially ceased since his arrival. Furthermore, a number of once-regular contributors, who are professional scientists working in related fields, appear to have been disallusioned with the Wikipedia process because of this. It's possible Wikipedia can't sustain a topic this controversial, though I hope that's not the case.</p>
<p>ZM has apparently moved to trying to start edit wars, since his debates didn't convince any of the dozen editors that tried to reason with him. Are there admin actions that can be proposed to end his disruptive activity, before more editors abandon the page?

<p>hi there, totally agree with you. i really don´t like it when anonymous users just simply put something up and the registered ones have to clean it up after... i don´t think that the word is nonsense either and therefore it can stay.. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 9 July 2005 18:42 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments and welcome! I can tell that everyone has put a lot of work into this, and I am going slowly. There are many, many POV issues with this article, though. The main thing at the moment is that I do not believe that the APA and AAA statements are comparable to Gottfredson's WSJ editorial, and I do not believe it's NPOV to claim it is. Where the others were drafted over many months with input from many experts and ratified unanimously, the Gottfredson piece has the feel of other (paid?) WSJ op-ed pieces by advocacy groups. Even "mainstream" the title has been called into question as POV by critics. I am extending my estimate to 6-12 months to get this NPOV at the rate we are going. I look forward to working with you! <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 20:50, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

My point is that the issue Ultramarine raises is the same one I have been mentioning-- systemic bias in the presentation of the R&amp;I issue. It's going to take a while to iron all this out, but I certainly assume good faith with you. I like what you have done with footnotes and imagine that will be useful across the WP site. I have been trying to think of ways to manage the talk page, which will only worsen over time. It seems that having the talk archives labeled more accurately will help those new to the issue find earlier relevant discussions so we don't have to rehash things all the time. Just a thought. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 00:42, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Arbor!</p>
<p>I've noticed your interest in the past in the issue of how post-ASCII characters should be handled on Wikipedia. Maybe you could give your input on a current issue.</p>
<p>There's currently an attempt underway to move <a href="../../../h/%C3%B6/%C3%B0/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r.html" title="Höðr">Höðr</a> to "Hodur" and <a href="../../../l/%C3%B3/%C3%B0/L%C3%B3%C3%B0urr.html" title="Lóðurr">Lóðurr</a> to "Lodur" (at which point the titles would rhyme, I suppose). Your opinions on <a href="../../../h/%C3%B6/%C3%B0/Talk%7EH%C3%B6%C3%B0r_f45d.html" title="Talk:Höðr">Talk:Höðr</a> and <a href="../../../l/%C3%B3/%C3%B0/Talk%7EL%C3%B3%C3%B0urr_46a3.html" title="Talk:Lóðurr">Talk:Lóðurr</a> would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Of course I'm not asking you to copy my votes but to study all sides of the issue and give your own opinion&#160;:)</p>

I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear.

If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<p>Hi, Your thoughtful contributions to this article are excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>I'll continue to tidy up the text, when I can find the time. In terms of the division of labour, I'll endeavour to add a bit more body text to the plot summary section in the next couple of days. This will fit well with the translation work on themes that you are undertaking. I'll also extend the bibliographical section.</p>
<p>If you have any specific issues with your translation, continue to employ commenting within the editing code and I'll try to check it out. My German is very rusty, but I've access to a friend who is a professional translator. One must have chaos within to give birth to a dancing star....</p>

<p>If you have an English translation handy, I suspect Ziemßen becomes Ziemssen? Similarly, is it Přibislav Hippe or just Pribislav? Arbor 13:30, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Lowe-Porter translation from German into English, published by Secker (England) and Knopf (USA), was approved by Mann and published in 1927. It employs "Ziemssen" and "Pribislav Hippe". It strikes me that the use of continental accent marking is inconsistent in this particular translation, with some characters within personal names, for example, retaining their "umlaut". I hope this helps--Rmackenzie 18:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The latter. He is Lord Walder's heir to the Twins at that time of his death. You are confusing him with his son [i]Ryman[/i] Frey, heir to the Twins at the time of FfC.

<p>Hi there. I noticed you just redirected the <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetal_personhood.html" title="Fetal personhood">Fetal personhood</a> article to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a>. I know a template has been up there for a while, but I am just wondering about the fairness of this unilateral redirect without any discussion. If you look at the <a href="../../../f/e/t/Talk%7EFetal_personhood_d070.html" title="Talk:Fetal personhood">Fetal personhood talk page</a>, there is discussion of merging with <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">Fetus</a>, but nowhere is there any discussion of merging with or redirecting to Person. As you did not provide an edit summary, I am unsure as to your reasoning for the redirect. If you could clarify your position, it would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps a re-instatement of Fetal personhood, and a call for discussion, would be a better way to go about things at this point.

<p>Hey Arbor, thanks for the kind words. It has been a struggle, to be sure, to be sympathetic to both sides, but I know that with good faith, we can disagree and come up with a better article. I actually find myself disagreeing with both sides to a certain extent, but I'm afraid the reasonable middle ground of, "yes, genetics have real impacts on intelligence, but arbitrary social categories of "race" are inferior to direct measurement of clusters when trying to compare population groups", is awfully far off. Proponents of the hereditarian stance and the validity of "race" have research which clearly shows self-identification can map to genetic groups, but then they make a quantum leap in assuming that such a study is definitive and conclusive. Anti-hereditarians focus too much on the ad hominem attacks, and their points lose focus when they concentrate on character rather than rationale.</p>
<p>What I'd love to see is some pro-hereditarian and anti-racist folks design experiments together. Of course, everyone wants to interpret things to match their POV, but if they could focus in on falsifiable claims, they might get a bit farther. As I often put it to others when debating a contentious issue, "what would make you change your mind?" As scientists, we should all have a concrete answer to that question. I'm afraid many of the more famous/infamous players in this field do not have concrete answers to that question, on either side.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again for the encouragement! And thank you for your contributions - I know as slow going as it may be, we're doing good work. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 23:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I surfed a little bit in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28Quotation_marks_and_apostrophes%29_d2d5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Quotation marks and apostrophes)">her in the Manual of Style talks</a> and so found your account "Arbor". The thing is that I moved some Wikipedia articles with typewriter quotation marks or apostrophes to pages with the title with proper typography. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lord%27s_Resistance_Army&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72166836" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lord%27s_Resistance_Army&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72166836" rel="nofollow">Like this</a>. All that moves got reverted. E.g. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a>' intention for this is:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">I generally think that unicode characters should not be used in the titles of articles, basically. Most people don't type in unicode, particularly myself when I type in the URL for an article directly instead of using the search bar. I know there's always the redirect, but I dislike seeing that (redirected from) line under the article name, like it's chastising me for typing in the title wrong or something.&#160;:) Anyway, yeah, basically I don't think unicode should be used in article titles, and I don't even think unicode quotes should be used in article text.</td>

<p>It also says <i>when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change.</i> Sad to say, it is wrong to change an articles title to the more typographically correct alternative. My view, and I hope yours too, is, that the more correct spelling IS the one with the typographic quotation marks and apostrophes. On the one side it may be a lot of work to change all those characters in the article titles. On the other side, in the end we have to go to the correct spelling. From this position, switching earlier to the correct spelling might save us from more work in the future.</p>
<p>So, my question now is, do you support my view, and if what can we do to get something like this in the MOS:</p>
<p>“<i>As there is currently no consensus on which should be preferred, either is acceptable. <b>For article titles, the typographic style ist preferred.</b>&gt;” Ensure that there is a redirect with straight glyphs.</i> (suggestion from me)</p>

<dd>Are you that sure? I just want that I can move pages without getting these edits reverted; That I can point to a policy in the summary, that says "it's OK to do that". I think there are Wikipedians who would do it without that tech stuff. There's no need of Wikimedia support, if you just want to have the page titles typographically correct. I think some administrator could implement a script on the <i>page move</i> page with functions similar to those under the textbox when you edit a page. This function I imagine would be a button next to the inputbox for the page title. You select some text in the box, click the button and voila all the special characters you need can be inserted before and or after the selected text. --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Schmidbauer_ae05.html" title="User talk:Tobias Schmidbauer">Tobias Schmidbauer</a> 17:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>See my comment on the article's talk page. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 01:07, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arbor, I copied the IQ Test Controversy article into the IQ article so you can delete the IQ Test Controversy article now (since you know how to do it). --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 19:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I deleted it several months ago. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 13:13, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw the section later. There is a ref within MMoM that says it's controversial. If you can move it up, you can open with it and have the "controversial" label cited. Then, I have no objections whatsoever.--<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 11:21, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arbor, maybe you can weigh in on the R&amp;I talk page. JK and possibly Ramdrake appear to be resisting even the most elementary (but important) rewriting of the brain size section. If my latest edit is simply reverted away, then I think it suggests that the state of affairs surrouding the article (and WP) are poor and the outlook grim. --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 04:14, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>arbor, if you're still around, you might be able to help with the R&amp;I page. JK has taken to doing some extreme and unwise editing. --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 04:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'll be back, but not now. Real life work/research is extremely hot right now and needs my full commitment, so no WP or similar activities for the next few weeks either. My moral support is all I can offer. 130.235.16.182 13:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC) (Arbor, not even signing in!)</dd>
