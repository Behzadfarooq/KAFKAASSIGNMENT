<li>Fred, as a current Arbitrator, I would hope you could at least provide one specific reason why you feel this way. "Fox in the henhouse" is a rather cryptic statement that leaves me wondering what the heck you're talking about. Please, can you provide some tips of what to look for in 172's edit history that makes you think he would be so dangerous to the other hens? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 14:15, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>172 has a long history of aggressive point of view editing which he covers up with a smokescreen of "academic authority". He is especially active with edits which whitewash left-wing totalitarian governments, leaders and actions. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:01, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I won't respond to this bullshit. I will say, though, that this is an unacceptable slander from someone the stature in the community of a member of the Arbitration Committee. I am a professional historian; and most of my family was murdered in Nazi death camps. I do not tolerate being likened to Holocaust deniers. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:30, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC) [Just to contextualize these comments, they were in response to a point added earlier to Fred Bauder's statement above likening me to Holocaust deniers. This comment was removed by the election organizers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements/172&amp;diff=8172753&amp;oldid=8159538" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements/172&amp;diff=8172753&amp;oldid=8159538" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:03, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)]

<li><b>Oppose</b>. When Shorne insulted Stan, calling him an "idiot" and a "propagandist", (on 13 Oct 2004) 172 expressed his support for Shorne instead of disapproval for insulting other Wikipedians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk%3AShorne&amp;diff=6538991&amp;oldid=6537294" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I suspect the reason is that Shorne and 172 have similar political orientations. I'd like arbitrators to condemn people who hurl insults, not to encourage them. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 18:02, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It appears that I am being blacklisted for having "the same political orientation a Shorne." Yet I really doubt that Shorne thinks that we share the same political affliations, given that I'm a leader of a local U.S. Democratic Party organization. Not that this means much... Many of the victims of these kinds of McCarthyite attacks like the one above along with Fred Bauder's weren't communists either. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:30, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Blacklisted" and "McCarthyism." I feel your pain, man. Of course, if the Democratic Party was made up primarily of people like you that'll bode well for the Republican Party's future, so keep on truckin'.</li>
<li>I am not going to respond here to the allegations that I "insulted" someone and that 172 supported the putative insult. I do wish to confirm that 172 and I do indeed part ways politically. I am openly contemptuous of the US Democratic Party, which I see as almost identical to the US Republican Party. Despite our significant political differences, I strongly endorse 172's candidacy for the Arbitration Committee.
<ul>
<li>172's comment on the dispute between Shorne and Stan suggests that he perceived the conflict in political terms ("Shorne and me [172] vs Stan and the rest of the rightwing clique"). But what really matters is not political motivation, but rather encouraging personal attacks. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 09:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As is quite obvious to anyone who can read, 172 and I don't agree with the allegation of "personal attacks" supposedly made by me. Moreover, 172 was right to frame the conflict as a political one. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 17:22, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose.</b> I've only had one encounter with 172, back in the days of Quickpolls. Admittedly, that was a contentious page; but I don't recall anyone more hostile than 172.
