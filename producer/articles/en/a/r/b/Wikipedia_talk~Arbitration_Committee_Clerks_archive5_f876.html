<dd>Radiant! queried the need for a chair when very few other Wikipedia activities have one; Raul suggested that having an explicitly guiding hand (with the Chief Clerk as a former Arbitrator) could speed things up a great deal, and that it would be better to have one unneccessarily than find the process hamstrung. Kelly pointed out that a single point of contact would allow quicker and clearer discussion, and that the Chief Clerk could help raise to the attention of Arbitrators cases which were languishing, and note objections and discussions that might have been raised over current cases.</dd>

<dd>Phil Sandifer noted the danger for Clerks of being considered easy routes for people to lobby so as to alter the decisions taken by the Committee, and also that were the Clerks to come to their recommendations on-wiki, the resultant text would likely be edit-warred (or otherwise modified) by interested parties so as to remove the value, so making the ability to email advice to the Committee directly more attractive to them; he also expressed concern as to how the Clerks would be regulated. Mindspillage suggested that, instead of locked pages, Clerks be given free rein to refactor and trim down workshop and evidence sub-pages as necessary, to avoid cutting out the input of others; Radiant! thought that Clerk input would be most appropriate on-wiki, but supported Clerk-and-Arbitrator-only pages (presumably the proposed decision sub-pages). Tznkai supported Phil's recommendation for self-regulation. Dbiv, Tznkai and Phil Sandifer all expressed concern about the danger of Clerks being blamed by those who dislike the way in which cases turned out, and that this might well prejudice any future Arbitrator elections involving them; Ryan Delaney said that ignoring such complaints where unmerited should not be a major problem.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Carrying out remedies?</span></h2>
<p>Apologies if this has been brought up before (I haven't really been following the discussion), but one thing I've noticed is that the ArbCom doesn't carry out the remedies - mainly blocks and bans. Instead, other editors have blocked per the ArbCom rulings in the past; however, some cases have fallen through the cracks and some editors have never been blocked. Would the clerks be responsible for carrying out the remedy of blocking once the case closes? This would make it more standardized and seems like a logical task for the clerks. Thoughts? Thanks! <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 20:44, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If people are really "slipping through the cracks", making many <i>fewer</i> people responsible doesn't seem the most sensible thing to do. OTOH, having clerks monitor the enforcement, remind people of remedies, and report back to the arbcom would seem entirely reasonable (though as before, this is something anyone could do). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:50, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I really hope not. I think ArbCom decisions should be enforced by all admins, not just the clerks. I know that you didn't mean that <i>only</i> clerks should be enforcing ArbCom rulings, but if we are expected to, then I guarantee that someone will complain that we are shirking our responsibility if we don't. Now, if a clerk happens to be closing a case where one of the remedies is that the user is banned, it would make sense for the clerk to block them as part of the closing procedure. But I don't think it should be the responsibility of that clerk to chase them down. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:53, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If admins would actually make use of the admin enforcement requested page then people wouldn't be slipping through the cracks in the first place, though I don't seen an issue with clerks making sure that remedies are listed there as needed and if they're an admin and the enforcement calls for a block or ban then enforcing the remedy as needed as well as making sure it's listed on the requested enforcement page, though in no case should clerks be the only one doing it. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 21:03, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have there really been any of those that have gone unenforced? As per Kelly, below, I can understand why clerks may not want to be seen to be acting with multiple "hats" below, and may wish to be <i>less</i> involved in direct enforcement than Generic Admins. There's also the at-least-theoretical possibility of non-admin clerks. If the issue really is just one of "slipping through the cracks", then co-ordination, and (ever-escalating as necessary) announcements/poking seem entirely sufficient. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 21:17, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I specifically do <b>not</b> enforce ArbCom decisions. When the ArbCom issues a ban, I see my job as to get the ban announced in the appropriate places. I usually also poke someone on IRC to enforce the ban, but I will not do it myself. The only situation where I am likely to block myself will be to block people who try to disrupt the RfAr process through vandalism. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 21:06, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So when the ArbCom decides to block someone, admins should actually do the blocking? Wouldn't it make more sense for the clerks to block after the ArbCom case is closed? There seems to be no system right now; whenever a case is closed, I've noticed several times where the person is not actually blocked until a week or more later; in some cases, people have never been blocked and have even edited afterwards. If the clerks did the blocking per the ArbCom ruling, wouldn't this eliminate the problem?

I noticed the motion to ban Andy Mabbett (<a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">User:Pigsonthewing</a>) just a few hours after it passed, and being an administrator reasonably familiar with the case, though not involved to any great extent, I implemented the ban by a block of 365 days. Later I noticed that Kelly had placed a note about the ban on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> (something I think I've seen arbitrators do themselves in the past). It occurs to me that it may be helpful to put some boilerplate into enforcement section of arbitration final rulings to remind the community of their responsibilities, but I do agree that clerks are, by the nature of their functions, better placed to administer enforcement orders. But it is still up to the community to carry them out. No clerk should be required to execute an enforcement order. Some clerks may not have the power to do so in any case; the post is open to all editors, not just administrators. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:17, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By the way in response to <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a>'s concern that in the past some enforcement orders have "fallen through the cracks" I suppose it might be a good idea for the clerks to examine past cases and determine whether this has happened to any great extent, and if so what kind of circumstance has led up to this, and whether great harm to Wikipedia resulted from the failure. Arbitration should certainly have a reputation for efficiency and good clerks can help oil the wheels. I guess the flying monkies had better get onto it pretty fast. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:23, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, I may be missing something here, but I don't think there is any requirement that clerks be admins. For obvious reasons it won't make any sense to expect clerks to do something they don't have the authority to do. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 21:46, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the specific case that prompted me to ask this was <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Nobs01_and_others_e8e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Nobs01 and others">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Nobs01 and others</a>, where <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">Nobs01</a> was banned/blocked for both a month and a year. The case was closed in December, and he's never been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ANobs01" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ANobs01" rel="nofollow">officially blocked</a>. To his credit, he hasn't edited since then (with the exception of two posts to Jimbo requesting an appeal) and hasn't been a problem, which is why I didn't bring this up earlier. I've also noticed this many other times - people who should be blocked per the ArbCom ruling either aren't, or are only blocked days or weeks later when an admin stumbles upon the case. Shouldn't there be a better way of doing this to make sure no one falls through the cracks?

<dd>I know, I know, I'm a process wonk, but I think it's important to keep the roles distinct. Clerks do clerkish things. WP isn't a government and ArbComm isn't a court but I see the admins carrying out the findings of ArbComm as more like bailiff functions. Now it may well be <i>convenient</i> that a clerk who also HAPPENS to be an admin can carry out the banning (or whatever) directive, and there should be no reason not to do so, it's efficient, but it should be with a clear notion of differing roles (and summaries should clearly show that), because, IMHO, that will help reduce criticism of the clerk function. (n.b. I'm not saying anyone above ISN'T keeping them distinct, just saying that they should be) ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 22:26, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well if you ANNOUNCE it with your LEFT hand, and PERFORM it with your RIGHT hand, you'd be OK, yes? (or is it the other way round???

I seriously do NOT think it is never OK for the same person to do both.

<dd>Quite. I don't think we need to say "never"; we just don't need to say it "must"/"really ought" to be performed by a clerk, either. I assume it's a given that clerks will take over the task of posting the "request for enforcement" notice, thus solving any future issues like the above instance of Nobs01 "falling through the cracks" (for a while).

<dd>I agree with Aaron that Tony's farming out the discussion was a bad idea (as I described above) which is why I refolded it all back into this page and the archive.

<dd>How didn't it help? OK, I'll spell it out. IMHO only, of course... Because there was an RfAr about it, a long and painful one, with lots of not very pleasant talk (including some from me, mind you, which I regret), sanctions and admonishments were handed out, and in what HAD to be a very difficult thing to do, Aaron said he was sorry, said he was taking the admonishments to heart, said he was going to try to do better, everyone else hopefully learned from it, and bringing it back up again strikes me as just picking at scabs for the purposes of making people squirm. Is that perception correct? If it is, is doing so useful? Is that past incident what we're here to talk about on this page? I hope not. Further, Tony already said he wasn't going to refactor this page that way again, said HE was sorry, and Raul said regular archives were the way to go, and I just don't see how this helps matters at all. If you really think it did, I'm sorry if I have given offense. But it just seems like this whole convo is at least partly degenerating into a re-dredge of past beefs.

<dd>It doesn't satisfy me, actually, as I don't care about transparency in their statements, but rather that they are inserting a filter between the arbitrators and the evidence. Since the clerks now standing have said that they think it's fine if they add <i>new</i> evidence of their own, that they clerk cases they're involved in, and since some of the present clerks have <i>already,</i> two days in, had credible charges levelled that they've been prosecuting instead of summarizing, I think we've demonstrated already, with no further action, that this function is ill-considered, ill-planned, unpoliced (clerks decide amongst themselves what duties they think are good? are you serious?), anti-editor, and the richest troll food ever concocted. No one has any explanation of any advantage for clerks offering summaries, and yet the lame duck arbcom, at the 11th hour, in the dark, has been willing to venture not its own credibility, but <i>future</i> credibility by insisting, to quote the charming phrase, "Tough luck." No, this is not satisfactory. Clerks should not be writing executive summaries.

<li>All evidence presentations require a summary paragraph or two written by the presenter.</li>
<li>Any evidence presentation that does look like a shambles is reprimanded and sent back to mediation (not acted upon). These two put the onus back where it belongs: the plaintiffs.</li>
<li>Have summaries, but have them by users <i>requested by the litigants</i> the way that mediators are agreed to.</li>
<li>Have a large (<b>large</b>) pool of names of clear writers to call upon, and have the litigants pick.</li>
<li>Have a process for clerk selection where the AC names names and then there is a 72 hour waiting period to see if there are strong, substantial objections raised to the person, with the understanding that objections need not be proven, as what is at stake is the appearance of propriety and trust, not criminality and law.</li>
<li>Get more ArbCom members and "tough luck" to the same degree that foisting biased, questionable people on the community is "tough luck" the other way. (Sorry, but I need one bitter statement in the lot.)</li>

<li>(edconf) Geogre, could you please give some links to indicate what you mean?

<p>Geogre, given that "All evidence presentations require a summary paragraph or two written by the presenter" is a pipe dream and isn't going to happen, who else do you propose is going to be doing the summary?</p>
<p>On sending back to mediation for bad presentation of evidence, that's not going to happen either. What happens (I've done it myself on two occasions) is that some civic-minded person steps in and organises the case. On your proposed selection process, it seems to me that you're suggesting the there is a question hanging over the propriety of some of the present incumbents. If this is a correct reading of your meaning, it's a pretty extraordinary suggestion. Are people "biased, questionable" because you say so? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 20:43, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So, "not going to happen" is sufficient to pass off a bad, unthought out system? That's no answer. As for my view of the individuals, Radiant is incorrect: it's <i>not</i> about the personalities. It's about the personalities that are not trusted who then pass on summaries. Again, set up an extremely large pool of editors who write clearly and let the disputants pick people to present the summaries, and this part of my objection would be removed. Otherwise, what you have is people who may be mistrusted by the disputants. As for the current list, there are a few who are widely mistrusted, but that's just chance. My central objection is to "official summary" being written by an "official" summarizer. That immediately creates a more equal than others summary. Once you do that, you open up the whole process to accusations. When those particular individuals include Snowspinner, Tony Sidaway, and Kelly Martin, all three of whom engender widespread disquiet, or even Johnlemeek, who is currently being accused of prosecuting instead of summarizing, then you foster the loser's discontent and give that person a platform from which to recruit others. Again: set up a huge pool of writers who are <i>drafted</i> to write summaries. Don't have Summarizers who get a halo about them bestowed solely by this arbcom. As for whether this particular ArbCom is disliked, it is. Is it disliked by me? Some folks, sure. However, it is generally disliked. Although I stay as far from it as I can, I keep being told, as a standing verity, that ArbCom is evil by people who otherwise are contributory and sane. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

The system is rotten, and it's not rotten because Snowspinner has been through 3 RFar's or so this year. It's not rotten because Tony Sidaway has been through at least two this year. It's not rotten because Kelly Martin's RFar engendered more outright hostility and hatred than any I've ever seen. It's rotten because there is no control whatever on who gets the Official Provider of Summaries title and because the people being prosecuted could very easily campaign with other users that they were harmed by the presence of one of these users. There is a readymade pool of people who will agree with the disgruntled. On the other hand, we have dozens of knowledgeable editors who have been in the political side who didn't jump forward mysteriously wanting to be the Official Voice. Draft them. Have the disputants pick them. Then you can overrule the losers. Instead of addressing any of these issues, though, you just chalk it up to "complainers."

<p>Okay, all this arguing back and forth is getting annoying and forest firey. I think that the issue for most people isn't that clerking is a bad idea, but that individual clerks are perceived as a bad idea. But simply put, if a clerk isn't trusted by the community, then this reduces trust on any decisions in which the clerk was involved. Hence, I suggest the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Community input to clerk appointments. We don't need any kind of formal process, but just let there be a page where people can state "I want to be a clerk because of so-and-so", then this is left open for community discussion for a couple of days (no voting!), and on grounds of that discussion the ArbCom decides whether to accept the person or not.</li>
<li>Since the Head Clerk's main role seems to be appointing other clerks, this seems to obviate the need for one. Most wikiprocesses do not have a leader anyway. It was stated as beneficial that the head clerk can read the mailing list, but I haven't seen any reason what the point of that is; the ArbCom can provide clerks on a case with CC'ed mails as necessary.</li>

<p>At the risk of starting another RFA-like structure (which seems to be exactly what you are proposing), I have created a community commentary section on this page where people can voice their concerns. However, I would prefer not to start planning for the next group of clerks until I have a grasp on how the current group is doing.

<li>Thanks. However, it seems to be the current group of clerks that people have problems with (about half of which are controversial people), rather than clerkhood in general. The two easiest solutions for that would be (1) dropping all clerks and let community discuss on them for a bit, or (2) instate more clerks quickly to dilute the amount of controversial ones. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 20:49, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't want to be the sole crank, but I'm getting more e-mail than ever before over this issue from "you're our champion in this" people, so I suppose it's my duty to say it again: the stakes are too high to wait and see. What we'd see if we waited was someone saying that Snowspinner, for example (who has had multiple RFar's on him), carried a grudge and wrote derisive comments in a summary and that he was on IRC all night poisoning the atmosphere, etc., and that his "official summary" was the only one forwarded. Whether it would be true or not would be irrelevant: there are enough people who really dislike Snowspinner that the charge would carry credence. <b>That</b> is what I've been complaining about.

<p>I find geogre's reasoning on this quite difficult to follow. Is he suggesting that we let trolls choose our clerks for us? For if we give the community the veto he demands, this is the logical conclusion. Nobody about whom a troll has ever written an unkind word would be fit for the job under such a regime. Not Theresa Knott, not Sam Korn, not Raul654. Arbitrators perhaps, but under geogre's proposal we couldn't possibly let them be clerks because someone might say something, you know, nasty and untrue about them. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, Geogre's saying that having controversial people involved in an ArbCom case makes it easy to say the outcome of the case is tainted by them. As we've seen from recent user RFCs, attacking any controversial user gets you instant support from a large amount of other users; the last thing the ArbCom needs is such feedback on case outcomes. And it's easy to say that that might not actually happen, but it's really easy to avoid the entire possibility by simply not taking on controversial people as clerks when there's plenty of people willing. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Here's a novel thought - rather than arguing about the hypothetical possiblity that the outcome of a case is "tained" by the participation of a controversial clerk, why don't we actually wait to see the outcomes of some cases? <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 22:35, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reason we don't, Raul, is that the first one will be the last one. I'm also getting e-mails from people who I <i>don't</i> put in the ranks of the august who are already saying that they're getting railroaded by summaries. I'm not easily swayed (obviously) and I'm not disengenuous (unlike people who seem to understand me perfectly well until the points start scoring), so I'll make no hay of it -- it hasn't concerned one of the big three of seriously controversial folks. The first time Tony or Snowspinner or Kelly writes a summary, though, <i>someone</i> is going to howl that it was all because of them, all because they couldn't reply to his or her lies on the summary page, etc., and that's going to generate a big swell of discontent. Again, <i>what exactly is the advantage to clerks writing summaries that can't be answered another way?</i> I keep asking this, and all I've gotten so far is Tony Sidaway, who has a bit of a vested interest, saying, "Pbbt, that won't work" to the ideas I tossed off in a minute. Couldn't you guys think it over a bit, come up with another way? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:09, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I don't think that a troll should have the availability to veto a clerk, I do think that a party involved in an arbitration dispute should have the right to request that a clerk not work on his/her case.

I know that Arbitrators on some cases publicly recuse themselves. I do think that it should be open and transparent as to what clerks worked on what evidence and that, should the need arise, a clerk should publicly recuse himself/herself. <a href="../../../s/r/e/User%7ESreed1234_8435.html" title="User:Sreed1234">Sue Anne</a> 00:43, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The dilemma is this: either the clerkships are relatively unimportant administrative positions, not requiring any kind of community consensus, in which case there's no problem with the way the current clerks were chosen — but that means they can't get involved in writing summaries. Or the clerks will involve themselves in summarizing cases and deciding on evidence presentation, in which case the positions are very close to those of arbitrator — and that means controversial people the community has only just rejected for those roles shouldn't be chosen. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:29, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There comes a point where community concern becomes politically irrelevant. All authority on Wikipedia to do anything comes ultimately from Jimbo and the board. The Arbitration Committee derives its authority directly from that source. If the Arbitration committee thinks the clerks office will help them do their jobs, then there isn't much the naysayers can do about it except naysay. Look, I'm not making Wikipedia out to be a dictatorship, and I do think discussion is important. But I'm sick to death of the phenomenon where every time someone comes up with a good idea, someone comes out of the woodwork screaming about how it's going to wreck everything and the sky is falling. Let's look at the real important questions here:
<ul>
<li><b>Do I think the clerk's office will have an effect in general?</b> Yes, and I think it will help the arbitrators do their jobs.</li>
<li><b>Do I think the clerk's office will have some significant political influence on Wikipedia?</b> I honestly don't know or care. Personally, I don't plan to use the position to influence anything. Summarizing evidence is a clerical job, and anyone here who has gone to law school or taken law-related courses will know that writing briefs is not a task taken with a particular aim in mind other than distilling the basic facts about a case so someone can review it quickly.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The bottom line here is that the clerk's office serves at the pleasure of the Arbitration Committee, not the rest of the wiki. This sounds odd coming from a clerk, but bear it in mind anyway; the arbs picked people they thought could do the job. If any of us doesn't do the job, they'll remove one or all of us. Again, our purpose is to help the arbcom do their job, and if we aren't helping, we'll be dissolved. That decision is entirely up to the people whose opinions on this issue actually matter. For my part, I've done for more work arguing about the office than actually doing clerk work, which is something that's going to change after I post this. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 01:42, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You wrote: "There comes a point where community concern becomes politically irrelevant ... If the Arbitration committee thinks the clerks office will help them do their jobs, then there isn't much the naysayers can do about it except naysay." Well, the arbcom needs admins to enforce its decisions, Ryan, and the encyclopedia needs a community to write its articles. As much as I agree with <i>encyclopedia before community</i>, no one agrees with <i>encyclopedia without community</i>, which is where you seem to be headed. The point is that, by having these discussions, the community is very politely requesting that the committee rethink its recent decisions about clerkships, and if you look around at the people making those requests (if you can find them all, given the fragmentation of this discussion), you'll see that it involves people who don't often (or even never) criticize the arbcom, so I hope that might tell you something. Given the attitude you just expressed, I'd say concerns will have deepened considerably. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup>

<dd>Yes, there are some very respected members of the community who don't care for it, based on problems which are at this point entirely hypothetical.

<dd>As I said in the diff above, we'll re-evaluate the clerk's office (in its entirety) come March. If they aren't producing good results for lack of new clerks, we add more manpower. If they aren't producing good results for structural or organizational reasons, we can reorganize it - scrap the position of chair, or make it so that it can be done by non-arbitrators. If there is no prospect of fixing it, we'll scrap it. But, I will say again (for about the 100th time) we are going to go forward and see how it works as is before we do any major restructuring. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:26, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Imposition-wise, why not try finding a way to enforce (and add where applicable) <i>recommended</i> word limits? It looks underhanded to opt for this route first, and appearences count. This filter is unheard of in Wikipedia; to involuntarily (<i>viz.</i> the AMA) have someone speaking for you is very different from having someone's own words limited to something or other within a given framework. Failure to operate within such limits should count as a forfeit, not rewarded by —or from a troll's standpoint, punished with— an ArbComm-mandated social worker. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 04:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony, I presume these are summaries written for someone who is unwilling or unable to adhere to the recommended word/format limits. What I am saying is very simple: enforce the word limit. Anyone is free to respond to a summary they find geared at obfuscation, in their own section. This clerk task force (&amp; admins, in general) should be removing summaries which are over the limit. Writing a summary for someone who cannot or will not adhere to the word threshold, is less productive and more open to abuse than having them forfeit their right to a summary. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:50, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's odd. Anyway the answer to the question (in question form) of "[h]ow is requiring parties to make well-formed pleadings going to help when we can't even get them to observe the 500 word pleading limits" is: can't we? Let's <i>really</i> try to do that, and impose other limits where applicable.

<hr />
<p>The idea that parties will, if asked nicely, write meaningful summaries of cases betrays an ignorance of the entire history of the arbitration process. The fact is that, in virtually every RfAr, at least one, and usually most, of the parties, are being completely unreasonable, and will not do anything reasonable to make the process less painful for everyone else involved. In many cases their very intention during the arbitration process is to continue to make it painful for the other parties. These people have no interest in voluntarily summarizing their cases -- which they are going to lose -- because doing so will just result in the case ending against them faster! They'd rather be obstructionary because it drags the process out and lets them troll longer. The other type of problem litigant is terminally convinced that he is right and all others are wrong, and doggedly sticks to that point no matter what. They're less of a problem, although their evidence and arguments tend to be stream of consciousness and full of irrelevancies, and they never show any evidence of understanding why they've been sanctioned.</p>
<p>I've just described 90% of ArbCom cases. This is what the ArbCom is facing. How is requiring parties to make well-formed pleadings going to help when we can't even get them to observe the 500 word pleading limits as it is? Either (a) we stop requiring the ArbCom to waste time on writing nicely argued summaries with long drawn out opinions and just let them smack the heads of people who act like shits, or (b) we provide the ArbCom with the support required to "properly" analyze the evidence, arguments etc. so they can produce the summaries and opinions that people have come to expect from the ArbCom. Frankly I'm in favor of (a) at this point. It doesn't take long on the ArbCom to learn how to spot the bozo in 90%+ of cases from a mile away. We could make ArbCom go a lot faster, and deal with the real issues, by just whacking the problem users straightaway without letting them use RfAr as a platform from which to rant from for an extra two months while their case is being heard. But I recognize that the "community" (an entity for which my disdain grows by the day) will likely not accept such a solution, and so do not advocate it.</p>
<p>Quite honestly I'm thoroughly fed up with the Wikipedia "community" and am rapidly losing interest in doing anything to assist it. I'm seriously tempted to resign my special roles (other than administrator) and stick to editing articles. It's far less stressful, and more satisfying, to boot. I even got a "thank you" from someone for cleaning up some articles he had written. I just hope that the community gets its problems sorted out before it destroys the encyclopedia. I am not hopeful on that, though. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 05:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The community isn't doing anything wrong, in general—it's arbitrators and similarly powerful users who are obstructing its efforts to move things in a more natural, workable, cohesive direction, and actually trying to move things in the opposite direction (arguably as a reaction to the first direction). The community isn't moving with much coordination; it moves because of a natural tendency in the system, which is a constructive tendency: the improvement of the operation of things to better reflect present conditions (for Wikipedia, the main change is rapid growth and the simultaneous broading of the user base to better reflect society at large, albeit still on a very small scale now). Try to think about how Wikipedia can be best run, what is the sort of administration that could involve less inherent controversy and combat, and what sort of things we're doing wrong now (hint: the problem is not that the community is full of idiots who need to be treated more harshly). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:02, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that Tznkai is missing the point of many, at least, of those complaining. We (I've joined in the criticism elsewhere, though not here before) are concerned, not that the institution might not work, but that it's a bad idea in itself. "giving it a chance" is therefore irrelevant to our concerns.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopædia project, not a national government; we don't need civil servants with titles like "Head Clerk" to do the work for busy ministers of state, and instituting this sort of thing strikes many of us a bad decision. Is there a department of New Page watchers, with a Head Watcher? A Department of AfD-Closers, with a Head Closer? A Department of Speedy-Deleters, with a Head Deleter? No — when work needs doing, we either do it or ask for help. It's very unclear why we need a Clerks Department, with a Head Clerk.</dd>
<dd>So I'm not saying "Kelly Martin can't be trusted, it should be me (or one of my chums)" – though, in common with very many editors, I don't trust Kelly Martin, which admittedly doesn't help – I'm saying that no-one should be appointed, because this sort of appointment is un-Wikipedian.</dd>
<dd>It's true there's a secondary concern — that a person who has been very widely voted and argued against as a memeber of the Arbitration Committee should almost immediately be given a newly-created official position working for that committee smacks of the chums-network that sees a notorious lecturer and attacker of other admins defend the same behaviour in one of his friends or associates. OK, it's unrealistic to suppose that this sort of thing doesn't happen in any human enterprise, or that it could be prevented — but this is just rubbing our noses in it. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 08:55, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well said, Mel. I agree completely with this assessment, and your comment has very neatly encapsulateed the concerns of very many editors/wikipedians. Has there been a single comment supporting this initiative from anybody not directly connected to ArbCom or its freshly minted Clerk Corps? The sheer hauter of some of the rebuttal to this opposition has given me much pause, considering the implications of these appointments, primarily the appearance of the "chums network" gaining a toehold here, and then spreading to other areas of the wiki. I will further state, that over and above this, the points brought up by Mel, Slim Virgin, El C and particularly Geogre sum up very articulately what I think about this whole (to coin a rather trite phrase) "kerfuffle".

<p>We have always allowed anyone to present evidence. With the creation of the /Workshop page anyone can make proposals and comment on them. What the creation of the clerks does is give a few people that role. We have work that needs to be done. For example requests for arbitration often make hardly any sense at all and sometimes even when they have a good case they don't present diffs that illustrate it. When we make finding of fact we have to spend hours looking for diffs which illustrate the problem. Opening and closing of cases was done in a haphazard and often incomplete way. Exactly what clerks should be doing is a bit up in the air, but there is a lot of paperwork. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:59, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So from Theresa's response they <i>are</i> special. They <i>do have</i> special powers. In particular they will have the <i>considerable</i> power to summarise (and thus possible spin) the evidence. In my view that qualifies as a "big deal". I have a lot of faith, trust, and confidence in most of the ArbCom members (some I simply don't know). And they all deserve the communities respect and appeciation — they are volunteers (as are we all) doing a difficult, unpleasant and thankless job. But that job, in my view, which the community has entrusted them to do, is to <i>read and summarize the evidence for themselves</i>, rather than to rely on others to do that for them. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Paul. Summarizing evidence accurately for a case you've not been involved in is a difficult job, and there are probably very few people who could do it well. During the election, people voted for the editors they want to do that job. Asking non-arbitrators to open, chose, and archive cases is fine, but evidence summarizing and discussion of summaries is best left to the committee. Perhaps word limits could be enforced as El C suggests above. That would cut down instantly on the amount of material the committee has to plough through. Why invent new rules and positions before enforcing and using existing ones? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:38, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Having said that, I did feel that Arbcom appointing Kelly, so soon after that fiasco, was somewhat unwise - the frenzy of the rabble was somewhat predictable. However, I'm even more disturbed by this resignation. What did Kelly expect when she accepted? And the resignation is now only going to whet the crowd's taste for blood. Either we appoint the best qualified people, and to hell with the mob, or we employ only those who will command with 'popular' (one might say vulgar) respect (an oxymoron?).

<dd>(edit conflict, on account of forgetting to press "save" for twenty minutes) While agreeing with El_C, I want to just make it clear that I am referring to the section of the community that is violently against Kelly, not the main bulk, which is good-tempered and well-natured. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 20:16, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kelly has spared the community a lot of upheaval by making this decision, so she should be applauded for that. If the arbcom really feels a head clerk is necessary (I don't myself see the need for one), perhaps someone could be approached from among those with high percentages who weren't chosen as arbitrators.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the issue of summaries, another suggestion would be to allow an opt-in/opt-out option. People bringing cases could say at the time of making the RfAr whether they opt in or out of having a clerk summarize their evidence. Those who opt out but whose cases are badly presented could be advised by the committee that opting in would be in their interests. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:16, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kelly has shown wisdom in resigning at this time, and I applaud her wholeheartedly. This will help her to regain the trust of the community, and shows a maturity of uncommon caliber. For an administrator to give up any kind of administrative power is a great sacrifice. Acting in the best interest of the encyclopedia and community can be difficult, and I am impressed that Kelly was able to summon the fortitude to do so once again. --<a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschor_7a19.html" title="User:Dschor">Dschor</a> 18:45, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>This will help her to regain the trust of the community</i> Fat chance. The "community" of which you speak (unworthy as it is of the name) is like the tabloid press: it wants its pound of flesh. Then another pound. Then another pound. It will not give up until Kelly has been harassed off this site. I strongly disagree that this is in the good interests of the community or the encyclopaedia. It is, however, in the selfish interests of a few people who don't help either at all. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 19:39, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam, I agree with the sentiment wholeheartedly (for the record: I think Kelly was a very good arbitrator, and that she would have been a very good clerk; I'm sorry to see her resign). But I don't know that such a comment was helpful. The harassment of her is unacceptable; it needs to stop, for <i>everyone'</i>s benefit. But lumping all of the community together in a sweeping statement isn't doing anything to help it end. There are reasonable people with reasonable objections and an arbitrator lumping them in with the tabloid press isn't constructive. I trust the people who are just carping are recognizable by everyone but themselves; it's the people whose judgment I trust who are, indeed, raising real concerns that I'm concerned with. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 21:15, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Defenders of the system fail to answer or even to acknowledge the arguments of its critics, preferring (like the tabloid press referred to above) to focus on a minor element that suits their purposes.</li>
<li>Those who disagree woith the system, such as me, are lumped together and insulted. It's those who blindly defend the proposed clerking system – and Kelly Martin's rôle in particular – who are raising the emotional tone of the debate. I wish that they'd calm down, and try to see past their (false) conviction that this is a witch hunt carried out by irrational and vindictive people. I for one have seen no sign of that, even when I've disagreed with some of the arguments offered. Sam Korn, at least, seems in his latest comment to retract his earlier outbursts, and that's a good sign.</li>
<li>After the announcement of Kelly Martin's resignation, a few editors kept up their insistent comments on the issue — but in her defence. Only when one of her <i>critics</i> responded were we told that the issue should have been dropped (with the childish response that strengthened my opinion of her, as I'm sure it did that of others; if she doesn't want to see herself discussed, after all, she needn't read this Talk page). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:01, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mel, if I have overstated I apologise. I had not intended to attack 'critics of the <i>system'</i> (I've never even really defended it - I just don't think it is a big deal). What I found absurd was the personalising 'anti-Kelly' campaign and incivility that some have been involved in. Userboxes were deleted and quickly restored and, instead of measured criticism of a not-unique dispute, we got mass hysteria (nasty RfC, attack-userboxes, and general incivility). Unfortunately, when Arbcom appointed Kelly to this new position, more personalising reactions to <i>her</i> obscured any valid discussion of the clerks' roles or method of appointments. People not previously interested in Arbcom process saw this as more of the Kelly-war and those same people will see her resignation as a 'victory' for, yes, their tabloid style debate. Of course rational discussion and criticism of the process is valid, and indeed may now be possible. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 23:26, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What skills are needed?</span></h2>
<p>Fair enough, Sam. I think Geogre's point all along has been that, in making these decisions, the committee has opened every single one of its decisions to even more attacks and suspicion from people who might have attacked it anyway, but who would suddenly have a legitimate complaint. And people who aren't normally critical of the committee would also start to feel uneasy. It's extremely difficult to summarize evidence accurately and neutrally for a case you know nothing about.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My suggestion is to forget the summaries, enforce word limits (why <i>aren't</i> they being enforced?), and if you need clerks for the other administrative tasks, invite applications from less controversial people (e.g. people who did well during the election). If you must allow summarizing, have an opt-out system where parties can insist their cases not be summarized by clerks. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:11, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly. It's very hard to summarize and rule on a case you know nothing about. Which is the job of the clerks.

<dd>If there must be clerks, they should either be chosen because they were eligible to be appointed as arbitrators, or because they'd be particularly good at the job (and preferably both). So what does being good at it entail, if summarizing cases is included? You'd need to be an excellent writer, be able to use sources well (the diffs), have a thorough understanding of our policies so you can highlight which policies are relevant to a case, and also so you can keep an eye on committee rulings to make sure none contradict policy. Geogre would be a great clerk, for example, because he's a great editor, but it's a job many good editors won't want, because it's going to get tedious very quickly. Have all the current clerks shown particular aptitude in these areas, and if so, who judged that and when? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(decreasing indent) There are three skills a clerk needs - the ability to summarise huge piles of data and edit them into somethat that is coherent but that still preserves the germane points and the "voice" of the person presenting the evidence, the ability to see the big picture and extract the things that matter in the context of the role of the arbcomm, and the ability to remain neutral and not get attached to his/her contributions and summaries.</p>
<p>The first part issue requires a good editor - not in the sense of "Wikipedia editor", but in the sense of a professional copyeditor - someone who writes well and is able to cut the chaff without losing the meaning. The second part requires a good understanding of the role of the arbcomm - not to be punitive, not to deal out punishment, but to come up with solutions to problems. This means that a good clerk should be able to come up with principles and summaries that are relevant to the process. In other words, a clerk should study what Fred does in /Workshop pages (and learn from it). The third requirement is a matter of character. In the process of summarising someone's contributions, the clerk needs to be sensitive to the fact that they are never going to get it right the first time, and they must be willing to take criticism (some of it very personal, since people in arbcomm cases often feel like they are fighting for their Wiki-lives) without being defensive. They need to be able to create summaries to which they are not at all attached. They need to be able to <i>work with</i> the participants without getting offended when their summaries are called "crap". Do we have any Buddhist monks who are professional copyeditors or ghostwriters? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 21:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To the above, I'd add a fourth skill: the ability to understand the spirit and letter of our policies and to be able to translate them, along with the details of each case, into workable principles that won't contradict some other policy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To reiterate what I said above, I'd rather those people turn to a sympathetic advocate than an apathetic clerk. But I want to stress that deleting items that are over the limit and enforcing format standards, is worth a try. This as never been attempted before, but it should. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 22:17, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I adamantly wouldn't second that - such moves are arbitrary, and risk giving a random selection of facts. They are rules dealing with process, willfully ignoring product. Yes, we ought ask people to scale back to where they are in line with the rules, but we ought not arbitrarily cut them off at their first X diffs, or terminate their evidence at Y words, mid-sentence or not, or whatever. To do so would actively get in th eway of making reasone decisions based on what happens, and turn the arbcom into a complex game of Nomic. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:12, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not if you tell them in advance. We already reject and delete RFCs that do not follow the RFC structure (which is rather rigid but easily figure-out-able). Give people ten lines of free prose; ten links to policy/guideline pages with a one-line explanation for each on why it is relevant; and thirty diff or history links, once again with a one-line explanation on why it is relevant. Any case that cannot be made in such a structure, is not worth arguing for. Since lengthy rants get rejected anyway (and they are, because they generally fail to have a point), might as well state that in advance. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 23:26, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree with most of the above concerning the skills that a "clerk" should have — but even more with whoever said: "but why can't the arbitrators do it for themselves? Or if there aren't enough of them for that, why can't more be appointed from the pool of people who got over 50 per cent?" It strikes me as bit odd for someone to run for and to be elected to the ArbCom and almost immediately to turn round and say: "But I can't do the job, of course, so I need help". --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:08, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's an example of where a failure to understand policy and the way the committee works can cause problems (not meaning to single <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> out; it's just that this is a recent example I know about, and John has been put forward for clerkship). John came up with a proposed decision in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_WebEx_and_Min_Zhu_67fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/WebEx and Min Zhu">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/WebEx and Min Zhu</a>: "When rolling back edits, especially non-vandalism ones, admins should notify the editors whose edits were reverted. (See Wikipedia:Revert.)" When someone objected, because this was taken from a page that isn't policy, John added: "[T]his is academic, as the arbcom ruling only deals with the present case at hand, and not necessarily the whole 'pedia, and does not set precedent." But this is just false. Committee rulings do set precedent for the entire Wikipedia (unless otherwise stated) or else they reinforce past decisions or uphold current policy. John refers to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy</a> to support his view that rulings don't set precedent. But again, he has misunderstood: all that page says is that past decisions are not binding on arbitrators when they make new decisions. The whole discussion is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_WebEx_and_Min_Zhu_Workshop_e12a.html#Editors_whose_edits_are_rolled_back_should_be_notified" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/WebEx and Min Zhu/Workshop">here</a>.

<dd>But this is exactly analogous to the role that law clerks play for judges. It is the judges responsibility to ensure that these misapprehensions are eliminated from the final decision. The skills that a clerk needs are to be knowledgeable, efficient and dispassionate enough that they effectively <i>support</i> the arbitrator; if they lack these skills they will make work for arbitrators, but this should not contribute to worse judgements, if the arbitrators know their stuff. --- <b>Charles Stewart</b><sup><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChalst_00d6.html" title="User talk:Chalst">(talk)</a></sup> 03:46, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And sometimes it takes a little feedback to get any helper to help in just the right way. The example given by SlimVirgin certainly needs correcting but it's not irreperable harm at this stage in that case... Presumably the whole idea behind the clerks office is that, even if there are errors in the first few things the clerk does, over time the net efficiency of the whole process goes up. So I would repeat my plea, can we give this process time and see how it all transpires before we let loose the baying dogs and drive anyone else screaming from the room? If the clerking process ends up causing more work for the arbComm I'm betting they'll look at it come March 1, when they said they would, and decide it wasn't winnage... till then, can everyone chill? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:55, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we are going to have clerks, it is because they have the requisite skill set. At best a person without the skills will make more work for the arbs. At worst, they will create additional biases and cause more strife with the participants in an arb case. Someone interested in serving as a clerk should show (by their previous contributions) that they are good editors (in the technical sense of the term, not the Wikipedia sense), that they are careful contributors, and that they are thick skinned. The simple fact is that a poorly suited person can further antagonise the situation, increase the workload for the arbs, <i>and</i>add subtle biases. The fact that John reacted defensively to criticism suggests a sense of ego about the job. Quite frankly, in my opinion it is a <i>good thing</i> to have an outsider looking in and commenting on the proposed principles and decisions.</dd>

<dd>I had no idea that John was a clerk - his highly defensive stand and obvious investment in his suggestions left me with the impression that he was connected to one side of the issue. Since I was not invested in the case to any real degree (I had commented on Larvatus's RFC) I saw no point in getting into a fight there (and I that if my comments were useful they would be seen by the and if they weren't they would be ignored). I don't mean this as a personal criticism of John - presumably he can learn from constructive feedback on his actions (though not from me, given his rejection of my comments). But if people are to serve as clerks they should show some promise, they should show the right skill set. I don't think it has anything to do with whether they were accepted or rejected by the community - if someone applies to be a clerk their contributions should show that they are capable. At the same time, if someone shows the skill-set, then they should be actively recruited. Not everyone has followed this discussion - I had not paid any attention until today, mostly because it seemed to be nothing more than a nasty fight about what role people thought Kelly should play. This is not to say that I would make a good clerk - this is to say that there are many competent editors out there who have no idea what this whole thing is really about.</dd>

<dd>I would strongly agree with that, and I'll further cede that you have more time in reading the case in question. However, I'm going to nevertheless give everyone the benefit of the doubt at this point, and assume that this is at most a minor slipup, that some mentoring by ArbComm members will correct the issue if they feel there is one, rather than some uncorrectable flaw, and hope for the best.

Johnleemk's statement on adoption of non-policy items as principles was absolutely and completely correct. The Committee can and does adopt principles that are not policy (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> is not policy but is commonly adopted in Arbitration cases). Such adoptions are not binding on the Committee so any precedential value they may have is limited. I myself have drafted principles that came straight out of my own head, and seen them go on and be adopted by the Committee, after discussion and editing in workshop, in its final decision. Whether he was or was not a clerk at the time is immaterial; this is precisely what workshop pages are intended for. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 07:39, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're saying that arbitration-committee rulings do not act as precedents unless they're simply reiterating a policy? If that's what you're saying, what do you base your understanding on? Rulings are, of course, not binding on the committee, in the sense that it may update its decisions, but that's not the point. Rulings are binding on the community until the committee says otherwise.

<p>I'm not saying that. What I'm saying, SlimVirgin, is that it is perfectly in order for a party to a case, an arbitrator, or anyone else to propose a principle in a workshop, and that I personally have composed, as a joined participant to a case, at least two principles that have been unanimously adopted by the members of the Committee presiding over the case, in their final ruling.</p>
<p>Further, I'm saying that because such proposals are non-binding on the Committee (by the specific clause of the Arbitration Policy which says this, and which John cited) their precedential value is limited.</p>
<p>The principles are usually statements about policy in the wider sense, and may reference written policy and other documents. Principles adopted in a case serve to illuminate and guide the deliberations of the Committee during that case. While the principles are not binding on the Committee or the community, they are interpretations, by experienced Wikipedians, of the sense of policy, and have a great deal of persuasive value. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 08:50, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now you're repeating what John said: that rulings/principles are not binding on the community after the case. But of course they are. They're not binding on the committee, because the committee can change or update them, but as <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_Past_decisions_b8a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Past decisions">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Past decisions</a> notes, consistency between rulings is desirable. I suppose the community could also overrule arbcom decisions via policy or a poll, though I don't think that's been done. But until the rulings/principles are explicitly changed, they are binding on the community. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:03, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arbitration rulings are binding on the community in the sense that the community is expected to implement the remedies and enforcement clauses. This doesn't--absolutely does not--mean that <i>any</i> Wikipedian is forbidden to propose principles, findings of fact, remedies or enforcement clauses in a workshop. Which I believe is what John did. I can do it (and have done), you can do it, John can do it, anyone can. And sometimes the principle is adopted by the Committee. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 09:18, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one is disputing that, Tony. What John said is that rulings are not binding on the community, but are only made for guidance within the case or something. He said: " ... the arbcom ruling only deals with the present case at hand, and not necessarily the whole 'pedia, and does not set precedent." This is clearly false. Anyway, it's not fair to say more about John in particular. The general point is that clerks need to be very familiar with policy and past principles, so they can predict contradictions, advise the committee, and see the big picture, if they're going to be involved in formulating summaries or advising in any other capacity. If they're only doing administrative work (opening, closing cases and so on), those skills are less important. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:28, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I happen to agree with John. I'm as familiar with policy as anyone. Moreover I'd say that the idea that clerks ought to enforce consistency with past rulings goes against the spirit of the arbitration policy: the it should not be bound by precedent and it should learn from experience. John seems to understand the policies that he cites; the only problem here, and it's a minor one for our purposes, is that experienced, knowledgeable Wikipedians can differ on this point of interpretation. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 09:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You happen to agree with John on what point exactly, Tony? No one is saying editors can't propose principles. I've done it myself. No one is saying that past principles are binding on the committee. The policy says they're not, and common sense tells us they're not, otherwise how could anything ever change? No one is saying that clerks ought to enforce consistency, though it would be good if they were knowledgeable enough to warn of a clash. What John said, and what I am saying is false, is that principles are not binding on the community after the case is closed. If you agree with <i>that part of what John said</i>, please say so explicitly.

<p>I "happen to agree with John" that rulings are not binding on the community. It goes even further than that. The Committee could make an enforcement clause but <i>there is no requirement that the enforcement be implemented</i>. This limits the Committee to making rulings that the community is prepared to enforce. Enforcement is completely at the discretion of the community. It's fair to say that the rulings have a lot of persuasive power and should not be ignored or contradicted without a very good reason, but I don't think I can accept that Committee rulings are binding in any meaningful sense--although I'm open to persuasion on this. My point is not that you're wrong and John is right, but that experienced Wikipedians can have legitimate disagreements on this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 10:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this was what was at the heart of the Stevertigo administrator confirmation case. You may recall that I started a motion on the RFA, an eventually successful one, to return the case to the Committee with instructions that they should make the decision to flip his bit. My argument on that occasion was the arbcom was seen to encourage the worst kind of pile-on. The contrary argument is apparently that the arbitration committee was itself not willing to approach a steward and ask him to flip the bit without community input (which I suppose it got, in the rather unwelcome form of my motion) because this would take it too close to a committee that both makes and enforces rulings. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 10:22, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No admin is obliged to enforce policy or principle so in that sense there's no requirement that enforcement be implemented. But principles are mandatory in the sense that, as with policy, a person could be taken to the arbitration committee for being in violation.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding rulings contradicting each other or contradicting policy, I'm not aware of any case where a principle has been passed in deliberate contradiction of a policy, though in the BCE case, there was a brief discussion on the mailing list about whether the committee was in danger of making a ruling that would make part of the MoS policy, rather than, as now, just a guideline — and most people are opposed to the MoS becoming policy, so there was a brief flurry of concern that the committee was possibly about to pass part of it as a principle, concern caused precisely because it would then have been regarded as binding on the community.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say there's no question that committee decisions are seen as binding, and indeed, the committee is building up an impressive set of precedents at <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_Past_decisions_b8a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Past decisions">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Past decisions</a>. What would be great would be to have a couple of clerks (or whatever you wanted to call them) who were able to become very familiar with these, and advise the committee on implications, because as policy gets more complicated and principles more numerous, inadvertent contradictions and unforeseen consequences are inevitable. Those who don't like rules and process may scoff at this, of course, but nonetheless, I find it impressive that the committee has been so effective in expressing the spirit of the policies; and my earlier point is that it's a minefield for clerks not thoroughly familiar with policies and past cases. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'd be pretty surprised if the Committee made a ruling on precisely what style dates were presented in. Looking at the proposed decision, I see that <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>] and <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">JamesF</a> made various versions of a proposd principle that looks like a finding on style. These were not accepted, but not because they'd be binding but "we should not subvert the consensus development of style guidelines by approving a particular formulation of a style guideline." This is not so much that such principles would be <i>binding</i> as that, coming from a body such as the arbitration committee, they would tend to have persuasive effect which would subvert the development of style guidelines by the community. There was no question at any time of the manual of style becoming policy by fiat of the Committee. That is not how policy is made.</p>
<p>I'm already very familiar with the so-called "precedents"--one of my qualifications for the position of clerk is a knowledge of policy and practise. These are not really precedents, but useful background information that arbitrators, clerks, participants and others may use in learning about the decision-making process at arbiration level. In my opinion it is not for the clerks to tell the arbitrators that their proposed decisions are inconsistent with earlier ones. Consistency is neither required nor particularly desirable in this context, and it certainly should not be imposed by a clerical body. Clerks should never become policemen of the arbitration process; their function exists solely to take administrative burden from the shoulders of the committee. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:57, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd suggest that it doesn't hurt for clerks–or anyone else–to <i>politely</i> and <i>reasonably</i> pose a question along the lines of, "The ArbCom stated <i>foo</i> as a principle in the arbitration regarding User:Bar. This case seems to be parallel for reasons X, Y, and Z; is there a reason why <i>foo</i> shouldn't be adopted here, too?"</dd>
<dd>Reasonable responses might include
<ul>
<li>"That's a good idea. We forgot about <i>foo</i>."</li>
<li>"We tried <i>foo</i>, and it caused a lot of trouble in retrospect; we're not going to do it again without a good reason."</li>
<li>"While <i>foo</i> was reasonable at the time, we'd like to try a different approach."</li>
<li>"This new case is similar, but unique from the old case for reasons A, B, and C; <i>foo</i> probably isn't appropriate."</li>

<dd>Sort of, but what you will actually see happen is a clerk (or for that matter, an arbitrator, participant or any other person able to edit a wiki) will put up a proposed principle, remedy or enforcement from an earlier case on the workshop and add "as V Andal, Pusher and Trolle, 2004" as a comment with perhaps a link to that case. This already happens, it's not like the arbitrators were being nudged or anything. Maybe sometimes, when we get a handle on the job and know what the arbitrators expect, a clerk will also haul out a list of relevant proposals and plonk them onto the proposed decision as well as the workshop. But this will simply be a way of saving the arbitrators doing it. It should never be done in the manner of advocating consistency with past decisions per se, but rather how to anticipating how the <i>present</i> committee is likely to want to deal with the case. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 21:05, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the question of someone being hauled before the Committee for breaching a principle adopted in another case, this doesn't happen.

<p>First off, apologies for not responding sooner -- in case you missed the red and black announcement at the top of my userpage, I've been without internet for almost a week (except for an hour on Monday). While Sarah (SlimVirgin) has assessed the situation WRT the WebEx case correctly, when I said that arbcom rulings do not set precedent, I was referring to the fact that the arbcom is not bound by its past decisions. While principles the committee accepts are typically good advice to the community, from my experience, they are not binding on the community. I've never heard of anyone waving an arbcom case and yelling "Hey, you need to assume good faith!" Instead they cite the relevant guideline/policy/whatever. I see nothing in Guettarda's comment(s) to disagree with, and would like to point out that I didn't take offense at his comments in the WebEx workshop -- I was just defending the way I read policy. And I think the "Should clerks recuse themselves from cases they presented evidence in?" question has been resolved at <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Clerks_Administration_5624.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee/Clerks/Administration">Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee/Clerks/Administration</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:02, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry if I missed any relevant discussion, but I could not find any mention of a community discussion evaluating the (somewhat new) concept of clerks, which was supposed to take place in March.

<dd>Speaking of my own experience, my case was opened ineptly and incompletely by a non-clerk who simply created a workshop page, no evidence page, no main page and no proposed decision page. I didn't feel comfortable about completing the opening myself so it took several days to get it opened properly so that the case could proceed. I feel that this was a failure of the clerk system and would prefer that a more pro-active approach were taken to the kind of car crash that can develop when parties start workshopping without any evidence. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:12, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To quote from the Clerk's page, <i>Clerks are not empowered to vote on decisions, nor do they have exclusive right to summarizing evidence, <b>suggesting decisions, analysis or other methods of assisting the Arbitration process</b>.</i> I think the quoted text above straddles the line between summary and analysis to assist the Arbitration process, but I can see nothing in the Clerk's charter which prohibits this. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a><sup>(<a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkSplotch_71d8.html" title="User talk:InkSplotch">talk</a>)</sup> 01:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyone can submit analysis or suggestions to the Arbcom in any case. Clerks are not an exception.

<li>Surely this is intended <i>not</i> to imply that clerks can submit analysis and recomendations in their official capacity as clerks, but to indicate that they in fact have no additional authority? That anyone can say "please reject/ please accept" if they want to? Can we look at this another way: What in this section <i>needed</i> to have the wax seal of a clerk affixed to it?</li>
<li>Imagine the horror if in some random AfD I created an "admins opinions" section, based upon the logical extension of this argument: Admins aren't <i>forbidden</i> from stating opinons. Of course we are discouraged from implying that their opinion has any extra weight, which is what this section appears to do.<br />

<li>I'm trying to say, nothing on this page prohibits a clerk from submitting analysis or recommendations. And I agree, it even indicates their analysis carries no additional authority...so I don't see why this has become an issue. Look at it this way, if Tony involved himself with that RFAr request <i>because he felt it his duty as a clerk</i> why should he not affix his seal?</li>
<li>For someone bold enough to reformat their RfA, I don't understand where this is coming from. Go ahead, start an "Admins Opinions" section in an AfD (and I would never be silly enough to suggest there wouldn't be a commotion, but) it's just formatting. There's nothing improper about it. It's when the admin working AfD starts saying, "per the Admins' Opinions (because I don't like the other bits), I'm doing X" that it becomes a problem. I've seen you working AfD, and it's some of what's most impressed me about you since you became an Admin. It's hard, and I can tell you're doing you're best to do what right by the job (when that's your duty). If you can extend that same faith to the ArbCom, I think you'll see why your fears are misplaced. Tony's just doing what he was appointed to do as a clerk..I've not seen him suggest once, here or elsewhere, that it makes his opinions worth anything more than another's. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a><sup>(<a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkSplotch_71d8.html" title="User talk:InkSplotch">talk</a>)</sup> 13:08, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is to my mind a case of an editor taking an over-literal reading of the wording of the Clerk's page. My actual personal opinion on the case, which I did not give in the summary above, had been given on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> in response to a plan to unblock rgulerdem, who had agreed to a stringent but informal mentorship.</p>
<p>My analysis introduced some facts that, while not raised by the parties, may be relevant to the case. I also emphasized other facts of possible relevance. This was an unusual arbitration request because it appeared to be an appeal against a community-imposed remedy. I know that historically and philosophically the Arbitration Committee has been wary of pre-empting the community's decision-making mechanisms, although I myself sometimes adopt a more liberal view and, had I been an arbitrator, I might well have been inclined to support a more interventionist iterpretation of the Committee's role. I thus, to some extent, briefed against my personal opinion. Yes, Clerks do that. We take our job seriously.</p>
<p>Events since that request have tended to bear out my analysis of this particular case: community discussion was renewed and a mentorship was discussed. If this discussion should fail, it would be relevant to a renewed request for arbitration. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 08:09, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not questioning that your analysis of the situation as it was then was accurate. I'm not even questioning the use of pink boxes with "clerk notes" on them. I think your comments were useful and helped cut through a thicket, and I think the idea's useful in general, it would cut through a lot of ghafla. (I have a small question, does "clerk notes" imply consensus among all clerks, or the thinking of the clerk assigned to the case, or just the thinking of one random clerk that popped by? That is not clear as it is formatted now. But the ArbComm already said they'd be talking about this and clarifying, which is good enough, even for a <a href="../../../w/o/n/WP%7EWONK_b33f.html" title="WP:WONK">process wonk</a> like me...)</dd>

<dd>What I'm questioning is <i>you and Phil</i> giving the appearance of jumping on Aaron in a fit of pique instead of discussing whether this apparently new process introduction makes sense. Aaron knows better than to futz around that way, I have no idea what he was thinking, but you guys <i>way</i> overreacted and you both know better too. There are so many ways you could have handled this better. You could have talked. You could have asked for help on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">AN/I</a> from some other admin to avoid the appearance you were jumping on him. And even now you could handle it better, because you could admit that maybe that perception that you guys were jumping on him exists among some of us, and that you could have acted differently then, (and still can now) instead of just sticking to "Tony is right". Tony, you're one of our most effective clerks and I think clerking is a good thing, but geez. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar"><font color="blue">+</font></a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:21, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tony, I think you're missing the point. If it had been a <i>different</i> two clerks, your comments might make more sense.

<dd>Friday: Nod. That's it <b>exactly</b>. It's perhaps a general case good principle as Hamster Sandwich suggests, (although Hammy may be stating it too strongly for a Clerk supporter such as myself), but one that I think particularly and especially applies to <i>Aaron</i> vs. <i>Phil/Tony</i>. Now and forever more, apparently. This was a tough lesson for me to learn in a previous life... there just are people I was not able to effectively censure and I would have served the project better by asking someone else to do it, serving two purposes, validating that it wasn't just my animus baying for blood, and preserving impartiality of the office. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar"><font color="blue">+</font></a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:02, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As Wikipedia editors you know better than this. This sudden construction of an ad hoc rule that clerks are in some manner <i>involved</i> with anyone who has expressed reservations about clerking is simply not acceptable. Criticising clerks or the institution of clerking doesn't give you an "out". It doesn't make clerks "involved" with you.</p>
<p>My observation that two clerks simultaneously and independently blocked doesn't demonstrate, nor was it ever intended to demonstrate, the infallibility of clerks; that is a complete straw man. It does, however, demonstrate that the thinking amongst at least some clerks on this issue tends to coincide. It is always a bad idea to engage in edit warring on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>.</p>
<p>Friday raises another issue. He seems to be exercised by the fact that <i>these</i> two clerks chose to block. There's a converse to that: Aaron chose to edit war. Editors who have a history of vandalism, sock puppetry and allegations of serious malfeasance against arbitrators probably shouldn't try their luck in edit warring. Anywhere. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 08:10, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes, Aaron should have known better (whether it was edit warring or not is a matter not completely clear to me, it turns on interpretations of events) than to even futz around at all. But you should have too, and you were the big escalator, and you're not internalising that. Repeated for emphasis: <b>there just are people I was not able to effectively censure and I would have served the project better by asking someone else to do it</b>.</dd>
<dd>This rule seems to apply across just about every project I've ever seen enough of to have some visibility to norms, and I've seen a lot. I admit it. This is <b>not</b> ideal. In an ideal world there is no past history, no bad feelings, no preconceived notion of who is and isn't (anything). We, however, don't live in an ideal world. You may be right that there shouldn't <i>be</i> such a defacto restriction, but there is. Either you abide by it in advance, or you get messes. <i>What we have here, is a failure to communicate. What we have here, is a <b>mess</b></i>. The question now is does this continue to escalate, or do we find an end to it? One end to it is that we all decide to agree you're always right and subsequently it drives Aaron off the project (because if you continue to censure him in future that's the outcome, I guar-on-tee it). Another end to it is that you admit there may be some validity to what others are saying and modify how you approach things a bit, as you have been asked/forced to do in the past. Maybe there are others? <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar"><font color="blue">+</font></a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:45, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are checkuser clerks being referred to, not ArbCom. They are supposed to reduce the burden on those performing checkuser (who are overloaded) by organising and streamlining requests. I recall it being discussed before the volunteers started, but I can't recall where at the moment. Not sure it has anything to do with ArbCom clerking at all. Hope that helps. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 11:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lar is correct.

<p>Petty officials in all ages have worn one sort of fez or another to announce their office and shield them from at least a portion of the slop that is otherwise tipped upon their heads as they go about their officious business.
