<dd>While I agree there are some possible issues with public voting, I didn't see them as a problem in any way in the 2006 election.

<p>Personally, I didn't vote at all in the last election because I think that open elections can cause problems. A lot of candidates dropped out mid-race. And there seemed to be some bickering IIRC. Boardvote seems to me to be a much better solution. — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">Ilyan</span></a><a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_Esperanza_a2a7.html" title="User:Ilyanep/Esperanza"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:green;">e</span></a><a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">p</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:#808080;">(Talk)</span></a> 21:25, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With open voting the entire community can serve as <i>election officials</i>, being able to input on duplicate votes/members failing to meet sufferage, and other issues. With closed, we have to enlist election officials to handle all of this, not even looking at the transparency issue. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 14:03, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If the usernames of people who have votes are public as in the Board elections, the community can check for duplicate votes and suffrage. The amount of transparency offered in the board elections was sufficient for me, and I would definitely prefer a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_ballot.html" title="Secret ballot">secret ballot</a>. As the ArbCom is elected and not discussed and decided by consensus, let us run proper elections. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 11:50, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure that's true since Jimbo theoretically has a lot of discression in how closely to follow the exact election ranking, so he may find the reasoning behind votes usefull. As a practial matter though, there seems to be a fair amount of sentiment in favour of a secret ballot. I would suggest a highly publicized straw poll in order to gauge consensus on whether we should change the system or not. It should be started fairly soon if we want to have the process ready by December. I propose
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>The same system as last year</b>: An Rfa style ballot in which each voter can vote <b>support</b> or <b>oppose</b> on each candidate. All candidates with &gt;50% support (i.e. as many supports as opposes) are eligible for appointment to ArbCom.</li>
<li><b>A secret ballot using <a href="../../../b/o/a/Special%7EBoardvote_bbfa.html" title="Special:Boardvote">Special:Boardvote</a></b>: Aproval voting in which voters either support a candidate or do not. No limit on how many candidates a voter can support. The ten (?) candidates with the highest level of support are eligible for appointment to ArbCom.</li>

<p>Can we please hurry up and decide whether to use Special:Boardvote or not? If Jimbo has objections, can he please post them here? If we need election officials, can we recruit some here? My current thought is that if we use the RFA system I shall boycott the elections and petition others to do likewise. <span class="ipa"><a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphax_a96c.html" title="User:Alphax">[ælfəks]</a></span> 05:29, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have no objection in principle to a secret ballot, but the standard wiki voting system is much more in line with our traditions and appears to produce better results. When we used Special:BoardVote, we saw a significant amount of trolling and negative campaigning. With the wiki system, we get much better behavior. Additionally, even though Special:BoardVote is theoretically "approval voting", the fact of the matter is that people have tended to use it incorrectly (in my opinion) leading to very low rates of approval. Wiki voting tends to produce high levels of support, and this is important for the confidence and credibility of the committee. We can use the same system as last year again this year, so that we can get things moving quickly, and then after that, we can talk about possible alternatives going forward.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 18:56, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have <b>zero</b> confidence in any election process that makes individual votes visible. While it may seem open, the process of open ballot elections permits a level of bullying, favoritism, fear of retaliation, and groupthink that defeat the purpose of a free election. If Special:Boardvote is good enough for board elections, it should be good enough for ArbCom elections also. For these reasons, it's doubtful that I'll be participating in this election. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriona_934d.html" title="User:Triona">Stephanie Daugherty (Triona)</a> - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETriona_5b3e.html" title="User talk:Triona">Talk</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Comment</a> - 08:20, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could we limit eligibility to candidates with 1000 edits minimum (or thereabouts, per Geni) <i>or</i> to candidates who are nominated by editors with those qualifications?

<dd>Perhaps a two-stage process?
<ul>
<li>Stage one. Candidates put forward their names and a candidate statement. Editors may support the nominations only; there would be no oppose votes. Candidates would have to receive a minimum of ten (five? twenty? <i>x</i>?) nominations from individuals meeting some suffrage requirement to proceed to stage two. This would also be an excellent time for seasoned editors to encourage unlikely-to-succeed candidates to withdraw.</li>
<li>Stage two. All candidates who receive the required number of nominations would be eligible (but not required) to participate in the full elections.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This mimics the common election practice of requiring nominators to support candidates for office before those candidates get their names on the ballot. It would also provide opportunities for candidates to gracefully bow out, be screened out, or to rethink their approach.</dd>
<dd>It cuts down on the time spent reading up on hopeless candidates—individuals who can't drum up support to clear the nomination threshold aren't going to make it in the general election. As the 'shoo-in' candidates clear the nomination bar in stage one, their nominations can be flagged to again reduce the amount of reading that nominators will have to do. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 03:15, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. If you can't vote for someone, you shouldn't be able to be voted for. (Apologies for the horrible grammar.) Someone who has edited a bit and is still around after 3 months is far more likely to know what they are getting themselves into than, for example, either an inactive 3 month old account or a one-week old account with 150 edits. I would like to see if there is consensus for this before moving on. If there is no consensus for any qualifications for candidacy, and I believe that this is the bottom of suggestions, then there is no point in proposals based on actual voting behavior, such as "must have been an administrator for at least three months". - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 20:20, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>150 edits last time. With the number of sleeper accounts around it is nessacery. Arbcom need quite a high level of knowlage about wikipedia. I doubt there are many people with 150 edits who have that and in any case they are going to have a hard time getting votes.

<dd>But if we just let people run regardless of their edit count, we can have our ideology with no costs to the pragmatists. Anybody can run (and theoretically win if the community and Jimbo find them qualified), while voters who feel that low-edit count candidates are no-hopers can simply refrain from looking at those candidates. (Admittedly this presumes that voters are capable of looking at a number next to a candidates name and checking if it is greater than whatever their standard is.)

<dd>Right. The simpler the procedures are kept, the better. Let anybody who feels like running run, no need for nominations, etc. In several days after the voting starts half of the candidates will drop or get very bad percentages (support divided by total).

<dd>I don't think the number of candidates starting the process matters overmuch (although there is certainly no problem with giving them a realistic appraisal of chances of success, since nobody with under a few thousand edits is likely to get through), I think what needs to be done is to encourage people to withdraw once it is clear that they will not pass, and remove these from the main election page. If we can make the main campaign page just a list of names and current tally (or names, brief statement and current tally) - i.e. keep the long lists of sigs in a &lt;noinclude&gt; - and as I say encourage people to drop out to keep numbers down, that should achieve all we need to achieve. Anything else is vulnerable to end up as instruction creep.

<p>As someone recently noted on the administrators' noticeboard, we seem to be a bit behind schedule here. The page indicates that candidate statements may be posted as of October 1 and the election will be held in December, but there are no statements posted and it appears the election rules have not yet been finalized. What is the current status and plan? Also, is there any indication whether the current ArbCom members whose terms are about to expire intend to run for re-election?

<dd>Currently the elections will be run in a simlar way to last year. Problem is that everyone except Jimbo thinks that way sucks but there isn't much we can do about that. No idea if which if any arbcom members will run.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 21:03, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think things sucked that much last year. OK, the devil may be in the details, but that open vote with support/oppose was definitely much better than the closed vote with supports only for the Wikimedia foundation. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 03:06, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm somewhat bemused about this myself. Apparently statements have been accepted since about a month ago, but as long as the page says <i>"Note this is not a final version"</i> it doesn't seem rational to submit a statement - and currently there aren't any. Presumably there'll be a "ready, set, go" moment when the page is finalised, and it becomes widely advertised that statements are being accepted - any idea when? Tomorrow will be a month until the deadline for self-nominations. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do we want to increase the number of seats on the committee? The committee isn't always at full strength and maybe we need to expand a little more. I can't see any harm in adding another three seats, increasing the number up for election to 8. That would increase the committee to 17 and make it an odd number, a good idea in my mind for decision making committees. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 15:01, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The committee at full strength is 15 members (there is currently one vacancy that is one of the seats being filled in this election), so there is already an odd number of members (and in any event, it doesn't matter that much whether the number is even or odd, because it <i>never</i> happens that all the ArbCom members sit in any given case). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:31, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I missed the vacant seat when I counted up at the committee page. I don't see that it's too late to discuss it since the page states "the number of seats that will be up for election is unknown but will probably be at least 5". I'd say it's too late when voting starts. So, given the committee is rarely at full strength, is expansion in order? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:07, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Expansion would also be something that current arbitrators might have views on. Is their workload too much? Would they welcome an expansion?

<dd>I suspect it's all up to Jimbo. Last year he increased the number of seats from 12 to 15 without any prior announcement or consultation. I suspect 15 is near the maximum practical number, but if there are more highly supported candidates then there are seats, he could conceivable do it again. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:17, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If there were further increases, they would be in multiples of three (one extra arbitrator per tranche). Fifteen could very well be near the upper practical limit for the current system where all active arbitrators hear every case. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 09:21, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">Bainer</a> is probably right that if the number of Arbitors be extended to 18 or 21 it would make sense to split duties so that each member is assigned to only certain cases. I'd say 21, random assignment by senior member, each hear 50% or cases; but such a system may not be in the cards. Though it might be worth discussion as the caseload is likely to be increasing for the forseeable future. Seperately though, I see that there has been a vacancy on the arbcom since February only a month after the last election. If Jimbo didn't appoint anyone to that slot (as my reading of the election procedures suggests he could have), he presumably won't appoint anyone to fill vacancies in the coming year. Thus only five slots are likely to be filled based on these results unless someone without an expiring term resigns before the end of the year. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 12:14, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One thing I'm confused about. With the ongoing reorganisation of the Wikimedia Foundation Board, and Jimbo stepping down as Chair (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_Signpost_2006-10-30_Board_reorganization_9898.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-10-30/Board reorganization">here</a>), how does that impact Jimbo's relationship with the en wikipedia and its ArbCom?

<p>From my reading of that thread, the situation seems to be "normal level of clarity, to wit mud-like". Is there a centralised discussion of this anywhere, either on the (en) mailing list, or on-wiki, or just brushfire outbreaks of confusion and doubt? Call me a dangerous radical, but I'm of the view that a) the election should be just that, an election, not "voting followed by semi-correlated appointments"; and b) the terms of same should be made explicit in advance, rather than declaring the numbers of vacancies/appointments after the fact, which is an extension of the above "not an election" practices. In the worst case, if JW is declared to have "reserve powers" by the WMF (or by the community, or as seems likely, by himself, recursively), at least have the provisions for "vetos" or "captain's picks" made expressly and explicitly in advance, not after the fact tinkering. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:52, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is a difference between AGF and feeding the trolls, and this editor clearly crossed the line, and revealed his <i>a priori</i> intentions with his behavior.

<p>I'd like to recommend consideration of an entirely <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomination.html" title="Nomination">no-nomination</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-partisan_democracy.html" title="Non-partisan democracy">non-partisan</a>, electioneering-free system. Such systems have advantages such as offering more choice to voters as well as avoiding self-aggrandizement, partisanship, etc. Of course, any individuals so chosen could decline, but I believe a no-nomination system presents a better solution and is more in line with the consensus-building (rather than individualistic) aims and methods of Wikipedia. I think contributors are intelligent enough to make informed choices by witnessing the behavior of fellow Wikipedians without needing to read speeches. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettz9_d368.html" title="User:Brettz9">Brettz9</a> 08:42, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's already self-nomination (pure no-nomination would be impractical, since there are those who would possibly win yet have no desire for the job) and while technically non-partisan with the exception of candidate statements and questions, the true pain of partisanship comes from groups which tend to vote as a block, as innocently as "this person is my friend, so I'm going to vote for him" or as complex and sneaky as real-world politics infringing upon our elections. The largest obstacle to nonpartisan elections lies in between these two, where private campaigning amongst large groups of friends takes place in the vein of "If you vote for John's friend Charles in the ArbCom elections, our group will support your bid for Adminship when it comes up". None of that sort of thing will ever be visible in a diff, and is the most difficult type of vote-abuse to rout, as by the time it's discovered, the perpetrators are already entrenched in positions of trust. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 19:33, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, your statement about the obstacle is I think correct, but I don't think that pure no-nomination is impractical since, as occurs in other such systems as exist in the real world, as I mentioned, "any individuals so chosen could decline". I really prefer to deal with non-self-promoters in the case of representatives (and feel I can trust them more since I chose them of my own accord in witness of their services); maybe if others agree to this, a statement could be put out as to its rationale; a referendum (vote count) could be put on whether to adapt the system. And if it is adopted, again, if those elected do not wish to shoulder the responsibility and honor bestowed on them, they can bow out after appointment, but people's choices, I believe, should not be restrained ahead of time. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettz9_d368.html" title="User:Brettz9">Brettz9</a> 13:47, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, apart from the question of whether Jayjg will run for re-election, I was wondering if there is likely to be a rush of last-minute candidates? What happened in the last elections in January? There are currently 31 candidates for this election, and there were 68 in the last election. Also, what happens in the period between the closing of nominations (1 December) and the opening of voting (4 December)? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:28, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The edit-count qualification for candidates has kept the number down. Without checking, maybe 20+ candidates last time were hopelessly underqualified/inexperienced? So the number is not that far off. We have no way of knowning if there will be a late rush, a late trickle, or nothing, unless individuals tell us they will enter at the 11th hour. If I guessed a number, say 5 more (making 36), it would just be a guess.

<p>Some collaborative work has been taking place to produce the summary table seen <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006_Candidate_statements_a528.html#Summary_table_for_ArbCom_Elections_2006" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2006/Candidate statements">here</a>. There may be better tables around elsewhere, and the Signpost might also produce some useful summaries of information. I suppose the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the current form of this table acceptable. ie. does it strike a balance between usefully summarising information (good) and over-emphasising certain aspects of a candidate's record (bad)?</li>
<li>What needs to be changed and how can it be improved further?</li>
<li>Can it/should it be made more visible? Where is the best place to put the table? How can this be done without giving the wrong impression that it is in any way official? How can it be made clear that it is mostly produced by the voters, and not the candidates?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the summary table is acceptable, I'd be happy to maintain and update it until the elections start, though I'd hope that it would also be maintained by the community, in the same way that it was built. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:38, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pendantic and maybe slightly unnecessary, but I'm interested in a list of those candidates that nominated themselves and then withdrew.

<p><i>"Self-nominations were accepted up to 1 December 2006"</i> - does this mean candidates can still be nominated by third parties, or is it completely closed now?

<dd>I think the wording was originally intended to reinforce that the nomination process was by self-nomination, not nomination by third parties.

<p>Can't see this recorded on this talk page or other election pages, so I thought I'd drop a note here in case the example can help in planning for future elections.

<dd>Oh, I agree. What is your view on <i>comments</i> along with votes (not discussions, which are removed to the talk page as above, but comments). Some comments are particularly strongly worded (eg. <b>Oppose</b> not in a month of Sundays). Working with someone after that can be problematic. Would it be an idea for the new ArbCom to consider ethical guidelines that recommends that sitting arbitrators and candidates do not add comments to their votes? Obviously this would be a guideline only, as you shouldn't prevent people from <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_speech.html" title="Free speech">expressing their opinions</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, Arbitrators are longstanding members of the Wikipedia community who are deeply involved in its operation. In addition, they are (or ought to be, at any rate) intimately familiar with the responsibilities, rights, and obligations associated with being a member of the ArbCom. Candidates – at least those who have a chance of success – who have not previously been associated with ArbCom are nevertheless heavily involved in contributing to and/or administering the operation of Wikipedia, furthermore they have shown a willingness to commit the time to stand for (and participate in) ArbCom. In other words, the participants in the election are among the most active contributors to Wikipedia, and among the most intimately acquainted with our policies and practices. I think that we would do ourselves a disservice to muzzle these members of the community during such an important decision-making process.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, I would expect all candidates to be unfailingly civil and decorous should they choose to criticise another candidate. Obviously the ArbCom needs to be able to function at least somewhat collaboratively, and I expect (and hope) that voters will punish candidates who can't be bothered to follow one of our most important user conduct policies in interacting with their potential future colleagues. (I also think we all would prefer to see people who can abide by <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> on the ArbCom.) On the issue of candidates voting for themselves, I see no harm in it—but I would hope Jimbo will be reluctant to select candidates who need their own vote to clear a 50% approval threshold. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:26, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On that last point, I'd like to hope that Jimmy Wales will seek to 'ease' himself into the position of being an election official per se (or not directly involved), as opposed to the one person involved with a "preference vote" (with arbitrarily large weighting, indeed). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 07:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hopefully he will vote right at the very end of the process, if at all. I'm waiting right until the end, but for other reasons (well, mainly because I haven't had time to read all the questions and answers yet). If votes at the end can influence the process (actually not that likely), that seems reasonable. Anyway, Jimbo can select any five above 50%, not just the top 5. Did Jimbo vote in the other elections? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:59, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't believe he did, but personally I'd have no objection at all if he did so. What I <i>do</i> object to is the "selection" process that you (re-)describe: that's exactly what I was saying above. My point about "voting" being that for all intents and purposes, everyone else is just "hopefully expressing an opinion", JW is the only person with any effective "preference" or "electoral" franchise. Which seems to me to be highly unsatisfactory, since it's (as usual) as clear as mud whether this is by mandate of Foundation, whether JW personally has 'residual powers' (or indeed total power) as constitutional-monarch-without-a-constitution, whether this is being presumed to be by common consent, etc. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 14:28, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason we and some of the other large Wikipedias have the Arbitration Committee is because we're too big and Jimbo doesn't have enough hours in the day for him to act as the final arbiter of disputes as he used to. It seems reasonable to me that Jimbo should be able to choose who he likes to act as what is essentially his proxy, so long as they're more liked than loathed. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a democracy, after all. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Sam, that saves me one c'n'p when I get round to composing a semi-standard question to that effect. But let me remind you the gloss of that point is "Its primary method of determining consensus is discussion, not voting", not, "Its primary method of decision-making is Jimmy Wales, who may delegate as he wishes.", and that its scope is expanded to say "or any other political system", not that it's specifically something-else-other-than-a-democracy. I have to say that what bugs me most is not the exercise of such functions, but the murkiness under which they occur: which seems to be increasing, rather than decreasing. Why is it not possible to enumerate them, and make explicit why they're being exercised? Otherwise, when JW edits the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> article, and says 'don't change this without consulting me' or such like, it causes consternation as to whether this is a 'you'll be sanctioned by the arbcom if you then become further involved' matter. Does JW in fact exercise these in any other Wikipedia, whether large or small? (Note that throughout I mean JW personally, not on behalf of ther Foundation (which I recognise is in some senses moot, since he has a 'controlling share' of the Foundation, but again, I'd much prefer if it were made explicit what was and what was not a Foundation decision).) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 17:32, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting graph, I love this sort of thing. I just want to point out a few things. First of all, there is a high likelihood that at least six people will be appointed to the ArbComm, given the recent resignation of one arbitrator who was not up for re-election. Also, in light of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93485957" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93485957" rel="nofollow">this post by Jimbo</a>, I believe that <i>if</i> Jimbo decides to appoint from the top of the list (in percentage terms) down, and not skip anyone, the logical number to appoint would be seven. (This would seem especially logical in light of the comment by Fys above, regarding an arbitrator who seems to be missing.) There is a significant gap in percentage terms between #7 and #8, while #4 through #7 are bunched together and #6 and #7 were virtually tied (less than a half percentage-point apart.) Personally I am hoping that this is exactly what Jimbo does -- of course, my opinion is somewhat influenced by who I voted for, but I also think it seems logical. I also think that the logical ordering of the candidates is their percentage vote (the vertical axis on your graph) and not Support minus Oppose votes (the horizontal axis.) Actually, the real issue here comes down to the fact that Can't Sleep, etc., received an unusual number of total votes (99 more than anyone else), resulting in him having the highest number of Support votes and coming in fourth in Support minus Oppose, but (coincidentally) being #8 in percentage terms. I think it's just a question of how Jimbo chooses to deal with a situation that was probably unanticipated, but I don't see any logic to deciding in terms of raw votes. The real issue probably would be whether Jimbo decides to appoint the top 7 or the top 8 -- or something else entirely. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 21:05, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well there is a rationale for looking at <i>#Support – #Oppose</i>, and that's that there were possibly more than 1,000 voters (I'm eyeballing here), the majority of which "voted" neutral for all candidates (Can't Sleep got the most total votes, but still less than 500). So <i>((+1)* #Support + (0)* #Neutral + (–1)* #Oppose) / #Voters</i> (which can be normalized to <i>#Support – #Oppose</i>) is just as reflective of community approval as <i>#Support / (#Support + #Oppose)</i>. And it does away with the (admittedly hypothetical) case of a candidate getting 85.7% approval based on 6 Supports and 1 Oppose. Of course this is all complete wonkery. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:32, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hopefully the appointments will be from the top of the election winners and non-controversial. My bigger concern is that, as luck would have it, ArbCom has accepted four new cases within the past two days, and looks likely to accept at least two more currently pending applications. If the transition isn't managed well, that means the newly constituted ArbCom is going to start off the year with a huge backlog, which would be highly undesirable in terms of getting cases resolved promptly which has been the biggest problem all year with our arbitration policy. I've left a note for Jimbo urging that he make his appointments as soon as he reasonably and conveniently can so the new arbs can start getting up to speed. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the graph, trialsanderrors; it certainly mirrors the way I was eyeballing the results. I would say that all of the top seven have clear community consensus to serve on ArbCom, but with six empty seats 7 is a tricky number to appoint since it leaves one Tranche bigger than the others. Jimbo, of course, has a variety of options, but I would say just appoint six and fill any vacancies that arise with whoever gets left out this time. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 04:43, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is also possible that there really will be an expansion. Didn't Jimbo warn that this was possible? There are smaller breaks in percentage further down. I could see more than 7. And it doesn't bother me. Without refering to individuals, I am delighted with the overall profile of those with the most support. If a question mark were to be included, it would not reduce the overall effect. These were good elections. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 05:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder when Jimbo will appoint the new ArbCom members, since Mindspillage recently resigned then there should be seven appointed. I think the graph is kind of a good idea and let's see what Jimbo has to say. We shall wait for the results, excited to see who are part of the ArbCom. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_E_a7df.html" title="User:Terence Ong/E"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> 07:45, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Overall the elections went smoothly. However, one thing I believe we should be stricter in next year is moving voter's comments to the talk page. It's probably best to move all such comments, but especially comments that are rather lengthy or contain diffs should be moved. The reason is that opposers tend to use these to cast the candidate in bad light by give a one-sided view of a situation he was involved in, in a manner that the candidate cannot really respond to on the voting page. Voters that feel the need to write a long story about the candidate tend to be people with an axe to grind, anyway. It would be easy to construct a bot to do the moving. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
