	    <p>Hi! I'm candidating for the ArbCom because I believe in justice in Wikipedia and think I can bring about positive change as to the fairness of arbitration procedures. I have worked in mediation in the past, and also in various cases at both the English and Romanian Wikipedias. If I become an arbitrator, my most important consideration will be to look at both sides impartially and to guarantee that the rights of the accused are always upheld in the fairest way. I am a firm believed in dialogue, and I always aim to make sure that both sides understand very well what the dispute is about, since I believe that alienation and misunderstanding is the most significant and most dangerous root of conflict. It is only through true justice and transparency that we can bring about a better, more stable and more trustworthy Wikipedia community. Feel free to ask any questions on this page.

<dd>Yes, very much so. I'm very keen on having a solid framework for user rights. There is perhaps one point I'm not that supportive of, namely #5 ("All Administrators must enforce Arbitration Committee rulings.") which is open to interpretation and I think places a somewhat unfair burden on administrators, especially in conflicts of interest. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 07:27, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How do you view the role (and relative importance) of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> in the process of building a factually accurate encyclopedia? How do you view editors who are normally correct in article namespace, but who may be perceived as rude – including to longtime, popular editors and admins – on Talk pages and the like?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> is very important in that without respect for each other, the process of building Wikipedia becomes very problematic. In my opinion, respect, understanding and empathy are the core community values we need in order to streamline work on an encyclopedia and reduce community conflict. I generally don't view rude, arrogant editors too well, no matter what their credentials or expertise may be. As I said before, I think rudeness and uncivility breeds conflict and misunderstading, affecting the progress of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 07:38, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Do you have an academic background of any kind, and if so, in what field? How do you handle critiques from your peers and professors (assuming those aren’t one and the same), which may be sharply worded or otherwise skirt the edges of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> even if they are correct? Considering those professors who have recently had you as a student, what would <i>they</i> tell me if I asked them the same question about you?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I current work for a non-government organisation that seeks to further minority rights. I'm generally very open about constructive criticism. If criticism is uncivil, I'm not one that gets angry - I generally try to talk to people and hear out their queries before making a judgement on their behaviour. At Wikipedia, and in real life, I have often been involved in cases where two people were having a dispute, and I tried to get both of them to look at the problem more calmly and empathise with each other. As to professors, they would probably say I take criticism quite openly and without worry (for me, free speech is tantamount), though to be honest, I have also been called stubborn my some people (in the sense that, I've accepted criticism but not always followed out suggestions which I consider to not necessarily be beneficial/positive). <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 07:38, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What are your views on the proposed policy <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Code_of_Conduct_4d1b.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Code of Conduct">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Code of Conduct</a>? Whether you think it should be a formal policy or not, do you believe you would generally act in accordance with it? What aspects of it do you think should not be there, or to put it another way, are there any proposals there which you can think of good reasons to ignore on a regular basis? (Please date any replies to this question as the proposal may well change over time.)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I have read the policy and I agree with it, particularly the structures that seek to ensure user rights in arbitration. For me, this is very important, because I think the Arbitration Committee has to act in the utmost fairness and transparency to be considered (otherwise, as I said before, alienation and conflict sets in, and that's most detrimental for any society or community). It is deeply disappoint to read of cases where arbitrators are friends or acquiantances of one side involved in arbitration and therefore pass unfair judgements. As to the specificity of the code - some users have raised doubts over its length, saying that it should be more general. I believe, however, that the Arbitration Committee should be treated seriously and should act professionally. Sure, Wikipedia isn't a court or anything, but there should be a structure - the ArbCom, in this case - that deals with matters very seriously and impartially. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 07:38, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How much of your Wikipedia time do you plan to spend on ArbCom business?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>If elected to ArbCom, I would prioritise this activity in front of others, because I think we need a working, fair justice system here at Wikipedia. So, I can't tell you in exact terms, but I will spend as much time as is necessary. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 08:46, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>If you were elected and had to spend most of your time in ArbCom delibations, which projects would you consider to be the most negatively affected by your absence?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, it would probably affect longer-term series or article improvement projects, such as Romania-related WikiProjects or improvements of articles to bring them up to featured status. However, in recent times, I have become less involved in encyclopedia matters and more involved in administrative-community matters, so hopefully the change won't be as significant. Of course, in arbitration-intensive times, other activities of mine such as mediation between users or in disputed articles (such as <a href="../../../m/o/l/Talk%7EMoldovan_language_b467.html" title="Talk:Moldovan language">Talk:Moldovan language</a>) may also suffer. While I do favour mediation over arbitration, I do think that ArbCom is more important as a fair system for higher-level disputes than the MedCom. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 08:46, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>To what extent would those projects be affected?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of WikiProjects, I probably wouldn't have as much time for research and organisation - instead, my edits would be more related to copyediting and the like. So, I suppose some Romania-related articles (which is where I contribute most) would suffer, even though there is an ever-growing Romanian Wikipedia community at en.wp that usually work on the very same articles as me. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 08:46, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, to an extent I suppose I do hold strong political opinions, though not religious ones. I'm atheist, humanist and liberal, so I don't think any of those values will ultimately conflict with ArbCom cases. I'm not American, so I really have no strong opinion concerning George Bush.

<dd>Yes, I do. I think ArbCom should fully investigate the activities of all people involved in a case, including the complainant. Again, that's for purposes of fairness. If there's one thing that I definitely don't like, it's the ganging up on the "defendant" user.

<p><i>Do you believe that regardless of Jimbo Wales' own views on the matter, the community should be able to strip arbitrators of their position under certain circumstances, and if so, what circumstances?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I do believe that certain members of the ArbCom should be stripped of their status when they have been found to have passed an unfair judgement. This, in my opinion, should be decided through a <a href="../../../o/m/b/Wikipedia%7EOmbudsman_d4d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Ombudsman">Wikipedia:Ombudsman</a>. This should be done through community consensus, similar to an RfC, but the standards of the review should be must higher and should involve Jimbo Wales. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 23:59, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>As a corollory:Do you believe, regardless of Jimbo Wales' view on the matter, that a large number of signatories (e.g. 150 requesting censure against 50 supporting the arbitrator) to an RFC against an arbitrator is enough that the arbitrator should be judged as having been rejected by the community in light of their actions, and consequently for them to be forcibly stripped of their post?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. I think even 150 may be too much to ask (maybe 100:50 instead of 150:50). Basically, I think if it comes to an RfC against an arbitrator, and there are people who bring credible facts and proof that that arbitrator has acted inappropriately, and they are in the majority, the arbitrator should be stripped of his or her function. I firmly believe in ArbCom transparency, neutrality and accountability, and any form of trying to protect the ArbCom in light of genuine injustices they passed is a gross miscarriage of justice, in my opinion. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 23:59, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Very much so. I don't want to sound like I'm approving everything here just for the sake of it - for me, a conflict of interest is a big mistake in any justice system, including the ArbCom. For this reason, I strongly believe in the recusal guidelines and I will abide by them. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 00:11, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If so, please describe in detail how you would improve them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Code of Conduct has three core elements that I really appreciate: recusal, adequate explanation of decisions ("accountability") and recourses. The section on recourses, however, is very brief and vague in my opinion. I have heard of numerous cases where people have been unhappy with ArbCom decisions, and I think these people should be helped and given a set of clearer steps and processes that they can undertake if they feel they have been mistreated by the ArbCom. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 00:11, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. Will you please pledge to support expanding the number of seats on the Arbitration Committee? If not, how would you propose alleviating the present arbitration backlog?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I think expanding the number of seats is not only important for efficiency but for fairness. The more arbitrators there are, the more views there will be on an issue, and the greater the chances for a case being evaluated fairly. I support expanding the number of seats to 15. I think if there are more than that, the ArbCom does become a bit too large. I was initially thinking of 11 arbitrators, so this may be a good interim step. One idea I fully support (and I congratulate who came up with it) is the Proposal 4 at <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Proposed_modifications_to_rules_f612.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006/Proposed modifications to rules">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006/Proposed modifications to rules</a>, which proposes that a group of 24 arbitrators be formed, of which only 9 deal with any given case. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 00:14, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Proposal 1 (allowing only admins to candidate in elections): <b>Weak oppose</b> - I feel this blocks out users who may not want to be admins for various legitimate reasons but are still valuable to the project and may make great arbitrators</dd>
<dd>Proposal 3 (block voting): <b>Support</b> - more rrequent elections is a good thing, since quite a lot of vacancies seem to occur in the ArbCom</dd>
<dd>Proposal 4 (expansion of ArbCom to 24 seats): <b>Very strong support</b> - this is an idea I like very much, as per question 3 above.</dd>
<dd>Proposal 5 (runoff): <b>Weak support</b> - seems like a good idea that would enable greater opportunity for review of candidates by the electorate</dd>

<li>What's your opinion on desysopping as an ArbCom penalty?</li>

<dd>Well, it depends on how it's applied. I think it's a reasonable penalty if the case is centred on admin abuse.

<dd>I think admins should never use powers that go beyond policy, but that it's OK to use common sense if an admin feels that policy is too harsh. So, an admin should follow policy very closely and make sure that the powers they use don't abuse policy.

There are circumstances where knowing too much about one's neighbours politicises how one deals with them. This is, to an extent, unavoidable in society, but wearing signs of hate as badges on our shoulders takes what is a small problem that we can usually deal with into the realm of being damaging to the community. Already, there have been signs of people refusing to help each other because they are on different ends of a political spectrum -- this seems likely to get worse if this trend continues. Some people cry that this is an attack on their first amendment rights (if they're American, anyhow), but that doesn't apply here because Wikipedia is not the U.S. government -- it is a community that has always self-regulated, and more importantly it is an encyclopedia with a goal of producing encyclopedic content. We have a tradition of respecting a certain amount of autonomy on userpages, but never absolute autonomy. We might imagine, for example, templates with little swastikas saying "this user hates jews". I am not saying that such a thing would be morally equivalent to this template against scientology, but rather that we should aim to minimise that aspect of ourselves, at least on Wikipedia, so we can make a better encyclopedia. The spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean that we cannot have strong views and still be wikipedians, but rather that we should not wear signs of our views like badges, strive not to have our views be immediately obvious in what we edit and how we argue, and fully express ourselves in other places (Myspace? Personal webpage?) where it is more appropriate and less divisive.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=34797833&amp;oldid=34788153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>I am inviting all candidates, including Improv, to expand on this theme on their questions pages. Do you agree that this is a cause for concern as we move into 2006? How do you see the role of the arbitration committee in interpreting the interpretation of Wikipedia policy in the light of this concern? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:57, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
